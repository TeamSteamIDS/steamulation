								Okay so everyone is asking for an update on my review so I just kind of threw the old one out! The game is now at a point where you have darn near everything you could want. Great graphics, excellent gameplay, it's what you had on your phone or wherever you played it. The graphics are a tad different and the future promises are quite nice!No real problems to speak of in my opinion now, the game used to have quite a few but now it's totally worth buying.			"

								This game is an educational tool like no other.On the surface you will gain insights into how various types of plagues are spread and adapt to new surroundings and the methods that educated scientists use to slow that spread and eradicate them.However, on a deeper and much more disturbing level you will realise how satisfied you are sneaking into a country undetected and mutating into a killer virus that wipes out the entire population in just a few days. You will pull your hair out with frustration as 3% of the world survives your onslaught because you were not quick enough to shut down vital organs. And finally you will learn that Greenland is magical place filled with people that always wash their hands, import nothing and travel nowhere.			"

												Plague Inc is a rather satisfying simulation in which the player's goal is to infect and kill off the entire world. Just exactly how the player chooses to tackle this is up to them.GameplayThe player can choose to slowly infect the population, remaining undetected and non-lethal, and then strike once much of the world's population is infected by evolving lethality to kill fast and unexpectedly, making it difficult for the world to react and cure it in time or just try to kill the world as fast as possible which usually results in losing the game as many of the more isolated countries such as Greenland will shut their ports and airports making it very difficult to infect them.ContentThe player is not presented with just one disease type, but many. These disease types range from a neurax worm which allows the player to manipulate infected hosts to their advantage to the necroa virus which allows the player to unleash a devastating zombie apocalypse on the world. It doesn't stop here though as there is a rather extensive community workshop with countless unique diseases thanks to the scenario creator which is available to every player who owns the game.More comingThe developers of this game are also working on a multiplayer mode which will see two players battle it out to see who's plague is superior. The game is also regularly updated with new content and bug fixes.ConclusionWhile Plague Inc is not perfect, it offers great replayability with different ways to beat different scenarios and higher difficulty modes which can really challenge the player. The price is rather steep so I would suggest waiting until the game is on sale to get the best value for money. 8/10 - Great game.			"

												Monday: Day 1At 0600 Hours Patient Zero contracts an unknown contagion. At 0720 Hours, a public hospital located Shanghai, China, is quarantined and an hour later, health authorities immediately issue a travel warning regarding travel in China's most populated city. Tuesday: Day 2At 0330 Hours, what appears to be a highly virulent strain of tropical rabies begins appearing throughout Shanghai and neighboring cities. Symptoms include a serve headache, coughing, excess saliva and mucus forming at the mouth and nose. Sensitivity to noise and movement is also heightened, mild aggression is also being reported. Within the hour, police respond to over 18,600 calls, all of which describe paramedic casualties resulting from the hostile sick. At 0520 Hours, another health emergency is issued and all flights in and out of the Shanghai, and her neighbor cities has been suspended until further notice. The number of infected tops a million and a half hours later: the number of deceased has yet to be confirmed, even the media doesn't know.At 0945 Hours, the Chinese Government requests assistance from the CDC, a leading health institution of the USA. The Chinese Government informs the North American institution that all cases reported outside the ""Epicenter for the Outbreak"" have been quarantined, and that all of whom who may have come into contact with an infected person are under a mandatory isolation. Furthermore, all emergency procedures implemented into preventing the spread of disease, have been activated with a 24/7 curfew placed in Shanghai. The CDC team begin their analysis of the infected persons under isolation. By this stage, the mystery contagion has caused a mild necrotic breakdown of its host’s tissue, extreme hemorrhaging and a serve migraine bordering extreme aggresion. The streets of Shanghai remain calm for now, the police stationed at checkpoints throughout the city keeping a cautionary eye out...nothing like this stays calm for long...Of the 24.1 million, a micro-handful of individuals who are asymptomatic (Unable to show symptoms) were on thirteen different travel routes before the Flight Cancellation Procedure was activated. Twenty four individuals, that's all that's required to bring modern civilization to its knees and palms...Day 3 sees the ""Previously contained outbreak"" spiral out of control as protesters march the streets. Quickly, China's biggest ever riot quickly forms and within hours, Molotov’s are being hurled, riot police beat their shields with their batons as they represent supperiority, all the while the contagion is being actively transmitted from person to person, the infected becoming cannibalistic in nature. The national press gets whiff in the Chinese media storm of the CDC team being evacuated after a serious altercation with the patients they were tending too.Similarly cases of the same uncategorized, contagion begins appearing in Jakarta, Indonesia's capitol city. Yet, there's remote cases appearing in Sydney of Australia, Rome & Paris of Europe, Los Angeles, and Brasília, of the America's. Soon, within the matter of a single week, these cases lead to dozens cannibalistic massacres & the lockdowns of public hubs, from hospitals to hotels, the number of calls the police receive regarding ""Zombie attacks"" rapidly increases by the hour. Weeks 1 & 2 saw a major involvement of Law Enforcements globally. From out of control rioting in L.A, to an Australia S.E.R.T team entering a quarantined hospital in Brisbane, for once the Government of each affected nation didn't see a positive resolution to the situation at hand, for once, they were genuinely scared because nothing they were issuing was working. Week 3 beginning sees 57 different Armed Forces being mobilized across the globe, the soldiers in their armored trucks and light assault vehicles taking to the streets as Martial Law is mentioned persistently in the international media. In nations such as the USA, the National Guard of each state is given detain on sight orders by the President himself, as companies of Guardsmen patrol each and every major city from the West to the East Coast. Rioting ignites everywhere where it wasn't before. Looting and arson is sporadic, but is seldom mentioned in the media as they frenzy over the prospect of genuine zombies. More and more, people in each suffering nation, are disappearing by the hundreds. Murders and cannibalism are common mentioning’s across the international media spectrum. Mid-way through Week 3, two thermal nuclear explosions occur in Beijing and Shanghai of China. Everyone had forgotten about the Chinese because they've been caught up in their own homegrown outbreaks. 37 million people in China die alone in the two separate detonations. The Chinese were hopping, preying, that the nukes would work and wipe out the two most heavily infested cities in the world, but the attempt is a failure and the infected run rampant. Big military nations like Russia and the USA, view through orbital imagery the shouldering remains of two desolate radioactive cities, the skyscrapers in them reaching up to the heavens as they smoke, their blackened husks on the verge of toppling down.Week 4 and Russia closes it borders indefinitely. With few cases reported so far in Putin's country, besides the massacre's in Moscow and St.Petersburg, the Russian's believe they're safe and will hold out while the rest of the world goes to hell around them. All of Europe does the same, each nation closing their borders to refugees fleeing the ruins of their home countries cities. Safe Havens that were constructed in an effort to protect the healthy and prevent the infected from getting in, whilst under the guard of an entire military battalion, begin collapsing as millions of infected breach the ""Safe"" Havens walls, those inside, for the majority swell to meet the ranks of their new brethren, while the remaining minority simply become food for a persisting, unsatisfied hunger.China goes dark on Day 28 of the Pandemic. Quick followers include all Asian countries on the mainland. Then the Indian Sub-continent. Most of Eastern Europe goes black as if someone turned the power off. Scatters of Western European nations fall as silent as the grave. Turkey, Greece and all of North Africa ceases to communicate. The last communication from Australia before its silence was that the ""Power Players"" in charge were making a retreat to Tasmania. New Zealand goes quiet hours later. Quickly, the rest of the world falls asleep into a never wakening coma. From Space, the planet that use to appear vibrant with light and modern civilization, is dark and dead. The last few nations to shutdown global communications included Russia, certain areas of the USA close to the Rockies, Canada, Norway and Poland. Then the world was truly dark. No city lights ever coming back on. The undead crowd in the streets like resident locus, swarming here and there in the millions.This is what I visualised as I manipulated the Necroa Virus and brought havoc & destruction to human kind XD. I've watched a lot of Zombie movies/tv series and read more than your average amount of apocalyptic zombie or doomsday disease novels, so my imagination whilst in-game may get a little to much into overrdrive. Just watching your disease spread from one nation to the unfortunate next, witnessing from a god-like prespective multiple countries attempting to restrict your diease's transmisson, from attempting to create a cure to shutting down airports, sea ports and forbidding forigen travel because the risk to their society is to high, and failing! Wow, its an awsome feeling. Be Manipulative. Be Smart. Be Superior. RATING: 10/10 Best Apocalyptic Simulator100% RECOMMENDED. 100% GARANTEED TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE GOD. 100% GARANTEED TO MAKE YOU BE THANKFUL THAT ZOMBIES OR VAMPRIES OR WHATEVER GHOULISH MONSTROSITY COMES NEXT, ISN'T REAL!If there's any form of typo, I apologize.

The amount of work put into this game is incredible, and it's a huge step up from similar games like Pandemic I and II. Totally worth the price! If you like strategy, contagion narratives, and killing off the entire human race, this is the game for you!			"

								So far i realy like this game, the more you win and unlock features the more you want to try things differently. I lost first time played not realising i had to kill everyone, it was a long struggle with bacteria  but got the job done, next up using a virus, i had a read of everything carefully used it as best i could, man did it spread fast, i had it mutating quickly, so quick in fact i started to feel bad for the world i had started to destroy. It is in alpha and seems expensive but for a game with the depth it has, such as checking the stats and whats going on in each country, looking at the camera feeds too, it's worth the money, all the bits that will be added will make this a game everyone should have like the multiplayer feature[yet to be turned on] paying 12 euro for a game i know i can keep coming back too is better than paying 30-40+ for something i wouldn't play again.hopefully he'll add a demo for players to try, i know he'll get sales if he does this, you won't regret getting this, feel free to add me here on steam so later we can destroy the world together :D			"

								If you enjoyed the flash game Pandemic you'll love this! If you're not familiar with the game, you basically choose a disease and plot to infect humanity with various transmissions and abilities. Some of the new disease types like the Necroa virus (where you create and control zombies) and the apes from planet of the apes are actually done really well.

								Who wouldn´t want to eradicate humanity from time to time?If you say ""Yes, here! Me!"" then you should probably get some help.. or this game.. maybe both. Either way, Plague Inc: Evolved is a simple game, where you can evolve your virus/bacteria etc. from a harmless flu to a pandemic mass killer. While the base game is very easy but fun, Plague Inc. has so many different scenarios, as well as different Plagues from mind controlling worms, zombies, intelligent apes and so on, that you can destroy humanity again and again and have different playthroughs. Beside the bigger changes the ways you customize your sickness offers great replayability.Last but not least the workshop provides hundred fan made plagues for your pleasure and humanitys demise. Furthermore a multiplayer mode is in the making and the developer is very actively improving the game time and time again.Conclusio: Even if you know the game from it´s mobile beginnings the PC version is worth it´s money, with a broad array of possibilities and challenges to casually destroy humanity in a relaxing evening session.

								Plague Inc.: Evolved; let me first start out by saying, this is exactly how the Early Access model should be done. This game is an absolute treat to play.The main idea behind the game, if you don't already know (I’d be surprised if you didn't to be honest), is to develop, mutated and transmit your very own disease. You can choose which symptoms you would like your diseases to have, how you would like it to be transmitted around the world and many other different options. There are a number of different kinds of diseases you can choose, my favourite has to be the zombie plague; each of the different modes offers different symptoms, abilities and ways to transmit your creation as well. The graphics are essentially a 2D world map; you don't need anything else for this game, the UI and HUD are very nicely put together and you can get all of the information you require within a key press. Each of the different modes have been carefully crafted so that no game ever feels the same; this game really makes you think, would this symptom thrive in these conditions? How can I get my plague to travel to the other side of the world when all of the airports are closed? The possibilities are endless. The game can also vary in difficulty; each different mode has 4 stages of difficulty; and boy oh boy does it get hard in the brutal stages. You are best of cracking out a guide if you want to tackle some of the harder stages.I have played about ten hours so far; this has enabled me to complete all the different types of diseases and modes on offer, done a couple on Brutal difficulty and worked on a few achievements. There are still roughly 100 more achievements to collect along with the scenario modes to play; and given that they game is still in early access, I fully expect there to be more content added soon too. I can 100% guarantee that anyone will enjoy this game; it’s a perfect pick up and play game but you can also get mind numbingly deep into the inner workings of diseases and plagues without having to do six years in medical school.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

								As i am writing this, the game is still in early access. There are still missing features, most notably the Necroa Virus type, Tutorials & Scenarios. But allready the game is highly playable and damn addicting. You are a plague, you infect people and evolve and the aim is to infect and kill everyone on earth in the end. There is strategy involved in picking the right mutations for your plague, keeping a low profile, not killing too many before you are discovered and later killing them fast enough before they can develop a cure for you.There are several different plague types, Bacteria, Virus, Prion and more. They require different ways to evolve them to be sucessfull. The Neurax Worm which was added with the last patch was the most fun for me. The hunting for achievements was fun as well, altough alot of them arent implemented yet.The game originally was made for mobiles and is now ported to the PC. It feels pretty good and polished for a port.If i had one negative thing to say about the game then its about the bubble clicking, which gets tiresome and annoying after a while. Also it feels a bit too pricey, ~10 Euros would have been a much fairer pricepoint in my opinion.You can get a mobid kind of satisfaction out of beeing sucessfull in this game, knowing that you just wiped out a whole planet. I just couldnt resist getting it, and overall i am sure i got my moneys worth out of it.As long as you dont expect deep strategy you will have a good time with this game. Its a nice timewaster with suprising complexity below its shell.			"

												This is a decent game with quite a bit of content as far as game mechanics goes.  There's plenty of upgrades and different pathogens to choose from.  The issue comes from one giant flaw in my opinion; there's only one strategy that really works.  The game is basically a race between your pathogen's ability to wipe out the humans, and their ability to cure it.  As soon as they notice the symptoms of your disease, they will begin to work on finding a cure.  This can happen very early on and the more people you infect/kill, the harder and more fervently the humans will work to cure it.  There are in-game ""upgrades"" you can purchase with your points to slow the humans, but they are laughably under-powered; reducing their progress bar by a measely 5-10% and costing you dearly in points. This might sound like a challenging mechanic to be conquered in an epic battle of wits, but it's not.  The gameplay is very limited as far as thwarting the humans or slowing them down, only offering a few one-time-use options for reducing their progress bar.  This is in leiu of the fact that should even one of the numerous island nations close their borders before they are infected, you just lost the entire game. This happens VERY often.  Unless, as I mentioned above, you use the strategy below.The ONLY strategy I have found that really works is keeping your disease hidden from the humans by keeping it from presenting with any symptoms until 95%-100% of the population is infected.  You then use all of your banked points and flood them into symptoms until your disease is incredibly lethal, and then sit back and watch.  If this sounds boring, that's because it is.  You are literally just sitting there looking at a screen for 10 minutes clicking around a few times.  Pretty dissappointing for a game with so much potential.  I really gave this one the old college try, but it retains its entertainment value for far less time than I spent playing it.  $15 is better spent elsewhere.			"

								The fact that I like this game shouldn't detract from the fact that I can't recommend it.This is a game meant to be played on a phone, and it shows.  It is very one-dimensional and once you've figured it out (should take about 15 minutes at most) that's it.  Sure there are levels and things to unlock, but the bottom line is that it should only be purchased on sale.  I paid full price and I regret it.The rundown:-Fun, but the same way a single level of mario is.  You can do it a few different ways and win.  You can unlock things and play it again (in the same way) and win.  Satisfying the first three times and not much more.-Educating, but not in a good or useful way.  It gives legitimate details about pathogens but nothing else.  Like reading the cliffnotes of ""all about disease""-Entertaining in exactly the same way smallpox was, take that as you will.-Replayability is hugely limited due to the limited nature of the game.I'll admit to enjoying it the first two times through the rest of it wasn't so enjoyable.  I know I only show a few hours of the game but that's all it takes.  There's a basic strategy that takes you though twenty minutes of playtime and that's it.  Buy it on sale and enjoy it but NEVER pay full price or you'll be left with the knowledge that you did nothing but pay for an undergrad to fail his midterms.			"

Plague, Inc. is a smooth playing simulation and real-time strategy game. It is highly intriguing and elicits quite a few time-sensitive questions on a relevant topic today... for everyone. Whether you are concerned about Contagion, Plagues, last-days scenarios, or bio-terrorism; Plague, Inc. is there. It doesn't take too many play-throughs to realize that not all diseases are created equal. But, the game does draw you to multiple play-throughs, as you spin out each scenario, captivated by the results of minor changes in your strategy. The game starts with a basic menu of disease types in the main-game portion: Bacteria, Virus, Fungus, Parasite, Prion, Nano-Virus, Neurax Worm, Bio-Weapon, and finally Necroa (Zombies) and the Simian Flu for those who want to turn Earth into the Planet of the Apes.The game is overflowing with feature-rich side scenarios; from real diseases past and present like The Black Death and Smallpox, to the fantasy diseases like Pirate Plague and spreading Christmas Joy, and myriads of others. And, if that weren't enough to keep you busy with the 142 achievements, they have included a workshop, so you can download community made scenarios and/or create and share your own.High Strategy:The premise is simple enough. You create a new disease and your goal is to watch it spread around the world. Naturally, since it is a game, you can't win by simply covering continents. You must wipe out humanity for a victory. You are able to name your disease, and choose the genetic traits, as well as the symptoms and the transmission traits for spreading the disease, whether it is something that spreads from insects, birds, by air, or sea... etc. Then, as humanity fights for a cure, you try to stop the cure before you've covered the planet. Die-Hard Fan:I originally reviewed the game in early access. The game has gone through many updates, and since then I was able to participate in the alpha and beta testing phases for multiplayer, which was added to the game along with the full release. So, I've updated this review to reflect all changes.The game has given me more than 150 hours of fun in early release, and now with over 300 hours in-game, I am still exploring all the fun and challenging levels. When I first started exploring this fascinating game, I found I was able to beat the Virus and Bacteria easily; finishing off both in one play-through each. But, I found the Fungus Disease and the Black Death scenario both to be very difficult to spread before they were cured by Scientists. But, they all are accomplished with time. The game definitely contributes to obsessive personality traits, like repeated hand-washing, and 12 hour gaming sessions.I managed to turn the Earth into a 'Planet of the Apes' with my own Simian Flu on the 2nd try. The first time, I had tried to develop the rampage gene. It didn't spread far before the humans managed to develop a cure. Too aggressive! So, I slowed it down a bit, and worked on the Simian side of the coin; developing colonies of apes, and making it spread among them, while increasing their intelligence. When the Earth was covered, I added deadly symptoms to finish it off with one quarter of the ape population surviving the human drone attacks, which were colossal-scale. Narrative: The game is imaginative and rich in story, not-surprisingly since plague is the story of civilization. The main game plays out on a world map. If you watch the news bits, and little popups, you see that some countries begin to execute and/or bomb whole cities of the infected, out of hysteria and fear. The disease spreads in real-time, as you are making changes in the control panel to try to counter-balance the reactions of the humans to your disease. But, there are speed and pause buttons for those who want to control the action. Also, in the single-player, opening up map and disease screens automatically pauses the game so you can get back to bursting dna bubbles when you are finished making changes. I've already decided that Greenland is the place to go in the case of world contageon. They are so isolated that many games are lost simply because Greenland closes their ports to prevent the plague spreading. Graphics & Sound:The graphics are first-rate; utilizing a variety of color and fx cues to help you monitor the situation as it develops. The different countries are covered with the color of your disease, and then turn to black as the humans there all die. The control windows are amply stocked with a variety of graphs and charts to analyze your disease's progress, and at game's end, to analyze why you won or lost. The music is intense and dramatic. Different sound bits include children singling ""Ring Aaround the Roses"" which was a children's song from the Middle ages about the Bubonic Plague. Multiplayer:You can choose games with friends, random matches, co-op or versus mode. Leader boards let you know how your opponent ranks. The multiplayer community is already spreading and many more are dying for a chance to win the co-op brutal achievement. These achievements, though easy to obtain if you have a good working partnership, would probably be more difficult if you don't chat or talk to the other player to coordinate. You can't play ""by the seat of your pants"" here. It takes team-work.Pros: *High Strategy and realistic simulation gaming at it's finest*Multiplayer Vs. & Co-op*Extreme Replay Factor *High level of control-The element of choice makes you feel like a Superman in game. When you make small changes, big things happen. *Friendship forming- You will develop close partnerships in the multiplayer co-op, because you won't win otherwise.Cons:*You will not finish this game in under 100 hours. My testing buddy 100% it in under 200 hours, even with all the beta testing hours. I'm not finished yet. *Though guides are certainly helpful, having a list of steps won't guarantee success because your timing and decisions effect results. Verdict: Plague Inc is an awesome game that makes the scientific/academic investigation humorous.  You get to enjoy what would seem on the one hand an evil and diabolic plot to exterminate the world, and on the other a biology experiment. I highly recommend this game for everyone above age 12. I rate this RTS game a 10 out of 10.			"

								So, a game where you spread a disease to end all human life... what's not to love! So many plagues and gene types to unlock and use. So many possibilities. When I first played this game, I instantly fell in love with it. There are many positive points about these games.+ Replay valueA lot of replay value. I could be playing this for years and would not get bored of it. Especially with the Steam Workshop Integration. Tons of custom scenarios created by people all over the world. Endless fun.+ Educational valueNow, the part no one's been waiting for. This game does give some educational value. People get to learn different types of plagues and symptoms. Very educational. Okay, done with this part. Whew.+ Scenario CreatorWhy go with the normal boring symptoms, transmissions and abilities when you can completely change them to whatever your heart desires. The scenario creator provides players a chance to carve the world to their own liking. Renaming countries, setting your own government actions, creating non-existent diseases and more. Plague Inc can't get any better than this.I would add in some negative points, but I couldn't find any. Oh well :)Plague Inc is a very addictive, innovative and smart game. Even in Early Access is this game a big success. A few bugs here and there, but it's still developing. I can tell that this game is going to skyrocket once it is fully developed. Can't wait for multiplayer! Plague Inc is here to stay!			"

								Now that the multiplayer update is out, I figured I would go ahead and make a review of the game, now that it's mostly completed. The short answer: If you like strategy games, or are fascinated by the idea of creating your own pathogen to destroy humanity, buy this game, especially during a sale.The details:The base game is a genetic strategy game where your goal is to infect the world and destory it before they can do the same to you. It offers plenty of options for doing so, and the game is simple enough in the lower difficulties for newcomers to get a basic idea of what to do, but in harder difficulties, it is challenging enough for even veteran players to have a difficult challenge. The game has many different plague types and modes to try, including user created plagues.The multiplayer mode is also fun, sporting many strategies that counter other strategies, with quite a bit of depth. Would advise AGAINST newcomers to the game from playing that mode first, as it is much more intense of an experience compared to the main game.  Against friends or randoms, the multiplayer is a great addition to an already great game.I've played this game ever since 2012, whenever the game first started out on mobile devices and there was only 6 plagues and 3 difficulties. This game has kept my attention and still manages to be a fun distraction and experience to come back to time and time again. So, if you seem at all interested, pick it up, it's a strategy game that's worth the price. P.S. This game will make you hate Greenland. You will understand why.			"

								I've played both versions Mobile and PC, and both versions are great however in my opinion the PC version is better. The PC version has features added which the mobile version doesn't have unless you buy them (the different viruses) differences listed below:1. PC version includes the Necroa Virus, Neurax Worm AND the Simian Flu. For the mobile version you need to buy them which costs $8.96 (incuding base mobile game).2. PC version has a new UI.3. PC version gives you a bigger screen, and if you have touch you get a bigger touch screen. (Not a big deal though)4. Custom scenarios, if you are getting bored of the regular plagues the game gives you, you can play scenarios the steam communtity makes, or you can even make your own.5. Mutiplayer feature is going to be added (from the time of writing this review).			"

 ""You see, it starts out as a minor rash, with some excessive sweating. The sweating partially dehydrates a person. Skin lesions form across the arms and legs, opening up the skin, causing infection to set in. The person begins to suffer from coughing fits and eventually contracts pneumonia. As the bacterica works it's way into the brain, insomnia and paranoia set in. The bacteria spreads through the air, permeates the water supply. After a while, it becomes resistant to extreme cold and heat. As the insomnia becomes extreme, the person begins suffering from seizures. Necrosis sets in.

								A plague simulator with an infectious amount of replayablity. The graphics and gameplay are rather simple but the end goal is to dominate the world with those little red circles of infection.  Timing plays a huge role in evolving and deevolving traits depending on the type of infection.  For instance, if your plague is too severe before you attain widespread infection, humans will begin working on a cure before you have time enough to infect everyone.  Conversely, if you are too wide spread through transmission abilities, you might not end up with enough DNA to be lethal enough before a cure is found.  The Planet of the Apes add on is very interesting.  I'm still experimenting with it but unleashing a virus that makes apes more intelligent and combat humans is quite entertaining.  In fact, things got so bad in China once, the US decided to nuke em just to supress the spread of the virus.

								As a huge fan of the Android game it was a no brainer for me to pick this up when it went on sale, certainly not disappointed. In Plague Inc: Evolved your aim is to eradicate humanity using a disease of your creation. A strategy game at its core you will rely on some luck but finding an effective strategy for your disease is the key to success.+Nice looking game+3D view of your disease which reacts to evolution and devolution+A good selection of pathogens to choose from+A good number of modifiers unlocked by winning a match to make the game more interesting+Some truly hilarious jokes, mainly about the gaming industry, including one about Valve and another about CoD+Good level of difficulty on normal, you might not win on your first try+Different enough from the iOS and android version to make it worth a buy but similar enough to be as good if not better+The option to speed up time+Doesn't feel like an early access game, everything you can play feels complete+/-Reasonably frequent updates, better than most but not as frequent as others+/-You only get unlocks on normal or higher difficulty+/-Quite a laid back game, doesn't require much inputSo far I haven't come across any negatives worth notingVerdict:9A great game with a lot of potential, if you aren't ready to give up your money then this is certainly one to watch.El K.

								*ah-heh-hem.*Picture the most violent you can think of...... that is a children's game compared to what I am about to describe to you.Enter Plague Inc. No guns, no magic, you're a disease. You kill with fevers. You will with tumors! You kill with necrosis! You kill with Dysentery! You kill with zombies! You kill with brain worms! You kill with organ failures!You kill the entire world! Billions will die by your microscopic hands. Men and women. Strong and weak. Rich and poor. Honest and deceitful. The last pitiful homosapien will die howling in agony, drowning in their own infected mucus and poisoned blood in some hole in the ground, covered in the twisted, freakish, unrecognizable remainss of what were once it's mate and spawn. You will leave the world empty, correcting the great cosmic error that was once the human race!But don't think this will be easy. Oh no; the things will fight back. They're smart, they're rich, and they take pride in all the diseases they've wiped out in their short pitiful existance. Rich countries will put aside their differences and work together to add you to the tally of ailments they've purged from this planet. But for all their wealth and knowledge, even the scientists and doctors that they hide behind are still susceptable to you!This is Plague Inc. The fun little game of human extinction  or enslavement.  And it's the nastiest out there!			"

								The simple question everyone wants to have answered: Is this game worth buying?The answer is >>> NO <<< .First of all, it's the port of a 0,99€ phone app. Charging 14€ for that seems preeeeetty harsh to me. But hey, maybe it's actually worth the money?The game is an advanced version of the old Flashgame Pandemic II, which was a great game of it's time and I truly enjoyed playing it. Actually, that's the only reason I decided to get Plague Inc anyways. Now, Plague inc is a bit more advanced then Pandemic, no doubt. The mutations system ismore complex, the graphics and algorythms much superb...But it doesn't add much else.Once you figured out the basic route, the game is literallyjust clickclickclick-wait-win. Every single time. The different plague types only change that at a minimal level.Look at my game time. I havejust finished the game, unlocking the cheat plagues (those giving you godmode anti-cure or unlimited evolution points). How? Just by doing the same thing a dozen times over again, with every plague the game offered.And that's it. And they charge 14€ for that.Now, a big point for me was the Multiplayer mode. I could really see potential replayability value there...BUT it's not even remotely implemented yet. So, my resume: Great concept (duh, they imported it from a great and innovative old game). Fun gameplay. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetitive and no further content to keep you playing. In it's current state, 2-3€ sounds like a nice price. If they really go up ahead and add a GOOD multiplayer mode, I'll gladly change my review. But till then, don't buy this.PS: Quick update:They STILL didn't add the promised multiplayer, but instead keep throwing in 'more different plagues' that play usually exactly like any of the others, adding nothing new to the game.PSPS: 6 months later, they ACTUALLY added a multiplayer. Albeit I feel trolled by the fact it's not the 'human vs virus' multiplayer I was actually hoping for.			"

								Plague Inc Evolved allows you to release a virus somewhere on to the earth and spread it to other countries. The virus can do this by itself, with enough time (you will absolutely fail in the end), but you can also evolve it by upgrading several of the many upgrades. For example, you can let birds or other animals and rodents carry the virus to other places and countries, or you can make it less vulnerable to humid environments. The goal is to infect and kill every person on the earth, by all means necessary. And all of this is done in a very realistic way, and it's a blast to play, let me tell you.One thing that should absolutely be fixed, though, is the fact that pop-ups (mostly for tutorials) pop up in EVERY SINGLE game you play. It's very annoying and there's no way to disable this (yet). If you can ignore that little part of the game you will absolutely have fun with it. Recommended ![Rating: 85/100]			"

								If you have ever played the flash game ""Pandemic"" or ""Pandemic 2"" and enjoyed it, this game is for you. While it contains and makes use of many features and standout areas the flash games utilise, it offers a much more in depth gaming experience. With many different scenarios to try along with the ability to choose to play both your own custom scenario and those others have created, you'll be playing for a long time. Not only this, but to enhance you overall experience, the challenge of unlocking each scenario and different genes and ""cheats"" (for the lack of a better word) means that it isn't a pushover game that can be completed in mere hours and actually requires a certain amount of strategy, calculated moves and thought.I'm not one for strategy games usually, however this one has peaked my interest and I strongly suggest people buy it.

												For such a simple game, Plague Inc: Evolved challenges you from the get go. Putting yourself in the shoes of a ""disease"" you must learn to survive in the world, by evolving until you become a plague. Only until every single human is infected and dead, you win the game. That is a real balancing act as well. Kill too quickly and you do not infect everyone, kill too slowly and you will be cured. Plus every country around the globe is shutting down air and shipping ports and working fast on a cure! A real challenge indeed!Plague Inc:Evolved  also comes with Co-Op and Multi-Player, so you can verse your friends and anyone else out there in this highly competitive landscape. Just a warning, the Multi-player, was just an added extra and unfortunately is not very active with people. I had a few games and got beaten real easy, but certainly helped me improve my speed in singleplayer. It does have Steam Workshop enabled so you can create your own scenarios and play other peoples creations.In the end, this game is 90% Singleplayer and a great game to chill out and watch millions of red dots appear on the screen! I really enjoyed the experience, except for a few achievements that had me going slightly insane! But beyond that if you are not an achievement hunter and just want to experience the fun of this interesting game, then I highly recommend it. It is a morbid take on a strategy game, that certainly puts our real lives in perspective, knowing that a plague could happen at any time in this world.I give it 4 out of 5 Beers!Cheers,Frost			"

								Plague Inc: Evolved is the PC version of the game Plague Inc, which was released for the tablet/smartphone in 2012. Updated frequently, Plague Inc: Evolved is a Strategy and Simulation game where you control a plague in an effort to wipe out mankind. You can evolve, and devolve one of several, plagues, viruses, and worms, in your quest to destroy the world. There are multiple game modes which have their own strengths and weaknesses and require different strategies to win. Converting the world into Zombies with the Necroa Virus, or Enslaving the human race with the Neurax Worm are just Two examples of the variety Plague Inc: Evolved offers.Recently Plague Inc: Evolved released a 1v1 multiplayer mode, where you can play against others. This mode offers different options than the single player modes and can be a lot of fun. There are so many different ways you can go about playing this game, it can become quite addictive. I would recommend if you enjoyed the App version to get this game for the PC as you will not be disappointed. If you are new to the game, and enjoy killing or enslaving billions of people, this game would be right up your alley. Plague Inc: Evolved is a value buy!			"

												Plague Inc Evolved is a strategy game about creating and evolving a disease that will infect and ultimately destroy the whole world. Upon discovering your disease, scientists of the world will attempt to cure it.Breakdown:Great things:-This is the biggest pro in my opinion: there is something for everyone here. It is a great casual experience for people who aren't big strategy gamers. My friend who claims to dislike ""map games"" loves this game. Hardcore strategy gamers and fans of the genre will also find fun here. I, for example, play tons of 4X and grand strategy games, and I love this one as well. The harder difficulties and scenarios (custom and official) can provide great challenges and interesting strategical situations.-Fantastic difficulty curve. The game is very easy to learn, and provides a fun challenge to master it at the hardest difficulties. The jump from Brutal to Mega Brutal is pretty big, but that gap can be filled by harder plagues or scenarios. The game never has to feel too easy or too difficult.Good things:-Good variety with the main plagues, official scenarios and custom scenarios. I will say that the ""normal"" plagues (bacteria, fungus, parasite, and prion) all feel very similar to each other, but even with that in mind, there is still a good amount of variety in the main game. Some of the official scenarios are very interesting, and can provide a large or small shake-up to your normal strategy. However, I will say a large portion of the scenarios don't feel all that different from the main game or each other, which is why I put this under ""good things"" instead of ""great things."" But there are so many scenarios, you will definitely find something interesting.-Custom scenarios are great. The game allows community members to create their own scenarios and customize the world, events, and the plague itself to create a unique experience. When you start to get a bit bored of the normal stuff, there are basically ENDLESS custom scenarios to play. True, not ALL custom scenarios are good, but custom scenarios are produced so often, that is is viable to only have to play really good ones. And the editor is very intuitive and explains everything very well, so it easy and quite to fun to create your own custom scenario. I rank this as ""good"" instead of ""great"" because the editor doesn't provide THAT much variety, and (last time I checked) TRULY unique plagues like the Necroa virus and the Neurax worm, cannot be created in the editor. Granted, they would be difficult to create, but many communities have dedicated creators who put time and effort into creating cool content for the game, and I have no reason to believe this one is any different. Anyway, you may feel that none or few of the custom scenarios feel meaningfully different from anything else.-Clean and intuitive UI. You will never be befuddled by this game's UI. It is not over-complicated, while still providing all the information you might ever want. As well, it looks very nice, and has some nice aesthetic but not distracting touches, such as a cool picture of your pathogen, and what an infected body might look like.-Concept: It is a very cool and interesting concept to manufacture a plague to infect and kill the whole world. The only other game I know of that has a similar concept is Pandemic, but Plague Inc has much more depth I would say.-Sound effects are pretty cool and fit the theme of the game rather well. There are enough to feel satisfying, but not so many that you get annoyed.Okay things:-Main graphics on the map are pretty good, if simple. You can zoom in quite far and see some detail. However, you would never want to do this, as there is never a reason to not look at the whole map, as you might miss something, so you might get a little tired of looking at the same thing all the time (besides the UI screens), although admittedly it is satifying to see everything slowly turn red!-Music is a bit lacking, but not bad. The main ""music"" creates the feel the game is going for, and is mostly ambient noises. I'm not sure if actual music would fit this game well, but nevertheless, I cannot rate the sound here as ""good."" It is a short loop, and there is not much to it, but since it is just ambient, it won't annoy you, I wouldn't recommend muting it.-Multiplayer is pretty meh. There are two multiplayer modes: Co-op and competitive, which I really like. They are pretty different, so I will start with Co-op.      -Co-op mode involves two players controlling separate plagues on the same map, and they can work on separate regions, or the same, and they can buff each other. However, multiplayer seems to function very differently than singleplayer with changed mechanics, and yet the game doesn't seem to tell you this, so we floundered a lot in this mode, despite both being very good at the singleplayer modes. Even when we won, most of the time, one of the plagues got eliminated early on and the other one did all the work. Also, pop-ups don't seem to appear as much in multiplayer, so I had my plague 50% cured without even noticing that the cure started.      -Competitive is fine, but it feels like a race, like we might as well just play singleplayer and see who wins first. Interactions are limited to several evolutions that can ""sabotage"" the other player. Some of these are very major and can change the whole game, but usually the other player will just do the same to you, as they are pretty much forced to, so it still feels like a race, just under different conditions. Also, the victory conditions are changed a bit: you don't have to kill everyone, just infect everyone, which is a big negative for me, as it feels like half the game is just missing. You can also win if the other plague is eliminated. As mentioned, you can sabotage the other player, but this victory condition almost always feels like you won because the other player messed up, and not because you did well, so can be a bit unsatisfying. I have mostly mentioned negative things, but that's not to say that multiplayer isn't fun. It is still Plague Inc, and all the previously mentioned positives still apply, it just isn't quite as fun as the singleplayer mode for me. However, big disclaimer: I don't have many friends who play this game, so I haven't actually played that many multiplayer games, so my opinion on them might improve as I come to understand them a bit better.Bad Things:-This game's only real con is that it can get a bit repetitive, but that can be a big con.      -The game lacks any real variety in its events, and doesn't have that many to start with, so there is very little variety created by in-game events, and even the ones that do happen seem to barely affect anything in the game.     -For many of the plagues, the EXACT same strategy can be used, and it can feel very repetitive. However, this isn't a huge con, as many of the more unique plagues and scenarios can change it up quite a bit, but it will still feel prevalent as you try out different things.-This is sort of a subset of the repetitiveness, but it is the biggest issue for me: Most of the symptoms feel the same. There are many symptoms in the game, but for most plagues, they consist of: Increases infection rate, increase death rate, or slow down cure research. Different tiers of symptoms will do this at different levels, but still feel the same. It can be fun to think about how people are affected by the actual symptoms you are adding, but from an actual gameplay perspective, many feel exactly the same.OVERALL RATING: 8/10 - Worth buying at full price. The pros heavily outweigh the cons, and you will definitely get some fun from this game.This review went way longer than I intended, but hopefully it was helpful to you!			"

												You know... this is a really fun game. Though the enjoyment you take may be a bit... questionable, I think?I mean, you eradicate humanity with a disease. Trying to imagine how people would suffer from your creation would make you sick. Thankfully, all you see is world map and few other windows.The difficulty the game provides is very flexible. Either go for a smooth killing spree or struggle with cure progress.This game also features A LOT of upgrades for each disease (there are quite many of them which you can unlock).Come to think about it, it's a strategy game. You start somewhere and expand until you take over the world. Or in that case, kill everyone (though it's not always necessary).There is also a multiplayer mode. Both versus and co-op are fun to play and can give you quite a challenge.I'm not really sure what else I should write about this game. Maybe workshop support? Millions of custom scenarios and an editor to make your own? Yeah, I guess I should mention that either. Oh wait, I just did. Anyway, that's all I can say.If you are into strategy games (or even if you aren't) and don't mind infecting the world, then go ahead and try it.			"

								I got this game on my tablet and it was pretty enjoyable to play. Glad to see they're adding some new things to their PC version. So lemme just recap the good things:- You can name your disease ""Cuddles"" or something ironic like that- You act as the god or scientist on a sattelite, upgrading the abilities, symptoms, and the types of spreading of the disease while watching over the world, making sure your virus spreads by any means necessary- Any player can play this game pretty easily once you get the basics handed down. If you're just a casual gamer like me then just go to casual mode, or if you like a challenge and realism go to Brutal mode to test your knowledge on how a disease outbreak can destroy the earth (in the game of course :P)- The game itself doesn't require a good PC to run, I'm running this on my laptop which has a medicore graphics card and it still runs fine with no issues.- Loads of information on the screen, both based on your disease and world events (news, cure research, activity, etc)- The disease tree allows the player to add a more personal touch to their disease and it doesn't force you to stick to a certain pattern to win, contradictory to what I just said it all depends on your knowledge on how an epidemic starts. For example: a disease that can only be spreaded through water and hot climates will eventually be cured if the traits are kept that way because the world is smart in this game.- Diseases in the game have a pretty ""realistic"" nature. If a disease can be spreaded through kisses and hugs it can do that. Be careful though, humans are realistic too, and will eventually thwart your plants by stopping people from hugging and kissing each other eventually. Plan your diseases carefully and upgrade them to the best of your abilities, or personal taste. Make sure to stop the humans from finding loopholes to your epidemic by finding loopholes in their ways of curing people or at least stopping the spread.- Controls are pretty straight forward, just point the mouse and click. No need for mulitple key bindings if you don't want too, but that's up to personal preference to dictate whether it's good or not to have a game relying on a cursor most of the time.Now lemme recap the bad things:- Trying to attempt this game in real life (by that I mean actually starting a real disease) will get you in big doo doo- If you can't understand what disease is and how it spreads, as well as basic disease terminology, this game may be difficult for you- Blindly picking stuff from the tree is bad, I've been there and had my disease stopped on Casual difficulty (the easiest difficulty in the game). Reading IS required for the game since the symptoms and diagrams provide you with hints on what each symptom and trait your next choice have and how they behave.- Recap: Reading is required. Not too much but you need to at least have a basic understanding of reading and some big words. If you don't like reading, then this game isn't for you.All in all this game is great! I hope they keep developing more things to add to it. Been a fan ever since the app came out for phones and tablets, still a fan for the PC version :D			"

												I purchased on sale for £5.99, though it is well worth the full price £11.99 on the basis you’ll get hours of entertainment out of this over time.  I bought as a casual game I was half interested in, but it turned out to be a huge surprise in just how good this game is. I thought it would be a basic strategy game; and the controls are exceptionally easy (basic) to learn.  But, for a game that looks easy, the underlying strategy is deep.  The idea in the game is to create a virus and spread it around the world, all the while the world governments’ tries to cure their citizens.  It sounds easy and basic, but the complexity comes from knowing where to spend your limited DNA points – do you focus on improving how well the virus spreads between countries, how well it spreads within countries, how strongly it makes people ill, or how fatal the disease is. But you also need to spend DNA points on ensuring cures take longer, and making your disease resistant to the cures. Then, add the complexity, that you need to focus on shutting down countries in order – focus on those that are most quickly developing cure research against you.  Each country could have many unique needs; is the country wealthy, poor, hot, cold, arid, humid, etc.  Each DNA choice affects how well the disease spreads in an individual combination of country. And to make matters worse for you, you have to know how well your disease will spread via boat or airline.  Warning: some islands will simply shut off their ports if they notice the disease is strong. Greenland is particularly isolated, so is Iceland. So if you can’t spread your disease you will lose the game.  You’ll also lose if you kill off people too quickly (doesn’t make sense at first), but you’ll realise you can’t simply spread a horrid disease as there’s a risk people could be killed before transmitting the disease to other people.  A potentially better strategy, you want to spread a mild disease first, and then ratchet up the symptoms so they kill, without leaving it too late that the population can make a cure.  Good luck!  This looks a simple game, but it is a fun, exciting challenge, that is very addictive with one more turn (try/game) feel. The game is real time, but has a pause button and pauses on important news. I thought in the tutorial the game played too quick even on the slowest level, but in my first game I got used to this speed and see why it works. The interface is very nice and adequate for a value game, providing news flashes from around the World, country data, cure progress data, your virus data, and shows planes and ships moving around the World from port to port.Oh, and if you master all this with a standard disease, try the scenarios. Fancy running a group of infected apes against the population? The scenarios add NEW features: Managing ape colonies, building them into a human fighting force and disease spreader. The “Planet Of The Apes” scenario may be for you.  No doubt they’ll be Zombie symptoms to create as I progress the game. There is also variety in starting standard games as there are “loads of bonuses” you can unlock to start games with, so viruses are unique for each game.  And there are over 100 achievements to strive for, from relatively easy to very challenging – hours of fun trying to get them all done.Because this was cheap, is unique, fun, addictive strategy, deep for how simple the game seems on the surface from its UI, it’s a 10/10, for a game you can enjoy over an hour or two each evening. MUST BUY for strategy fans.  You will know (if) you like it after 2 hours, so no risk if buying through steam – just get a refund if you don’t like it. I’m sure you will love it though and see this is a keeper to come back to again and again.   "

												I've owned this game since early access and enjoyed it. However I was a bit disappointed in the lack of multiplayer. I recently checked back in to see the progress in the game development, and they now have a very stable and fleshed out co-op and PVP mode. The developers continue to update the game at a steady pace. Plague Inc: Evolved (And the original mobile version) are good time killers for casual players, but also very in-depth for those who have a passion for strategy games. I haven't played a RTS game quite like it. Highly recommend.			"

								Really excellent game. It's a simple plague simulation game that involves a lot of strategy to try to infect and destroy the world. The infection patterns are quite realistic. To start off, the plagues are fairly simple bacteria, but you unlock crazy plagues (allowing zombies, for example). Games are pretty quick, running 10-30 minutes from my experience. You can name your own plague, creating many hilarious phrases to pop up during the game. Stick to singular nouns or proper names and you will get some amazing combinations. For anyone worried about it being early access, there is more than enough content to keep you busy for a very long time. If the creators hadn't told me it was unfinished, I wouldn't have known. I still look forward to updates (which the developpers are keeping up with), but it's not an incomplete game without them.On a science note, the only real problem I have with this game is how mutations occur in all the Plague cells at once. In actuality, a mutation would only occur in one instance and then have to spread again from the new patient 0. It makes the ""infect everyone then evolve deadly symptoms"" tactic to lose some of the magic.			"

								You need to infect the entire population of the world, and then kill them. With all kinds of different disease/virus types, gene modifications, and the choice of which symptoms you want your disease to display in its patients. Different ways the disease can be transmitted, resistances to temperatures and different climates.I like to think of this as a kind of ""total world-destruction solitaire"". Take that how you will.Some of the game is very skill-oriented, where as some times on harder difficulties you may rely on the chance of your disease spreading to other continents and having to re-try several times, if not sever dozens of times. So that's the luck part.This game is very in-depth strategy that puts you in the role of a vengeful, wrathful evil god (or perhaps scientist, who knows?)If you ever played the popular flash games Pandemic or Pandemic 2 years ago and enjoyed them, this is your game.It draws obvious inspiration from those games, but adds even more depth and realism to the strategy involved.More ways to destroy humanity, more information on how your destruction is coming along, better visuals.In all ways imaginable it is a beefier, better re-creation of Pandemic into a higher-tech envinronmnt than just flash games would be able to bring you.Overall, for being in early access, I still feel like I got more than my money's worth. Plus, there's new content being added, constant fixes, and upcoming multiplayer with versus and co-op. Easily a 10/10Highly recommended			"

												How many times can someone destroy the world before it gets boring? I've successfully doomed the human race 50 times, and the game is still as fun as it was the first time. There are so many different diseases, genetic upgrades, and scenarios available that the game keeps fresh after dozens of iterations. The co-op version is also a lot of fun, but it requires very good communication with your partner if you want to successfully obliterate mankind together. Pro tip: watch out for the island nations. Iceland, Greenland, and New Zealand are the worst offenders, but Madagascar and the Caribbean have also proven problematic in the past. If you pull trigger too soon, those nations will spook, and close up their harbors, essentially locking you out of the country unless you get lucky with a mutation or special ability. Oh and get ready for some BS when it comes to the Nano Virus. I've started in Japan (makes sense, right?) and within 3 to 5 days, BOLIVIA has grown concerned and started to work on a cure--because of one infected Japanese scientist on the opposite side of the planet. Still, the game is loads of fun, and I highly recommend it.			"

								I stumbled across this game a  year or so ago as a mobile app and absolutely loved it.  Really glad to see it in the steam store!It's an interesting - if grim - plague simulation/strategy, wherein you get to ""conquer"" the world with a different kind of ""empire.""  Despite how unbelievably morbid the concept is, it's actually a pretty fun game.  It's good for a casual way to pass time, and its harder difficulties offer a lot more challenge for those who really enjoy strategizing and thinking about the next move... because one wrong step can actually throw your whole game and see your plague destroyed.Beyond that, there's a bit of learning to be had as well, if only because the information pages on each of the countries are like little encyclopedia entries that offer up real world information.  Of course you don't HAVE to read it, but it's pretty awesome that it's in there.10/10 for sure, even as early access.  It's a complete game.  It's fun and engaging.  You might even learn something while you're frightening yourself with the strange ease of wiping out humanity.  Unless you turn up the difficulty, in which humanity becomes a little more tenacious.  :)			"

								I do recommend the game as a time waster, but beyond that, I think the price is a bit steep. My main problem is that, after creating a few varieties of various bacteria, viruses, and fungi, you come to realize that the symptoms are by and large still static.You always have the same symptoms. And that makes it feel very repetetive very quickly. Even after deciding to think ""outside the box"" and go for something you normally avoid, you're limited to the same technology tree of symptoms, which makes it feel a bit too redundant.I know it's still in review and development, but that's something I would really like to see happen.

												I originally played this game when it came out on mobile and logged 50+ hours there, when I saw its release on Steam I thought it wouldn't be much different and to my surprise I found it was actually pleasing to have a larger screen, more options and content! Greenland is still a pain in the butt to infect sometimes and it can be morbidly satisfying to watch the world crumble from your plauge. I like the implementation of multiplayer and co-op which I feel adds replayability, It is definitely worth the grab when it's on sale  which I reccomend to a high degree  considering the pricing is a bit high.TL;DR Overall a fantastic game			"

YouTube™ Video: Let's Play Plague Inc. Evolved (Badly): WHEN SQUIDGY ATTACKS 

			Views: 1,185		

			Recording of the livestream broadcast on Twitch (www.twitch.tv/gameplayjenny) for The Crystal Crow, 25.8.14. http://www.gofundme.com/d223u8 If you like it, like it! Leave a comment!		

I really love this 'game'. I'm not sure if I want to call it a game, as any enjoyment comes riddled with guilt that you are killing off the entire world...I started with the tablet version, and was playing it on a train sitting next to a woman who was overly interested in what I was doing. I prayed that she didn't look over my shoulder to ask, as the answer would have been, ""Killing off six billion people with a parasite!""Watching your efforts spread and take hold across different countries is very satisfying, especially when you conquer somewhere really annoying, like blummin' Greenland. It's not perfect, and I would much prefer it if all countries were separated out individually (at least on the PC version). But there is a lot of room for updates and sequels here, and you get silly seasonal tasks which show that the developer is still very engaged with the game.Of course, calling your plague something daft is the really fun bit: ""Facebook"", ""Miley Cyrus"", ""Arriva Trains Wales toilets""...

												Splendid game. I always wanted to eradicate humanity, kill, kill, destroy, annihilate! I vaporized billions of people already and it is still fun. Especially when using specialized types of viruses, vampires, zombies or Caesar (the ape, not the emperor). It is just one screen and you have to imagine most of the stuff going on, people dying but whatever, it is still fun. The only thing I was missing were hopeless cries for help as people realize, there is no chance the humankind will survive.			"

												I'm really into real-time strategy games and have been playing them for many years now (Caesars, Tycoons, TTD, Hospital, Age of..., you name it) - so Plague was on my wishlist for some time then I bought it a couple days ago.I think I spent half of my day trying to beat the game on different leves with different bacteria/virii - this is kinda addictive.One round doesn't take too much, 20-30 mins I guess, but it's easy to lose track of time. Maybe, just like for Pokemon Go, someone should make a custom scenario, how Plague Inc. Evolved eradicated humanity.			"

								Have you ever wanted to create a Plague, virus, nano-bot, zombie virus, even control Apes and play out your own planet of the apes, And many many more diffrent types of plagues you will make and evolve. Be the mad scientist you have always wanted to be.I have had and still do lots of fun playing this game. The developers did a great job converting this from a phone app into a great PC game. They have constant great updates, Including New scenarios , achievements and fixes . The game also uses steam workshop so you can play Custom scenarios from  peoples twisted minds and thier imagination or create your own.Pros1. Tons of gameplay ranging from the main scenarios to Workshop custom scenarios & time trials2. The ability to do it your way. you chose what you want your creation to do. ( evolve sympotms , transmision factors, and much more)3. Constant new updates for new scenarios for you to play. Its not a dead game.ConsNone that I can see.			"

								My real life dream is to destroy humanity on a nuclear holocaust, but this also fills me with joy.Pros:-It is actually difficult, you might believe making a virus and making it evolve to destroy everyone is just a matter of clicks, but no, you do need to think about  what you will evolve and take good decisions.-You can choose from a variety of organisms. Virus, Bacteria, Spores, Parasites etc.. Thus making the next game you'll play not repetitive by adding different perks or even special difficulties.-The game devs usually add content and new events like ""Infect everyone with Christmass Spirit""-The game is Still Early Access and it is incredibly well done! which means if you buy it now your money will be helping them :D and you will get more content! what could be better than that?Cons:-GREENLANDConclusion:Buy the game! honestly it is fun to play and even more with the funny names you can add to your diseases.i even made the T-Virus and destroyed the world via zombies :)			"

Score – 8/10 (Pretty Good)It's hard to fault Plague Inc: Evolved since it does so many things right: the game gives you the opportunity to be the stereotypical, evil mad scientist, hell-bent on destroying humanity and while this can be a challenge to do (especially on higher difficulty levels or if you're going for Greenland – friggin' Greenland…) it's quite easy to grasp the basics of spreading your virus/bacteria and evolving it. Add Steam achievements, trading cards, multiplayer (co-op and competitive), leaderboards and the ability to make your own mods, and you've got yourself a great value-for-money game that should keep you entertained for a long time.http://www.choicestgames.com/2016/07/plague-inc-evolved-review.html "

								Notice how most reviewers only have 2-3 hours of gameplay? Well, there's a reason for that. This game is bland. It's the same thing over and over again. Doesn't matter if you play bacteria, virus, bioweapon, or parasite. No matter what you start as, you well end up doing the same thing: getting cough and sneezing, upgrade water and air transportability, increase cold and heat resistance, get a single point into drug resistance and maybe a point into slowing research, wait until the whole world becomes infected, then upgrade to total organ failure and whatever else you choose to accompany your leathality.The real ""trick"" of the game is doing just what I said, but do it quickly. There is little to no challenge to it and there's no reason to deviate from a certain ""be all end all"" disease build unless you want to roleplay that your disease is unique which causes paranoid people to stay up all night ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants. Regardless, you'll end up getting coughing, sneezing, and segway into total organ failure (and I know you will).The game costs more than the mobile version and has less content with little to show for. I know it's ""unfinished,"" but these silly early access games keep biting me, and other gamers, in the♥♥♥♥♥ By the time the game becomes something fun or original, I would have already been left with a sour taste in my mouth with no want to play it again.

												Lack of Common Sense has eradicated 99% of humanity.11/10 - 100% accurate.Somehow Greenland was immune, I'm now totally moving there.Game Features: Greenland somehow surviving every apocalypse. Being able to cause humanity to worship worms.A multiplayer mode that allows Memes to fight for world domination.What's not to love?(Actual Review)My personal impressions of the various modes after playing through most of the game.Single player is more of a limited-resources strategy game with a bit of randomness and time constraints thrown in.Versus Multiplayer is a Optimization war that's equal parts strategy and luck in your opponent's starting moves not countering yours.Co-op MP seems like a somewhat harder and far more chaotic version of SP.Scenarios are mostly the main part of SP with various modifiers thrown in, or recreating historical plagues.The Tutorial is exactly what it should be.Overall, I'd give the game a 9/10, mainly because SP mostly relies on Workshop support or achievement hunting for replayability, but there's enough content in the game to last quite a while without even touching MP, so it's not too big of a deal.

								To say it shortly, I beleive that this game is very great, though can be a tad bit boring after several games. I think that despite it being in early access, this game is already quite ready for sale, with no glitches or crashes, but the devs are fixated on creating much more, including multiplayer. I played the game a many times and found that its methods were highly legitimate, as the different events that often occur such as the Olympics allow the plague to travel more quickly to other countries around the globe. I particularly like the way your plague can evolve into a greater, more deady, and more infetious disiease (I once made everybody s**** their pants in public). The game's ""street veiw"" is not as cool as I had expected it to be, but the graphs and such that display the amount infected, deseased, and healthy, as well as the depiction of the country's state of emergency both helps and entertains. It is fun to watch people fall disaterously to your evil, diabolical plague. This is my opinion of the coolest strategy game I've played for a very long time.8/10			"

The realism of this game is pretty nice, and I really like the scenarios that can be laid out for you to try.    One last thing, if you're failing world geography, buy this game.

								I don't understand why this game is still in Early Access. It's one of the most complete games I've played. Rather bug-free as well! To the game: I don't feel like explaining what this is about, you can find that info elsewhere, easily.As for the price-tag, if you're planning to explore the game to it's fullest, i.e.: do all or most of the achievements, you can spend a LOT of time with it. I spent about 50 hours in game (counter shows more but idle and so on..) and that's about how long it took me to do all of the achievements. And these get really hard in the end! But it adds to the fun for me. For people who are uncertain as to if this game's worth the money, I recommend just trying out the phone version. Yeah, the content on the mobile version is largely the same, but due to the nature of touchscreens and the capability of phones, it's rather dull on phone - I feel. Sometimes you just lack the tempo to do certain tasks in a certain speed on touch, while on PC it's much easier with all the hotkey and mouse controls. It's simply more manageable. Aside from that, on mobile you have to pay for ""DLC"", while on PC you get everything for 14 bucks. Also you have triple speed here on PC, while only double speed (max) on phone. To everyone saying this is a slow game, I recommend upping the game's speed, you'll have your hands full with work, especially on higher difficulties.If you're the kind of person that's not even interested in playing a game to it's fullest, someone who's like ""yeah I'll try every mode out once on the easiest difficulty and move on"" then no, this game probably has very little to offer for you and thus rather low value in regard to it's price.As for the multiplayer that's still in development; I feel multiplayer on a game like this is needless. But apparently, people seem to enjoy it (unlike me). But I guess MP is, in today's world, a high value proposition for most of gamers.Anyway, if you've liked what you've read and seen, maybe stumbled across this review, I can wholeheartedly recommend buying this game under the above circumstances.

I spent 2 hours playing it but it felt more like 20... Too long partThe game has very fascinating background and it's very exciting to discover everything it has to offer at first. But as you go on, you realise that while the content is wide, it's also quite shallow. You basically spend your time staring at a world map and some pulsing red dots progressively expanding over time. There are also red, orange and blue bubbles to pop every now and then, which in all honestly seems like a very very desperate attempt to make the gameplay look more dynamic. I imagine this whole concept works amazingly on mobile devices but it's just not good enough on a PC.Another way to spice things up is various events which occur in a more or less random fashion. Most of these are opportunities which can be abused to spread your disease faster. Problem is that these events tend to happen on the other side of the globe and you don't have enough resources to react in time.I also feel like there is a huge gap in the difficulty levels, as Normal can basically be beaten by not actively doing anything at all while Brutal seems almost impossible in comparison. If humanity starts working on a cure and you havent infected every single person on the planet yet, you basically lost the game because you usually don't have enough resources to deal with the cure development and security precautions. At Brutal and Mega Brutal difficulties the discovery feels very random which is what makes it so hard and infuriating. Fun thing to note is that island countries become impenetrable fortresses once the cure development starts and you haven't infected anyone in there yet.			"

												It's the kind of game that when someone walks in on you, you switch to porn becuase it's easier to explain. 10/10 would get mistaken for a terrorist again.That's... boy, I wish that was just a joke.That being said, this game requries a lot more strategy than you think. When you first start out, you probably think stealth is the best way to go, until you hit Brutal and your only option is to go hard or get cured. Pretty much every plague type has a mechanic that requires tweaking your strategy, to the point where if you play blind, you have to play several games just to understand what kind of angle you need.If you're coming from the mobile version, as I did, I would definitely recommend this version. It's not a direct port, more of an upgrade that breathes a little life into a game all about murdering everyone on the planet. Now, I haven't played it as extensively as the mobile version (I bought it on release to support the dev and never played it until recently WHOOPS), but just playing a few co-op rounds with a friend has definitely made this worth it, and the added Workshop functionality means more screaming for everyone. And, IIRC, all updates are free.A late update: the Shadow Plague is nice, but a little easy once you figure out how it works. Still, the new achievements (even the non-Shadow Plague ones) are relatively fun to get, so not a bad addition at all. Pros:Great bubblewrap simulator.Beating Mega Brutal with bacteria and almost no genes feels really nice, okay.It makes you feel really smart with all these big fancy words wow look at them all.Easy to alt-tab out of, for all your alt-tabbing needs. Probably to look at a guide and cry. No judging here, man. That Necroa virus sure is killer. (Yes, you can hang me now. I've made enough bad jokes.)The news reel and random events are kind of great. The game has just the right amount of humour for being a game about pathogens.It just has such a nice draw to it. Makes you feel like a mad scientist kicking back and watching the world burn. (Sometimes literally. What is with these nukes, mate.) A+ ego boost.Cons:Greenland.I'm probably on a watchlist now somewhere, tbh.Being able to infect everyone after you get noticed didn't really feel right until I remembered standard precautions even in 'rich' countries is actually really poor because no one follows them as rigorously as they should. Not really a con about the game, just a little bit of an unsettling revelation.Greenland.Sometimes when you make a mistake, but still obviously going to win (ie, no cure prgoress being made), it takes forever for the game to finish. I've only really noticed this with the Necroa virus because of the zombie mechanic (I'm a scrub I know I know), so it isn't something that happens often, but it's my only real complaint.I personally just strongly dislike the Necroa virus, which only grows the more I play with it. It's very gimmicky, cured easily (I assume to encourage your inner necromancer.), and just generally the least fun of all of them, even when zombies do start. Since it's part of the mandatory progression line-up, this becomes even more noticeable. I'm not sure what could be done to balance it, though my general frustration suggests buffing the lethality of the few non-zombie symptoms it has.Maybe it's just because I'm playing on a glorified toaster, but the Steam overlay keeps glitching out and closing on me. I'm going to do some testing on this one as soon as I can. This isn't a game breaker, though. This is my toaster. Stupid toaster. Can't even toast toast.Greenland.So go get it. Be the change you want to see in the world. And for the love of God, evolve water transmission and cold resistance.			"

								Differences between this and the mobile version:- Better Music- Better Graphics- No microtransactions (unlock everything just by playing)- Scenario editor (you can make your own scenarios and play user made scenarios [you can wipe out humanity with fridges!])- The freshly added Multiplayer- The upcoming Co-op modeIs it worth it?- Yes!In this game you choose between different plague types to wipe out humainty.While certainly not easy (mostly because there's no tutorial, but since it's early access it will be added in the future) it is rewarding for a while once you know the drill (mostly because it's almost the same tactic for every plague type). There are also 3 special plagues (neurax worm, necroa virus, simian flu) that require different tactics. You'll unlock genes for every win to modify your plague. After that, you can try to beat the game on Mega Brutal.Then you move on to scenarios. They are different from the normal game and therefore you still have to put thought in your actions. After that you basically have seen everything from singleplayer. Now you can play some custom made scenarios. It's time for the Multiplayer! You have to either infect 100% of the world population or have the other plague getting wiped out by making humanity focus on the cure for the other plague or kill all it's hosts (passively or actively). More modes are coming.Every game of multiplayer is different, because the enemy has different tactics (unlike in singleplayer). You'll have to adapt and use their mistakes to your advantage to win. There are special transmissions, symptoms and abilities just for multiplayer.I can't write about the co-op mode because it's not out yet.9/10 because early accessIf you don't like it right now, wait until it's out.

												This is a difficult review, I'm really struggling against the simple 'recommend/don't recommend' system here.  I don't think the game is bad at all, like many people I originally played this game on my cellphone and found it quite entertaining.  The whole game is here and I really have nothing against it or it's strategy.  Heck, it's one of the few mobile games I liked because it actually fit the medium it was made for.  And yet, that's the core of why I cannot recommend it: The game was better on mobile.This experience is tailored for a small touch screen.  The point and click gameplay was fast and fluid on a tiny screen but clunky on my HD display.  The interaction with your virus was a detached experience on a small screen as you played the observer tinkering with the virus' evolution.  The 'pimple popping' gameplay made sense as a way to pass time as you watched your virus spread.  On the big screen?  It almost comes off as insulting.  The simple evolution of your virus makes sense when you have ten minutes to play, but it feels empty at my desk.  Perhaps because I knew it as a time-wasting mobile game that I don't want it on my desktop but here we are and I really just don't.  I hoped that they'd make use of the big screen somehow, maybe take some risks and update the game.  I did not find that to be the case.Honestly I'm not recommending not buying it, I just don't think it's a good desktop PC game.  It barely surpasses it's flash roots.  And since you ~can~ play it on a cellphone or tablet, well, this may not be the worst port of a cellphone game to the PC but at the same time it's hardly better for it.  The pick up and play is gone.  The swift menu navigation is gone.  And I don't remember this on mobile, but an endless flood of tutorial messages drags things down further.  It's good for a few minutes of your time but do you really what to boot up your computer, log into Steam and kill ten minutes?  Maybe it is.  To me, all the gameplay which made it fit the mobile genre feels wasted and for ten dollars you could easily buy something far more interesting.			"

								In Plague Inc: Evolved, Your goal is to wipe out the human race with a type of epidemic. The game pretty much speaks for itself. Though the game sometime feels like it is designed for smartphones, it is very fun nonetheless.NO SPOILERS AHEAD.Pros:The Idea of Plague Inc is very unique and the concept is very nice.The Gameplay is fun and addictive.The Variety between the types of plagues is good.The Zombie and Planet of the Apes Plagues are a ton of fun to play with.The Atmosphere at the end of the game is very chilling. As the last humans are dying, everything on Earth stops which can give you such an erie feeling.The Steam Workshop makes this game 10 times better. User Created plagues with custom timelines and traits are very awesome.Mixed Feelings:I don't like clicking on my screen every couple of seconds to catch the bubbles. This clearly is a mobile mechanic in which you need to keep clicking on your screen. When you level up, eventually there is a gene which automatically pops the bubbles for you which a must have.Cons:The Game does get repetitve after you figure out the formula for the game which doesn't take that long.Many major countries are missing from the map.Final Verdict:Overall, Plague Inc: Evolved is a very nice game. Though it does get repetitve after a while, there is plenty of fun to be had playing this game.I give Plague Inc. Evolved an 8/10			"

												If you are into these kind of games, interested in microbiology, viruses or diseases - this game is totally for you. The game is clearly something unique and interesting. You can develop your own strategies, which you actually need to do for each disease type. Bacteria and viruses I find are very similiar to what they are in real life - so for example viruses are mutating very quickly which is actually true based off of real life studies. I highly recommend the game for the unique idea, good gameplay, low hardware requirements and of course the hyper-realistic world. I hope the game will get better and better as I did find few bugs or errors with the workshop maps which could be caused due to the Scenario maker and not the author him/herself. I give the game a solid 9/10, would recommend.PS: I did play the game on my friend's account for a long time until I could actually buy it. I say that due to the low amount of time playing (only 30min) on this account :).Best regards, Wolfie.			"

												Do you ever wake up and think; ""I sure wish I could kill everyone in the world,"" or ""I wonder how hard it is to create a bio-weapon!"" If so then instead of buying this game, I think you should seek serious help. Please don't kill people. This is a video game, please realize a problem when you have it.But if you don't want to kill everyone in the world and only want to play with simulations that do it for you then this is the game for you; Plague Inc.Take on the role of a plague, choosing how you evolve to spread from country to country. Use your wits and skills to infect every single human being, or look up a walkthrough when you can't win because of F***ING GREENLAND, ahem, my bad, lost my cool for a second. Fight the cure with your abilities, travel places using transmission, and kill people useing symptoms.All of this and more in:Plague Inc: F***ing GreenlandWhy. Can't. I. Infect. GREENLAND?!			"

								NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS NOT MY FINAL THOUGHTS OF THE GAME. IF MY OPINION CHANGES DRASTICALLY OR WHENEVER THE GAME IS RELEASED FROM EARLY ACCESS, I WILL REWRITE THIS REVIEW.Do you or have you ever despised humanity? Do you like video games but you're tired of the same old shoot em ups? Do you want something (fairly) new and unique? Well, my friend, this is the right game for you!Create a disease from a variety of disease types (which you have to unlock... fun), select special traits for your disease (also unlocked... more fun), select your difficulty, and infect Patient Zero. You then choose some skills to evolve your plague to make it more lethal, easier to infect others, or resist outside forces (i.e. temperature and drugs). Unfortunately the governments of the countries aren't very keen on the idea of you eliminating the human race, so they'll shut borders, airports and harbors and try to cure your disease, so you'll have to race against the clock to infect the world and evolve enough lethal symptoms to kill the world. Rinse and repeat.The gameplay is fun, there is a bit of strategy on choosing which country to infect, whether you want to be able to infect by air or water first or if you want to invest some points to get bonus infectivity in colder countries. More strategy comes when you get traits for your disease, since they add bonuses to infectivity, extra DNA points, and a couple more nifty abilities. Each disease has some varying traits, like virus evolving frequently, biodisease being so deadly you have to suppress the lethality, nano-virus being built in with a kill switch that you must race against, and there are much more. It's worth it to unlock the diseases, since some of the cooler ones like Neurax Worm (mindcontrol) and Necroa Virus (zombies) are unlocked a bit later and it's always fun to mess around with those. There are also random events that happen that will affect the game, making each experience different.The display looks nice and it's easy enough to see what's going on. There's a cool little body chart that shows you where in the human body your disease affects. You can see what's going on in all countries, how they're combating your plague, how their cure research is coming along, and if the government is still stable there or if it's falling apart.There are also scenarios where you mess around with stuff, mostly stuff like little to none plane transmission, a mirror version of Earth where all of the countries characteristics are reversed, a virus that's DNA is damaged, affecting its transmission, and some more. Steam Workshop also makes an appearance, letting you create your own scenario. The communuty for this game is pretty large and I can see multiplayer being popular when the dev releases it.There are some problems I had with the game, most of them small however. Mostly minor stuff like Portugal being part of Spain, Alaska being part of Canada (to be fair, the dev makes fun of this in an event so I dont care about that :P), Hawaii being nowhere to be seen yet, minor stuff like that. I can see this game becoming a bit repetetive, but it hasn't become that for me yet. One thing I would like to see, though, are different... I guess maps, you'd call them. Stuff like the continental USA with all of the states instead of the whole world, the providences of Canada, a map where the melting of the ice caps has flooded the world, stuff like that. That would make the game more replayable.Regardless of any criticisms I may have, Plague Inc Evolved is a breath of fresh air with plenty to offer and more to come. 9/10. Never has a game made me hate a country for no good reason like this one has. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Greenland... Anyway, get this game now. It's worth it even at the full $15 or your regional equivelant. Just know that this is an Early Access game, so the game isn't complete yet. However the dev updates frequently, so it could be coming out of Early Access soon. Either way, though, it's worth getting. So get it. NOW!			"

												This game is pretty cool. What I like is about this game is that it's a game that requires you to think and use at least a bit of strategy. Also, it has quite a bit of replay ability to it (if that makes sense), and it can be somewhat addicting at times. I'd really recommend playing this game is you have some spare time.Also, I believe I speak for many people in this community when I say... Screw Greenland, Iceland, Madagascar, and every other POS island in this game.EDIT: Even after this all of this time, what I have said still stands. This game is fun, and it makes you think and consider solutions that may not be conventional but still work. I put this game down for a while and came back to it, its just as fun as when I first made this review.			"

								Simply put, I love this game. I was a huge fan of the Pandemic series (and still possess a hatred for Madegascar because of Pandemic III) so when I found Plague Inc on iOS i was very excited, and now to have it on my laptop, well, my free time is totally swallowed up. Plague Inc is simple to play but does require a good amount of strategy to master; that is part of it's charm. There is a huge amount of replayability either through trying out harder difficulties, changing which genes you select at the start or what syptoms you use to wipe out humanity quickly. Being able to name my disease has always been one of the things I've loved about Pandemic, and now Plague Inc. Some of the pop ups can be hilarious as a result, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ begins to spread"" still being on the top of my favourites list...I'm really looking forward to the multiplayer update that is coming in the future. I bought the game for my girl too, and I want to kick her♥♥♥♥♥I'm yet to try the content creator but, like the rest of Plague Inc, I am sure it'll be awesome. Yes, money well spent. No doubt I will be playing Plague Inc for a long time to come.			"

								I was addicted to the mobile version of this for a long time.  There's much more strategy involved once you really start learning how to play, which makes the replay value great.  When you first start playing this game, you'll get a strange feeling of dread and guilt.  It's morbid and distubing, but before you know it, you'll start getting a creepy grin every time you get the message, ""there are no more healthy people remaining"".  As of now, yes, this is basically the mobile version on a bigger screen, but the things they have in the works for the future sound AMAZING.  Multiplayer is going to be quite awesome I think.  Love that this is fully integrated with Steam also.In its current state the game is very polished and quick.  Although my GPU fan really kicks into high gear when running it for some reason.I wonder if the devs have plans for opening this up to the Workshop... hmm... that could get really interesting!			"

								After playing around with all the plagues, I can higly recommend this game to anybody who wants to kill time. The current price is a little high imo, but the game is overall very enjoyable, yet simple.Pros:+ strategical+ doesn't need much HD space+ free naming of the plague+ neurax worm+ funny news lines+ description of the symptons are quiet accurate (as far, as I know)+ workshop scenarios+ fitting soundtracksCons:- mostly point-and-click if you know what you're doing, but the workshop scenarios keep tha game fresh and enjoyable- definitly needs more soundtracks- no multiplayer as of now- 14€ buying priceOverall, if you can get it for a lower price, definitly worth picking up.I give it a 10/10, just because of the endless naming possibilities. Would enslave humanity with grilled cheese again.			"

												TLTR: It was fun for about 2 hours. Can't really give it a negative even tho it's not very positive.Cool concept and kept me entertained for a couple of hours. After that it just gets repetitive (bacteria, viruses, prions - it's all the same with different names in this game). It's sort of fine as I didn't expect a high-quality game, and I don't feel right giving it a negative just because it's not comprehensive. I was dissapointed by the lack or representation of basic real-life understanding of diseases. Incubation period and the human immune-system for instance does not play a part in this game at all. It was a huge letdown that I came away from this game having learned absolutely nothing about real-life diseases whatsoever.In a nutshell you get some currency with which to buy disease-symptoms and method of infection, and then you monitor how that plays out in a sort of world-sim. It was entertaining until I realized that was all there was.I wouldn't have bought this game knowing what it is, but I can't really give it a negative either. Ah well.			"

								You diabolical bạstard! You destroyed the world!Well congratulations and welcome to the world of Plague Inc.One of the most unique biological simulation games of saving the bad guy, or wait! - sometimes good guys too. You decide. Are you tired of people? Do you want apes to take over instead? What about bringing peace and love back to a depressing terrible world (seriously)?  If you love the research and development parts of your economic simulation games, you're going to love Plague Inc.  It's not too hard to learn but incredibly tricky to master each plague.  You'll need to fail several times but eventually you'll be failing or saving humanity in no time.  You must race to beat the cure! Even if Robert Smith disagrees.			"

Let me tell you, there's nothing more satisfying then making the perfect disease and then watching each and every country and continent go dark red with death as all of it's populace succumbs to the most painful and terrifying deaths imaginable. See how desperately the little ants will try to survive, and then laugh at them as you ruin their efforts and destroy their hope. Show them what just one little microscopic organism can do and remind the haughty humans just where their true place in nature is.

												Great fun game. A massive improvement over the mobile game, and I've never once experienced a bug or problem, considering it's in early access.The game is challenging yet enjoyable, and the plague types are not all the same which I sometimes found with the mobile game. The steam workshop is an amazing idea, you can download other people's disease types, or upload your own to the workshop.The scenario creator (where you make your own disease type) is very good, easy to use and has guides if you're not sure. It's easy to place your scenario on the workshop too! I've got a fair amount of hours on this game, although about 11 of these are trying to complete the Necroa Virus... it's not easy ;) And a multiplayer mode is also in development!All in all, I'd give it a 9.5 / 10.Update 17th June: The Multiplayer mode has been out for a little while now so I thought I'd update the review to reflect on the new mode.I love 1vs1 Mode, which allows you to challenge your friends to see who can destroy the world first! Another thing to add is the new mechanic that is included in the multiplayer mode. They added new abilities which allow your disease to continue to infect the world while the authorities see your opponent as the priority, so your cure status will increase much slower. There is also abilities which prevent your infected people from being infected with your opponents disease, which makes it much harder for them to finish. I've not really played much of the co-op mode in Multiplayer yet, so I can't comment on what I think of it, although I'm going to assume I'll love it :) After the release of the game (leaving early access), my final judgement is still  9.5 / 10.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Calm strategy simulation game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is mouse sensitivity.The Master volume has a slidebar that shows up in %The Sound volume has a slidebar that shows up in %The Music Volume has a slidebar that shows up in %There are many resolution sizes.You can play this game in fullscreen mode or windowed mode.You are able to change your controls on the keyboard.There are many different languages.There is Steamworkshop and you can create your own scenario.About the game.You are choosing a disease/Virus and your mission is to infect all people and eventually kill them. You are able to name your own Virus. You start off by picking a country, From there you will have to make a nice infection. You can choose to spread the infection with birds, Rats, lifestocks and other things. Your Virus will be able to evolve (Over time by itself) and become stronger. Getting  more deadlier and even protection to yourself. You have to click on the bubbles that will show up (If u want), to gain some more virus points. Which you will be able to spend to make ur virus more deadlier. The stronger your virus, The faster you will be noticed and countries will fight back by developing a cure. You can sell virus evolutions. It's pretty useful if they are useless and wont have any affect anymore. However you will only get a little bit of Virus points back in return.  DESTROY THE HUMANITY!You can name your own virus.Games are short but alot of fun!Addictive.There are alot of different game modes.There is a Tutorial.Music is alright.Graphics is alright.You can fast forward and pause.Steamworkshop.You can save and load game.No fast country information (To see if they are a hot climate or cold, on the mobile its a simple tap and you know it).MULTIPLAYER.There are 2 different modes in the multiplayer mode. There is Versus and Co-op Mode. There is a a small tutorial about the multiplayer, they are explaining the Co-op and Versus mode there. You can play online or playing with 1 friend. The servers are NOT IP BASED. They are all dedicated. There is also a different ""unlocking system"" The unlock system is only for the multiplayer, It's the same as single player, So that means single player and multiplayer have both different progress. If you unlock upgrades in single player 5 times, These will NOT be unlocked for multiplayer. You can only unlock all multiplayer upgrades in the multiplayer mode. There is a level difficulty and you can choose a disease name. - Pausing and speeding up will send a request to the other player. He needs to accept this if you wish to make it happen. Finding Online matches will NOT take too long.  I will explain a little bit about these 2 modes. In Versus mode: Your goal is to infect the entire world, You do not need to kill everything in order to win. But you can win by killing off the opponents disease hosts or if his disease is cured. The DNA Bubbles will give you points, If you are the first one that will click the bubble you will receive extra bonus of DNA. Killing people will give you extra bonus DNA aswell.In Co-op Mode: You both need to infect the world and then kill them off, (Same rules as in single player) However the enemy/Humans are far more difficult then they are in single player. You will receive bonus DNA if both diseases has infected the same country. If one of the players has lost and their disease has been fully cured. You can help your team mate by sending out ""Activate abilities"". You can still get points and help him upgrading and evolving his disease. You can also click on the Bubbles to receive DNA.Other things.You are able to play this game for free on the mobile playstore. But its a bit buggy sometimes. I do suggest to try this game for free on the mobile store before you are going to buy it on steam. Just to know how the game is. See it as a Demo.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

Then I was like ""damn... a simple remake of that flash game I played long time ago with some kind of mobile-ish gimmicks""Then I head it was a mobile port ... In a few words.... It's an okayish distraction while eating something... but if you play it and don't have any other thing to do, it's really boring.  You can see it's an almost strait port when you see huch time you have to finish the game to unlock everything. (I presume it was in-app purshase on mobile ? )   Graphics :  UI is okay... the  map is ... a map... you can zoom, but there is no purposeSound : one single 'music' loop ...  and occasionally some sounds effects...In this current state  it's a waste of money. Go play a flash like version if it still exists.			"

												This is a morbidly charming game that appears simultaneously mobile-esque simple and simulation-level complex. Fortunately, Plague Inc meets somewhere in the middle.You'll find yourself balancing competing variables: how fast can I infect everyone without raising the world's alarm so that they don't create a cure in time, how deadly should I be (heaven forbid you kill people faster than you can infect them... at least at first), or how exactly do you infect Greenland, use your DNA points, and so on. There is a surprising number of concepts to juggle for such a simple game. On top of that, the different types of plagues (bacteria, virus, fungi, etc.) all play differently and there are random events that keep you on your toes so that games aren't rinse, wash, repeat.That isn't to say that there isn't a rythm to the game (at least on Normal difficulty--I'm no genius and I've won 4 of my 6 games so far) or that certain strategies seem to work better.There are some mobile-esque quibbles that might cause an aneurism if you're a diehard PC master race proponent. There are clickable bubbles to get points, for example.For all the apparent replayability, a multiplayer mode I haven't even touched, and a fascinating strategy game that ends in human extinction all for a fairly low price, this game is worth it.

												The game is great, and I gladly recommend it. The only bad thing I can say about it is...well, Greenland.At first, I thought the idea of Greenland, the country with the lowest population in the game, being hard to infect was an exaggeration or joke by other players. I beat the game a few times with different plagues, and had no real problem with them. Yet, the more I play, the more I find Greenland ending up as the last country to get infected. They're out in the middle of the ocean, so they share no borders with any other country, no planes fly to Greenland, and the only way to get to them is if an infected person in Russia or Norway travels to them by boat. If Greenland closes their seaports before they're infected, you might as well restart. The game ends up becoming a race to infect them, otherwise you'll lose because ""humanity survived"" despite wiping out 7,124,487,479 of 7,124,543,962 humans.It gets pretty annoying after the 4th or 5th time, but still, it's a fun game.

								This game was a blast to play through, even though I have it on my phone. I didn't really play to much of it on my mobile device, but the computer version got my eye and had a lot more visual effects and easier to handle controls than on the mobile device app. The task of the game is to kill all humans with a deadly pathogen. The game also offers genes (perks for your pathogen) that makes the game easier to handle. I didn't find really any negative problems with the game, but I do recommend it to people that like scientific strategy games. The game also relates to one of my favourite subjects in school science, but you actually play as the pathogen instead of the humans.Favourite disease? Simian fluTry the game out for yourself!			"

								Have you ever had these queasy thoughts about humankind being terminated by the smallest of bacteriae? Have you ever wondered how a zombie-virus would go about starting the apocalypse? Have you ever wanted to kill all humans?Look no further, you've found your game! An interestingly strategic game, where you evolve your bacteria/virus/neurax worm/etc. from a harmless organism, to a massively spread and ultra deadly killer. The game creates it's ambience with a pulsing (but rather dull) soundtrack and flavor text of world-events that actually do influence the game's progression. It's especially fun on mobile devices and is also available for Android.			"

								It's a realistic and simple disease simulator with a huge amount of options while keeping it simple and player friendly.Pros You can choose one among several disease types (bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, prion, nano-virus, bio-weapon, neurax worm, necroa virus, simian flu and more may be add in the future) You can name your plague You can choose your plague's genetic code (initial traits) You can choose on which country your plague will start from You can evolve your plague with symptoms, abilities and type of transmission The game has 4 difficulty levels being casual, normal, brutal and mega brutal they highest the difficulty the more realistic and challenging the game becomes A lot of information is displayed about world events and how the world is reacting to your plague and you can use the evolution system to evolve you plague making the best use of the events happening to help spread your pathogen Aside from the main game disease types there are official scenarios with interesting diseases to play like black beath, smallpox and much more There are also unofficial scenarios that are made by the players themselves and uploaded on steam workshop making the game have even more content The controls are simple you can basically play using mouse only or mouse plus space (pause), 1, 2 and 3 to control game speed plus q (opens abilities, symptons, transmission tabs) and e (stats tab)Cons Can't think of anyIf you like simulation games this is definitely a must buy.

YouTube™ Video: Plague Inc: evolved PC First Impressions 

			Views: 3,604		

			Cosmic's first impressions of Plague Inc: Evolved developed by Ndemic creations. Available now on Steam early access. Twitter - http://twitter.com/Cosmicengine99 Facebook - http://tinyurl.com/q5vpc63...		

You may be saying to yourself 'hey I've seen this game before' and you would be correct in that assumption. Plague inc was originally an iOS and android game and has now come to PC via Steam early access. Now you no doubt know what the game is all about so the purpose of this video is to inform you whether it's worth your hard earned cash.Developed by one-man developer Ndemic Creations and released originally for mobile devices in 2012 Plague inc went on to be the 15th most downloaded paid iPhone game of 2012 in the U.S. (and 18th on iPad). In March 2013, the game went on to win multiple categories of the Pocket Gamer Awards, including Overall Game of the Year. The game itself is a plague simulator, the object of the game is to infect and kill the entire world's population. Once you have selected what type of plague your going to use, be it bacteria, parasite or a myriad of other options. You then go on to select where you plague will start by selecting a country of your choice. Throughout the lifespan of your plague you can evolve it, not only increasing its infectiousness but also it's lethality. You accomplish this by purchasing various so called evolutions with DNA points. DNA points are earned naturally by the plague spreading but also by clicking the DNA and infection bubbles that pop up on the world map as the plague spreads.As your plague spreads and starts causing fatalities, authorities will start to take notice. At a certain point scientists will begin to research a cure for your plague and then the race begins to see if you can kill the populace before a cure is developed. You can hamper the cure research progress by popping the research bubbles on the main map and by also purchasing evolutions that hamper research development.I really enjoying Plague inc on my iOS device last year, I thought it was a fun little title that had some replayablity but it certainly was not a core game. So it begs the question is this title worth $15 of your hard earned cash? And before the complainers out there say, well you can't critique an early access title, I'll say this, if your asking money for a product, I'm damn well going to find out if it's worth the money for people or not.In its current state on early access, it is not worth your money especially since only the main game, which I might add is the same version as the mobile game, is available. Why spend $15 dollars on something that you can pick up for less the $3 on your mobile device. That being said there are some new features coming to the game like multiplayer, speed run mode and scenarios but even then will it be worth it?For me personally, to make the $15 really worth it, this game will have to produce a great multiplayer experience. The multiplayer needs to add what the single player experience lacks, re-playability. While the cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes do sound like fun, I do doubt it will hold people for long. I think the single player could have done will some rework too, if it was me, I would have added some micro gameplay elements in there to add to the experience. Everything in the game is on the macro level, I would have added in some new levels. For example like in spore where you start of as a cell and as you grow the level gets bigger, what you could have done here is start of in a town of a country, the aim would be first to spread your plague across the country, then the game would go onto the world level.I really feel that small changes like the addition of levels would have really added to the game and make spending $15 for what is essentially a mobile game, a more justifiable purchase. I'm not saying that Plague inc is a bad game, on the contrary its a very fun, if not superficial simulator. I simply feel that in its current state it is not worth $15 of your money, once the additional features are added especially the multiplayer, it may be worth another look. But for the time being, I'd wait either until full release or if your just interested in the single player, pick it up on your mobile device.			"

								Score: 7.5/10Total playtime: 31 hoursPrice: $10 or lessPlague Inc. A game of creating and evolving various types of illness to wipeout mankind. Be it bacteria, virus, parasite, zombies, simian ape flu (Planet of the Apes), nanomachine or a man made biological death virus you are tasked with infecting and ultimately wiping out humanity. Transmission, Symptom and Ability are the three areas you will dabble in making your virus hardier in different climates and against man made medicine and air / water filters. Symptoms tend to come in three areas as well. Infectivity, severity and lethality. The trick is to keep infectivity high while keeping severity and lethality low initally. Should the latter two get too high countries will begin researching a cure for your illness.While essentially the exact same game as the mobile app, the real fun comes from the Steam Workshop. Everything from demonic possession, the four horsemen of the apocalypse, Terminator-like machine uprisings, AI self awareness (I Have No Mouth and Must Scream), spider-based armaggedon, the 1982 'The Thing' and many more. Be it the coming of dragons, vampires, werewolves or transforming into a propane loving Hank Hill this game provides amusement with slight resource management and is well worth picking up on sale as a time killer.

You control transmission methods, symptoms, and abilities with the object being killing everyone before a cure can be created. Thinking about your decisions is crucial. Can't just kill off everyone immediately because it cannot spread. Cannot make it too passive because the cure will catch up to you. So, you have to find a balance.While it may be a dark premise, which might put some off, the game is pretty solid. Hoping multiplayer is on its way soon.Added bonus: You give your disease a name. So, have a giggle killing off the planet's inhabitants with ""Kindness"", ""Puppies"", ""Mad"", and ""Your♥♥♥♥♥quot;.			"

												Pros+Cool concept+ Watching the earth turn red is weirdly satisfying in a evil mastermind kind of way+Upgrading symptoms seems cool and interesting at firstCons-I don't really feel like what I'm doing has much of an impact on anything. There isn't much to adapt to. Just try to infect everyone before the timer runs out.-Once you learn what upgrades are good and what ones are bad the game is very boring.-There isn't much for content. Different viruses and thats about it. Steam workshop helps.I would not recommend this game. It feels like farmville. Just waiting around tapping on bubbles when they pop up and picking the same upgrades over and over. Hoping someone takes a boat to Madagascar cause otherwise you lose. Feels more like I am watching a game than playing it.			"

								Infecting the World and evolving a virus is fun and the game does a good work as a simulation game. However this game is not for everybody, because there is no fancy graphics or story or gameplay, so if you are not into this genre, look for something else. On the other hand, if you do like these simulation type of games, you should get this one, because it is very good in its playfield and the concept is innovative and scarry at the same time considering its real life connections. The game also has a HUGE re-playability with several different plague types with different gameplay and abilities.I'm looking forward for the future updates which may legitimate the price, but at the moment I feel the current price a bit expensive. I really hope that more plague types, game modes and evolutions will come which will further enhance the fun.Overall I have enjoyed this game even in its current state and I can recommend it but only for those, who are into this genre.

								Despite this game being a simulation of a disease, it's got alot more strategy than you'd initially think. Hence it being in my Strategy games library category.Basically what you've got here is an experience akin to the mobile android game Plague Inc. Only awesomely enough it's the same cost as all the DLC for that game combined.Plus looking at the prospect of Co-op and even Competitive Multiplayer, Custom Scenarios (likely implemented via the workshop) and the existence of Speed Runs, a Leaderboard, and even a virus not currently featured in Plague Inc. The Simian Virus as a reference to the Planet of The Apes series.You start with Bacteria, Then Virus, and later control Fungus, prion and even my favorite and one of THE EASIEST plague types in the game, The Neurax Worm, a plague that is essentially a brain worm (Alpha Centauri's Mind Worms, anyone? :D) tha can either kill or mind-control, allowing for a second victory alternative.Whichever plague you start with, the object of the game is to kill all of mankind, save for the Neurax Worm which can turn all of humanity into a slave race (which in my opinion is better than killing them all).There are 7 plague types, and they all play differently, although a couple feel or act similar, no single plague works the same as another, which is the important part as nobody wants to play an FPS where 60% of the guns all act the same, or an RTS where 5 units are literally the same thing with a paint job.There is easily a wealth of content as the game itself is fairly tricky with plague types like the Necroa Virus, a plague that can turn people into zombies.... or just act like a normal plague... which doesn't work as well as when a zombie, you have abilities you can use.If you oppose Evolution, or find killing humanity in a simulation wrong somehow, or you don't like Simulations or Strategy games... Then this game isn't for you.Otherwise, if you're okay about either point, or like any of them, then I highly encourage you to get a copy of this game, It's loads of fun, allowing for more than 6-24 hours worth of gameplay if ignoring the achievements.To get them, I'd imagine that number would triple easily.This game's a blast, I personally see it as a 7/10 in it's current state, it may easily rise in the future as I just cannot forget future features like Co-op, which I am absolutely ecstatic about.So yeah. 7/10, once leaving Early access, I will come back and redo this review.

												The best way to describe this game is ""A HD remake of Pandemic with a sh*t ton of new features!"" Simply put, if you enjoyed Pandemic, theres no reason to hate this game, it's better in everyway.The music is good, however it can get repetitive at times.The graphics (If you can call them graphics) are nice and bright, and everything stands out so you know what is what, nothing blends in.While Pandemic had 3 diseases, this game HAS A LOT more and creative ones, plus thanks to the Steam workshop, theres pretty much an unlimted amount of diseases you can play as, plus if you want to make your own, it's very easy to learn!The game while simple and repetitive, it's still a lot of fun and has a lot of Easter Eggs in game, including a Minecraft reference and more.However theres one downside for me, and that's you unlock some of the content by playing a disease in a specific difficulty, this sounds good, but most of the time from my playthroughs, some bullcrap keeps happening like the following.I never get enough DNA points to stop the cure OR get the upgrades I need.The game has an♥♥♥♥♥pull and the cure sky rockets while the upgrades don't help at all, they barely help.Some upgrades feel like they do nothing, for an example I got an upgrade to increase lethality, but people die at the same rate as before.If my disease has nearly no severity, it will get spotted no matter what... this is really unfair when I have a PIXAL amount of severity and I pretty much lose when I just started the game.When I try to play sneaky and spread then kill, I keep getting random upgrades because my disease is evolving, this can help, but most of the time ruins the game for me.I would have prefered to have all the stuff unlocked at the start and have ""Beat this difficulty with X disease"" just as achievements, rather then having it locked.Overall it's a fun and basic game, if you enjoy Pandemic, theres no reason to say no to this game.

								This was probably my favorite thing to play on my mom's iPad when I was home sick. The original kept me busy for weeks, especially all the cool things you could do with the Necroa Virus, like tricking countries into nuking each other. I'm dying to see what new horrors they plan to release with Evolved. It doesn't matter if it's in beta for the moment, it's worth the buy. Go on, spread the infection.			"

								Yes I know what your thinking, WHAT!? FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR A GAME FREE ON MOBLIE!? THIS IS A OUTRAGE!?. But I can assure you it is niot. The game while being basically a polished better graphical version of the first game is basically what it is though. BUT do NOT forget. This is only in early access alpha and it already has allt he feautures the phone has. Imagine how it's going to be when fully done and released. Also this game includes the things you qwould normally have to pay for on the phone FOR FREE! I know right? That means you can fast forward without having to spend a dime! And the game itself is great. They will be adding tons of new and great feautures to the game so tis worth the 15 dollars to be able to watch these things come out. Now is probably a better time to buy it then before because basically all the diffrent straijns you can be. From bactiria to bio-weapon. They're all great and require a lot fo diffrent approaches. This game WILL give you tons of hours to waste into it and in my own opinion truly worth the 15 dollars. Also buy paying for it in  early access you'll be supporting the development of the game as he makes it. So buy it or don't I could care less what you do. but all I'm saying is that it will NOT be a waste of money.			"

I have the app on my phone, ipad and recommending to my nurse coworkers/friends. My best friend gifted this game to me, and I am just so thrilled!! Creator, you are a GENIUS!! Can't wait to see more updates and added soundtrack!

								This is 'Early Access'? I thought 'Early Access' meant you had to put up with flaws and crashes and incompatibilities. THIS GAME is polished, clean, and almost fully functional. This is one of the rare cases where you actually feel like you are getting your money's worth for a game that is unfinished. The game is fully playable. Sure, there are certain pieces not included, such as custom scenarios to play out, or new plague type, but we have already seen an update that includes some of that. If you enjoy the mobile and flash versions of this game, this much more refined desktop version is a great buy. Early Access or not.Plague Inc: Evolved is a simple concept. Take a disease and evolve it to the point where you can infect and eventually kill the entire human race. While the premise is simple, the tools given to you to accomplish this are vast. Multiple different 'bugs' to infect with (Bacteria, Virus ... Bio-Weapon, Mind Worms....) and many paths of evolution give this casual game huge replay value.For those familiar with the simpler versions, here, the graphics are a bit more refined, easier to look at, but with no serious changes in design. Mostly you are presented with a simple World relief map, an interface by which you can evolve your plague, and an information screen regarding the World's progress to fight you or more information regarding those countries your are so desperately trying to infect. Simplistic perhaps, but it is all that is needed. The audio soundtrack isn't going to win any awards, but instead provides the creepy horror movie ambiance that infecting the world with a nano-virus that spreads through open oozing sores, causing folks to have trouble concentrating and suffer narcolepsy, full system failure, and death, should have. Creepy hospital noises, disembodied coughs and fear abound.Overall, I feel this is a great buy. You have a fully playable, fun game for a good price. This game already has multiple difficulties, types of plagues, and lots of replay. Plague Inc: Evolved is being updated regularly with new features at no extra cost. A few of the new features promise to add not only whole new ways of gameplay, but community support in the guise of scenarios designed and uploaded by your peers to play. Oh! Did i mention it supports cloud saves? Save your game at home, and play it on the road from your laptop!If you are a fan of casual gameplay, and not a fan of the humans winning... then this is the game for you! So grab a pair of rubber gloves, slather yourself in some Purel, and let’s see what happens when a super bacteria escapes a lab in North Korea...8/10 "

												Plague Inc: Evolved is a much more expanded version of the mobile version.  While the basic game play is the same you do get a whole wealth of new plagues to unleash on the world including Zombies, highly intelligent apes and now Vampires.  For fans of stratagy games that are looking for something quick to play then this may well fit the bill as each game is relatively quick to complete but the game does have high replayability and it seems the developers are still adding new content.

												Let me preface this by saying that I am not good at this game.I mean, I get the way the game works, and I'm not hopeless, but as of this writing, I've put in nearly 100 hours and still haven't unlocked cheats.  And while that is largely due to the fact that I don't want to try Bioweapon again, it is also illustrative of why I recommend this game so highly.  You don't have to be good at Plague Inc. to play it and have fun with it.At its core, Plague Inc. is a casual game.  You pop bubbles with your finger or mouse, tap or click to choose how your disease progresses, and that's it.  However, where this game differs from most casual games is that the developers have created layers of strategy and complexity over that basic framework, layers that individual players can freely embrace or ignore as they see fit.  If you don't particularly care about factors like how many uninfected countries have dry climates as opposed to wet climates or how to best target the countries that are advancing cure research, then you can simply ignore them, play on casual, and evolve whatever you feel like.  However, if you are looking for more challenge and depth than the average casual gamer, then you can crank up the difficulty to normal. brutal, or even mega-brutal, and carefully plot out which combinations of symptoms, transmission vectors, and other abilities will lead you to victory.In short, Plague Inc. has something for everyone, from the most casual of casual players ro the hardest of hardcore gamers, and I highly recommend it.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go swear and flail uselessly at the new Shadow Plague disease type some more.

								It's easy to look at a game like this, one that you played a few times on your phone, and say ""Oh boy another horrible mobile to PC port."" Well I can confidently tell you that that is not the case. General Pros:~ Easibly navigable GUI and map screen~ Detailed explanations of the implications of your in-game actions~ Random events that can help or hinder your plauges growth~ Fun upgrade paths that are exciting to explore and discover~ Multiple plauge types each with their own special abilities and upgrade pathsThe real question, however, is 'why should i buy this game on my PC if i already payed 5 bucks for it on my phone'?PC Pros:~ 3 all new plauge types that are very different from the generic plauges of the phone game (A zombie plauge, A Planet of the Apes Plauge, and a Plauge that allows you to partially control the infected!)~ Better controls, A 0prettier and more easily navigated GUI, and the ability to go 3X speed (The Phone only has 2X)~ Hundreds of awesome user made scenarios that allow you to plauge the world with everything from Evil Ninjas, to Cults of Cthulu Worshipers~ EXTREMELY easy to use Modding system (included with the game) that allows you to edit virtually every aspect of the game~ An Indev (in Development) multiplayer version.The cons to this game are minimal. While the core of the game remains constant with each new disease you play as, the depth, story, and gameplay can change greatly with different scenarios, mods, and disease types. If you can try to pick this game up on sale, after having spent $5 on the game for my phone i didnt really want to pay full price again, but on the same token i would snatch this game up while its still in the early access stage, because for the content it has and will have i would definitly want to get it before the price goes up.

 Can you infect the world? Plague Inc is a unique sandbox/strategy/simulation game in which you'll be able to play up to 8 different types of deadly diseases with one main goal: To infect and kill every single person in the world. Sounds morbid? Well, it surely is!Upon launching a match you'll first get to choose the disease you want to play - you'll also get to choose one of four difficulty levels - the least one being really though - even for long term players. After this you'll skip to a map of the earth and here you'll get to choose a starting country and from there on you gotta use the skill system (3 skill trees which differ - depending on your disease - all of them using DNA which you'll gather during the match) to overcome the obstacles which the game will throw at you. You'll develop more efficient transmission/resistance abilities to spread further and infect more people - as well as symptoms to spread and later to kill. The setup is very realistic, with a ton of countries, climate zones and random events to make every match you play unique. Note that every match is 45 minutes to 2h long - depending on how you're playing. You're able to save and revisit your match at any given point.At first you'll only able to play as bacteria but upon winning a match you'll unlock the next disease-type. You'll also unlock genes to modify your diseases to make them more resistant to their environment and to generally strengthen them (this enables possibilities to differ in strategies and  YES, there IS a zombie disease ). I should mention that there aren't any graphics aside of the skilltrees and the map on which planes and ships are moving around and infection bubbles popping up - but those are enough to make it an entangling and fun game. The soundtrack is very good - and there are sometimes slight noises like coughing or children playing depending on how far your disease has spread. In the end everything is silent - a pretty sinister and strong impression if you'd ask me!I should also mention that there is a enjoyable multiplayer with PvP and  Co-op and a scenario creator as well as tons of archievements and scenarios - most of them for more experienced players!This game is extremely fun despite having such a scary background and I really recommend it to you if you're interested in diseases and tactical simulations with much freedom and many ways to approach your goal!

Very enjoyable game!Similar to the Flash game Pandemic (or Pandemic 2), if you have not played one of those and are interested in this game, I really do suggest to try them out first to get a feel for the type of gameplay.Plague Inc is essentially a more refined version of Pandemic, with more features, more gameplay elements, more intersting evolutions, more more more!Your task is simple; develop a pathogen to infect and kill the entire humankind. :)There are many different ways to achieve this goal and each time you manage to complete it you unlock a new type of pathogen and a new gene which can be used the next time you play.There are currently (24th June 2014) 9 different pathogens, for which you can select 5 gene slots, each slot has 5 different genes to choose from.Genes are a way to get different starting stats on your pathogen, for example ""Darwinist"" increases the chance of your plague mutating, ""Aerocyte"" increases chance of plague spreading by air. Your choice of pathogen and genes will affect your gameplay.The challenge of the game is to try and beat the game with all kinds of pathogens, they have different types of mutations that you can research with some unique attributes and abilities.The game is a tablet/mobile port, which is noticeable by some of the UI but in this type of game it isn't really an issue.

												Early development:I really enjoy the pc edition. There is not many cons other than there not being multiplayer at this time. Hopefully they will release it soon.Early Development Update: I would highly recommend this game because of the intergration of the steam workshop to the game. I like to see the bizarre scenarios that people come up with. There are thousands of them so the game always changes and the potential is almost limitless.Post Full Release Update: The multiplayer mode is incredibly hard and it is great! I only wish that more of my friends owned this game to go against each other in the versus mode. Even when you unlock all of the plague vectors, it is never the same game because in the multiplayer mode you can face off or join forces with a complete stranger.			"

								First of all, I have way more than 86 minutes on Plauge Inc: Evolved. It only says 86 minutes because most of my time on this is when I was offline.I don't even know where to start this. First off, you get to kill the whole freaking world. Now doesnt that sound great! Anyway what you do is you create a disease to kill the world. In the beggining you choose the disease type, then you name it and finally, the best part, you get to kill the world.So far, I haven't encountered any glitches. This game has many features encluding the game senarios or you can make/ play your own or others games. Overall, great game and great price.			"

Early Access Review
								I can highly recommend this game. For those who are already familiar with the mobile version:All additional content is or will be included but has to be unlocked during play. The visual presentation was adjusted for the PC and looks way better. The world map looks beautiful, and the country pages now include a textual description and camera surveillance. You get much more stats about how your plague is performing, and as a bonus, you can save and load your game at any time. Other gaming modes like speed run and campaigns will be added, but those seem to be added to the mobile version as well.For those new to the game:You get a quick to play, casual strategy game with an interesting theme and excellent visual presentation. On first glance, it may seem repetitive to just having to add perks until all humanity is wiped out. But the different plague types and random events require different strategies. It's quite rewarding when you succeed with your plague on the harder difficulty levels. As an additional challenge you can try to get the over 50 achievements, some of those are very interesting and require additional thought.Pricing and Early Access:I won't discuss the price as it is a personal choice of how much one wants to pay for a game. But compared to many other mobile ports, this one stands out because it was adjusted to PC standards and not just copied over. Also, for an early access game, it is quite stable and the basic gameplay is already there. I did not encounter any bugs, there are of course some very minor issues.Summary:If you are on the edge, and the price is ok, then buy it without any doubt. If it seems too expensive, then at least get and try the mobile version. There will be a steam sale eventually ;-) "

												Let's start of with saying, that I work in a hospital. Love taking care of all the people that are sick/dying and trying to fight off whatever illness/disease process they have.This game is actually pretty exciting since I have to do the opposite of what I do everyday!SIck, I know! But look at it at a medical person's point of view: we have to know what disease it is and how it works to defeat it, but in this game, you have to make it BETTER!This game is pretty helpful in real life because it makes me better at what I do ;-)Suggestions:Do mini games where you have to go inside a person's body and, for example, if I'm a virus I get a chance to try and infect other healthy cells, but I also have to try and hijack and destroy the T-cells that defend the body, etc. If I'm a parasyte (see the cool way I spelled it? Haha), give me a chance to try and infect the host whilst trying to avoid being destroyed myself.If I'm a tumor, give me a chance to try and hijack the replication process of the cells to make it cancerous. I believe there are G-0 to G-3 gates during replication, but I'm not too sure right now as I write this.			"

								This is my game of choice, when i have been playing other (more visually intense) FPS games.  Sometimes after playing a few hours or half a day, i really like to play a little longer, but my eyes will start to tear when trying to focus on moving targets while other players or objects keep moving around me...  Now i know i need a brake...This game is relaxed on the eyes for the background (picture of earth, stretched to fit your square screen) is not changing !! Only things moving (appearing, not actually moving) are a few red dots that keep popping up to give you materials to work with. The game will allow for my eyes to rest..Make no mistake !!  Just because the game is visually not very intense,,, it is every bit addictive, competetive and agitating if you fail yourself. The game revolves about your choices, your insights, your patience or lack off and the way you normally playgames. Get ready to be constantly challenged to learn, evolve and adapt. Time to think outside the box !!			"

								      When i first saw this game i thought it looks alright and would be a bit short on content for all my $15, but when i bought the game it took me 12 hours to just beat the plague's in normal mode without cheats or advanced genes in my plague's. I plan on spending atleast another 10 hours working on the brutal difficulty for each plague and start working on the new multiplayer virus vs. virus on one map which is very fun and difficult. Once i've beat the brutal mode on each the plauge's i'll be spending even more time on the mega brutal gamemode which is very hard (Tested it out early on, disaster) and gene compisitions and tactics. I'll also have the cheats for singleplayer and special genes for the 1 v 1 matches to mess around with too. Overall the game is great fun and challenging at the same time creating the best experience for me personally. This game has far exceded my expectations with content so far and im sure there will be alot more in the future.			"

								This is a very good game... almost my top 5 favorites actually.Won't lie, I got this for my best friend in real life. Didn't even have any interest for it at the time... however, due to the game's popularity and increased number of positive reviews, I purchased it for myself. Did not regret it in the slightest.Unlike most strategy games, you REALLY have to consider how to indirectly make your virus (or disease) wipe out humanity. Every little choice matters, and can affect you in the long run. What I love about this game, is that humanity doesn't die easily even on, well, easy mode! They'll fight it till the end, and it's fun seeing who'll win. You or the world.Every feature is unique, and I haven't seen a game like this in a long while. Everything that happens is recorded, you will get News of the latest events until your virus becomes deadly (or known) enough to make countries start worrying. It's realistic too since countries will start coming up with ways (news wise, or strategy wise) to stop your virus from killing everyone. It doesn't even stop there-The more you unlock, the crazier (or creative) it becomes in you wiping out humanity. Extremely fun, plus the game is nice enough to let you speed things up since it can take awhile for the infection to spread country to country. Best way in taking any mode on is to make your virus spread quickly without hurting people (even a cough will make doctors eventually look into curing it.) Luckily you can devolve your virus's symptoms so that it doesn't end up drawing attention. Not to mention you can name your virus anything, and a LOT of events can occur in which your last run didn't activate. I somehow caused Japan to have a nuclear plant explode ... and that's just 1 out of the 103 events lol.I give it a solid 9.5/10 and it's just in Alpha. I cannot wait till it's fully done. I also wonder how multiplayer will work?			"

Plague Inc. Evolved begins with you selecting a country to begin your disease. There can be a lot of strategy involved even at this stage as you’ll gain resistances to certain effects, but at the same time you may have trouble infecting other countries. There are numerous factors to take into account such as airports and harbours, the climate of the country, if the country is rich or poor – poorer countries will be less capable of dealing with disease – and if the country is an island.You gain DNA points periodically over the course of the game and you’ll gain more by infecting new countries, popping DNA bubbles on the map and generally just spreading your disease. Devolving certain symptoms also yields a refund of DNA points if you need them. Symptoms, transmissions and abilities (such as resistances to drugs and certain weather) all cost DNA points.Each pathogen is distinctly different and each one require different strategies. Bacteria is the most basic pathogen which is easy to master, viruses can mutate very quickly and can quickly get out of control and funguses are hard to spread. Some pathogens also have unique gameplay modifiers to them such as the neurax worm – which can manipulate minds. The neurax worm is able to develop a trait that allows you to fly infected planes to uninfected countries. The necroa virus allows you to control zombie hordes and send them into other countries.Plague Inc. Evolved can also be played on 4 difficulty levels – casual, normal, brutal and mega brutal. Normal mode is the most realistic interpretation of how a disease might spread as the game treats 67% of the world’s population as regularly washing their hands and doctors only work a standard amount of days per week. Sick people will also be ignored.Higher difficulties have 100% of people washing their hands, doctors working non-stop and sick people will be locked up in prison. Plague Inc. Evolved is a mobile/PC port of a game to PC that is done right. Really a great game for the money.THE GOOD- Insane number of factors being simulated- Great customization options- Easy to pick up and play- Humorous scenarios- 10 Different Disease Types- 20 Unique ScenariosTHE BAD- Co-Op matchmaking is defect- Low replay value for campaign missionsDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

Full disclosure: I'm a strategy game junkie, and am therefore more likely to view them favorably.Plague Inc is a ""God Game"" map game where the goal is to transmit pathogens to all the zones on the map. The player selects a type of pathogen and a starting location, and then manages the development of the pathogen by evolving attributes like abilities, infection vectors, and symptoms, typically to spread the furthest possible before anyone notices, and then bringing on the symptoms like a sledgehammer to become as virulent and dangerous as possible to thwart research efforts.The Good Highly innovative adaptation of the traditional Risk-style ""map game"" Solid gameplay, good controls, decent pacing Strangely satisfying to see a country hit that threshhold where your virus gets runaway growth and red floods the region Also strangely satisfying to thwart human efforts at a cure. Seeing the research bar making negative progress, or even better: when you go virulent so quickly that the UN plane never appears, or where the world is dead but some ports never got closed... very satisfying indeed! Fun to try out different sets of genes and symptoms and watch the results Developers continue to stay engaged, despite the fact that the game really is DONE. New scenarios get dropped from time to time to keep the game fresh and new. The Nureaux Worm spreading Christmas Cheer was especially cute and fun. Nureaux Worm in general is just amazingly fun Nice quick game. Game time is about as long as it should be for a game of this complexity. It never gets to the point of ""Are we there yet?"" Planet of the Apes tie-in is brilliant Cool musicThe Bad The single biggest ""bad"" IMHO is the number of things that players have to unlock. I wanted to play as a Prion right away, but you have to GRIND through several previous stages to get there. It really feels a bit like jumping through hoops. Strategies don't change much. For the most part, you want to (1) infect everyplace before anybody has discovered you, (2) get as deadly and dangerous as possible once its likely you will infect everybody. The only real exceptions to this are the Nano Virus, where you start out discovered, and the Zombie Virus, where zombies can continue to spread the plague. Even the symptom selection is pretty straightforward, but I won't get into that because discussing those strategies would constitute spoilers. Some game modes are extremely hard without unlocking genetic starting abilites. For example, the zombie virus you really need to play as Creationist or there's little chance of getting the whole world. Yet I got the Zombie virus long before I got the creationist gene, and wasted a lot of time on an (arguably) unwinnable scenario. Humans develop cures unrealistically fast, even on easy mode. I suspect that developers decided the speed of research by choosing what was challenging for the player, not for any type of realistic scenario. I mean... how long have we been trying to find a cure for AIDS? While it makes for a better game, it weakens Plague Inc as a simulation. Bubble Popping mini-game is silly and should just be eliminated. You ""pop bubbles"" all over the map for 3 different scenarios: to collect a bit of evolution (orange), the patient zero in any new country (red), or to squash ongoing research (blue). These reflex mini games really have no purpose in a strategy or simulation game. I suspect this was added because this was released for tablet too, and they needed to give players stuff to reflex-poke to make them feel engaged. (PC Gaming Master Race has a longer attention span, and doesn't need trivial casual mini-games to stay engaged) Random Events can really determine victory or defeat, especially on really close games. If you've read my reviews before, I'm sure you're well-aware that I consider dicerolls in strategy games non-strategic, and a no-no. Plague Inc really relies heavily on dicerolls, whether for random events, mutations, ""drops"", or deciding whether or not an infection spreads onto a transmission vector (plane, boat (etc)). There are no dice rolls in chess. Strategy games should be about strategy alone, not luck. Name never made sense to me. Plague Inc? Where's the Inc? You play as a virus, not a company.ConclusionGreat game, despite some minor blunders to cater it towards mobile audiences (bubble popping and unlockables). Otherwise its an awesome concept well-executed. Its a smallish game with short ""levels"", so if you're looking for deep rich gameplay or a story, this one might not be for you. It really is more of a simulation, despite the gamified elements. But I enjoyed it thoroughly. And now I know that Greenland is probably the best place to be, if there's ever a plague.Thanks for reading! "

But who wouldnt like it to wipe out humanity once with something like a virus? Or even better Zombies! I couldnt wait for the Necroa virus to finally be playable.

You chose what symptom's will affect people, be it simple cough, headache, stomach problems, etc., how will it spread, through insects, animals, water, air, etc., where your origin country will be. You start as a simple virus affecting one person, each contact with other people spread you around. Boost how effecting you are in warm, cold, dry, humid environments. What are your resistances to medicine and ability to withstand treatment. Keep one step ahead of humanity, while they try to eliminate you. Evolve, infect, multiply, kill. Game is point and click based, with overview of the Earth, with all the countries, transport routes. You earn points by infecting more people, evolving yourself as a ultimate plague, stopping humanity from developing a cure and spending them on your evolution. It's a sick little simulation.

								The first thing I want to say: this game is awesome and unique. It's the first game where you don't have to be a Superhero and to save the Earth dozens times. Forget it! Now you can be an evil genius in whose hands is the destiny of humanity. It even sounds incredible! Create new powerful deadly viruses and turn people into weak-willed zombies. Yep, this game is new, but it has lots of great features already: various types of viruses, diferent DNK types, great number of symptoms.I can only recommend this game. It'll be better with new upgrade, I bet!			"

								I was a little reluctant to buy this as I can play Pandemic 2 for free as an online Flash game, but I'm glad I DID buy it!  Although it's Early Access, the main single-player campaign is fully playable and I've encountered no serious bugs at all (multiplayer and new single-player missions are now being worked on for later addition).  The game has taken care of all the irritations of the online Pandemic (where Madagascar would slam shut its borders as soon as anyone merely stubbed their toe, meaning game over), diseases can cross borders via birds and insects even when border controls are closed and there are more factors to meddle with in the hope of being evil and spreading your new disease before anyone has chance to notice and work on a cure.  Additionally, successful completions of the game unlock new bonus traits you can collect and use to develop your own mutations and improve your chances of winning.The developers have made an excellent job of the game and I'm glad they brought it from app to PC.

												It's so much fun playing this even when I fail. It gives me good ideas for stories to write when I'm not playing. It'd be great if the scenario editor allowed players to customize borders or even offer a fractal generator so players can create different lands to try and infect while also allowing people to create different countries and customize wealth and climate in addition to the scenario editor. I think the game would sell even more if the devs considered this approach, even though the game is already highly successful as it is. Either way, this is a great game to pass time. I highly recommend.			"

								I didn't think that this game would be worth the $15. I couldnt have been more wrong. My girlfriend and I both purchased the mobile version of Plauge Inc: Evloved and hands down it is worth spending the extra money to buy the PC version. Plauge Inc: Evloved is challenging and makes you constantly think about your next step, and there's something morbidly fascinating about watching the whole world get completely wiped out. Cannot wait for the full release.  Overall, Plauge Inc: Evloved is a nice change of pace, and an extrmeley addictive time killer. Highly reccomended.			"

								Definitely worth the $15. If you've played this game on iOS or Android, skip this paragraph. Plague Inc is a world-ending virus simulator. It started out on iPhone a few years ago and was a huge success. It consistently topped app charts, had a number of really cool free updates, and it just gives you so much to do. The CDC even liked it enough to meet with the app creator and discuss how to make it more realistic! In this game, you control a plague (bacteria, virus, fungus, man-made plague, brain worm, and more...there's a lot to choose from). You choose where the virus begins, and you watch as it spreads across the world. You control what vectors the virus uses, how the virus defends itself against temperature and medicine, and what symptoms the virus produces (oh, and I'm just going to use ""virus"" as shorthand for ""plague"" just because I'm more used to typing ""virus""). There's a lot of strategy involved, whether you try to create a nearly invisible virus that, when detected, it will be too late or if you try to create a virus that becomes scarier and scarier as it spreads and just overwhelms cure efforts. The game has been balanced to really support both options. As you infect people, new countries, and kill people, you gain DNA points that you use to alter your virus. The scarier that your virus is, the more you're rewarded with points, but the more that every scientist in the world focuses on curing you. Don't worry, however - the game does a great job of explaining everything to you. Whereas a game like Pandemic can be really intimidating with all of these different medical terms (even one for runny nose - are you kidding me?), Plague Inc prefers to use the common words for symptoms. You're not overloaded with choices (but there are enough for you) and the impact each DNA change has is clearly shown (such as infectivity, lethality, and how scary it appears to the world).For those who have played it on mobile, not much has really changed. Each plague is unlocked after beating the previous one, there's the world map, unlockable gene bonuses, etc. However, it doesn't really look too polished as of yet. The UI feels outdated and inexplicably cheap. I almost feel like I'm playing a flash game in my browser. The UI is mostly functional, but has a lot of empty space. It also has some elements that are just for show rather than solving a purpose. For example, a bar graph to the right of the country status indicator (the main bar on the UI) has different colored bars that don't represent anything and don't move. I don't know why they're there. It's still early access, so that may change. Also, every country has a picture of it (mostly just showing people and buildings, maybe a landmark). The pictures look like cheap CGI (god knows why - there's no shortage of real pictures of locations), but there are maybe 10 - or less - pictures used for every country in the world. I don't mean that, say, Sudan cycles through 10 pictures. I mean that Sudan, and ""West Africa,"" ""East Africa,"" and ""South Africa"" (along with most of the rest of the continent) all have the same picture. Cheap CGI with nothing moving. At first I thought it was a neat touch, but that kind of shallowness stands in contrast to how fleshed out the rest of the game is.On the upside, each plague type has its own 3D image that reacts as you upgrade it. It doesn't change as dramatically as the neurax worm on mobile, but it will stretch out and rebound a bit when you upgrade it and wince when you devolve a feature. I think that's pretty neat, and it doesn't feel as cheap. The DNA upgrade menu is definitely an improvement. Also, the world status menu has been solidified and now has all of the important info on one screen. That's a huge improvement.Also, this game has Steam workshop integration, meaning that people are submitting their own plague types. I saw one for a Hank Hill virus earlier today. It looks like people are going to have a lot of fun creating and customizing their own plagues, and I think that's great!In summation, it's the same as the mobile game, but with a new UI (with its ups and downs) and steam workshop support.

												TL;DR: Very fun but somewhat limited replayabilityThe co op and versus modes fix that to a certain degree, because your opponent's strategy significantly affects your experience of the game. It also helps that it takes a while to unlock all of the different types of plagues. The news headlines are amusing. I like to read those while I'm waiting to get more DNA points. Oh yeah, sometimes it can take multiple minutes to save up points, especially early-game when you haven't infected very many people yet. Also, as a pedantic person it bothers me that you can become ""antibiotic-resistant"" as a virus. The game obviously isn't supposed to be scientifically sound, considering it contains zombie viruses, so I'll let that one slide....I always feel slightly guilty when I win a game, too.			"

												This game is great. I've been playing on mobile for more than two years, and I must say that this version is more challenging. Since everyone has reviewed the single player, I am going to review the competitive side!In vs mode, you are pitted against another (human!) player. You start out with un-modified bacteria, and you participate in games to unlock more stuff. One thing to remember is that tactics that worked on single-player may totally shaft you! For instance, all genes now have postives and negatives, and you may only use three at once! For plague types, there are currently three- your starter Bacteria, which has losts its ability; and two others unlocked at five victories: Virus and Bioweapon. The gameplay itself is fairly simple- upon starting, everyone is given a short amount of time to find a country to settle down in. You may NOT both start in the same country! The starter phase is hide and seek. Depending on what country you started in, you start with different amounts of DNA. You also continue to get DNA bubbles... until you starting location has been found out. The other team then gets a boost in DNA. Note: Being a high-profile disease tends to work poorly in concealing your starting point. It is hard to see the other disease's locations at first.For abilities and perks, they switched it around A LOT. Your stardard Air and Water traveling transmisisons are now teamed up with Dust (Arid) and Sweat (Humid). For symptoms, the previous symptoms are joined by 2 orange ones. These will unlock a tree that will either make the enemy plague's carriers easier to infect, or protect your own. Both are useful. Abilities has a serious overhaul. There is an ability that lets you fly planes to uninfected countries (like Trojan planes!), an ability that focuses cure research on your opponent in that area, and a buff that increases lethality and infectivity for BOTH diseases. All in all, I would give the multiplayer an 8/10. It's not perfect, but it is extremely promising! I will look forward to Co-Op mode in the future!			"

								Note: It's Early Access for now, but I'm pretty sure the basics of the game aren't going to change dramatically between now and release.Remember a flash game by the name of Pandemic 2? (Some of you will probably recall cursing Madagascar for ruining your runs on it. Yeah. That one.) PIE is similar (in fact, I suspect its ""casual"" difficulty setting is based on that game), but a more well-researched and broad title. You start with nothing but bacteria as your plague of choice, but victories will unlock gene modifiers (for starting boosts) and new types of medium. That last chunk is where the craziness comes in: sure, viruses basically play like a more mutatable bacteria, but then you begin unlocking the real weird ones, like a fungus (such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to spread...), or mind-altering worms (suddenly, the goal can go from ""kill the world"" to ""enslave every living thing""), or nanobots trying to thwart their kill-switch... the list goes on, more are still being added, and each plays distinct from the others while keeping the basics of the game, so what you learn with one can carry over to the others.If you worry it's just going to be a pushover, play with the varying difficulty settings or some of the mutator genes you get for victories. Figure out what types of symptoms combine to make you more effective, or take on the double-edged sword of being incredibly mutation-happy. All of a sudden, your disease isn't communicable ENOUGH, and your hosts are dying before infecting others...I really dig this, but you've gotta keep in mind, this is a dark game. It's a frighteningly-realistic simulator of ending the friggin world with disease (or worse). Victory is literally a mass extinction in most scenarios. I would absolutely NOT recommend this for everyone just based on that.			"

There are different levels of difficulty that give you a chance to get use to the mechanics and while there are still some issues like crashes (never in the middle of a game thus far, but sifting through options while running a dozen other programs), save files either hidden or acting a little funky (usually never need them personally) this game as it is right now is well worth the full price!There is a slightly mildly steep learning curve but with the basics understood you'll find it obvious where you were getting it wrong. I really hope to see more cause it's another game that leaves you wanting more when all is said and done but has great replayability. A must buy imho.			"

												Very, very good game with lots of strategic depth. With the addition of custom scenarios and free scenario creator, there's always something new to do, even after you've beaten the main campaign (Which is absurdly difficult once you start getting to Brutal difficulty). Haven't spent much time in the multiplayer modes yet, but overall, the premise of biological warfare/disease in general has always really intrigued me. So if you're looking for a semi-realistic plague simulator that lets you ravage a variety of diseases across the face of the Earth, killing everything they touch, this game is for you. Also, please release an OST; the music is very eerie and I mean that in the best way possible. Oveall: 9.5/10.			"

												My personal study of Plague Inc: Evolved, a game in which you can destroy or conquer the world, as you like, with the deadliest (and funniest) diseases and pathogens you can think of !Pros:- Game developers keep adding official diseases, including the Simian Flu from the ""Planet of the Apes"" movie, Vampire and Zombie plagues, as well as more basic pathogens.- With the amazing Scenario Creator tool, you will never lack for new game experiences, and you can make up your own ! The Plague Inc. Workshop is filled with amazing addons.- The game design is incredibly realistic and well-made. Game graphisms have simply beautiful.- You can watch your disease reach every corner of the world, and even zoom on what its precise effects are on the infected victims ! You also have access to statistics showing you all there is to know about your plague and how humanity reacts, on a worldwide or a country's scale.- Since Multiplayer was added (thank you so much...), you can team up with or fight another player's plague to eradicate humanity.And so much more to say...Cons: I played so much my diseases infected me... Hope I haven't caught Ebola *cough cough*In short, a simply awesome game ! Even the CDC was impressed :)My counsel: buy it, infect, evolve... and as the developers say with each update, stay healthy ! (pretty hard to do once you start playing *cough cough*)			"

								I would definitely recommend this game.  I put in about 30 mins in the morning to get all the normal levels completed (21 hours total) and I really enjoyed the aspect of destroying the human race, (morbid, yes), but also give you an idea of how it can actually happen in real life.  Some say the price is kinda high and I would say, yes/no, yes the price is high, but for the play-ability of the game, I think it is just fine, but I did wait for the summer sales to actually purchased it.  If you like a challenge and looking for a game that may make you think about how to plan an plague attack on the human race, then this is a game for you.  I wanted to add that I did not experience any bugs in the games, or I did not notice any.			"

								I played this game on my phone and I really liked it. I saw it's on the PC now so I had to buy this game. And I'm really glad I did. This is the full game, it has much more facilities and the graphics are really good. What I think is really good about this game is that you have to play very strategically. If you evolve too fast people will die too quickly, but if you evolve to slow the cure will be finished before you've killed everyone. It looks like a simple game, but it's definitely not! The extra content with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is also really great! Taking the world over with apes, who doesn’t want to do that?! Playing this content you’re able to use more possibilities with evolving. The apes can use abilities to take down research labs and more. It’s a really great game, especially for this price!   "

								This game is really addictive, in a good way!Considering the concept is so simple, there are so many different ways to play to try and succeed.  I've been through everthing that's available so far on brutal difficulty and it does serve as a decent challenge keeping you gripped.  Depending on your disease as well completely changes the gameplay aspect, so it doesn't feel repetitive.I guess the only thing that will put people off is there isn't much to watch per-say, however there isn't anything quite as satisfying as seeing your disease spread across the world and infect everyone.I'm looking forward to the multiplayer aspects coming in as well, be interesting to see how those pan out!  There are plans to add in the necroa virus for zombies as well - hope more pathogen types come in too to add to the varities of play methods already available!			"

Anyway, the game is still in alpha and still needs to add the last or more virusses which one of them is the Necroa Virus which makes zombies, fricking zombies am i right!? Also, look out! When the disease is spotted you have to be on your toes, cause if you make it worse, they will start to try and make a cure, if the cure is 100% you have a 0,001% chance, to use DNA points and try to get a symptom like organ failure and stop it to like 94%.

								I played the Ye Oldie Pandemic 1 & 2 and i liked those games. This game is a more advanced version of them games. And so far... It's not half bad for what it has in it ATM. Although im not gonna touch muliplayer idk why i just wanna play by myself you know. Anyways this game has 9 Different Disease Types to play around with. BUT you have to unlock them :/ That...Thats kinda lame but i get it, i so pose (rolls eyes). The first Bug you get to work with is the Bacteria. And on normal difficulty its... Easy to infect the world but it's also kinda hard to kill them all and i like that :) on my third playthough i ALMOST killed the earth But Them Danmded Icelanders survived to rule the world with just 1000 or so peeps >:/ and you CAN actually infect Madagascar CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? :D Holy geeze i almost fell out of my chair when i did that (not really thoe) But anyways. The one and only reason i bought this game is because of the ZOMBIES >:D YEEEEAH i wanna play the Zombies but alas they are 3 levels away :( but Danmit im gonna do it Just for them Zombies man i tell ya what :D its worth it just for the Zombies (for me anyways) But yeah this game is suprisingly challenging But fun even on Normal difficulty (thats just me don't hate me cuz i play on normal :l ) It's a good game a TINY bit, Just a WEEE Bit to expensive if yer the penny or... Nickel pincher type person but if not its worth every... erm.. Dime i guess .. yeah :D			"

Its got a spooky soundrack that is VERY simmallar (problaby identical) to the mobile (which I also loved). And is worth every penny. It takes mabye.... 8-10 mins to install. Along with the custom Scenario Creator where you can make custom Scenarios and/or Plagues You Can Edit Effects or make your own. Its a small bit over priced but Is still very fun to this day. Make a plague that kills more than the black death. Why not? Start a Zombie Apocolypse? Sure! The game has Unlimited Potential. (Almost since Bio-Weapon is Very Deadly) There is updates coming out with new Country pictures, And a challenge every once and a while. Its Much better than the Mobile... Problaby.10/10			"

												This game is unlike any other I've played. I recommend it if you like strategy games and want to challenge yourself. It's brutal-especially on the difficulties of the same name haha. This game is about creating and mutating various plagues to wipe out mankind. You might not think it, but this is actually a great game to play with a group of friends. It's perversely satisfying when you and a group of friends get together and simulate various ways to wipe out humanity-whether it be with an ancient brain controlling worm, a prion, a mechanical bioweapon, a simple virus or bacteria. They even added more plagues than that which is a large part of why I love this game so much. It would have been great as it was, but they weren't satisfied and added a vampiric plague that allows you to create vampires and enslave humanity, or you could wipe out the world with a zombie apocalypse, and they added a Planet of the Apes type plague that allowed you to mess around with the idea of using sentient apes to destroy humanity. The amount of thought and depth they put into each of those three new plagues impresses me and is the main reason I will always come back to play this. It's a great game whether you're looking to just kill a couple hours, or trying to game all week. There are a bunch of scenarios that let you play out various situations either made up or from history to keep you interested if you get bored of the main game. Scenarios like the black plague, or an infectious happiness disease. This game even has multiplayer so you can play online with your friends or other people. I haven't tried it out yet, but I know it has both co-op and competitive modes for whether you want to work with or crush others online. I also like that it rewards you for completing games by unlocking additional genes to implant in your plagues to help give them a boost (help them spread faster) in certain environments or help them remain unseen for longer. These are essential if you're going to try and beat any of the plagues on their highest difficulties. Seriously-this game is beautifully difficult. The genes aren't necessary for normal gameplay, but they do make it easier and more fun to try to more manually direct how your plague spreads at first. For example: I like starting out in Saudi Arabia or India. They're both arid, hot climates and I often give my plague a gene boost in arid climates and a boost to spreading by land because they are both connected to a ton of landmass and arid climates. However, I could also have chosen genes that gave my plague a boost in cold and/or humid climates to help my plague spread once it leaves it's starting environment. Since all your plagues get a slight bonus to the environment type they start in (makes sense, right?) it might be more beneficial to me to plan ahead and help my plague out in climates that it normally would be fairly ineffective in.All in all, if you like a good strategy game and the idea of wiping out humanity in any way appeals to you-I recommend trying this game out. It's worth your time and money whether it's on sale or full price.			"

								Plague Inc: Evolved is a game about a topic very near and dear to my heart: Big Pharma.In Plagues Incorporated: Evolutions, you play an intrepid reporter looking to expose the lies of Big Pharma; you slowly uncover things like AIDS being created by the CIA and the flu vaccine actually causing autism. But, at every turn, you are persued by Big Pharma who work to discredit your work.Like I said, I really enjoy Plaguez, LLC: Devolved because it covers a topic not many games do, and one that I have a personal stake in. You see, Big Pharma has set up a campaign to harass and discredit me at every turn; its gotten to the point where I can't even go outside without fear of someone shooting me with a tranq dart. I'm so glad that a popular game is finally increasing awareness of this important issue!WAKE UP SHEEPLE/10			"

												I lobve the games single player. Very interesting premise. Kill the planet as a bacteria, virus, parasite etc. My favourite single player game is bio weapon.And recently Multiplayer was added. Both vs of 2 diseases fighting to infect everyone and co-op 2 diseases trying to kil humanity together. This used to be a fun multiplayer. Used to be. Now? Its a frustrating chore for Multiplayer. Everyone looks at the guide and does the exact same stuff, upp symptoms, use airplane special abb to move your disease to china, india, south Africa and Brazil to infect most people. College Humour did a comic animated short of 7 deadly sins of gaming. And guess which one this game is currently taking up? No go on watch the 7 deadly sins and get back to me.If you want a fun experience going againt the computer player on sing player go for it very fun, interesting scenarios it shoves in there. Stay away from multiplayer. Its like playing C&C where everyone builds super weapons and spams away. This game everyone gets airplane special and spams away. Frustrating chore.			"

								This game contains very few fancy pictures, models and sound effects. Instead, there are lots of numbers, trends, explicit and implicit parameters that have dramatic impact on gameplay. You will have to try it more than once to achieve understanding of how things flow in here.But when you do that, it is experience nothing can compare with. Learning to act like disease, at some point you start feeling like disease and thinking like disease. It is a bit horrifying, but it is certainly exciting.Dynamic, interesting, complex. Recommended for everyone who likes new experience and is not afraid of using brain while playing games, not relaxing it.			"

								After 120 hours on the meter, I could say that this game offers a crazy amount of challenge even though it is supposed to be a casual game. Or is it? Maybe looks can deceive. First game I played when the game was on the fourth update on early access. They are adding features faster than I can learn to master them. If you think 40 hours of gameplay is worth 30-40 euros, then think how much worth of fun, and funny disappointments will you get for 13 euros. Few headlines:Gameplay - You work on three views. The main view is the whole planet, where you can zoom, and scroll, and so on. And you have to click points. Like in  Farmville, except the potatoes are human souls that you are about vanquish.Music - Eerie. Gives my nightmares. Or maybe it is just filling enough for the mindset about to destroy the best and the worst of humankind. Graphics - In progress. They are improving it all the time, and it fits the glove already. Educational/Morals - Well. Heh. You are taking the role of a god, and pick on the dominant species on planet Earth. You still have a very good excuse: They started it first. And it might have some hidden educational value as well. About how diseases spread, how everything is interconnected, blaah blaah. Go kill the humanity.Definitely 5/5.			"

								well, I like the game, however I think it's a bit too hard even on casual and normal, there aren't always enought dna points available to accomplish world domination. this game should actually ""start small"" in a more specific way. When you choose your starting nation, you should be able to manipulate how the plague affects the local area before attempting to expand. ALso detection of the plague should depend on what it does. For example a plague that only causes insomnia and anemia at first could simply be mistaken for a bad diet and no firther research would go into it for a time. By contrast a plague that immediately attacks the lungs and gastrointestional cycle will be noticed much faster. These dynamics should factor into gameplay. I have a huge problem with how plague cure prevention is set up. popping bottles doesnt seem to slow the cure progress in any significant manor, once a bottle is burst it should reduce plague cure by an increasing percent, depending on how aggressive the virus is against curability. This reminds me of another issue in the game. I have set up a plague that should have been beyond any curability factor and low priofile, however even though there were no obvious deadly effects of the plague once I added lethal affects to eradicatre humanity, miraculously some type of research on the cure began and exponentially increase even though almost the entire world was dead, I can only say there are dynamics in this game that genuinly frutrate the most strategic plague setter.

								I heard Plague Inc was moving from iOS to PC and sharpened my pitchfork. So tired of Steam being so cluttered with expensive mobile ports that make it hard to find actual games among them. Then I read the positive reviews, here. Put it in the back of my mind. Fine, maybe it's decent -- but I'm not paying full price for this. Maybe when it drops to five bucks for awhile, I'll try.Something spurred me to make the impulsive move to eventually buy the game, anyway. And I played it. And . . . it was good. It was really good. Not perfect and lots of room for more compelling and complex additions, but . . . a really solid improvement over the old flash game or the iOS game. This is the way you need to think about making a port to PC. This is the attention and consideration that should be paid.If you haven't played this type of game before, go check out the mobile version. If you like that, you're likely to enjoy this a lot, too. If you couldn't stand that, the PC version might not be for you. In other words, if you liked the original, this is more of that - and better.Overall, $15 might still be a little pricey for this type of game. I think $10 would be ideal. It shouldn't be a deal breaker, though; if nothing else, put this on your list and come back to it when it's a little cheaper, if you are hesitant.			"

								If you like strategy games and destroying the world then this game is for you. It also updates frequently which is pretty cool. I would give this game a 7/10 and I think that is a fair score. All of the viruses and other microbs are unique. Some are hard while others are easy. They also have unique scenarios that you can play which are difficult. The downside to this game is that it gets repetetive. If you do not have the willpower to keep trying again after failing 4 times then this game is not for you. You can cheat and look up guides to kill the world. Also this game is time consuming and if you don't pay attention you can miss valuable resources.			"

								I usually dispise early access games, after purchasing a few dozen of them, I know failures when I see them. Plague is a very simple type of game wth very complex mechanics, Easy to learn, yet challenging. I'll start with the pro's then move to the cons.-PRO'S-Variety of pathogens to choose from-Each pathogen has its on quirks and methods of killing-Each pathogen requires you to take a different approach to transmition-The BGM tends to draw out your inner bio terrorist and really allows you to immerse yourself into the game-The many adaptations and genes to each pathogen add more replayability to the game.-As far as I can tell, There are no bugs (Atleast for me)-the game can be either fast pace or slow depending on your playstyle.-Devs so far seem to be activeCONS- there is a part where you will need to grind early on pathogens to achieve genes to assist you with some of the pathogens that cannot be transmitted as fast on a large scale. (This is very minor)-Games like this struggle with replayability, though this game trys its best to conquer that, after 12 hours of playing it can be a little repetitive. While every scenario and every game prevents different challenges, you find yourself trying to conquer the same feats (Transmitting your virus to the same island countries...Damn you greenland)SUMMERY-While Plague is still early access, the content is def there, the game is very enjoyable and coming from a major in patho and microbiology the simulation is very accurate to what you could expect in real life scenarios. $15 is a well worth it. My hats off to the devs, I apologize for my grammer, punctuation, run ons, spelling and blah blah blah.. its 6am and I have been spreading aids for the last 12 hours. and on that note... I have had more enjoyment playing plague then I have any other early access game. I def reccommend this game to everyone. I hope to see you spreading aids soon XD			"

This is accomplished by upgrading your disease, whether it be bacteria, a virus, or something else, to increase it's infectivity, severity, and lethality so you can infect & kill more and more people.Anyway, overall I like this game. There's  a lot of different things in the game that you can do to have a unique and fun experience like different forms of a disease you can choose from (bacteria, virus, etc.), different difficulties (casual, brutal, etc.) and other ways of creating a unique experience. You can even take over the world with apes! The game is strategic and can be very challenging. However, that's the fun of it, especially when you can name your disease a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ meme & have the end message of ""xd has eradicated all life on Earth"" or something like that.But anyway, definetly reccomend trying out this game for anyone considering to do so. Challenging, fun, and rewarding. Great game if your into strategy games & destroying the world.			"

								I bought this game a while back, and since then many new features have come out. Many of you will probably be thinking, 'Oh, this game costs £11 but on the phone is only costs £2!' The price point of this game is a bit steep, so buy it on sale, it regualy goes down to £8. I myself have the phone version, but the interface and the mass of scenarios makes it worth the money. Also, theres no ads! Yes this game is still in very early access, as many of the features like multiplayer are unavailable. However, the different plague types and the scenarios will keep you going for a while, and even if you complete them you can create your own plague of download one off the community workshop. Overall, I would give this game a 9/10, and this game should be amazing when fully complete.			"

								I've always enjoyed booting up Pandemic II from time to time, and I'm really happy with how much Plague Inc improved on the experience! The upgrades you choose for your disease have intuitive effects and matter a lot with how well (and where) the disease survives and spreads. You can't help but develop an evil grin when you see [insert funny disease name] finally start to balloon across nations.It's a great game for killing time now and then, multitasking with your other activites, and slightly freaking people out when they ask you what you're doing.

								If you like strategy games and destroying the world then this game is for you. It also updates frequently which is pretty cool. I would give this game a 7/10 and I think that is a fair score. All of the viruses and other microbs are unique. Some are hard while others are easy. They also have unique scenarios that you can play which are difficult. The downside to this game is that it gets repetetive. If you do not have the willpower to keep trying again after failing 4 times then this game is not for you. You can cheat and look up guides to kill the world. Also this game is time consuming and if you don't pay attention you can miss valuable resources.			"

								I usually dispise early access games, after purchasing a few dozen of them, I know failures when I see them. Plague is a very simple type of game wth very complex mechanics, Easy to learn, yet challenging. I'll start with the pro's then move to the cons.-PRO'S-Variety of pathogens to choose from-Each pathogen has its on quirks and methods of killing-Each pathogen requires you to take a different approach to transmition-The BGM tends to draw out your inner bio terrorist and really allows you to immerse yourself into the game-The many adaptations and genes to each pathogen add more replayability to the game.-As far as I can tell, There are no bugs (Atleast for me)-the game can be either fast pace or slow depending on your playstyle.-Devs so far seem to be activeCONS- there is a part where you will need to grind early on pathogens to achieve genes to assist you with some of the pathogens that cannot be transmitted as fast on a large scale. (This is very minor)-Games like this struggle with replayability, though this game trys its best to conquer that, after 12 hours of playing it can be a little repetitive. While every scenario and every game prevents different challenges, you find yourself trying to conquer the same feats (Transmitting your virus to the same island countries...Damn you greenland)SUMMERY-While Plague is still early access, the content is def there, the game is very enjoyable and coming from a major in patho and microbiology the simulation is very accurate to what you could expect in real life scenarios. $15 is a well worth it. My hats off to the devs, I apologize for my grammer, punctuation, run ons, spelling and blah blah blah.. its 6am and I have been spreading aids for the last 12 hours. and on that note... I have had more enjoyment playing plague then I have any other early access game. I def reccommend this game to everyone. I hope to see you spreading aids soon XD			"

								Virus strategy games are making leaps and bounds. I was really looking forward to such games to come to the Steam Market.For years now I've been playing a little flash game called ""Pandemic"", of which this is like the parent of. This game is absolutely great. It's difficult to beat, really makes you think and it does hold your hand a little, but scoots you on your merry way.Pandemic was a simple interface. You clicked maybe three or four buttons. Start in random counties. Told you when all borders were closed or all flights are gone. Check boxes for symptoms and infectivity. Still let me enjoy killing time.Pandemic 2 was more difficult. You had to watch a video tutorial to understand more about this game. For a flash game, bringing in a more RTS feel to it was alright. At the time it puzzled me and made me turn my nose, heading back for the first game.However, this is about Plague Inc.Only a few hours in and the fun and frustration is flooding back to me. You can say a hearty ""F*&# you, Madagascar, I'm going to infect you, first!"" But when you're initially going to infect them, you notice little icons above their information. The fact that they've incoorperated statuses like Wealth, Humidity, Hot or Cold gives a major challange. Finding places that are less rural and more densely populated is great for growing viruses. You have to take more into account when you're trying to spread your nasty plague upon the world.My advice? Do buy this game. Help the developers become a pandemic (Hehe) upon this market.It is definitely worth the $15.00 and the tasty demo on Android really got me into this. "

								Not bad for alpha stage. Feels good to be able to destroy humanity :P The start menu seems promising; there are official scenarios, custom scenarios and even multiplayer. Not accesible at this stage. The options are kind of limited as to how you evolve your pathogen but again it's alpha. You unlock new pathogens everytime you successfully kill everyone and it gets harder to spread the new one. Right now there are 12 pathogens 2 of them not available and i'm stuck at the third one :D You can mutate your pathogen which is really cool. You can make it resistant to weather conditions, difficult to cure. You can choose how it will spread. Sometimes there are random mutations which might get annoying because you want a sneaky pathogen but the random mutation makes it deadly.I like the difficulty levels. There are 4. 'Casual, Normal, Brutal, Mega Brutal'. Casual is fairly easy no one washes their hands there are no researches to destroy your pathogen. Normal, some people wash their hands some doctors work so they might discover the sickness. Brutal, THEY LOCK SICK PEOPLE IN PRISON :D Mega brutal, is even worse :D I'm currently playing on brutal and stuck on 3rd pathogen because before i spread it to everyone some countries already restrict access :(I recommend it but feel like price is a bit high			"

								Do I have to explain the awesomeness behind the concept?  I had no idea it was a mobile thing before, apparently it was popular itself, this is essentially that with all the DLC stuff included, far as I can tell; its in Early Access still because they're working on multiplayer functionality (which I personally couldn't care less about in a game like this, destroying the world is MY job goddammit), and platform support, but as far as singleplayer on a windows machine goes it runs flawlessly, and there's plenty of content, though I do think they plan to add more with time (easy to monetize with DLC, you bet your♥♥♥♥♥they will ^^ and honestly that's fine because it has Steam Workshop support meaning limitless free content). Its harder than you might expect but that's a good thing, the game is rather simple in terms of gameplay (it does feature advanced math to figure out how fast stuff spreads and people die) and it'd get boring if you didn't have to try different combinations to nail a scenario or the sandbox mode.Also, pay attention to the voice of the guy during the intro video thingie. Some of you (ahem, Half-Life fans) will grin ear to ear ;D			"

								Some games you play to build empires. Others you play to shoot things in the head. This one... you play to exterminate humanity. Fun!Plague Inc: Evolved is a game where you make horrible diseases, spread em around the world, and try to kill everyone before those pesky humans make a cure for your plague. There is strategy involved, but there is some luck too which can be rather frustrating (F***ing Greenland). The game is fun, but also relatively easy to master. Once you figure out how things work, the challenge is mostly gone. Good thing this game has plenty of opportunities for messing around.The variety comes in the form of each different type of plague having different strengths or weaknesses, like viruses mutating alot which can lead to your disease being detected earlier than you would like. Most of the plagues are real, but the imaginary ones allow for some comic situations to arise. The Neurax Worm allows you to mind control people, leading humans to either kill themselves or worship the worm as a god. And, of course, the Necroa Virus, which allows you to unleash the zombie apocalypse rather than fighting it. The game can get a bit repetitive in time, but there is alot of crazy fun to be found as well. So, if you want to play a game where murdering everyone is the objective, then this is one that can possibly satisfy. :)			"

								Plague Inc: Evolved has evolved beyond its roots as a mobile game, and its inspiration, Pandemic 2. Even at $15, it's worth it.For those who have only played Pandemic 2 and are wondering if this is better or merely an inferior ripoff, it's definitely a more comprehensive, fleshed-out, less frustrating, more entertaining game, even if the premise is very similar. All the skills (from avian transmission to projectile vomiting) are useful, and while some strategies are more prevalent than others, there's no be-all-end-all way to win the game like there is in Pandemic 2. I'm ten hours in and I'm still finding new ways to win against the odds.The visuals are vastly improved over the mobile iteration, with red transmission dots forming across the world map as countries fall victim to your plague, 3D renders of your plague hovering in the menus, and image feeds of the cities popping up as they descend from normalcy into chaos. The devs will be adding online multiplayer, Steam Workshop support, and tutorials (amongst other features) in the upcoming weeks/months, but it's more than playable now and I definitely recommend it if you loved Pandemic and want a superior version of it.

								This is a good game when you want to play solo-strategy.I played the first Plague on a tablet app,This second version is just as good with many more choices!The game is based on the facts of biology and infectious disease.To win, you need to kill all of earth's population.There are 3 levels, Casual, Normal and Brutal.The achievements are very creative. The game is challenging.I like to play it because it is real science.A casual game is about 30 mins. Good way to learn,Normal unlocks achievements. It takes about an hour.There are at least 5 bio weaponsbacteria, virus, fungus, neurax wormI'm stuck on fungus at the moment.It's nice to have a game like this when you feel very curious or very bored.Because there is no other sim-game like this one.Yes, it is very creepy but it is darkly humorous too.It's worth the money and even more, it's worth your time and attention.Now, do you want to share recipes for swine flu? or bubonic plague?This is the cookbook for the zombie apocalypse.

								Ok, so what we have here is a early-release game. You can do so much, you can start your own zombie apocolypse, with the zombles bending to your will. Your pathogen can control someones mind, you can create deadly Bio-Weapons like Ebola, and Nano-Virus', Fungi, Bacteria, Virus', and the Neurax Worm. This game is so good, and in a way it can be slightly educational. You can learn the symptoms! Get this game right now! (Or save up for it if you wish) Its early acsess, so the gameplay may not be as  up-to-date as you wish it be. "

												Ninety percent of the games play the same- you infect the world and the plague slowly spreads.  You do not add any symptoms as they cause the plague to be discovered (and quickly cured).  This renders most of the symptoms pointless- as you don't dare use them.  Once everyone in the world is infected (which normally means waiting for greenland which is very cold, and very isolated) you quickly turn the disease lethal - from totally asymptomatic to a heart stopping, system killing death machine.  You then buy the abilities that stop or slow research and watch the world die.The main wrinkle is mutation which will randomly generate symptoms for your disease- there are basically two types of diseases, ones which allow you to cancel those and get resources back, the other that costs resources to cancel.  First type is very easy, second type can randomly screw your run by mutating before its fully spread and starting the cure clock. "

								Cough!,"" Cough!,"" Cough!"",.. 'We're on.""'Having spent but a little more then a few hours on a title still very much in DEV atm., thereby also using the very few early-access features available to one's disposal, I have already come to love the concept and the gameplay as a whole. The wunderbar evil outsetting plotline in-synch with the racing against the timer makes this a thrilling to fun experience with the actually quite-so hard a' goal that of which is the exterminating of all humanity, which one usually comes relatively close to but never quite then reaching such an conclusion. It delivers on a promise and is what I might say; a Russian's coping-test.-:""It's one of those somethings' that you really don't find laying around on the shelfs of your local Gamestop-store.""(Rating: 9.25/11) "

								Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of an intriguing little Simulator-type game called Plague, Inc. Plague, Inc has been around on mobile devices for a while, and on Steam since February 20, 2014. It is still in Early Access, but Publisher/Developer Ndemic Creations is VERY active, having just recently added the highly anticipated Competitive Multiplayer mode.(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)Video Review:

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Great game, good casual way to pass time OR you can ramp up the difficulty and give yourself fits. Highly replayable. Active Devs. Another 4/5 on an incomplete game? Yup. Worth $15 easily.The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:I picked this game up a long time ago on my iPhone and loved it, so when it came to Steam I picked it up about a year ago around Xmas. I stashed it away, awaiting it's release from Early Access. Well, I couldn't wait and the newly updated Multiplayer mode gave me an excuse to review it anyways! Now, I didn't review the MP mode simply because I wanted gamers to get a feel for the actual game itself first. This game is a simulation game where you are trying to spread a disease and essentially wipe out mankind. You get points to evolve your disease in different categories (Transmission, Symptoms, Abilities) to try and help it spread and eradicate humanity. Meanwhile, the world works against you by crafting a cure, shutting down airports/harbors, etc. Pesky humans, you'll find, are quite resiliant. As you play and get better at the game you unlick different types of diseases and starting genomes for your disease. There is a lot here and this is all fun on it's own, but then you incorporate things like Steam Workshop, User Made Scenarios, Multiplayer and the like, and the replayability shoots through the roof. The best part....they aren't even done yet and are obviously very active in the games continued development. Hop on board now, this is not one to miss. 4/5 easily, even in it's incomplete state. There is MORE than enough to play here, nothing game breaking going on, they just keep adding more and more awesome stuff!! Well worth the $15!Happy Gaming!!!			"

								This game is available as an App for phones and pads. Get it for that to play something when you need to kill time. Odds are your on Steam on a laptop or desktop and want to play a real game. This just doesn't cut it. On the phone its great. On here, its the phone app just bigger with some clouds and some added information screens. Certainly not enough of an upgrade to warrent $14.99.  I'm sorry but seriously, fifteen dollars? I have games I paid less than 5 dollars for that are more involved with better gameplay and graphics than this. Again I can't say it enough, on your phone or pad, yeah this is a great game. I loved it, still play around on it when I'm killing time. But here, it's just not enough.  Basically you have a world map, pick a country or area and start. As the game goes, clouds move some, boats and planes move around the map, and you occasionally pop bubbles. Sometimes you will have popped enough bubbles to evolve your disease, this part is just another couple of screens with a skill tree, oh and a simple animation of your disease, that will change as you evolve it, you rather will grow as you evolve it, no matter what you chose the picture will change the same way. Illusion of choice. Just not a very good illusion. My other issue with this game is the fact that when you start you can only play as bacteria, you have to beat the game on normal with bacteria to unlock the virus, and so on and so forth. So if you bought this game thinking about making some nanovirus from the future...yeah your not going to be doing that for a while. Cause you will have to unlock it and to do that you will have to play as certain things in certain styles. There are only a couple of for sure ways to beat the game with each type so instead of having the freedom to play as you want, to unlock everything you'll have to play very paticular ways. Again the illusion of choice.  Now on the bright side of things, this is EA and the game will have features and things added in later. Thats great, I suggest maybe then you wait to buy it till its released. However, I'd take real close look at the screenshots, what you see is pretty much what you get.			"

								So, having played 16 hours of this game so far I should write a review about my experience with it. I'll just start off by saying it's fun. I wouldn't have played 16 hours of it if it wasn't. The basis of Plague Inc, make a plague and try to exterminate humanity (though some plagues allow different endings, with the Neurax worm you can either make them slaves to the parasite or have the parasite tell them to all commit suicide, and with the Necroa virus you can kill off all of humanity with a horde of zombies infected by the virus, there are also different endings with other plagues in the official scenarios, one of which reverts humanity back to neanderthals). Evolving your plague and watching it's influence on the ingame world is interesting, you can slowly make the pathogen more severe and kill off the world in a very drawn out fashion or you can hide your plague, wait until everybody is infected and evolve it to be extremely lethal and watch society go from modern day to human extinction in a week. The news ticker on the top of the in game interface will reflect the state of the world and you will notice the ticker change as your plague changes, it's one thing that I like about the game, though eventually you will get to the point where you've seen it all as events usually happen multiple times throughout multiple playthroughs. I have a few gripes about the game, one of which is that you can use one tactic to pass a good amount of the plagues almost 100% of the time regardless of how difficult it is, but for the ones you can't use this tactic on I will note that Mega-Brutal difficulty is really.. really.. Brutal. As it should be, I've yet to pass some plagues after trying them repeatedly with different tactics on the difficulty, and I like that. Eventually I'll find the right combination at the right time, though thats not to say there is only one combination set for every plague, you can try many things, but generally there will be a few tactics that are both fast and efficient that should be used. To those who have played the game on the phone, you won't be seeing much new here other than a prettier interface and 3d graphics. Though there will be more content later down the line, right now the phone and PC version of the game are pretty much identical. In the end, is the game worth 15 dollars? Yes, though the game doesn't have a significant amount of replayability after you beat a plague on mega brutal with 5 stars, getting to that point took me over 10 hours, and even then I'm not completely done with all plagues, so the journey up to that point is a long but enjoyable one. There is promise for custom scenario support and mutliplayer in the future, which will hopefully make the game even better. tl;dr: The game is fun, and can be extremely difficult at tougher difficulties, the future updates promised look good and I don't regret paying for the game while in early access.

												Two years later, with the addition of the ""Planet Of The Apes"" virus and the Shadow Plague, I still recommend this game, both in PC and mobile versions.Shadow Plague is interesting, and proving to be a challenge for me.  I was skeptical at first that a vampire plague would feel too far on the side of fantasy for this game.  To the contrary, even the pure fantasy aspects of the new plague (like shadow portals) are modeled to obey the real world's rules.I think it's worth more than the $15 they want for it.------------------------------------------------------I've played this on my android tablet (Galaxy Tab 3).  Both versions are fast-paced fun, but this PC version is better.  Gameplay is basically the same, which is lots of fun, but the PC version takes advantage of the larger monitor real-estate.			"

								So i got this game maybe a few months back and its definitly fun. I love simulators even if they're not always as realistic as they're meant to be. So the game has variety good gameplay no bugs that ive noticed so far. Tons of options and the game is challenging, cause in my opinion you never want a really easy game cause then whats the point of playing. So the game has its strategic diffuculties and it does have its realistic atributes they have the pathegons down and just the stuff in it theres so much stuff along with Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes. And the thing is after i play games stuff always happens in real life. So after i play any game stuff that happens in the game comes out into real life. Like i got sick constantly when playing and i fricken got paranoid and washed my fricken hands off. Then abola and other diseases spring up after i start playing. Coincidences god.

								Do you like feeling like a supervillain? Do you like strategy? Newsticker jokes about banning laughter and Canada annexing Alaska? What about terrible things happening to the human body, all for your amusement? If you answered yes to any of the above, this game may be for you. On a more serious note it's a pretty seriously engaging strategy game that balances actually having to think and plan ahead without being so labyrinthine and convoluted to navigate that it stops being fun. The interface is pretty, but might benefit from some streamlining as actually using it takes some practice (though it's perfectly fine once you do get used to it). The sound direction is also very nice.			"

Early Access Review
								After playing the iOS version of Plague Inc. I was slightly skeptical if a PC version could actually be any different and more enjoyable. Currently, it's holding up better than its iOS version and the regular updated with fresh content keeps me regularly coming back to try them out. Apart from that though the replayabiltiy seems to lose its appeal after you've completed each plague a couple of times ( unless you really care about completing each disease on the hardest difficulty ).Sadly the scenario mode doesn't really offer much difference from playing as a regular plague, albeit with a few preset evolutions and different human interaction. The real stand out features are the Neurax Worm and Necroa Virus, both of which work very differently to the regular plagues. Whereas each disease follows a similar concept, evolve symptoms and transmission until you've infected most the world, then start killing people. The Neurax Worm & Necroa Virus offer different methods of completion, taking control of humanity through the Worm, or driving the human race to extinction through zombies with the Necroa.The Simian flu is essentially an altered version of the Necroa virus created as a tie in for the Planet of the Apes move, I don't have a problem with it, and its definitely a nice addition, but it all feels a bit too familiar after you've turned everyone in to a flesh eating zombie a few times over.Overall the game is definitely worth purchasing, even while its in early access, although you might find yourself a bit bored as you approach the 30 hour mark, the frequent updates will keep you regularly coming back to try out new features and try your hand at the scenarios again. 8/10+Regularly updated, simplistic design, cool plagues, Zombies- Gets boring after 24 hours or so, scenarios are a bit basic.

								i really like this game its fun and addictive, it easily absorbed hours of my day, i find the fungus and neurox worm too be a tad easy but still are my favourites, they both have the best control over the plague and makes you feel as if you have more control over it than the rest of the plagues, i do recomend this game however i do have a few nit picks on the game which i will say soon, but first its shining areasGOOD AREAS:1: the map, we all know its hard too put a 3d round object with alot of detail upon a flat surface but the makers in this game in my opinion did well on it, the water and cloud movements added some more immersion it it, so it feels as if oyur looking down upon the earth as your plague spreads. i also like how the plague spreading looked however i will get on that in a sec2: the news, i really liked the funny easter eggs in them,  plus it makes you have a sense of progress during the game with how the news talked about you3: plagues, the variety of plagues is really good but i find the differences lacking and the changes in form, how it spreads across the map is really cool it feels as if the country is festering with the plague, and the whole name your own plague bit is awesome4:traits, i loved how the traits where making the game more interesting upon fast yoiu racked up DNA, transmission symptons and abilities where a hoot too mix and match5:the models and body scales, i thought it was neat on how you could see how your plague was moving threw the human body inside of the plague menu, and the models of the plagues looked spectacular, however6:simulation, this game is a great plague simulator and is a good gameBAD AREAS:1: the models, i know i just praised them but in truth when you add traits too the plague there is only little differences, mostly there are just more and more in the background of the plague, and in the human anatomy area there is very little change but still a nice touch too see how you infect. there is one exception and that is the neurox worm plague you can see it grow on the brain and the tendrils move threw the brain, what i would do is make the other plagues gradually change in appearence threw time. like make the bacteria  grow long or bigger add its own little strings coming of too make it seem more infectous , but again this is just my  opinion im not a critic2:difficulty, if you have a structered strategy the game feels too easy its only really difficult on the first time playing a plague type, my suggestion add a few minor curve balls like them making a nano cirus too counter act against you and you have too make your plague more lethal too beat the nano virus, just and idea it could be horrible one just saying3: street view, in it you get the ability too make a street view you only get still frames and what you can see is a bit disapointing there isnt much in them, my suggestion make them change more often too other ones like showing the people infected walking around or the healthy wearing doctors masks. just a suggestion this isnt a game breaking thing...unlike the next one4: the curser, i dont know if anyone else has had this problem but my curser sometimes doesnt work or doesnt click the rihgt one, how? for examply i had too click four times on a ability ounce just too highlight it, it gets annoying especially when you buy one and arent paying attention and go too buy another and you accidently de-evolve the trait you just got, i was playing nano virus and had nearly killed humanity and went too buy organ failure aaaand i sold coma and got 2 DNA points back and didnt have enough too buy coma back and organ failure5:news, even with how the news makes you feel acomplished, it still repeats it self and has little variety thats just minor though6: the cure, dont get me wrong i love how it works but if you up transmission and the medical resistance tree it just doesnt even matter, half of the time when i upped the med tree so much i forgot about the cure and destroid humanity with it 40% doneeven with all that ive said this game is a wonderful game and i recomend it too any who want too just kill time, its fun some times funny and with the game in early access the game has alot of bugs but there minor and you can just have fun with it. so i recomend this game			"

								Plague Inc EVOLVED is a game you normally dont see on the Steam store. It is unique , fun and most importantly challenging and it makes you think , Should I evolve my diease further to affect a infected person more? Or should I make more ways of transferring it to people so more people get infected? ORRR.... Toughen up my diease so it is harder to cure in some states and possibly around the world?This game lets you play your own difficulty , name your own diease , lets you pick your type of diease , and many other things I can't list right now , WARNING: This game is in early access there are features that havent been added yet , such as multiplayer for the most part and other things. This game does have a workshop where you can easily run and make your own dieases to share to others. Enjoy the game , however I think the price is a teeny tiny bit pricy for what we got right now			"

But I decided to buy it and I haven't regreted it. The UE looks advanced and high-tech but it is simple. The game is just like Pac-man, easy to learn but hard to master.

								If you ever wanted to kill the world with...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Well then this is the game for you. Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death. Or you could do it the ""passive"" way and enslave them with a mind controlling worm, which is personally my favorite plague. Or if you're one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it's so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus. For those who own the mobile version, this is not some kind of scam. You notice that they put a lot of effort into the game and it even includes new things that the mobile version doesn't have.

In it's current state there is still a lot to do and very enjoyable with tons of strategy planning and decision making that makes you pause the game and go through your options. My favorite part of the game is that there is a variety of diseases that all do different things, including a cheat one that gives you access to unlimited resources to evolve your disease as fast or as slow as possible. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes the idea of spreading a disease named whatever you want and seeing if you can infect the entirety of the world and ultimately kill 7 Billion people. It's a game that allows you to play the bad guy which is awesome.Pros: Music, humor, interface, graphical style, decision making.Cons: Still in Alpha with a lot of features not yet implemented.Overall: 9/10 would buy again and will continue to play			"

Which should be interesting :) But it is challenging as I said, you have to have a good strategy, I personally haven't managed to kill the whole world yet but I want to, you start off with only a Bacteria and then you have to win a game to unlock another type of disease. Anyway, I recommend this game, as an early access I give this game 4.5 Bacterias out of 5 :)			"

								Ever secretly wished you worked for Umbrella Corporation, spreading despair and disease one bioweapon at a time? Well now you get to live out that sick fantasy, like a true Albert Wesker-in-training! Plague Inc. is rather morbid in its conception, but the gameplay is so fun you often forget that you're in control of ending the world itself. The disease types and modifications are varied and interesting, from a simple parasite to a virus responsible for turning people into zombies-- making for differing challenges each time. It requires a good deal of patience and strategy to make it through. I love the attention to detail in this game, it adds to the realism. The graphics are simple but effective:  Slowing watching a map of the entire earth as it goes from green (healthy), to red (infected), all the way to a grim black (death) is strangely satisfying.

								If you ever wanted to kill the world with...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Well then this is the game for you. Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death. Or you could do it the ""passive"" way and enslave them with a mind controlling worm, which is personally my favorite plague. Or if you're one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it's so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus. For those who own the mobile version, this is not some kind of scam. You notice that they put a lot of effort into the game and it even includes new things that the mobile version doesn't have. Thanks for reading and sorry for these ""spoilers."" Have a good day or night, or at whatever time you're reading this.			"

								I have this weird thing for diseases the way most people have a thing for car accidents and this game feeds my addiction. On that note, I love it, the whole 'real world' scenario is fantastic (despite the fact that I love starting all the chaos in India-- crowded spaces = swiftly moving death plague) and I would recommend this game for everyone (if they like playing God...) I would like to add that it's a damn good thing I never went into science because I am fairly certain I'd have destroyed us all by now.			"

								So, having played 16 hours of this game so far I should write a review about my experience with it. I'll just start off by saying it's fun. I wouldn't have played 16 hours of it if it wasn't. The basis of Plague Inc, make a plague and try to exterminate humanity (though some plagues allow different endings, with the Neurax worm you can either make them slaves to the parasite or have the parasite tell them to all commit suicide, and with the Necroa virus you can kill off all of humanity with a horde of zombies infected by the virus, there are also different endings with other plagues in the official scenarios, one of which reverts humanity back to neanderthals). Evolving your plague and watching it's influence on the ingame world is interesting, you can slowly make the pathogen more severe and kill off the world in a very drawn out fashion or you can hide your plague, wait until everybody is infected and evolve it to be extremely lethal and watch society go from modern day to human extinction in a week. The news ticker on the top of the in game interface will reflect the state of the world and you will notice the ticker change as your plague changes, it's one thing that I like about the game, though eventually you will get to the point where you've seen it all as events usually happen multiple times throughout multiple playthroughs. I have a few gripes about the game, one of which is that you can use one tactic to pass a good amount of the plagues almost 100% of the time regardless of how difficult it is, but for the ones you can't use this tactic on I will note that Mega-Brutal difficulty is really.. really.. Brutal. As it should be, I've yet to pass some plagues after trying them repeatedly with different tactics on the difficulty, and I like that. Eventually I'll find the right combination at the right time, though thats not to say there is only one combination set for every plague, you can try many things, but generally there will be a few tactics that are both fast and efficient that should be used. To those who have played the game on the phone, you won't be seeing much new here other than a prettier interface and 3d graphics. Though there will be more content later down the line, right now the phone and PC version of the game are pretty much identical. In the end, is the game worth 15 dollars? Yes, though the game doesn't have a significant amount of replayability after you beat a plague on mega brutal with 5 stars, getting to that point took me over 10 hours, and even then I'm not completely done with all plagues, so the journey up to that point is a long but enjoyable one. There is promise for custom scenario support and mutliplayer in the future, which will hopefully make the game even better. tl;dr: The game is fun, and can be extremely difficult at tougher difficulties, the future updates promised look good and I don't regret paying for the game while in early access.

								I've been a old supporter of the game ever since the game came out on iOS, and as an Early Release to the game, I can see that NDEMIC Creations have done a brilliant job of creating the game!Firstly the whole game looks so much better compare to the iOS version, giving details about the world, more indepth detail on the viruses and lastly, the polished graphics given to the game. Virus Combos, Brilliantly constructed Music and insanely addictive for the Early AccessHowever there are some frequent Frame Delay on some PCs using Medium-High DX10.1/DX11 or a Intel Ivy Bridge CPU's. I would like to see a Lower Quality Option or the option to swap to 3D to 2D graphics for those who would love to run the game on an Older/Weaker Systems. I would love to see Steam Workshop support to see what other viruses people could create and a Multiplayer mode for Virus (To Kill) vs Humans (To Cure).Would Definitely Recommend for everyone!9.5/10+Unlimited Virus Strategies +Brilliantly constructed UI and Menus+Extremely Impressive for a Early Access "

								A fun game, still in development (Early Access). You have to control the evolution of the Plague by spending skill points in detailed skill trees. The type of Plagues available to you get unlocked as you progress through the game, you start with only Bacteria available, you will go on to unlock Virus, Fungus, Parasite, Neurax Worm, Prion, Nano-Virus & Bio Weapon. These different Plague types will have either minor or major variations in the evolutions available to you, making for more interesting gameplay! Each game mode is unique in its own way, the different Plagues all seem to have game mechanics independant of each other. When you beat a level you will unlock different Gene structures, which allow you to get slight boosts or powerups in your future games, these are not needed for the normal difficulty, but can make Brutal or Mega Brutal difficulty go much smoother! There will be more Gene types to come, as this is early access, I have all Gene types unlocked (25/25), but it says that I am only at 83% on Genes unlocked, so we can expect to see more in this department.Overall the gameplay is fun & challenging. I would definitely say this is in the survival genre with a dash of world domination. If you try it out, you may enjoy it!			"

When I saw ""fomites"" as a transmission method in the Simian Flu expansion I must admit I had a pretty big fangirl moment. This game has even been recognized by the CDC! Which is AWESOME!It's a fast, fun, and challenging strategy game that anyone can be infected by.			"

								Plague Inc: EvolvedAll in all, it's not a bad game. The Mobile version caught attention of millions of players when it was released and was a world hit game. Fans enjoyed and loved the game. Why? They had a reason to be. It was an amazing and well developed game. You, the gamer controls a pathogen that infects a person and starts to spread. How your pathogen evolves is based on your choices and how you want it to be. A stealthy pathogen that spreads around slowly and stealthy to destroy the human race or a killing machine that kills everything it touches. The devs made the game even better by adding different kinds of pathogens, all the way from bacteria, all the way to turning humans into friken apes. Now this game was not that hyped because it seemed like plague inc for the computer. Not really different. But they suprised us. The game featured better graphics more scenarios, even a future multiplayer in development. This time they  even brought in a scenerio character for the players. Making the game even better. In conclusion, Plauge inc. Evolved really did, evolve. It brought many different new feautres to the game making the game great with many new options to the player that make them even more superior in the game.  "

								Fun, Well developed and the most dynamic infection simulator out.If it looks good to you get it, you will get what you expect and more.If you are looking to destroy the world via a slow and painful death, this game is what you need and more. Originaly only hosting slightly different ways to murder the world with small alterations between disease types, there are now lots of different additions that really stood out to me and showed how good the developer(s) are working on this game. The two recent disease additions of the simian flu and the necroa virus (ZOMBIES) add a large dynamic to the game that not only is fun but shows the great potential for future diseases.I also dabbled in multiplayer which is made to be very competitive and was happily surprised to see how different it was to single player. It really feels like you are against someone instead of just trying to be better than them with out them affecting you.Also:No microtransactions like the phone game... What is it? My birthday?!?On the other side of the spectrum the game can feel repetitive with the vanilla diseases such as virus, bacteria, parasite.For what it is at the moment I give it a 8/10.			"

I would definitely say this is in the survival genre with a dash of world domination. If you try it out, you may enjoy it!			"

Early Access Review
								Plague Inc: EvolvedAll in all, it's not a bad game. The Mobile version caught attention of millions of players when it was released and was a world hit game. Fans enjoyed and loved the game. Why? They had a reason to be. It was an amazing and well developed game. You, the gamer controls a pathogen that infects a person and starts to spread. How your pathogen evolves is based on your choices and how you want it to be. A stealthy pathogen that spreads around slowly and stealthy to destroy the human race or a killing machine that kills everything it touches. The devs made the game even better by adding different kinds of pathogens, all the way from bacteria, all the way to turning humans into friken apes. Now this game was not that hyped because it seemed like plague inc for the computer. Not really different. But they suprised us. The game featured better graphics more scenarios, even a future multiplayer in development. This time they  even brought in a scenerio character for the players. Making the game even better. In conclusion, Plauge inc. Evolved really did, evolve. It brought many different new feautres to the game making the game great with many new options to the player that make them even more superior in the game.  "

								For fans of the mobile app version of this game, the computer expansion promises to be equally infectious. Being on the computer doesn't take away any of the fun creating a plauge and watching the world burn. >:)Also, as a medically-minded geek I ADORE the fact that these symptoms use the real names! When I saw ""fomites"" as a transmission method in the Simian Flu expansion I must admit I had a pretty big fangirl moment. This game has even been recognized by the CDC! Which is AWESOME!It's a fast, fun, and challenging strategy game that anyone can be infected by.			"

Early Access Review
								Memes infected and killed all of humanity. 10/10 We all knew it was going to happen someday.Theres a lot that can be said about this game but I'm going to keep this short and simple because frankly I think that the overwelming amount of positive reviews speaks for itself. This game is one of those games where graphics mean virtually nothing. The whole point is to create an infectious disease or contagion that infects all of humanity and the kill them. It's absurdly simple sounding but it suprisingly takes a lot of skill in the higher difficulties. In fact this game rewards aggressive players, the only real restriction to playing this way though is balancing out lethality with infectivity since you need to infect faster than you kill.The menu system pre-game is rather nice as it gives you options for pre-game modifiers to make your casual eradication of humanity a little bit easier. In game you have 3 major screens to pay attention to, your primary world map, the evolution screen and the overview. Theres little to no clutter in these screens making them easy to navigate and easy on the eyes. One recomendation I have though is to always make use of the pause time feature. It helps to plan out your next moves but keep in mind your evolution doesn't take effect until after the game is unpaused.All in all I love this gae and am honestly suprised it's still listed as early access since it feels like a finished product. I highly recomend this game, easily worth the $15 price tag.			"

A unique game concept executed perfectly, that eerily shows how close humanity is to Armageddon of the microbial kind.+ Unique game concept of being the ""superbug"" that kills off humanity. Different kinds of bugs (coming into and venturing into the ficticious and silly) as well as scenario play, Steam Workshop support, and more keep it fresh and interesting throughout.+ Simple, clean art direction and UI that confuses little, and delivers the info when and where you need it.+ Logical game mechanics and concepts keep things easy to learn, yet hard to master especially at the higher difficulties, making it approachable for all, whilst giving the needed challenge for the dedicated. Its even realistic enough that the developers were invited by the Center for Disease Control (yes, THE CDC) to talk about the game and the dangers of superbugs.+ Great soundtrack that covers the emotional gamut of ""haunting"" to ""inevitability of the end"", fitting for the game's rather morbid end goal.+ Consistent and solid update pattern from the developers shows that even after their full release, they intend to continue their work on the game from its days of Early Access.================- Highly focused a game this is, it suffers from being not so extensive to mod, even with Steam Workshop support as most people can do is creating unique scenarios that use the game's already-existing mechanics and allowing the creators to play the numbers around to deliver something new.- The game is nothing more than menus and a map, and can surprisingly chug for no reason at odd moments before clearing up. Surprising, given the origins of the original game being from the mobile marketspace.- As with the game being just menus and maps and watching numbers, the sounds as well are functional at best. Soundtrack can be very one-dimensional, other than newer tracks that came with the more esoteric concept bugs in updates.- Gamers who are looking for expansions upon the concept outside of the ""zombies"" or ""mindworm"" bugs may not find much more without a major update or two from the devs themselves when they extend what the game can do.

								(At the time of writing this, it is is in early access.)There isn't much to talk about. Its a simple game. Its mechanics are straight forward and logical. Knowing a little bit about some of these countries actually does make a difference as you can make more informed decisions that actually effect the gameplay. My only real complaint is that there isn't enough interactivity between choosing upgrades (i.e., evolving). I'm a fan of careful decision making over rappidly pressing buttons, but I should be able to do at least something at any time.Its simple but has depth. It gets done what it tries to do.			"

I can recommend this game to people that are around 14 years and up, because it is not very easy. And the price that the game cost's is worth it in my opinion.[Sorry for my, not so good English]			"

								Despite this game lacking a bit of content at this point, I have been glued to it all weekend.  I enjoy playing with higher difficulty settings and I'm looking forward to what the future will bring for this game.ProsDifferent classes of diseases yield very different playstyles; each with their own strengths and weaknessesThere are many things that could work out differently in a single gameplay instance.  Capatalizing on this is heavily rewarded.ConsSymptoms, transmitions, and abilities (resistances) seem a little bit underdeveloped or lacking in quantity of options.Different disease classes are unbalanced with each other.  Neurax Worms in particular far outperform all other options. "

								I made a bacteria where I made it evolve to make people diarrhea AND vomit at the same time until they die. I just guided the symptoms and stuff. Then I got the notice in game that people were pooping in the streets and throwing up at the same time.There are many other just straight disease types [virus, bacteria, fungus, zombie virus/etc] but also has scenarios where the world is set up a certain way and you are a specific disease made with it's own stuff or just a general one like above. Or you can make your own diseases using the several types as a base.This game is great with each disease having it's own balance to win. With fungus, you need to really focus on spreading right. It doesn't spread like a virus, you have to plan when to do a spore release. Eventually you can evolve it so powerful that the whole world just has spores in the air. But you need to get the evolution points first.. which takes planning. So you can get crazy power but you have to think it through.Many great difficulties each describing exactly how it effects the game.Researchers and other stuff, among other 'enemies' in the game depend on your selection. But always end up starting to make a cure. Oh I'm sorry researchers is it hard to see through the microscope while bleeding out of your eyes? Does the cure become easier to find when you got sick too and now your organs are shutting down? Watch the lab! Don't want to poop all over those samples.Oh wait, no, it's because your whole country is dying and has a few thousand survivors just waiting to die. Good luck getting the lab grant to fund research!Oh and there is a Neurax Worm alien type disease. It is a creature that attaches to the brain stem, and spreads with eggs but you can modify it's evolution do spread and grow other ways. My favorite is to make the infected obsessed with putting eggs in people's food and hijacking planes to fly into countries that tried to shut out the world.Then you can evolve so the Neurax causes them to all enjoy suicide. And another where they worship the worm and start  becoming a religion. If everyone gets infected you win and all humankind now worship the alien things.My favorite though, aside from making zombies that evolve in crazy ways and the millions of ways to enjoy the game...Is when you get a notice that what ever you started as, you had now caused the human race to go extinct.Because it can happen, several diseases rocked human civilization, and the game doesn't let you forget.20/20 would poop and vomit at the same time again. Gotta go now, there is a neighborhood gathering. Some worms that you put on your neck and it's supposed to feel really good. Free caviar too!---update buy the game and buy it for everyone you know			"

								This game is pretty fun. It does a lot of things that the flash game equivalents do, but adds some neat features that keep things fresh. I think as long as it keeps getting updates and fulfills its promises of multiplayer and custom scenarios, etc. etc., it could be more than worth the pricetag. As of now it's still good and still fairly worth it, especially for those that like macro-scale world domination games or the disease theme like this. Even if you're not a hundred percent on board with games like this, I'd say it's still worth a try.			"

								Well, it's one of those games I expected to play a couple hours and leave in my library for long periods of time between plays. Now, after unlocking so much, I see that won't be the case. It's an addictive strategy game that's good for wasting time at any time. I had a few issues where screens for loading saves and devolving wouldn't show up, but those are bugs they'll fix. Get it if you're into strategy games of any kind. Or if you enjoy watching the world burn under your command.When I play this, I get a weird god complex sorta feeling... but oh man, it feels AMAZING when the world ends up worshipping your pet worm.

								Awesome strategy game, and thats coming from someone who never plays them, ever. I recieved the game as a gift and I think its really fun. Its kind of like a stress reliever, wiping out the human race with a wide range of official and community created plagues, virsus, and bacterias. Its not one of those sit down for a quick session games though, depending on how in depth you want to get evolving your plague, a game can run upwards of about 45 minutes, unless your just really good at games like this. I still recommend it though!			"

								Plague Inc: Evolved is probably the first game that has made me actually fear for my safety, It's also the first game that allows me to destroy humanity with diseases like ""LolCatz"" and ""Weed"" which I had named myself for a small laugh.While the game is in Early Access it seems to be mostly done with only a few things missing such as multiplayer and the tutorial but that doesn't stop it from being a good game with what it has.The game is in Early Access and is based off the popular smartphone app with the same name and well yes you could play that for $2 but you wouldn't have as many Features;Achievements (there's a ton of them) or Visuals since the game looks great on PC. The App is however a good means as to see how the game works, (Game explanation) Basicly you select a type of disease all of which work differently, You then select a starting country to infect your first victim and as your virus spreads/infects;kills ect you gain points which you can then spend to gain upgrades which do a viraty of things from allowing it to infect certain animals to making it more resistant to heat or cold which can effect the outcome and reaction of the world greatly. Your first time playing will probably come as a quick defeat as you learn which upgrades are best at what time in your diseases development and I would love to go into detail about my strategy but this is a review not a guide. :DSo is the game worth the $14.99 price tag in it's current state? The answer is Probably not unless you're a big fan of the smartphone game or a fan of these types of games, The problem with the game in my opinion is that most of the diseases feel the same, They do all have differences but most are so small you barely feel a difference between them which can cause the game to get boring fast. The Zombie and Mindworm Diseases which are new feel very well done providing a fresh new experence due to their completely different upgrades and playstyle from the rest of the diseases and if other diseases were to follow suit and get a redesign to make them all unique from each other I would be much more willing to recommend this game for its price.While I can't fully recommend the game for the price right now I can only hope the game will grow to be worth $14.99 because it is a good game it just needs a little more grabbing power to keep people coming back for more, and although I'm not quite sure how multiplayer will work it could just be the thing to do it.

								Honestly loved the game, finished enough to enjoy 10-20 hours of gameplay which is surprising for early access.I understand its a reboot of a phone ap that cost .99 cents but they charge 2-4 dollars per plague type which is half the gameplay. So in the end 15 is worth it. I felt like the game was worth the full ammount in its current condition. With that been said I'm super excited  for the full release. Couldn't find a bug(a possible spelling error is all). Just one or 2 balancing issues. Like I said though this game is better than most finished games out there!			"

It's still being worked on, and right now, it's just the core game, and while that isn't worth the 15 dollars that the developer is requesting now, the added work and multiplayer feature, I have a feeling, will make every penny worth it. I can't wait to see what the developer has coming, because as we've seen with the mobile game, the developer is adament on pumping out new material for this game and as a devoted fan, I will be waiting.

								To those thinking about buying Plague Inc Evolved I would say ""Go ahead, it's alot of fun!"". I bought this game with high hopes as I played the original pandemic games as a child and was highly addicted to them for a while, but naturally I forgot about them and moved on. Now several years later a full steam release with polished graphics, new pathogens, more tactics and more realism? Yes please! The only thing I will say is at this point in it's development it is not worth it's current price tag, once they add in the mind control worm and zombie virus I have a feeling that will change. So in short, if you are looking to dominate the world as a deadly disease that cannot possibly be stopped and wipe out the human race in it's entirety, there is no better or more fun way to do it then Plague Inc Evolved (Either that or you could just manufacture a deadly disease and do it yourself :P)			"

								This game is one of my favorites considering how well done it's been since these few updates in the app and now on steam? The anticipation to kill everyone as a virus, fungus, prion, or even bacteria just leaves you happy at the end when you beat everyone. Of course, this game is still in development so there are some stuff in the game that can't be used(Obviously). The strategy is just simply marvelous and sometimes really hard to achieve through your goal. Many strategies are involved in this game. Although, I do agree with some people that $15 is kinda of a rip-off, I understand that when you buy this game. You'll get the DLC for free along with it on the later updates which is understandable in most cases. Is this game worth it? Yes.			"

								Plague Inc. Evolved - Whether it is the Simian Flu or your own custom disease, Plague Inc. Evolved definitely provides a wide spectrum of upgrades which can enhance your disease when you collect DNA Points by doing horrible things that you wouldn't usually do in real life like:Infecting millions/billions with a zombie like plagueKilling the millions/billions of people I infected for a laugh.Release your true Hannibal Lector in Plague Inc. Evolved today :D			"

												Much worse than the flash game this is derived from.  No matter how Severe you make the disease, it never slows the development of a Cure, which is the primary late game strategy.  Now its just dumb - they basically removed the Severity mechanic so the game wasn't beatable in 5 mins so they would have a product to sell.			"

								I've played this game both on my iPhone and on Steam.  I LOVE it!  It keeps me entertained for hours upon hours as I figure out new strategies for killing off humanity.  And, since I have played this game so much, I tend to view real world scenarios (such as the Ebola outbreak in west Africa) from the viewpoint of this game to try to figure out what the next best action for ""the Cure"" might be.  Highly recommended for nerdy and geeky types!			"

												Is this game worth your time, yes or no? I'm not sure myself. I had some fun with it, but I never played the mobile version. If you did, you're probably better off with that one, since this costs a whopping 15 bucks and doesn't really offer all that much.In PI:E you are a virus or bacterium or whatever you wanna be. Your goal is the eradication of the human race. Sounds like fun and actually is for a short time. The main game consists of several different scenarios from simple viruses, bacteria to mind control worms and ""ape flues"". In theory this all sounds very interesting and different. In reality though this is where the game just falls off, because every scenario is more or less the same with some minor differences (the Simian Flue is actually the most interesting since you can actually create ape colonies, have them fight and transmit the disease, etc.)The core gameplay, however, stays the same. You pick a starting country (preferably with access to planes and ships) and then click on various bubbles to get ""DNA"" points with which you can increase the virility, severity and lethality of your plague, as well as develop certain immunities or stronger transmission via birds, insects, air, etc.The problem is you don't really see the effects of these choices. You can mostly just guess what you might need. Let's take Greenland as an example: It's only accessible by boat (potentially birds I guess), is sparsely populated and pretty cold, so it's imho the hardest country to even infect. You need to invest a lot and the costs are constantly rising after each upgrade. ♥♥♥♥ you, Greenland.There's also a lot of RNG involved since your plague can mutate randomly, which can ♥♥♥♥ up your whole plan, leading either to a too quick discovery by doctors or killing people too quickly before everyone can get infected. You can ""devolve"" these mutations, but that costs DNA points as well...*sigh*.When your plague is discovered you can only hope that you can infect everyone quickly enough since there isn't much you can do to slow down research other than investing in particular traits if you get enough DNA points, which becomes ever harder the longer the game goes on since you mostly get them from infecting new countries. Fascinatingly, once the cure is found, millions of people are healed quasi over night and you lose the game almost instantly.PI:E is not a bad ""game"", but it's more of a time sink than a real strategy game imho. I can't imagine what playing this on brutal would look like...casual was already annoying enough. Might grab this for a steep discount.			"

												Plague Inc: Evolved is a well made and enjoyable casual game of strategy with a lot of developer support and expansions, but not recommendable due to the price. On sale price is where the full price should be.As a simulation it has a couple of problems. First the there is the whole human immune system which historically has created far more ""cures"" to disease than medical science. As a disease percolates in hosts without killing them there should be a rising chance for a natural immune system cure to emerge leaving part of the population immune thus requiring mutation to revitalize its ability to affect hosts who have previously encountered it and will have a leg up on defeating it. Kind of like how the flu comes back every year.The second more nitpicky problem being that the ""goal"" of any ""disease"" is to reproduce. Not to destroy its host. Successful diseases become symbiotic with their hosts. This is touched on in a few scenarios in the game, but is generally in opposition to the main goal.The third and most nitpicky issue is with port closings which are the biggest threat to your disease's success and have historically been almost completely useless at stopping the spread of disease.

								Incredibly addictive game. After annihilating the world a few times you start pick up scary facts about the world. Like if a zombie outbreak started in India the world is doomed; Or if a virus mutates to survive in water, then colonizes in England, the world is doomed. Also, have you washed your hands today? I think I'm washing the skin off mine now.Having said that the game is still a little buggy and I wouldn't reccomend you buy it until full release. The Developer says ""On a serious note – we are still hard at work adding in new content and cool features - the game is stable and polished but not currently feature-complete. Please only buy the game now if you are OK with this and understand that you may also encounter bugs (not the good, world-killing kind...)."" and it's 100% accurate. Amazing game that I can't wait to see in full release.			"

								Strangely addictive for such a simple game. Hours invested on the mobile and now looking forward to many more on the desktop. Overall I love the game, but do have to say I think it's a little over-priced for the content. I'm taking into account what will be in the full release. The scenarios are a nice add, but more plague types would certainly boost the overall value of the game, the marketability, and replay value. I noticed the custom senario feature that's going to be added in with the full version. This is either going to be extremely awesome, and make the game worth every penny of the $15, or it'll be a huge let down. I highly recommend picking the game up. Either now, if you're feeling anxious like me, or wait until the full release hits so you aren't all antsy for the additional features to unlock. I might also add the summer sale is only a little ways away, and if you're like me you still have plenty of games to play from the winter sale. I'm glad this made it to PC. It's much more enjoyable compared to playing on my phone.			"

								I was unsure about buying this game because I didn't know how much it would really add on to the experience of Pandemic/II. However, I have always really enjoyed Pandemic II, so I decided to go for it, because it is my kind of game.Plague Inc. definitely takes the experience to where it deserves to go; the trait trees are a lot more in-depth, and I like the tweaks they've made (the biggest issue isn't necessarily getting the whole world infected, as least as a bacteria, but competing with the cure. Playing as a virus changes this up due to the random mutations, however!) to how those games play out. Severity feels a little finicky but is enjoyable, and it is fantastic how you can still infect a country after its air/sea ports are closed, with the livestock transmission mutations. As for the price tag... I'm still uncertain about it. This game is still early on in development (although there is a lot to it as of now), and the gameplay can be reptitive to a lot of people. It's a must-buy at $5, but at $15, I have to really think about it. IF you REALLY love the gameplay, though (e.g. you're a huge fan of Pandemic II and still enjoy starting a few games up even years after you started playing it), I'd say go for it. Otherwise, wait for a sale, and then DEFINITELY go for it. I look forward to seeing what the devs add, and also playing through the challenges while I wait.			"

								Incredibly addictive game. After annihilating the world a few times you start pick up scary facts about the world. Like if a zombie outbreak started in India the world is doomed; Or if a virus mutates to survive in water, then colonizes in England, the world is doomed. Also, have you washed your hands today? I think I'm washing the skin off mine now.Having said that the game is still a little buggy and I wouldn't reccomend you buy it until full release. The Developer says ""On a serious note – we are still hard at work adding in new content and cool features - the game is stable and polished but not currently feature-complete. Please only buy the game now if you are OK with this and understand that you may also encounter bugs (not the good, world-killing kind...)."" and it's 100% accurate. Amazing game that I can't wait to see in full release.			"

								Strangely addictive for such a simple game. Hours invested on the mobile and now looking forward to many more on the desktop. Overall I love the game, but do have to say I think it's a little over-priced for the content. I'm taking into account what will be in the full release. The scenarios are a nice add, but more plague types would certainly boost the overall value of the game, the marketability, and replay value. I noticed the custom senario feature that's going to be added in with the full version. This is either going to be extremely awesome, and make the game worth every penny of the $15, or it'll be a huge let down. I highly recommend picking the game up. Either now, if you're feeling anxious like me, or wait until the full release hits so you aren't all antsy for the additional features to unlock. I might also add the summer sale is only a little ways away, and if you're like me you still have plenty of games to play from the winter sale. I'm glad this made it to PC. It's much more enjoyable compared to playing on my phone.			"

								This is approved by Plague Inc and we all approve of this for the damn, more close in details of the plague,towns,statistic,multiplayers,several new game modes and slightly more flat beautiful global maps with animated winds/clouds and aeroplanes plus ships in 3D shapes especially the global map which isn't exactly 3D.. At least not yet anyway.And I hope that they put in or make videos that show off the catastophic plague or the townspeople rioting/panicking/business as usual, as well as the news and natural disasters. That could be bloody enjoyable for sadistic people who likes to see people suffering in this game or people who just wants to know what is the people doing in their life. But hey its Alpha don't trust what I say in this okay?Oh what? A brony picture? Huzzah! I just ruin the anti-bronies day!....(No seriously thats enough, MLP already season 4 just give up)			"

								I really like the gameplay, different plagues have different ways of winning. I especially like the neurex worm because that has a total different skillset than all other plagues. I wish all of them have more unique characteristics/skill trees like the neurex worm. As for suggestions: possibly add different conditions for winning the game, instead of just kill all humans. However, I know it's still early access but anyway it is a brilliant and fun game! Can't wait to play with the full version			"

								Let me start off by saying i played this game since the Mobile version. I never expected for a Mobile game to become such a great computer game. I was pretty addicted on getting everything completed on the mobile, and after i finished most of the things it was a big boner killer. Then now, the computer Version arrived which was a breath of fresh air :)The Game is very pretty graphically, i also love the themes in question of trying to help to Donate to certain non-profits in-game making the gamers aware of what goes on. The game is basically just like the Mobile version but in a Prettier and more detailed Version . You get to understand the countries, weakenessess and strenghts of viruses better, the spread of the virus looks way cooler, and there's also everything unlocked (not having to buy in pieces like the mobile version) Overall, i enjoy the game a lot and for now i give a 8.5/10 for the game.What i would like to See enhanced/Improved?More Music tracks, more viruses/Evolution. Maybe a Virus versus Cure mode Online?(thats just a wild dream), Some perks on the way you can play mechanically. Its a Early Access game so i do have high hopes for the future :) Keep the great Work!			"

In this game, your goal is to kill the human race before a vaccine is developed, and spread all over the world before everything closes. This requires a bit of patience though, and generates frustrations, because sometimes it doesn't work out, and sometimes it takes a while. A great game.			"

												I've played Plague since early access, and the devs are without doubt some of the best in the industry. Intuitively, you'd think there are only so many times you can destroy the world with your pathogen of choice in a 10-30 minute rampage, but you'd be wrong just like I was. When I first got the game, there were the standard pathogens to choose from - Bacteria, Virus, Prion - and I'd proceed to destroy the world (Greenland notwithstanding) for 15 minutes at a time in single-player. I played for maybe 4 hours in 15 minute bursts, but soon grew bored. A year on my GF bugged me into installing it on my old laptop so she could play it. I looked over her shoulder and saw she was entrenched in a multiplayer battle, her disease fighting to destroy the world before her competitor's, actively seeking to spend her precious little DNA to sabotage her nemesis' pathogen and strengthen her own. I swiftly took the laptop from her and played for the next 4 hours straight. In my absence, there was now a fully-fledged multiplayer mode - versus or co-op. There were new diseases - Neurax Worm, Simian Flu, Vampires. There were scenarios that forced you into abandoning your tried-and-trusted strategies and finding new ways to kill everyone.I later found out that many of these changes had come long after the early access period was in the rear-view mirror, which brings me back to my original point - the devs are great. After its full release, the devs could have moved on, taken on new projects, made more money, but instead they stayed to ensure Plague became a 40-hour game, not a 4-hour game. The reason you'll see reviews that state the PC version's supremacy over the iOS game is because the iOS version is pretty much the Early Access version, comparable to the one I first alluded to - fun for a while, easy to pick-up-and-play, but not the game you sink hours into - whereas the devs continue to work on Plague (Steam version), adding new content and improving gameplay to this day. This is the only game I've ever bought twice - I bought my GF it so we could play together. I don't recommend doing the same, or if you do avoid Versus mode, because it caused several considerable arguments when one of us did something underhanded to expediate our annihilation of the free world at the others expense. Stick to Co-op.This game has my highest recommendation. I believe it is one of the most content-rich games available (considering its price) and, given a reasonable chance, could be enjoyed by nearly anyone with a Steam account.			"

								As many have said, this game is extremely similar to the original mobile version but nicer looking, there are a few differences here and there but even the messages that pop up are basically the same. That being said, once you reach the neurax worm (Necroa isn't yet available) I found myself VERY much enjoying it, this new one is very interesting and very new.Unfortunatly, once you have played the neurax one, it's a little harder to go back to the others as they tend to resemble each other a lot, like in the handheld. I think if there were more different types or a deeper gene system it could make the game very interesting.Overall, I would say the game has a lot of potential, by adding new messages and events to shake things up, a few new plagues that differ like the neurax worm, this could be amazing! There are still a lot of features that aren't implemented since this IS early access, but I'd say if you're interested, 15 dollars isn't quite so bad. I recommend it, but cautiously.			"

								Plague Inc Evolved is really fun. You play as a virus or bacteria, fungus, etc. Your goal is to infect the world and kill people at a pace that allows you to infect people and to push the cure back from development. It's pretty fun, easy to play, and interesting to see the effects of your choices. A lot of fun achievements are in this game. Have fun trying out how to ""Paint the Streets Brown."" The graphics are fresh, the sound effects are spot on, and the gameplay is entertaining. Just when you think you're getting a chance to get bored, it reels you back in again. Very addictive. There are plans for this game to have multiplayer as it's currently in early access. Regardless, I still recommend buying this game as the only way this game can go is up. 9/10			"

								Create a plague and infect the world - pretty much as it says on the tin.A typical playthrough of this may take about 20 minutes. You create your plague (choosing from bacteria, virus, fungal infection and various others - most need to be unlocked through gameplay), choose a starting point and try to paint the map red essentially. You evolve your disease with traits and perks which determine its strengths and weakness (how contagious it is, how well it can spread overseas, which climates it is most effective in etc) and the goal is to wipe out the entire human race - nothing else is acceptable. There will be times when those bloody secluded Greenlanders or New Zealandfolk simply seem to refuse to get infected, and nothing is more frustrating, but when you get it just right, and watch it spread like absolute wildfire...very satisfying. Also, as someone who works in retail, destroying the human race is usually the ideal way to blow off steam after a hard day of work.I should mention this game started off as a smartphone app and has been ported to PC. The PC version is still being developed, but on the phone it is more or less the same exact game. Perfect for a bus/train journey or so.			"

								After playing this on an Android tablet through a couple of plagues, I became addicted to this game. I went to the website and found it was also on iPhone and PC, and ended up buying the versions for each. This game, while not action-packed, is definitely for those who love strategy. This game has plenty. Don't be fooled by Casual and Normal difficulties, where it first appears that the strategies are all the same. The real challenge lies in Brutal and Mega Brutal difficulties, where everything you do has a serious consequence. At those difficulty levels, each plague becomes unique, and managing them to beat the cure is no easy task. You really have to plan and think your way through each, and even then random events can derail you. I haven't even gotten to the scenarios yet - can't wait to try them, once I finish all the plagues and unlocking all the genes.I highly recommend this to the strategy fans everywhere.			"

								I usually don't review games, actually usually is an overstatement.. I dont think I ever have reviewed a game but this as an upcoming title and early access I feel that it deserves some recognition. This is a great rendition of Plague Inc, this reboot has brought me hours of nostalgic trial and error fun. The days playing the old flash game in school never got old I guess. The game brings from what I have experienced and stated above, hours of trial and error fun. The game is polished and looks great. A certain thing I feel I could bring up though are that in the fungus level, at least on the lower difficulties and I also believe on Brutal you can exploit the refund system to gain points by constantly refunding spore burst abilities. I love the depth and scenarios this game offers and I am looking forwards to see how it pans out. A well-spent 15 dollars and a small but great addition to my steam library.			"

								I usually don't review games, actually usually is an overstatement.. I dont think I ever have reviewed a game but this as an upcoming title and early access I feel that it deserves some recognition. This is a great rendition of Plague Inc, this reboot has brought me hours of nostalgic trial and error fun. The days playing the old flash game in school never got old I guess. The game brings from what I have experienced and stated above, hours of trial and error fun. The game is polished and looks great. A certain thing I feel I could bring up though are that in the fungus level, at least on the lower difficulties and I also believe on Brutal you can exploit the refund system to gain points by constantly refunding spore burst abilities. I love the depth and scenarios this game offers and I am looking forwards to see how it pans out. A well-spent 15 dollars and a small but great addition to my steam library.			"

								A simple, but fun game. Plague inc Evolved is a perfect example of a simulation game done right. Most simualtion games have to sacrifice good gameplay elements to make the simualtion more realistic, or try to be goofy and become youtube fodder thats popualr for about a month untill it fades away. This game manages to be a solid strategy game while being a good plague sim as well. With a good amount of pathogens to chose from (some more different than others) and the outstanding scenario creator, this game may last you a while.			"

								This game is worth buying now (in my opinion)If you enjoyed the web browser Pandemic 2, you will love this!The new zombies plague is something I really enjoyed.. Maybe I just like destroying the world? And why did I get excitied when russia nuked Korea.. Eh.Anyway, quick review but this game is sexy. BUY ITTTTTI do want to suggest something inside this review, and make sure you help me with getting this in XDI think that there should be cheat codes. Along with the cheat plagues, in the ESC menu, add cheat codes. But, Upon use would disable all scoring throughout the game to ensure cheaters get stopped when using these. And once the game that was cheated in is over, and they are back to the main menu or wherever it redirects, The scoring would become Re-Enabled.Seriously, GET THIS GAME.Random note: The reason people should by Alpha or beta games is because as you play through, you can get easily bored, or maybe not. But the time you may get bored, they can release an epic update adding new interesting things into the game, relieving your boredem of the game for a little while. Then you get bored again?? NEW UPDATE!! new stuff to play with! less bordem. repeating the proccess.			"

								Create a plague and infect the world - pretty much as it says on the tin.A typical playthrough of this may take about 20 minutes. You create your plague (choosing from bacteria, virus, fungal infection and various others - most need to be unlocked through gameplay), choose a starting point and try to paint the map red essentially. You evolve your disease with traits and perks which determine its strengths and weakness (how contagious it is, how well it can spread overseas, which climates it is most effective in etc) and the goal is to wipe out the entire human race - nothing else is acceptable. There will be times when those bloody secluded Greenlanders or New Zealandfolk simply seem to refuse to get infected, and nothing is more frustrating, but when you get it just right, and watch it spread like absolute wildfire...very satisfying. Also, as someone who works in retail, destroying the human race is usually the ideal way to blow off steam after a hard day of work.I should mention this game started off as a smartphone app and has been ported to PC. The PC version is still being developed, but on the phone it is more or less the same exact game. Perfect for a bus/train journey or so.			"

								Plague Inc:Evolved is a strategy game where you control the spread and evolution of a disease (via manipulating the DNA) with the aim of wiping out the Earth's population.If you kill everyone, you win. If they (the human race) cure you, or you run out of living hosts, you lose.The ""nastier"" your disease gets, the harder the humans will try to develop a cure.There are several different plague types (virus, bacteria, bio-weapon etc), and each has there own quirks. For example , a virus will mutate rapidly (possibly developing to be too nasty before you have infected all that many people), while the Neurax Worm can either kill or enslave the humans.Each game only takes an hour or two, and it's both entertaining and (to a degree) educational. If it has a downside, it's that the strategy for all disease types is broadly the same - you want to infect as many people as possible while trying to limit the ""nastiness"" of the disease. Once everyone/most of the world are infected, then you can ramp up the lethality.But even with this consideration, the game has a large amount of replayability, as wins unlock new genes for you to customise your disease, and the different plague types each require a somewhat different strategy. Plus there are 4 different difficulty levels to try your hand at.I've got 85 hours so far, and still have plenty to unlock, and many achievements to get (if achievements is your thing).I certainly consider I've got good value for the money.

								I know I haven't played very much of this game, but I'm ADDICTED. This game is awesome. It's creative and well thought. It has an  EXCESSIVE amount of replay value. You get to create and evolve your own disease. Choose from different selections of pathogens, and unlock more as you go! Your goal? infect and then destroy humanity with your pathogen. Other cool features; Co-op mode (future update),  Funny news casts, share your disease and how well it did to facebook or twitter, evolve and devolve certain genes, insert genes before starting the game, amazing community creations found on  the steam workshop, make a country's government fall or make everyone go insane!!!! (etc...)  How ever, there is only one con to me, and that is the price, right now it's $15. I don't think I should have to pay a whole $15 for it, but it's worth it. It's a great strategic game. So have fun relieving stress and killing humanity using a micro-organism!!!!!!!			"

								After playing this on an Android tablet through a couple of plagues, I became addicted to this game. I went to the website and found it was also on iPhone and PC, and ended up buying the versions for each. This game, while not action-packed, is definitely for those who love strategy. This game has plenty. Don't be fooled by Casual and Normal difficulties, where it first appears that the strategies are all the same. The real challenge lies in Brutal and Mega Brutal difficulties, where everything you do has a serious consequence. At those difficulty levels, each plague becomes unique, and managing them to beat the cure is no easy task. You really have to plan and think your way through each, and even then random events can derail you. I haven't even gotten to the scenarios yet - can't wait to try them, once I finish all the plagues and unlocking all the genes.I highly recommend this to the strategy fans everywhere.			"

												I've played Plague since early access, and the devs are without doubt some of the best in the industry. Intuitively, you'd think there are only so many times you can destroy the world with your pathogen of choice in a 10-30 minute rampage, but you'd be wrong just like I was. When I first got the game, there were the standard pathogens to choose from - Bacteria, Virus, Prion - and I'd proceed to destroy the world (Greenland notwithstanding) for 15 minutes at a time in single-player. I played for maybe 4 hours in 15 minute bursts, but soon grew bored. A year on my GF bugged me into installing it on my old laptop so she could play it. I looked over her shoulder and saw she was entrenched in a multiplayer battle, her disease fighting to destroy the world before her competitor's, actively seeking to spend her precious little DNA to sabotage her nemesis' pathogen and strengthen her own. I swiftly took the laptop from her and played for the next 4 hours straight. In my absence, there was now a fully-fledged multiplayer mode - versus or co-op. There were new diseases - Neurax Worm, Simian Flu, Vampires. There were scenarios that forced you into abandoning your tried-and-trusted strategies and finding new ways to kill everyone.I later found out that many of these changes had come long after the early access period was in the rear-view mirror, which brings me back to my original point - the devs are great. After its full release, the devs could have moved on, taken on new projects, made more money, but instead they stayed to ensure Plague became a 40-hour game, not a 4-hour game. The reason you'll see reviews that state the PC version's supremacy over the iOS game is because the iOS version is pretty much the Early Access version, comparable to the one I first alluded to - fun for a while, easy to pick-up-and-play, but not the game you sink hours into - whereas the devs continue to work on Plague (Steam version), adding new content and improving gameplay to this day. This is the only game I've ever bought twice - I bought my GF it so we could play together. I don't recommend doing the same, or if you do avoid Versus mode, because it caused several considerable arguments when one of us did something underhanded to expediate our annihilation of the free world at the others expense. Stick to Co-op.This game has my highest recommendation. I believe it is one of the most content-rich games available (considering its price) and, given a reasonable chance, could be enjoyed by nearly anyone with a Steam account.			"

								A simple, but fun game. Plague inc Evolved is a perfect example of a simulation game done right. Most simualtion games have to sacrifice good gameplay elements to make the simualtion more realistic, or try to be goofy and become youtube fodder thats popualr for about a month untill it fades away. This game manages to be a solid strategy game while being a good plague sim as well. With a good amount of pathogens to chose from (some more different than others) and the outstanding scenario creator, this game may last you a while.			"

								Plague Inc: Evolved is one of the Most time consuming/time killer games I have ever played,I originally did play the Iphone version for it,and to be honest,Plague Inc is really fun even with basics and such,now onto the Depths of Plague Inc. Ndemic Creations comes at you with a whole remade version of Plague Inc but now on the Computer! You can choose old classic Pathogens or even new ones like the Recently added for advertisement of the Movie Rise of the planet of the apes.You can choose from Bacteria to even Bio-Weapons that kill on touch! Becareful though,don't wanna kill all your human hosts or let the Humans develop the cure or else yer dead and gone. Sure it has some of it's problems like freezing,lag and such but I tend to ignore it. Ndemic Creations has done a wonderful job on this game and I honestly want to see it in its full Glory at the Full Release which has new features to be included like Multiplayer Mode,this mode is mostly anticipated by me and my friends! I highly recommend buying this game if you want to Kill time or just Strategically plan out how to Kill off the buggers the Pathogens know as Humanity. Overall,this game deserves a 10/10 from Me,some of you may think different but I think Ndemic Creations did Splendid work on this just for it to not go Unrecognized. Keep it up Ndemic Creations!			"

								This game is worth buying now (in my opinion)If you enjoyed the web browser Pandemic 2, you will love this!The new zombies plague is something I really enjoyed.. Maybe I just like destroying the world? And why did I get excitied when russia nuked Korea.. Eh.Anyway, quick review but this game is sexy. BUY ITTTTTI do want to suggest something inside this review, and make sure you help me with getting this in XDI think that there should be cheat codes. Along with the cheat plagues, in the ESC menu, add cheat codes. But, Upon use would disable all scoring throughout the game to ensure cheaters get stopped when using these. And once the game that was cheated in is over, and they are back to the main menu or wherever it redirects, The scoring would become Re-Enabled.Seriously, GET THIS GAME.Random note: The reason people should by Alpha or beta games is because as you play through, you can get easily bored, or maybe not. But the time you may get bored, they can release an epic update adding new interesting things into the game, relieving your boredem of the game for a little while. Then you get bored again?? NEW UPDATE!! new stuff to play with! less bordem. repeating the proccess.			"

												Wow, just WOW.I've been playing this game on and off for about a year or so (not sure), and I find myself coming back to this game. It is such an interesting game idea; infecting the world and eradicating humanity.I can also guarantee that you will actually LEARN something from this game as did I, from diseases to populations. Plauge Inc. is also an amazing Real Time Strategy (RTS) game, and you can impress your friends with your strategies (and even dominate them in multiplayer!)I definitely recommend this game. So many things you can learn, but there is a point (unfortunately) when you may discover all there is to learn and you beat every disease on the hardest difficulty.Great job, Ndemic Games!			"

								I remember playing this game in it's free browser incarnations and it was a simple, challenging, and enjoyable game. This PC version is SO MUCH MORE! When the game first came out I didn't get it because it sold game features a la carte -- and I vote with my dollars when it comes to things like that, taking a pass until it was being sold all in one peice. I'm glad I came back to get it! The interface is both familiar and developed, and you can have great fun evolving your disease, over and over again, to see how it does best. Runaway killer? Insideous hidden plague? Airborne? Waterborne? you can pick numerous different paths for each disease in how it is transmitted, it's symptoms, and it's abilities. What's best is the variety of different plagues. From simple bacteria, to mutating viruses, to zombie plagues, mind control parasites, and on and on -- great replayablility. The main game is fun enough -- then you realize there are a bunch of scenarios that add even more to the game! A great and unique sim. Worth a look.			"

								Fond memories of this as a browser game led me to believe that Madagascar would be the cause of my frustrations. This time it's Greenland that distrust everyone and close their port at the slightest whiff of any symptoms.The game is educational on both the infection spread and the geography of the world. And probably anger management.It's an early access game, but there is still plenty to do. I've not touched the scenarios yet, but the interaction with players on the design is a big plus.With the main game, it feels like the difficulty may be a barrier to some players and that locking content is a bit off putting when you lose your first normal game as you feel like you'll never be able to unlock anything whatsoever. Once you've got a rough strategy going (and playing games on casual unlocks helpful extras) of sneaky sneaky, kill 'em all before they can even think about starting a cure, you'll appreciate the subtle differences of the different plague types. Then will begin to find the game much more enjoyable and will start developing your own favourite techniques, such as, mega hordes of zombies invading the irritating surviving country, nasty symptom combos and mind control.The save function is useful as well, in case something doesn't go quite right or you just want to boot up a 100% infected world and wipe them out in whatever way you see fit. Whilst the world menus seemed useful, I didn't find myself using them much. Maybe they just need a little more polish. Who knows?pros--Lots of features-Steam workshop-Variety -Value for money-Quick to load-Easy to pick up and playCons-App style means it feels like it should be played on a touch screen.-Endless frustration at eagle-eyed researchers "

												A unique take on the Strategy genre, Plague Inc. allows you to take control over a microcellular disease. Your ultimate goal is to infect everyone in the world and then kill them off. There are TONS of tough achievements that you can unlock if wanted, and it makes you feel very good inside seeing the words VICTORY on your screen when you win. There is a gamemode that allows for multiplayer now, in which you compete to kill off everybody first.7.5/10, I reccomend that you play this game			"

								This is a good addicting game for a early access game. It has ALOT of features im exited to see. The multiplayer is what i REALLY want. And im exited for their planned Workshop thing. People will make their own diseases and plagues by using their planned Custom Creations kit. I am always jumping up and down like a 2 yr old on an Extreame surgar high, waiting for the next update to bring the Necroa virus or the workshop. I reccomend this to players who like flash games on the internet and strategy games.But there are a few things i have against this game.Its way easier than the original mobile game and i could beat it in under an hour again if you dared me to. I beat it in 6 hours before, and the other 2 hours ive played it is just re-beating it all on mega brutal,(which is waaay to easy for the hardest difficulty) and messing with the recently added Neurax worm.(which again, is still to easy and ive beaten a bunch of times)If it were me, i would rate this a 7/10 or a 6/10 because it is really fun at the beggining but you can beat it in 30 minutes if you really try. I personaly cannot wait until it adds the workshop. It would make tons of oppertunities for extra gameplay. Who knows what people could come up with? (The Last Of Us fungus? hint hint.....) When they add that, i would probrably change my 6 to 7 out of 10 to a 9 to 10 out of 10. The gameplay would never end with millions of players uploading and developing their own custom diseases for others and themselves to enjoy. Again, who knows what could happen? What could you create to infect the world when it comes out? *coughs* ugh.... man i dont feel good....*dies*EDIT: For most of you who are saying ""wel dis gaem waz 1 dallar on da app store hur dur"" the plague inc app was free when you downloaded it, i know. the reason why its 14$ here is because they give you ALL the special features you would have to BUY on the app version, free. If you bought everything on the app verson, it would be about 14 to 20 dollars. So technically, 14$ is a fair price for a game that gives all the dlc to you on purchase :p			"

												An excellent simulator with sufficient complexity to keep interest up, but possessed of an interface that does not require 100% attention. Fun without loss to real world productivity. The wealth of options, not withstanding community mods, make for extensive replayability.I have not yet tried out Multi-player, however, casual solo-gaming has been very enjoyable.----Update----Whilst I do still enjoy the game, I have found a growing disatisfaction with some elements of the ""Mega Brutal"" difficulty level(I've completed much of the game at this setting beating down on a pathogen or senerio until biohazards are maxed). Whilst various combinations can be found which offer a high chance of success, the almost ""blind luck"" of infection to a handful of nortorious nations does offer little in terms of skill. The ""luck"" element of fan favourites, such as New Zealand, Madagascar and Greenland, for example, seems to have the same intrinsic failure of 4x games (where the AI doesn't actually get smarter but rather gets to push resource boundries--volume over substance or in this context luck over skill).There should be a random element to this game--any infection stream would be in the real world. However, the degree of such seems skewed at the higher difficulty levels, so much so, that the tactics used are far less important than the ""blind luck"" of a ""red"" boat or a plane.The game is still enjoyable and I still recommend it. However, the ""luck factor"" is over emphasised on higher difficulty levels and seems to be quite unrealistic.Suggestions to afford greater realisation in terms of infection routes to nations:Birds fly. Many birds fly very long distances. Many of the island nations are well within the flight range of various species of birds. Why then, using Madagascar as an example, do birds not traverse the waterway to the island? Why, in terms of the various animal and water transmission streams is there no infection route for say ""sea life"". I would expect that Greenland would be far more readily infectable if there was an animal transmission via sea life/seafood (a significant staple of many arctic nations). etc etc.			"

								Plague Inc Evolved is really fun. You play as a virus or bacteria, fungus, etc. Your goal is to infect the world and kill people at a pace that allows you to infect people and to push the cure back from development. It's pretty fun, easy to play, and interesting to see the effects of your choices. A lot of fun achievements are in this game. Have fun trying out how to ""Paint the Streets Brown."" The graphics are fresh, the sound effects are spot on, and the gameplay is entertaining. Just when you think you're getting a chance to get bored, it reels you back in again. Very addictive. There are plans for this game to have multiplayer as it's currently in early access. Regardless, I still recommend buying this game as the only way this game can go is up. 9/10			"

								The game is fine, good plagues, good difficulty, feels just realistic enough if I don't count the geographic mistakes that really have to be solved (Chili does exist, and think about resizing South American countries guys) I can't really say it's really worth the  money yet, but the evolutions are coming and you have a big lot to do on this game until the developpers finish their work, so for the current situation you won't regret to buy it. I wait with a lot of impatience for a multiplayer, a full plague and scenarios editor, the possibility to create or fight the disease online. A few plagues are more original than the others, and the game would need more of these. Some can control minds, send back humanity to Ice age, transform peoples in zombies or even recreate the Planet of the Apes. THIS is what I want to see, because the usual plagues like bacteria, virus, nano virus, prion and bio weapon are honestly quite similar and boring. Fighting boredom on this game is important because all the real animation is just a world map and a few photos of the capital. The game really needs some real time videos showing the evolution of each threats and deceases on every countries to make it immersive.Buy it, you are safe, just do it, have fun with the lot of possibilities and trophies it propose yet, and give a chance to these developpers to show you their best, I support them for the work and help they already done, and i really invite you all to do same, you have nothing to regret. I am a demanding player so you can consider this game deserve it's price.			"

								Plague Inc:Evolved is a strategy game where you control the spread and evolution of a disease (via manipulating the DNA) with the aim of wiping out the Earth's population.If you kill everyone, you win. If they (the human race) cure you, or you run out of living hosts, you lose.The ""nastier"" your disease gets, the harder the humans will try to develop a cure.There are several different plague types (virus, bacteria, bio-weapon etc), and each has there own quirks. For example , a virus will mutate rapidly (possibly developing to be too nasty before you have infected all that many people), while the Neurax Worm can either kill or enslave the humans.Each game only takes an hour or two, and it's both entertaining and (to a degree) educational. If it has a downside, it's that the strategy for all disease types is broadly the same - you want to infect as many people as possible while trying to limit the ""nastiness"" of the disease. Once everyone/most of the world are infected, then you can ramp up the lethality.But even with this consideration, the game has a large amount of replayability, as wins unlock new genes for you to customise your disease, and the different plague types each require a somewhat different strategy. Plus there are 4 different difficulty levels to try your hand at.I've got 85 hours so far, and still have plenty to unlock, and many achievements to get (if achievements is your thing).I certainly consider I've got good value for the money.

VS mode will keep you playing until you evolve the best strategy. Co-op changes the gameplay up by a lot, and even after your disease is cured you can still help your partner to infect the rest of the world.There really is no reason i can think of to not buy this game.You'll get what you payed for and more.

Other cool features; Co-op mode (future update),  Funny news casts, share your disease and how well it did to facebook or twitter, evolve and devolve certain genes, insert genes before starting the game, amazing community creations found on  the steam workshop, make a country's government fall or make everyone go insane!!!! (etc...)  How ever, there is only one con to me, and that is the price, right now it's $15. I don't think I should have to pay a whole $15 for it, but it's worth it. It's a great strategic game.

A ton of plagues and different bacteria to choose from along with strategy to take over and beat the cure before it beats you.  You are humanitys destruction and liberator to the end. 10/10			"

												Well worth it at full price, and an absolute must buy when on sale! Originally designed for touch devices, it works exceptionally well on touch screen notebooks (and because it isn't very resource hungry).Instead of saving humanity from infectious outbreaks, you are the infection and must evolve while the world tries to eradicate you. There is a great deal of gameplay in Plague Inc and it's a very strategic sim. The first few games I lost because my diseases were simply dying off before destroying the world - and not because of human intervention. I thought about it for a few minutes and then realized I was making my disease so lethal early on it was killing off the hosts before it could fully infect the world. So I increased the transmission rate and scaled back the lethality. You have to think like that.There's even multiplayer now! You can name your diseases as well - read some other reviews to see how that turns out.			"

This game has plenty. Don't be fooled by Casual and Normal difficulties, where it first appears that the strategies are all the same.

At those difficulty levels, each plague becomes unique, and managing them to beat the cure is no easy task. You really have to plan and think your way through each, and even then random events can derail you.

								I usually don't review games, actually usually is an overstatement.. I dont think I ever have reviewed a game but this as an upcoming title and early access I feel that it deserves some recognition. This is a great rendition of Plague Inc, this reboot has brought me hours of nostalgic trial and error fun. The days playing the old flash game in school never got old I guess. The game brings from what I have experienced and stated above, hours of trial and error fun. The game is polished and looks great. A certain thing I feel I could bring up though are that in the fungus level, at least on the lower difficulties and I also believe on Brutal you can exploit the refund system to gain points by constantly refunding spore burst abilities. I love the depth and scenarios this game offers and I am looking forwards to see how it pans out. A well-spent 15 dollars and a small but great addition to my steam library.			"

I lost my first three games and it wasn't until I unleashed my fourth disease onto the world that I was able to eradicate all human life. Given this is an early access game and the enormous potential this game has, I can highly recommend this game to anyone interesting in strategy games. This game, though completely different from other strategy games, is very much about strategy, about making the right choices at the right time. Very much recommended!			"

								Fond memories of this as a browser game led me to believe that Madagascar would be the cause of my frustrations. This time it's Greenland that distrust everyone and close their port at the slightest whiff of any symptoms.The game is educational on both the infection spread and the geography of the world. And probably anger management.It's an early access game, but there is still plenty to do. I've not touched the scenarios yet, but the interaction with players on the design is a big plus.With the main game, it feels like the difficulty may be a barrier to some players and that locking content is a bit off putting when you lose your first normal game as you feel like you'll never be able to unlock anything whatsoever. Once you've got a rough strategy going (and playing games on casual unlocks helpful extras) of sneaky sneaky, kill 'em all before they can even think about starting a cure, you'll appreciate the subtle differences of the different plague types. Then will begin to find the game much more enjoyable and will start developing your own favourite techniques, such as, mega hordes of zombies invading the irritating surviving country, nasty symptom combos and mind control.The save function is useful as well, in case something doesn't go quite right or you just want to boot up a 100% infected world and wipe them out in whatever way you see fit. Whilst the world menus seemed useful, I didn't find myself using them much. Maybe they just need a little more polish. Who knows?pros--Lots of features-Steam workshop-Variety -Value for money-Quick to load-Easy to pick up and playCons-App style means it feels like it should be played on a touch screen.-Endless frustration at eagle-eyed researchers "

												An excellent simulator with sufficient complexity to keep interest up, but possessed of an interface that does not require 100% attention. Fun without loss to real world productivity. The wealth of options, not withstanding community mods, make for extensive replayability.I have not yet tried out Multi-player, however, casual solo-gaming has been very enjoyable.----Update----Whilst I do still enjoy the game, I have found a growing disatisfaction with some elements of the ""Mega Brutal"" difficulty level(I've completed much of the game at this setting beating down on a pathogen or senerio until biohazards are maxed). Whilst various combinations can be found which offer a high chance of success, the almost ""blind luck"" of infection to a handful of nortorious nations does offer little in terms of skill. The ""luck"" element of fan favourites, such as New Zealand, Madagascar and Greenland, for example, seems to have the same intrinsic failure of 4x games (where the AI doesn't actually get smarter but rather gets to push resource boundries--volume over substance or in this context luck over skill).There should be a random element to this game--any infection stream would be in the real world. However, the degree of such seems skewed at the higher difficulty levels, so much so, that the tactics used are far less important than the ""blind luck"" of a ""red"" boat or a plane.The game is still enjoyable and I still recommend it. However, the ""luck factor"" is over emphasised on higher difficulty levels and seems to be quite unrealistic.Suggestions to afford greater realisation in terms of infection routes to nations:Birds fly. Many birds fly very long distances. Many of the island nations are well within the flight range of various species of birds. Why then, using Madagascar as an example, do birds not traverse the waterway to the island? Why, in terms of the various animal and water transmission streams is there no infection route for say ""sea life"". I would expect that Greenland would be far more readily infectable if there was an animal transmission via sea life/seafood (a significant staple of many arctic nations). etc etc.			"

								The game certainly has it's moments where I was frustrated at something not working quite how I expected or the AI proving to be a bit harder one game then the other even on the same difficulty.  The interface is clean and easy to navigate.  It was clear each game what I was supposed to do with that virus type with messages at the begining and helpful hints along the way.  For most of the plagues I would have to commend the author for sticking with realism as much as possible.  Given some of these are rather out there, I was surprised how well even a zombie plague stuck to the rules of mutation and containment.There is a lot of replayability in this game, as even after you have beaten it on normal you have two harder difficulties to get through.  Beyond that there are tons of scenarios to play through of famous plagues or just weird ""what ifs"".  Each plague type has a set of prelaunch mutations you can apply to help you get started or even avoid getting cured.  The cheats are nice for when you want certain elements around but not others.  I personally enjoy giving myself a headstart in my starting country on a brutal (difficulty) game.As I said there are certainly issues.  Some games I'd have no problems infecting the whole world while the next with nothing changed I couldn't get past four countries.  There are differences each game, with weather and economy news effecting the outcomes.  I do enjoy the randomness but I don't feel it should be that random.  I have also run into a severe issue with the zombie defender bases, being able to fend off millions of almost fully upgraded zombies when I show only thirty thousand or so people left alive in the country.Even with the issues, I have enjoyed this game from the day I bought it.  And sending in reports on issues or suggestions is as easy as pushing a button in the game and writing it out.  I have shown my friends how quickly I can wipe out humanity and it makes them truely afraid.  I'm just not sure if they fear the plague or me...			"

								If you saw this game and (like I did) thought ""Well I've played the mobile game, why should I pay $15 for this?"" it would be understandable.However if that's the case, cast those inhibitions aside and consider the mobile game a ""preview"". If you didn't pay for any of the unlocks in the mobile game, this is especially a good value.You get more levels of infection, far more inuitive graphs to track your infections, genes to add some boosts to your plague, and the one that piqued my interest most; scenarios. For a game that kind of already exists, albeit in mobile form. And for a game ""still in development"" you could sink a good amount of time perfecting your viruses and maniacly grinning as you watch the human race whither away.I also sugget psyciatric help after playing this.

								For an Early Access game Plague Inc. Evolved plays fairly well and looks incredibly good compared to it's predecessor Plague Inc. for Android and IOS. The game plays exactly the same as Plague Inc. with more improved visuals and more plague types. The game puts you in the seat of a plague of your choosing and allows you to systematically destroy the human race. I am incredibly excited to see what is going to happen with the multiplayer being added later on in the games developement (Perhaps Cure vs. Plague or Plague vs. Plague).See my full review at:

								Isn't a awesome game at all, I guess that the idea of games captives more than the game itself. The game can turn boring after 3 hours of game but still you have a lot of things to do inside of it, also the multiplayer system was been implanted and the game gained some more diversity of what to do.But also the game isn't that bad, I guess you can spend some time playing it if you don't have anything better to play, BUT I highly recommend this game if it is only on sale(This game have a more-or-less recommended rate)			"

								Literally one of the best games I've ever played! I played a game similar to this a few years back, but this game gets really into the stragetic genre. You have to plan where you start your virus and evolve it in certain ways to make sure it survives. If you make it extremely infectious, then it will infect the whole world extremely quickly and it will be really hard to get points to be able to evolve. So eventually it will get eradicated. If you make it extremely deadly, it will kill all of it's hosts. You will have to strageticly plan out the way your virus evolves, or you loose! Awesome game! Still being in developement, I'm sure there will be tons upon tons of new features in the furture. Defiantly worth your money. I really recommend it! 10/10!			"

								Is this game worth buying? In my opinion: Yes,here is why:This is an advanced recreation of mobile phone game Plague Inc., which I stopped playing exactly when I bought this game. The game comes with more features than the mobile version, like Versus Multiplayer(recently came out), Scenario Creator, Scenarios from other players as well as sharing your own created ones. Ndemic Creations also plan creating the Co-op multiplayer, which may get interesting... unless you know that you have no friends that play Plague Inc. Evolved...Graphics are much more advanced than in the mobile version, along with 3d zooming in, each country has their own picture.Most of negative reviews which say ""Almost every type of disease has almost the same grid"" - did they try scenarios? Some of the scenarios have entirely different symptoms, transmissions and abilities, some of them just change the gameplay a bit.This game has no DLC(yet), while on the mobile version, to get Necroa Virus, Neurax Worm, Scenarios, you need to pay some amount.This game is also really informative if you think. Playing as pathogen, which can kill humanity, just like in real game, it evolves, causes damages to the world.			"

								The game certainly has it's moments where I was frustrated at something not working quite how I expected or the AI proving to be a bit harder one game then the other even on the same difficulty.  The interface is clean and easy to navigate.  It was clear each game what I was supposed to do with that virus type with messages at the begining and helpful hints along the way.  For most of the plagues I would have to commend the author for sticking with realism as much as possible.  Given some of these are rather out there, I was surprised how well even a zombie plague stuck to the rules of mutation and containment.There is a lot of replayability in this game, as even after you have beaten it on normal you have two harder difficulties to get through.  Beyond that there are tons of scenarios to play through of famous plagues or just weird ""what ifs"".  Each plague type has a set of prelaunch mutations you can apply to help you get started or even avoid getting cured.  The cheats are nice for when you want certain elements around but not others.  I personally enjoy giving myself a headstart in my starting country on a brutal (difficulty) game.As I said there are certainly issues.  Some games I'd have no problems infecting the whole world while the next with nothing changed I couldn't get past four countries.  There are differences each game, with weather and economy news effecting the outcomes.  I do enjoy the randomness but I don't feel it should be that random.  I have also run into a severe issue with the zombie defender bases, being able to fend off millions of almost fully upgraded zombies when I show only thirty thousand or so people left alive in the country.Even with the issues, I have enjoyed this game from the day I bought it.  And sending in reports on issues or suggestions is as easy as pushing a button in the game and writing it out.  I have shown my friends how quickly I can wipe out humanity and it makes them truely afraid.  I'm just not sure if they fear the plague or me...			"

												An excellent simulator with sufficient complexity to keep interest up, but possessed of an interface that does not require 100% attention. Fun without loss to real world productivity. The wealth of options, not withstanding community mods, make for extensive replayability.I have not yet tried out Multi-player, however, casual solo-gaming has been very enjoyable.----Update----Whilst I do still enjoy the game, I have found a growing disatisfaction with some elements of the ""Mega Brutal"" difficulty level(I've completed much of the game at this setting beating down on a pathogen or senerio until biohazards are maxed). Whilst various combinations can be found which offer a high chance of success, the almost ""blind luck"" of infection to a handful of nortorious nations does offer little in terms of skill. The ""luck"" element of fan favourites, such as New Zealand, Madagascar and Greenland, for example, seems to have the same intrinsic failure of 4x games (where the AI doesn't actually get smarter but rather gets to push resource boundries--volume over substance or in this context luck over skill).There should be a random element to this game--any infection stream would be in the real world. However, the degree of such seems skewed at the higher difficulty levels, so much so, that the tactics used are far less important than the ""blind luck"" of a ""red"" boat or a plane.The game is still enjoyable and I still recommend it. However, the ""luck factor"" is over emphasised on higher difficulty levels and seems to be quite unrealistic.Suggestions to afford greater realisation in terms of infection routes to nations:Birds fly. Many birds fly very long distances. Many of the island nations are well within the flight range of various species of birds. Why then, using Madagascar as an example, do birds not traverse the waterway to the island? Why, in terms of the various animal and water transmission streams is there no infection route for say ""sea life"". I would expect that Greenland would be far more readily infectable if there was an animal transmission via sea life/seafood (a significant staple of many arctic nations). etc etc.			"

								This is a good addicting game for a early access game. It has ALOT of features im exited to see. The multiplayer is what i REALLY want. And im exited for their planned Workshop thing. People will make their own diseases and plagues by using their planned Custom Creations kit. I am always jumping up and down like a 2 yr old on an Extreame surgar high, waiting for the next update to bring the Necroa virus or the workshop. I reccomend this to players who like flash games on the internet and strategy games.But there are a few things i have against this game.Its way easier than the original mobile game and i could beat it in under an hour again if you dared me to. I beat it in 6 hours before, and the other 2 hours ive played it is just re-beating it all on mega brutal,(which is waaay to easy for the hardest difficulty) and messing with the recently added Neurax worm.(which again, is still to easy and ive beaten a bunch of times)If it were me, i would rate this a 7/10 or a 6/10 because it is really fun at the beggining but you can beat it in 30 minutes if you really try. I personaly cannot wait until it adds the workshop. It would make tons of oppertunities for extra gameplay. Who knows what people could come up with? (The Last Of Us fungus? hint hint.....) When they add that, i would probrably change my 6 to 7 out of 10 to a 9 to 10 out of 10. The gameplay would never end with millions of players uploading and developing their own custom diseases for others and themselves to enjoy. Again, who knows what could happen? What could you create to infect the world when it comes out? *coughs* ugh.... man i dont feel good....*dies*EDIT: For most of you who are saying ""wel dis gaem waz 1 dallar on da app store hur dur"" the plague inc app was free when you downloaded it, i know. the reason why its 14$ here is because they give you ALL the special features you would have to BUY on the app version, free. If you bought everything on the app verson, it would be about 14 to 20 dollars. So technically, 14$ is a fair price for a game that gives all the dlc to you on purchase :p			"

								Isn't a awesome game at all, I guess that the idea of games captives more than the game itself. The game can turn boring after 3 hours of game but still you have a lot of things to do inside of it, also the multiplayer system was been implanted and the game gained some more diversity of what to do.But also the game isn't that bad, I guess you can spend some time playing it if you don't have anything better to play, BUT I highly recommend this game if it is only on sale(This game have a more-or-less recommended rate)			"

												Relaxed I tried the game, thinking to myself ""let's just try this for a few minutes. Doesn't look like much anyway"" And then I found myself playing it on and on for the next hours. It's strange how much satisfaction it gives when your virus manages to wipe out the whole of humanity. I thoroughly like this game. It's simple but challenging at the same time. It's very amusing :)			"

								Philanthropist beware, this game will task you with taking control of a deadly infection that is set to destroy all of humanity. Bacteria, viruses and brain worms alike will surely bring an untimely end to mankind if you play it right, but one slip up and those pesky little survivors on Madagascar or Greenland will have themselves a good time repopulating the Earth. You get to evolve and nurture your own personal plague every step of the way from patient zero to a massive worldwide outbreak. The mechanics vary significantly with every different type of disease, so it takes a while for the gameplay to start becoming repetitive, and overall Plague Inc: Evolved feels like a well polished time killer game.Oh and there are zombies.

								One of the best simulators I have played in a long time. It seems easy at first but its difficulty get's ramped up quickly. It takes time, patience and skill to evolve your simple little disaster into a full blown pandemic. I found the zombie virus is quite a fun task to play and quite difficult to get everyone killed by it, not only can  you infect people and turn them into zombies, you can also control the hordes and get the power to make the dead corpses rise up again. The question is can you kill off the world before humanity has enough time to fight back and survive all the odds, you will have to play to find out. ^_^			"

								I often wonder wonder what was going through the mind of the person who came up with the idea for this game...Like, ""I can't think of an idea for a game... so let's just kill the other developers.""Then he/she gets a response: ""Better idea... let's kill all of humanity.""And so, Plague Inc. was born, the only game that lets you be the cause of death for approximately 7.125 billion people.But you see, it didn't stop there.  These people decided to evolve it, make it better, make it harder, and make it more deadly... and hence, Plague Inc: Evolved was created.  Now, it's still a work in progress, which means I am sure they will come up with much more humane ways to kill off humanity, or just enslave them....Overall, I give this a solid 10/10. Played it on iOS, Android, and now for PC. Loved every version and the game is well worth the money.  I haven't talked to the developer(s), but I'm sure they're great people.			"

There's a fine line between balancing out the lethality versus the spreadability versus the abilities to fight against cures.  It's not simple, yet it is. There's noa ction.

								After naming a plague ""My Girlfriend"" and watching it spread to hundreds of people in the United States before spreading to the UK and France, I'm brought back to fond memories of my girlfriend spreading to hundreds of people in the United States, the UK and France. The realism of this game is unmatched.""World of Warcraft"" started in the United States and, admittedly, made a detour in Australia before spreading to and taking over Japan and China.Plague Inc: Evolved kidnapped the old Pandemic browser game, tied it to a chair and waterboarded it until it revealed its addicting secrets. They took everything right with the classic and expanded on that content, most notably, many more interesting disease types.I think everybody's favorite right now (though I haven't played to see the zombie plague in action) is the Neurax Worm; it's the one type (again; haven't seen the zombie plague yet) that has its own specific symptoms tree which leads to hilarious conclusions, as well as many more unique properties. I was a bit disappointed in the fact that all of the other plague types have identical symptom trees (you'd expect a complex prion or bio-weapon to attack the body differently than a bacteria or virus), though I'm sure that they plan on creating more variety as the game matures, which is alluded to nicely by the Neurax Worm's tree.People wary about early access: the game has yet to lock up on me, and other than a few display glitches with deaths and infected counts, it runs rather smoothly.If I had to give one good reason to not purchase this game so it doesn't look like I'm hyping it up, I would say it's downfall is its replay value. Of course there's many different ways you can kill the world and ways in which you can choose to infect, but after one or two playthroughs, you can very well have seen and purchased everything. Until you get to the Neurax Worm, and like I said, I would stay optimistic that the other plague types will be updated with specific symptom trees later on.Is it worth $15? No, but is a $7.00 chipotle burrito that's going to leave bloody skid marks on your underwear worth it? No, but you eat the chipotle anyway, cause you're a fatty fat mcfatterson. Just like how you're on Steam and honestly trying to ponder the $15 like an investment banker purchasing futures. It costs like $40.00 to simulate driving a train. It costs $60.00 to shoot those gerd-dern Soviets. It's free to play TF2. The world doesn't make sense. You'll spend a lot more money on dumber things, like drinks for girls who'll never sleep with me. Consider this buying yourself a $15 drink where you can sit back, relax, and exterminate the world with a disease called ""Snapchat.""			"

												Bio terrorist manual 101. Use viruses, bacterias, bio weapons, zombies, apes, vampires, worms etc. to infect and kill humanity. But watch out, because humans will fight back by creating cure for your disease or in other ways (depending on the disease type). This game offers different tactics with different types of diseases and it even offers you to create your own disease. Singleplayer mode offers main game, scenarios, custom scenarios, speed runs. There is multiplayer mode too. It offers you to play in co-op mode to infect and kill whole world and 1 vs 1 mode.If you think that it's time to purge the humanity, this is your manual.			"

												It's a good game, for a low price, working on any computer and OS (Linux too, thanks dev). You will have to manage the propagation of a virus or a bacterium, trying to infect and kill all mankind, but governement will take mesures to prevent the propagation and will try to find a cure. That's time pursuit, to be faster than cure research.Pros : very addictive at firsts games. Fast and easy play. Good graphics. Full stats per countries. Lots of scenarios (including Rise of Ape and Vampires). True symptoms names and behaviors. Dynamic propagation (birds, ships, planes..., depending of your strategy). Cool game. Cons : after 10 or 20 games, you will find it a bit repetitive, as it's quite a small game. You unlock some bonus, but game remain the same, then you can play in multi-players. Some end game failure with harbors locks are not really realist, and it make then impossible to win. Should be better with deeper biological parameters and choice, there's not so much choices, so it's quite easy, but you can try harder difficulty. Well, for a low price, it's a good game (8 or 9 bucks), more it will be too expensive.			"

												All in all, I was scared to buy this game. When I first saw it on the steam store, I was confused, as I thought the mobile version was just fine, and a more costly steam version was not necessary. However, I stand corrected. This game is in fact different from the mobile version, overall having a better feel and look. I could not ramble off all the differences if I tried, but overall, this may or may not be worth the higher cost depending on the person. I overall am in support of this game, but keep in mind this game does not have any monumental changes from the mobile version other than looking much, much better.Overall: 7/10			"

												If you enjoy a fun and addictive strategy game where your goal is to kill everyone on the planet, then this is the game for you. You get 7 different types of plagues to spread and 4 special plagues with complete revamped gameplay that will keep you on your toes. There are many achievements and scenarios to keep you company, and a feature to make and upload your own custom scenario. Thea game also comes with multiplayer, so you and a friend can either fight against each other of play a  round of co op to destroy humanity together. Overall, this is a very fun strategy game that will make you a plague expert in no time.			"

												If you like watching little red dots pop up throughout the globe knowing that those red dots are killing humanity, this is the game for you! It was fun for me to watch the world end becase of the rarest pepe, and all those little dots are very theraputic. If there is someone you dislike, or you just feel like wiping out the human race, this is the place to do it! Ive found that the save button is a little glitchy, but if you stick to it, you wont need it! That is all I have to say about this game, so get out there and infect some people, and destroy some governments!I hate greenland.			"

								I used to play this game a lot, both on the online flash version, and on mobile and now I am happy to find out that they have made a much superiour version for Steam. Firstly, let's get one thing out of the way - you won't be playing this for 8 hour marathons. This game is best enjoyed in quick 30-60 minute timespans, however, you can expect to go back to it often. As far as gameplay goes, it's very enjoyable, even relaxing, which you can consider black humour. The gameplay revolves around creating a plague, infecting as many people as possible, then either killing off humanity, or enslaving it, depending on what you are using as a plague. The plagues are varied, and while some are just variations on your standard bacteria with a twist, a lot of them, in perticular ones such as the Necroa Virus and Neurax Worm change gameplay in very significant ways. This helps to keep it fresh.A point of note is that this game costs a dollar on the app store for mobile, and on Steam it's 14 euros. While the steam version is superiour, I wouldn't say it is 14 times better. Regardless, still worth your money if you are into the idea. I'll deffo be playing this more in the future, and can't wait for custom scenarios and multiplayer.			"

												The most morbid RTS I have yet seen. An RTS where you cannot command units. You are a disease. You are fighting against a simulation of disease response by human organizations. Your goal is to kill all humans before being cured. Your methods are choosing Transmision vector, Symptoms, and resistance to climate/drugs/research mutations. The choice of when to mutate how is interesting and fun to experiment with as you interact with the simulated global population. Expect to lose often as you feel out how the game responds to stimuli. Games can be very short, and there's a mild clicker aspect to keep you engaged in what would otherwise be a very hands off game. Pause often to keep up with clicking things and to spend mutation points at precise times.This game's mobile origins show, but its enjoyable enough to spend a few hours on trying to wipe out humanity.

												I've played this for quite some time now, both on Steam and in my mobile devices, and I have to say that I'm surprised as to how Ndemic Creations keeps the game fresh with different plague-archetypes and scenarios -- from the micro-management of the newly developed Shadow Plague to the brain-eating difficulty of the Necroa Virus.The game also boasts a multiplayer mode now and it officially supports scenario mods so if you're getting burned out from beating the game on solo and/or trying to get the unlockable skills, you can compete or ally yourself with people around the world to destroy humanity.I definitely recommend this game for its full price, moreso if it is on sale.

												Indeed this is an adicctive game, you just keep playing making some nasty diseases, putting them silly names and laughing that they killed, zombified or slaved the population of Earth, and the plus of the ""Simian Flu"" disease (the same as the one in The Planet of the Apes movies) just makes it better.The only thing I don´t like is that you have to be very patient and the game doesn´t have visuals more than a few animations when you see your disease, but aside of that, it´s a great game.9/10 Would kill the Earth over and over.

								It's one thing to rule the world. But how about we mix it up and try to kill every living human on the planet? Creating your own killer plague is truley fun and makes you think on how to kill th emost effective way. Kill everyone within moments of contact? Or perhaps infect the world and hit the kill switch? Maybe create the greatest zombie outbreak? So many ways to kill off humanity. Zombie mode is easily a selling point since it had my most intense experience.The survivers held up in India and parts of South America. My lost lil'batch of zombies in Australia. One final upgrade. Have my zombies travel by water. Play the waiting game watch as the hold in India falls and my army grows and I crush the remaining humans. Moments like this makes you just smile and feel like an evil mastermind  seeking the end of the world.			"

								I really love this game. I'm going to be going to school for infectious diseases so I'm kind of biased when it comes to this genre but I really do believe others will find it as fun as I do. This version is a lot more complex than the free online Flash game (I'm not sure whether or not it's made by the same people though) that has the same concept. If you liked the Flash version then you'll love this. The Flash one, however, get's kind of boring once you've beaten it the first time but Plague Inc: Evolved allows you to unlock items and options that increase the depth of your gameplay. By doing this, even after you've killed all of humanity once, there is still tons left in the game for players to want to come back to. Unlike the Flash version, you won't get bored after your first time winning as there will still be so much more to expreience. Instead of giving you all the options right at the beginning like the Flash version, you actually have to work for things in Plague Inc: Evolved. So far I've played around 36 minutes, which on the Flash version would have been long enough for me to beat the entire game, but with Plague Inc: Evolved 36 minutes is only enough to expreience the very beginning. I think one of the other really important features of this game is that, although you don't need to have a high end PC to play it on its highest settings, it still looks beautiful. If this is the kind of game you're into (puzzle, statagey, infetious diseases) or you enjoyed the online Flash version then I highly recommend buying Plague Inc: Evolved... you won't be disappointed. It's well worth the $15.			"

								I don't have very much to say about this game because there's not much that needs to be said. All that needs to be said is this: This. Game. Is. Awesome!It's a greaat plague simulator with a variety of different pathogen types, something I valuse in a game. On top of that, it had very nice looking terrain on display in addition to some music and ocassional crying in the background to go with the theme.As if that wasn't enough by it self, you can have even more variety by making your very own custom scenario to play, or you can play someone else's masterpiece.Overall, this is most certainly an A+ game.

								Thought I'd finally post a review of this. A great game that can be got for cheap these days, and that you can easily spend dozens and dozens of hours on, especially now that the versus is finally out. I've heard people compare it to the mobile version, but that comparison just doesn't hold any water. Long story short, if you like strategy, if you like intriguing scenarios based on both real-life diseases (Small Pox, Black Plague, Swine Flu) and not-so-real-life ones (zombies, brain controlling parasites, Christmas disease XD ) then get this game and prepare to spend (not waste!) a great many hours on this, as I have. =)			"

								This game is probably the best mobile game that was turned into a console/pc game. But... if your looking from inovation or deviation from the app version, you wont get much from it. If your arent a fan of the mobile version, skip this because it is nearly the exact same, but it comes with the necroa virus, neurax worm, time trials, scenarios, and all the other bells and whistles that come with it. What this game gets that is new is multiplayer, even though it isnt out, they promise us  co-op and vs. modes. Also, peolpe will be able to make their own custom scenarios, which I personally am excited for. Untill they add new viruses, scenarios, and finish the game, only purchase it when they fully release the game.                                          -Saterminator13			"

								One of the best simulators I have played in a long time. It seems easy at first but its difficulty get's ramped up quickly. It takes time, patience and skill to evolve your simple little disaster into a full blown pandemic. I found the zombie virus is quite a fun task to play and quite difficult to get everyone killed by it, not only can  you infect people and turn them into zombies, you can also control the hordes and get the power to make the dead corpses rise up again. The question is can you kill off the world before humanity has enough time to fight back and survive all the odds, you will have to play to find out. ^_^			"

												If you want to lose buckets of time evolving and chasing secondary objectives and challenges, Plague Inc. Evolved is very unique in that it also teaches you epidemology at the same time, putting you in the driver's seat of a world-threatening pathogen in its quest to spread over and extinguish the breadth of human existence. You can start as contagious but cautiously benign, and then upgrade to a killing level when you have the world under your thumb, or you can come out like gangbusters with immediate killing potential and race against time to wipe out the planet.With constant updates, an incredible mod community, and limitless potential for fun, you'll find yourself stuck playing it again and again just to see how far you can go this time. Whether you enjoy the game for the achievements or you just want some fun way to spend ten minutes, this game is the tops.			"

												Interesting game!Plague Inc. Evolved is a really sick idea that has the potential to be an interesting strategy game. I'm really not into the bubble clicking thing but this can be removed later in the game: I still feel this may turn off more ""serious"" strategy gamers with it's free mobile app feel and that really I don't think that it adds anything in terms of game-play: I suspect it's there to add a sense of urgency and to keep the player's attention focused, but I really think that it would be better replaced with something that feels a bit less cheap.That being said, there's clearly a lot of depth here. The game ramps up the difficulty pretty quickly and there are a good few options for altering the core game pretty significantly.I've not felt particularly interested in sustained gameplay: it hasn't totally grabbed me in all honesty. Personally I find that the fact you can play through a single player game in a half hour or less very appealing. I recommend the game on this basis, that it's a good quick strategy fix. I'll be putting more hours into this But it's pretty unique as far as I can tell and it's a worthwhile addition to any strategy gamer's collection.EDIT:I've noted the comments below and edited this review accordingly: further proof that you should probably research something before low-rating. I do stand by my original comment that it still feels like a free-to-play game, albiet it a very nicely presented and polished one. My main gripe was the bubble clicking thing and since that is something you can get around I've changed my recommendation. I still think it needs to be removed for the reasons stated above.			"

This version is a lot more complex than the free online Flash game (I'm not sure whether or not it's made by the same people though) that has the same concept. If you liked the Flash version then you'll love this. The Flash one, however, get's kind of boring once you've beaten it the first time but Plague Inc: Evolved allows you to unlock items and options that increase the depth of your gameplay. By doing this, even after you've killed all of humanity once, there is still tons left in the game for players to want to come back to. Unlike the Flash version, you won't get bored after your first time winning as there will still be so much more to expreience. Instead of giving you all the options right at the beginning like the Flash version, you actually have to work for things in Plague Inc: Evolved. So far I've played around 36 minutes, which on the Flash version would have been long enough for me to beat the entire game, but with Plague Inc: Evolved 36 minutes is only enough to expreience the very beginning. I think one of the other really important features of this game is that, although you don't need to have a high end PC to play it on its highest settings, it still looks beautiful. If this is the kind of game you're into (puzzle, statagey, infetious diseases) or you enjoyed the online Flash version then I highly recommend buying Plague Inc: Evolved... you won't be disappointed. It's well worth the $15.			"

												Greenland always my genocide.I always infect every other inch of the planet, and not a single person in Greenland has got my virus. So I just sit. Staring at the ONE PORT at Greenland (there is no airport to get to or leave Greenland). Then they close the port. Once this happens, it is impossible to win. But I still like the game, because when I start in Greenland, I can kill the population of the planet, which I enjoy.			"

								For a game in active development, I am very impressed. I was instantly addicted to the single - player modes, and have made some progress in the main game. However, I imagine that it would take me a while to unlock all pathogen types etc. meaning the game will last a while. I look forward to the completion of the multiplayer mode, as I think this will be a very impressive feature if it works out well. Great job!			"

								Coming from someone who didn't buy the Pandemic version of the game and someone who is into different strategy games, I really enioy this. I feel that you can get enough hours out of the game that the price as it stands now is justified. The way the game is now, without the promised multiplayer, already can give you tens of hours of playing time which is really all I can ask for out of a game like this. Although only a few hours in, I find countless reasons why I should get back on the game instead of doing other things. Only having access to one type of disease from the start encourages you to keep playing in order to unlock the others, among other things like obtaining achievements or even just conquering different difficulty levels and testing different strategies gives the game an incredible amount of replay value. I absolutely dig the simple but sweet design of the game as well. Something about playing on a simple map in HD with good particle effects just is really fun. The menus are very easy to navigate and understand and overall it looks really polished. Some people claim that this game can be boring in the sense that they claim all you are doing is clicking and waiting, but I disagree. Although this game doesn't require as much attention as some other games that I have played, you clearly make strategic decisions throughout your game in order to go about spreading your disease but at the same time trying to keep a low profile so you are not noticed before spreading the entire globe. You are continuously involved by clicking bubbles that appear on the screen for ""DNA points"" that you use to go about ""leveling up"" your disease through different transmission methods, abilities, and symptoms. Lastly, I enjoy reading and reacting to some of the random ""news"" events which may contribute to my playstyle. For example if bird migration was up, I may consider using my DNA points to make transmission with birds more effective among many other things.I suppose I can go on all day with this but i'll just finish with saying that I am excited to check out the multiplayer in the future and finally just see how this game turns out when it is officially released.

								God made diseases....They ranged from diseases like Rabies first known in 2300BC then Cholera in 400BC and then after these early years of playing on mega brutal difficulty God still couldn't beat mega brutal difficulty and then rage quit until he started playing again with a new disease called ebola which he first created in 1976. Since then god never made a new disease that trolled the world on such a large scale...especially Africa and more specifically Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. God wanted all to know though that the story is found in the page 69 of the bible and has decided his rating would be a solid 420/10.			"

												Bio terrorist manual 101. Use viruses, bacterias, bio weapons, zombies, apes, vampires, worms etc. to infect and kill humanity. But watch out, because humans will fight back by creating cure for your disease or in other ways (depending on the disease type). This game offers different tactics with different types of diseases and it even offers you to create your own disease. Singleplayer mode offers main game, scenarios, custom scenarios, speed runs. There is multiplayer mode too. It offers you to play in co-op mode to infect and kill whole world and 1 vs 1 mode.If you think that it's time to purge the humanity, this is your manual.			"

On top of that, it had very nice looking terrain on display in addition to some music and ocassional crying in the background to go with the theme.As if that wasn't enough by it self, you can have even more variety by making your very own custom scenario to play, or you can play someone else's masterpiece.Overall, this is most certainly an A+ game.

								Tricky game and fun.You play a plague and have to wipe out all of humanity.  Simple enough sounding...Some you can keep from being noticed until you have them infected then go virulent.Others you 'mutate' and must compensate or they'll catch on too soon - shutting down ports and such so you can't infect the world...Still others, they come out knowing you're there and trying to cure your plague from the start.Several different scenarios including conquering the world for the apes.

												It's a simple game, where you take the role of a microbe and try and wipe out humanity (or enslave it if you happen to be a brain parasite).It is also really quite enjoyable, and there's definitely scope for replayability (you often need to complete it in a certain way as one microbe to unlock another which uses a different approach).I'd recommend picking it up in the sale; you definitly will not be disappointed. Little puzzled why it's spec requirements seem so high for what it is though.			"

								Plague Inc Evolved allows you to release a virus somewhere on to the earth and spread it to other countries. The virus can do this by itself, with enough time (you will absolutely fail in the end), but you can also evolve it by upgrading several of the many upgrades. For example, you can let birds or other animals and rodents carry the virus to other places and countries, or you can make it less vulnerable to humid environments. The goal is to infect and kill every person on the earth, by all means necessary. And all of this is done in a very realistic way, and it's a blast to play, let me tell you. Still could payless on the IOS but still a great game. 10/10			"

								Well, while this game is fun, it has a steep learning curve. I managed to infect the entire world without being lethal, then when I went to lethal, the game didn't throw up many DNA points, which are needed to upgrade your virus, so I wasn't able to upgrade the virus with the ability ""Genetic Reshuffling 1"" which slows down research for a cure, and sets back said research. By the time it reached 92% completed, I'd only killed about 600 million people. So beware of that.Really though, this is a game that I'd keep on playing, even when everything is unlocked.			"

								Have you played pandemic 1 or even 2? (and possibly Plague inc)well, you could say that this game 'evolves' upon the others; it features alot more custimisation, diseases and looks much prettier with the 3d models and 'hud'.The way plagues spread is very realistic, and it can both terrify you and excite you as you watch how humanity chokes on their last breath with each enhancement of your plague.*shivers* ahhh, it's that brilliant; but it gets better especially when you get your hands on the 'neurax worm'. oh how amazing it is :'D  Just the way it  'hugs' your brain and manipulates your every move, you can even make humanity think your their God!Zombies: yep, the things that eat your brain, well... used too. Now they just blood thirsty decaying bodies that CLAW AT YOUR FACE! Oh, and hopefully you know that it's a strategy game.Thank you for  reading this 'review' and hopefully you buy the game, it'll really help the developers to make this great game even better!On a side note: it features a planet of the apes disease :D			"

								Play God for once in this brilliant strategy game about contagion and extinction.Plague Inc. Evolved sets you, a human being behind the keyboard, in the world of viral outbreaks, bacteriological contagion, and man-made epidemics set from whatever date you start playing all the way to years from now, in which your virus can either destroy or be destroyed.The game offers various scenarios with your choice of different types of plague to choose from. Each plague has a genomic upgrade, unlocked throughout your playtime, which could make your plague superior. After that, it's all about location, location, location. Any country can start this epidemic and every country can be infected, but no country is safe.Currently, as of Aug. 4, 2014(the date of this review), it's under construction to include a few new ways of transmitting diseases, to symptoms that could resemble everyone's favorite apocalypse, to abilities that could hinder the efforts of curing diseases, but that's not all. You will be able to create NEW SCENARIOS in the custom scenarios slot. You can mutate the common cold or make Bedbugs become the prime transmitter of your disease or redo the black plague(even though that's already a scenario in the game) which kills in a month.Overall, the game is not complete, and with current games all for flash, bang, boom, instead of thought provoking gameplay, you won't keep entertained if you're simply a COD fan. However, if you want to play God, doom the earth to suffer the worst plague of mankind, and feel like a villain, then what are you waiting for??? YOU MOTHER, GET UP! COME ON! GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS!!!			"

The big amount of possible DNA mutations give you a lot of posibilities to develop your plague. It is a nice idea to reverse roles of all zombie and bio-weapon szenarios and due to the wide range of plagues, szenarios and difficulties the game has a very high replayability.Hope I could help you.Cheers,Gecko			"

								  I started out playing this game through various free flash gaming sites back in high school and continued playing it on mobile devices well into 2013. This is THE definitive version of Plague Inc. Essentially it simulates the capabilities that a pathogen could have to spread and wipe out the human race. A wide array of infection options await ranging anywhere from the common virus to prions, bioweapons, fungi, and even some more interesting fictional ones like the undead plague, brain-invading worms, and with the most recent update the Simian Flu from the Planet of the Apes movies.  Add to the fact of how addictive this game can be and its totally worth the price.			"

The UI is crisp and nice to look at and there are many great features such as the ability to see how the countries are coping throughout the years of your pathogen spreading. It is easily worth the $15 dollars as is and I cannt wait to see what is added in the future, for a full gameplay and rough review of the game I have made a 3 part series on a casual playthrough of the bacteria pathogen that you can all check out if you need any reasurance in whether or not to buy it!Part 1 link;

								---------------------------------------------------------------I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST.---------------------------------------------------------------OK seriously, how can something so bad be so much fun? This game is so wrong but at the same time so ♥♥♥♥ing great. TL;DR below.So you have a disease which can be in the form of many things (virus, bacteria, worm, and like 10 more). You choose one form and start a game.You infect one person in a country of your choice. Then you start modifying the disease. So it can spread and kill. Add abilities to increase transmission rates between humans or add strength to the virus so it's harder to eradicate.You can modify it further to slow down the cure research progress. Oh yes, rich countries are working on a cure. You didn't just expect them to sit on their asses and watch did you? Canada, Japan, Germany, ♥♥♥♥ing health fascists send planes around the world to spread cure research.As your disease spreads and kills more people,♥♥♥♥♥♥happens. Borders, sea ports and airports start closing down. Previously issued drug safeguards are removed in the name of a faster research.Martial laws are put in effect. Governments fall, people rage around killing, looting, dying.And all you do is, WATCH.TL;DR:- The game has a high replayability value since there are different game modes and scenarios.- There is stuff to unlock- For some reason I like the soundtrack- I like the sound effects- Simple design- Accurate country populations- Funny news bulletins if you read them- Advance into harder and more interesting game modes- Kill the whole world with disease mutatingThis game is a unique must-have. It should be in everybody's library. It's really fun. It turned even ME, a born humanist, into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrorist.			"

								This is my number one Favorite Strategy game out right now. The update this game Brings in so much more Unique stuff and the Mechanics to the game is outstanding. And the Graphics is Great! Ndemic did an Awesome job with everything! The main point of the game is that you are a Pathogen who has to wipe out humanity. Your goal is you have to think about how you are gonna Spread it and kill before they develop a Cure. And for anyone who has played Pandemic 2, this is a game for you. I played Pandemic, so seeing this game caught my eye. All Pathogens do have strengths and weaknesses like for example, Viruses have a Much higher chance to Mutate than any other Pathogen, but it can be detected more easily. The Bacteria can have a Greater chance to surviving in every climate, I didn't see a negative effect there. The Nano virus can spread Extremly fast, but the world Cure starts as soon as you start spreading ( I am still trying to beat it on Brutal ). These examples show how the mechanics for these Pathogens and how different they are from one another.You can also now do real life Scenarios. And they're pretty Cool and Difficult as well. I am still trying to beat the Black Death on normal because when it starts Spreading, they close the Borders off of noninfected Places like Islands and there is no way to spread it to them. But that's not a Way to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. If that literally happened in real life they would close the Borders. It's a Stimulation.And the Jokes can be funny in the game. One of them says that the new game Plaque inc. Evolved went Viral. Or it says a Guy Sued himself. The jokes can be pretty Funny.And you DONT need a High end Graphics card to run it. Like the Specification says, you can run this thing on Integrated Graphics. And yes you can, just don't turn Anti-aliasing and you will be fine.But I just have to say, if you want a Strategy game where you really need to plan everything, this is a game for you. Ndemic James, Great job on everything. Thank you for making this awesome game. I really enjoy it.			"

								Wow.  This game is just amazing.  It is a game where you create a disease and destroy the world, just without gore! It is really fun if you are into strategy games! I highly recommend this game.  Plus, you have the Scenario Creator, so you can make your own diseases or worlds, like lets say you want to make a world with a higher population, or a new disease, you can do it and post it on the Steam Workshop! I have played this game for a while, and I just thought this might help you in considering in buying this game or not.  If you do buy it, I sure hope you enjoy this game! One more thing: this game started on Apple and Android devices, so get it on there if you love the game and are on the go! :)			"

								This Game is quite fun and very addictive. There is a lot of content above and beyond the flash versions and where at first the game play may seem redundantly the same over and over again - it really isn't. The differences from disease to disease are subtle and it is making the subtleties of the game work for you that make this game worth it. These subtleties can make the game very very hard at times.Is it worth $15?  . . . maybe.At first no. It is a simple game without too much flare. However it is the type of game you will pull up when you got some time to spare or when you want you something simple to play. It IS the type of game you will come back to and as such it will be worth the money over time. Especially since it is still being refined and more content will be released.If you can get it on sale (for $10 or less)  it is unquestionably worth the money.			"

I had so much fun with the Planet of the Apes virus, haha Best $8 I ever spent on a Steam sale for a random game I had never heard of really.9/10, -1 simply because with more added features, like being able to have my apes rampage in that special scenario to destroy humanity instead of the virus, with just a few flame effects or something, would have made my day.

								Plague inc evolved comes from a genre of games dedicated to real time strategy but on an information bases dealing strictly with graphs and interactive maps.It stems from two free flash games that came out in the early 2000's called Pandemic and Pandemic 2. Plague inc is essentially the same game except presented much better and with far more in depth features that lacked in the flash game.Plague Inc evolved is simple and easy to navigate. This however does not mean the game is at all easy to beat, it is very challenging and unrelenting in handing you defeats for poor strategy choices. This is a good thing. This isn't a menu game you would find on facebook that rewards you endlessly and gives no consequences for neglectful choices and behaviour. A victory in this game is something that is relished and feels authentic as a seal of approval, proving your strategy works. Its also very realistic (in the default state of the disease only) I find it very enjoyable reading the news headlines and seeing how each nation reacted as new studies and new symptoms of the disease surfaced, The visual cues below showing how much chaos you have wrought on a nation is also very satisfyingMy experience in Plague Inc Evolved is a very positive one, I myself have bought this game for a few of my steam friends and they all agree this is a very well made game pointing out the same good qualities that i had mentioned previously. The choices among different plague scenarios and types as well as the ability to tinker the starting genetic make up of your plague can radically change how the game plays out forcing you to adopt a new strategy that was counter productive in a previous version of that same disease.Visuals are good, the music is great and sets the mood of your nafarious goal quite splendidly. It however relies heavily on imagination playing off the description of symptoms and side effects of combined symptoms. Those that aren't great at visualizing things in their mind probably won't enjoy the game. Those who want live action probably won't enjoy the game. For those who do like using their imagination. You will be pleased when you read that your disease has begun making people defecate themselves in public due to diarrhea and insanity spreading the disease much more quickly. The Types of diseases are quite staggering and they continuously add more all the time so its always going to be fun. The only complaint I have on the level of realism is simply the homogeneous properties of a nation, All of the nation is subject to to certain environmental and cultural effects that simply make no sense to me. Sure China does have the biggest cities out there, but that doesn't mean that the whole country resides in urban areas. If they wanted to improve this, they would change the game from nation initial infection to something that illustrated city to city infection as well as how pervasive the desease spreads through water ways, the wildlife and rural communities more realistically. This would make the game eerily more realistic as well as the amount of information at your disposal require true thought processing and strategic planning. Instead of losing simply because Greenland closed its seaport, You would lose because your pathogen had difficulty traversing cold rural areas due to lack of mutation to infect local wildlife. Untill they implement that, I wouldn't call this game perfectI myself find myself sinking an hour into this game each day simply cause most games require a time commitment that sometimes you simply don't wish to spend. This game will bode well with those who are going cross country in their car or on a plane flight or simply killing time as you make up your mind on what you want to do next.I would highly suggest this game to anyone. It is fairly cheap considering how many hours I myself have put into it, and how many more I plan to. It is also a simple game that can be played almost anywhere due to the lack of processing power it requires. If I were to give this game any rating it would 4.4 out of 5			"

								I love plague inc. i played the mobile version and i could never get past bacteria because you had to beat the game once on normal or harder. I like that they have removed that from you'r average virus and parasite. Well i say average what i mean is a killer sickness you can call it what you want and then leave the world deserted. plus the fun little news popins where it might say ""big earthquake hits USA"" which might have an impact on you'r virus if you have started in the USA and have infected let's say 10,000 people and the earthquake hits. You might lose a 1000 of the infected (which is not a big deal but whatever) and thats all fun and all but theres one thing i dont really like. How hard it is (don't take that out and make it a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥joke) dont get me wrong i like a little difficulty in my games but this just cranks it up to 11 on normal. For me atleast. so i would recomend this if you'r good at this kind of game. Thats it hope you found this usefull and BYEEEEEEE :)			"

								Interesting twist on the ""End of the World by virus/plague/disease/etc"" genre.  In games like Resident Evil, you (typically) fight against a big organization (Umbrella) who released a disaster. In this game, you ARE that organization, making the perfect organism to wipe out human life on the planet and selecting Case Zero, before a cure can be synthesized.  My first bacteria took just over three years to kill everyone, whereas my virus took just over a year...kinda freaky.  As it is still in its initial build, there are several menu options not yet available, but there is still plenty of fun to be had in the Main Game.  It'll be interesting to see how they develop their multi-player aspect; P1 creates the disease while P2 tries to find it and cure it, or, P1 and P2 BOTH create a disease and whoever wipes out more wins?

Early Access Review
								Already in early access I'm absolutely enjoying this game.Since I've always liked games similar to this like Pandemic 1 & 2 it's hard for me not to love this game too.It has a simple mix of laid back strategy, chance and punny humor.The gameplay starts off by of popping little bubbles, as if it was on a phone, (it originally was), in hope to give you enough points to make some effects on your plague, varying from symptoms to transmissions and ""research complexity""... And then you wait (speed time up) and hope you don't get your plague detected before you've spread out at least a little, as your ultimate goal is to end humanity by killing everyone.Of course this comes with variations of diseases and parasites which changes the play style, each with their own advantages or disadvantages which may prove challenging.The addition of pretty graphics are alright, yet it does not enhance the gameplay.The music and atmosphere is sweet and generally just fits with the theme without being uncomfortable.Overall it's pretty solid, but could still use some improvements which seems to be worked on.I'll list a few things I did not like from the time I did this recommendation:Low variation of symptoms: Many diseases and parasites has the same ""symptom tree"" with the exception of the new Neurax Worm which is unique and absolutely brilliant. Amazing to play with, not so much the others as it is mainly too similar and dull.In-infectible countries: You may be playing the game, having infected the entire world with only one tiny island with closed borders and ports, yet it becomes completely impossible for you to infect the country with most plagues once this happens, immediately deciding that you won't be able to win. Even though, logically it would still be possible for the disease to be carried there, regardless of border control.Common geography: I've noticed a few countries have been fairly detailed in some areas but a bit too vague in other areas by calling them after the biggest country, then overlap the smaller neighboring countries, Yet it would have been more appropriate, for instance ""the balkan states"" which is absolutely correct, not too vague and not too detailed. While you see Germany overlap five different countries. Instead better naming would had been Southern Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Britain, Balkan States (even though technically still Eastern europe), etc.The pricing: Having to pay 30% more in Europe and only half price in Russia doesn't seem all that fair. If the pricing had a smaller percentage difference, maybe it would be more attractive globally.Still.. It's a fair game which I consider worth the money in contrast to its entertainment value.			"

								A fun strategy game not unlike the popular browser game ""Pandemic 2"", with a refreshing load of new content. One downside, however is that the game will get very repetitive, and once you finish all the disease types, there is almost no replay value other than for achievements. The scenarios do mix things up a bit, but it still will get boring fast.My personal rating: 5/10. Fun, but repetitive.			"

								I love plague inc. i played the mobile version and i could never get past bacteria because you had to beat the game once on normal or harder. I like that they have removed that from you'r average virus and parasite. Well i say average what i mean is a killer sickness you can call it what you want and then leave the world deserted. plus the fun little news popins where it might say ""big earthquake hits USA"" which might have an impact on you'r virus if you have started in the USA and have infected let's say 10,000 people and the earthquake hits. You might lose a 1000 of the infected (which is not a big deal but whatever) and thats all fun and all but theres one thing i dont really like. How hard it is (don't take that out and make it a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥joke) dont get me wrong i like a little difficulty in my games but this just cranks it up to 11 on normal. For me atleast. so i would recomend this if you'r good at this kind of game. Thats it hope you found this usefull and BYEEEEEEE :)			"

								The beauty of destruction at your hands!I will not congratulate it on it's simulative style because despite the fact that it is somehow accurate there is a lot of improvement to be done on this part. But improving the accuracy of the simulation would make the game very hard and mainly boring. There already are many factors to take into concideration. Imagine thinking about ten times as that. It would blow your mind. (like Democracy 3)So in fact, it is a good thing that it is innacurate!There are many types of viruses to play around with; each with it's own stats and trickness.It is very strategic but fun at the same time.Providing enough information to make it competitive and real but not too much to make it overcomplicated.I now know where zimbabwe is!I would recommend this game to anyone of any age (no it will not rotten your children - it will on the other hand educate them while they are loving it at the same time!)I already had this on my mobile device but i had to buy it on my pc too!

												i'll start this review by saying that i am not personally a fan of games like plague inc for many personal and professional reasons.Plague inc i believe is a recreation of the flash game ""Pandemic"" which uses relatively the same features in a far smaller scale and while i actually like Pandemic better then plague inc some players may prefere the more in depth, advanced, and more well thought out system that plague inc uses.i can recomend this game strongly to anyone who was a fan of the old pandemic flash game and to anyone who is into flash games such as this in general, the trailers and visual examples listed on the store page give a rather accurate description of the experience.the game has an air of stratedgy and planning that only increases as you get into stronger virus types, the game also promotes different starting scenarios. difficulties. play styles (in the case of the Neurax worm, Symian flu, and Shadow virus especially) it makes you feel fully immersed in the idea of becoming the ultimate disease.

												This was one of those games that looks really promising. A strategy game like Civ with unlimited potential and real time strategy where every move you made would make an impact. That is certainly what Plague Inc evolved tries to be, atleast.After almost 10 hours in this game I've come to the sad realisation that there is very little depth to it. You gain DNA points -the points used to upgrade your disease - overtime as you infect/kill more people, and also from occassionally clicking on little pop up bubbles on screen. You can then use these to add Symptoms to your disease, manners for it to spread and to increase its resistances to certain climates or being cured by the humans. This may seem interesting at first, but once you figure out which upgrades to use the game really has little strategy involved and is more so based on probability and luck. It is also worth mentioning that this game leads you to believe that there is much more content than it actually has, in the main singleplayer, that is. You start off with Bacteria and can see that there are other disease types you can unlock once you beat certain difficultues with Bacteria. Now you may think that these other disease types would have much different gameplay to them, making the game diverse and complex. Wrong! Every disease type is practically the same with a few minor adjustments. To give this game some credit though, it is fun for the first 5-8 hours or so when you don't really understand the game's underlying mechanics. You can sit there and be an evil mastermind, watching humanity crumble before you as you upgrade your plague. Not to mention its hillariously amusing to name your disease after something stupid due to the in-game pop up's you can get.Is it also important to mention that this game does have Steam Workshop, and thus there is a surplus of player content to go through. The player created levels are far more entertaining that the ones the game gives you (and a lot more creative!). If you're buying this expecting a strategy game with the depth of Civ you're going to be disappointed. If your intent with this game is to just have a good time laughing at popups like: ""Furries to Eradicate Humanity!"" then I would say go ahead and buy this. I just do warn that this game isn't that entertaining after awhile, and I would advise buying it on sale rather than at full price. It's definitely not a ""must have"" game for your Library.  "

HOLY CRAP ITS WORTH IT IF YOU WANT TO KILL THE WORLD WITH SICKNESS AND DISEASE until the human population is destroyed.+Lots of different type of disease to choose from+Rpg elements of developing your disease+Awsome track to play along with the game while you conquer the world until you wipe out humanity+Incoming Multiplay aww yea- Theres just one interface being looked at the entire game, Its a simulation not much more than that, planes flying around etc. Wish there was cutscenes or what not that kicks in to add more spice to your work.

								Hypochondriacs REJOICE! Boy this game is just for you. Think you have something Deadly well fill out the symptoms in the game into your own little cup of Germs and found out how quickly you can kill others near and dear to you. OK, seeing as how at the time of this review it’s still under early access, you still can have some fun killing all humans with your own custom cup of Germs.The point of the game is to infect the whole world and kill everyone at any pace you wish to attempt it. Usually I would say as soon as possible, but heck you can decide that by modifying and upgrading your Plague at any time after the starting stage. This game is fun yet simple if you enjoy watching Death occur many different ways with all the news reports saying what Countries are in total anarchy because of your attempt to infect the world.Each time you attempt to play this game and you kill all humans you unlock new different types of DNA to generate for your precious Plague to start with. Is it worth countless hours of fun? Sure, if you enjoy reading the numbers of times you have turn a population into Zombies or poor individuals that get so forgetful they cause a nuclear containment breach at any given time.Most features haven’t been added into the game yet but the basic of building a Germ and sending it out in the world to infect everyone is still up to you. I look forward to the future updates and eventually playing with friends to see how the multi-player works out. "

								It's a quick game if you know how to balance things, and very open ended on how you can work the transmission of the various diseases you can design, if I have any complaints, they're few.One being fungus, it seems silly that it's got such a limitation on it's ability to transmit itself without spending points.  You're basically using that ability to wait for the fungus to not be infecting hard to infect areas to use it.  Second, it doesn't really make sense to limit the ability of the humans to develop a cure based on how many humans are left.  Sure, you might be killing off doctors, but just because there are only , say a billion humans left, that doesn't mean they can't cure the disease any slower just because there are fewer humans left.Other then that, it's really a indepth cool way of learning how diseases can work.

YOU CAN WITH THIS GAMEComing from the iPhone Game Plague IncThis Game has you playing all Stealthy like trying to get one person in each region of the world infected before you start to figure out how to make your disease kill everyone. Symptoms are based on actual Symptoms and depending on which disease that you choose from, you can figure out a strategy to destroy The worldThese Countries will do everything in their power to stop you as in providing Health Care for the infected, Advanced Medicine, Executing a Bunch of Infect to ensure that no one else would get the disease, Extremenating all Rodents and Avian Carriers, and much more!I might not have a lot of Time with the Game on Steam but I have spent quite a bit playing on iPhone. It is a good Time Killer and its a fun game that doesn't require a lot out of your computer/Labtop/whatever you are using for Steam in order to run it. It is a Great Buy and a wonderful Gift			"

The game itself is fun and interesting allowing you to attempt to develop different strategys of infection or starting points for patient zero. Should be even better once all the game is unlocked and fully developed.Even better to play while having zombie movies in the background. World War Z, 28 Days Later, Land of the Dead and even maybe Resident Evil.			"

								Since it's inception, the content of Plague Inc. Evolved has only increased and its game-play, improved. The game focuses on the ""management"" of several types of pathogens. Said pathogens are rather varied & offers differing options/methods of playing. The main goal, is to succeed in destroying humanity.As for now, the game is quite active. In terms of development & its community, actually. The game itself differs from the mobile version by a notable degree, with this version being vastly improved in several aspects. Such as graphics, interface, features, and such. The strategic aspect of the game remains as a noteworthy part of the game. Determining the results of one's actions in the game. Towards defeat, or a victorious end. Including one's score as well, may I add.In addition, due to the aforementioned pathogens, the game offers a fine degree of replay value. Even more so with newer additions of diseases, scenarios, competitive/co-op multiplayer, and much more. In essence, this game has much to offer, and in my experience, provides an abundance of fun & contentment.			"

								Sum up - Good - Expensive - iOS portPlague Inc. is an iOS game around the $5 mark (or your regional equivalent), in saying this a price mark up of $10 is not something that a lot of people may think kindly to but if you do enjoy death simulators or something that involves logical thinking with SOME dynamic game play, pick it up for the $15 or wait for the sale. The game involves evolving a plague (many to choose from) to eradicate the human race. The gameplay is created from number crunching and strategic thinking towards the extinction of the human population. Graphic quality is not great in this title, little is able for customisation but the requirements for the title to run are quite minimum. This is an early access as stated before and buyer should beware of this. Many game states and even options are still under development and only those who want to be involved in the development and social process of the game should buy it pre full release. Features such as multiplayer and scenarios are not completely functioning. There are two tiers of multiplayer in my opinion; the first consists of leaderboards and the social network sharing, the second tier consists of the incomplete multiplayer mode which can only speculate to be a completive mode that heads you against another player in real-time (hopefully). Game play itself is identical to the iOS predecessor; you infect one country to begin with and mutate/evolve the plague to achieve total annihilation of the human race and ultimately winning the game. At the end of the game scoring does occur which allows you a placement on the leaderboards. For more information do check out my Perception check video on this title!
