AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Bardbarian Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Defense; Strategy; RPG; Casual; Musical   My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-7 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamersREVIEWBardbarian is quite the fun game.  It blends elements of tower defense, RPG, action-strategy, and bullet-dodging to form a short-and-sweet little game.  Personally, the game felt a lot like the “Protect the Queen” games I used to play on StarCraft custom maps.   There are no truly innovative mechanics to the game, but the way the pieces come together do manage to form a game that has a strong charm of novelty.The game is short.  It took me just under 5 hours to earn all achievements.  That’s OK though, because it was a fun 5 hours and I didn’t really need any more.  If you find yourself wanting more you can compete on the leaderboards. Also, the game is casual.  Even on the “insane” difficulty, the game becomes simple once you’ve bought enough upgrades.  As someone who enjoys casual games, I really felt the balance of difficulty in this game was very enjoyable.  You have to pay attention and play, but you won’t ever find yourself frustrated.  Having said that, people who like very difficult games may find themselves left wanting by Bardbarian.The gameplay itself is extremely simple.  You’ll have it all figured out in the first minute and it won’t change much after that.  There are new units and upgrades which you unlock that spice things up as you progress.  But I will admit, the content is rather limited.The graphics are ""cartoonish"" and simple, but they fit the atmosphere.  The music is not bad by any means, but I felt it could have been a little more epic and various considering the game has strong musical undertones.   The controls are fluid and intuitive.  The game is stable; I experienced no glitches or crashing.In summary, I would say Bardbarian is very fun and worth playing.  It’s simple enough that almost anyone should be able to enjoy the gameplay.  If you are itching for something fresh and a little different you can probably get some fun out of this game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Bardbarian ""is a mixture of Tower Defense, RPG & RTS with some 'Shmup and Snake elements"". I have no clue where the RTS element is.It's essentially a game about defending your town crystal from incoming waves of enemies. How do you defend it? You summon party members with different abilities, and you run around dodging bullets and buffing your party (you do not control your attacks, that's all done automatically).When I saw this game, I thought it looked interesting enough to give it a go. The reviews were surprisingly positive, so... why not?I'll just say that I was extremely disappointed with this game, and the reviews are unbelievable. I honestly don't know why people think this is a good game of PC! Here's a more lengthy analysis.First off, presentation.The graphics look a bit average to me, but they're fine. What you see is what you get (from the screenshots). One problem with it, is that it's highly repetitive, even visually, since you have only one map for the campaign. And it doesn't really change its look. Other modes have different maps, but nothing beautiful or interesting. They're fine. That's all I can say about it.The music was actually not bad. It's almost neo-classical metal, instrumental only. Unfortunately, there's only one song on the campaign. The song loops the entire time, which can (and does) get repetitive after listening to it hours on end. The song loops pretty seemlessly, so that's good (from what I could tell). It was just background music, didn't really add to the experience. There were no volume sliders either. Only music/sound-effects on/off.Very limited overall. A bit more effort and it could have been much more enjoyable, but playing the same track over and over and over... not good.The interface was fine. The mouse support works fine on the menus. I played the game with a Gamepad and it worked well as well, so good job on that. Unfortunately, the concept of an Options Meny seems to be very foreign to the developer. There's barely anything, which is really annoying. But hey, at least it had rebindable keys!It's.. again, fine. Nothing noteworthy here, it's missing a bunch of options, but it didn't really prove to be a problem, in my experience.So, how's gameplay?Well, it's a grindfest. Almost a waiting game...As I said, you don't actually attack. So, your whole job is to summon party members, and run around the map, getting close enough for your party to attack. You can also boost the party with +Attack, +Speed, +Defense, or a special Stun ability. If your party member dies, you'll have to summon them again, at a cost. If you Bard dies, or your Crystal is destroyed, you lose. Simple enough. To summon units and use buffs, you'll need to gather ""Notes"". You gain a few over time, and you get some more from enemy drops, sometimes.And that's pretty much it, as gameplay. Enemy variety was pretty good. They'll shoot at you, with some of them being faster, some firing multiple shots, in multiple directions, etc. It felt inspired by The Binding of Isaac (in a good way). That's not to say that the enemy variety is even remotely closer. Not at all. There are about 10 different enemies, and some of them are fairly similar. So, all you have to do is literally run around, for the most part. And it gets very old, very fast. It's clearly designed as an iOS game... And a lazy one.It does have some bullet hell elements. And those could have saved the game! But, there's a huge problem with that. As I mentioned, you have units. These run around you. Which means that your hitbox is huge, and very inconsistent. You simply can't do those awesome dodges you would in a bullet hell. There's no way. There's an upgrade on the shop for the party to stick closer together, but it barely helps... Everytime you move, they'll stay a bit behind, which would be fine, but it provides nothing of worth! It simply inutilizes most of the dodging. Which means that you'll always play safe, run around, not feeling like a badass.That's all the gameplay is. Running around. The Boss fights were significantly better, but still not very good. A few simple patterns, but they at least felt more refreshing.The second part of this game, is the upgrading system. The game is structured with 4 times of the day, each with 5 levels (a Boss Fight in the 5th). Once you beat a Boss, you can't start from that point after you die, or you can go back to the beginning. This could have been fine, but it isn't.The upgrades are absolutely necessary. It's literally impossible to make any progress without upgrading everything. And that's usually how games go, but this is different. Your progress is 95% affected by your upgrades. There's no skill involved. It's a question of either having enough damage, or not having it. Even if you're a good player, you'll simply be overun by enemies that will rush you crystal. Once you die, there you go upgrade some more, and then beat it easily. And that's the whole game. The upgrades aren't at all interesting. They're just that, upgrades. More damage, more health, more speed, more money, more notes, etc.This makes for a very, very stale game. You're always doing the same thing! Running around, collecting gold so that you can buy more upgrades, until you reach the end. There are no deep mechanics to learn or master, no strategy, no anything. The only glimpse of strategy, is choosing your units. You'll unlock different units throughout the game, with different abilities. There's a huge problem with it, though. First off, some of them are pretty much useless. They're not helpful at all, so there's no point in even existing. The other problem, is unit upgrades. You can upgrade them too (see it as levels, basically. higher level=better version of the unit, simply that). BUT, if you want to test a unit, and see if they're any good, you'll have to upgrade them to the same level that your other units are. Otherwise, you can't compare them very well, can you? But, to upgrade them, you'll waste gold, that you only want to use in a unit that you know will be useful. And this is where the system falls apart. To try the unit, you'll have to waste gold already, otherwise, there's no point, as they'll be incredibly underpowered. This makes it a waste of gold (which equals to a waste of time, as your play time is simply to collect enough gold to make progress!). It's broken and pointless. This leads to a very limited cast of characters. I stuck around with most of the initial ones because of it. And I've done fine. Different characters could interact differently, but when the gameplay is literally just running around, it makes almost no difference! You don't play with the characters, they play themselves.To its credit, there are 2 other game modes. One is just survival, in which you get a random unit spawn that you must collect, and sometimes food (healing). There are bosses, from time to time, and the enemies will try to kill you (no crystal this time).The other one is an infinite runner mode, you a few stationary enemies (pretty much towers), and randomly spawned obstacles. Both of these modes unlock 2 cross-over characters, so you are encouraged to try them out.The achievements were... meh. Barely anything to encourage you different (and interesting) character combinations, which is a really big miss. They're mostly for beating each Boss, unlocking characters, upgrades, etc. Nothing interesting. And that's unfortunate.ConclusionThis game is literally a waste of time. You'll collect gold to buy upgrades and progress in the game. You'll not learn how to master the mechanics the more you play. You won't feel any kind of rewarding sensation whenever you beat a Boss.The game has potential, but ends up feeling like a lazy iOS game. You'll be entertained for 1-2 hours. Not more.			"

												I have always enjoyed a good tower defense game but to be honest the genre has felt very stale as of late. Most tower defense games are mixtures of previous tower defense games we have all played before. In this game however you are moving around the ""towers"" (that are actually people) in a group while dodging projectiles. It makes for good fun and most importantly it's priced right. I support devs that price their games accordingly. Bardbarian trys something new and for that I give this game a reccomendation.

												Yeah this game is pretty rad. I picked it up in a bundle and really recommend it, even at full price RRP it's pretty worth it. As far as tower defence games go, its way up there on the list and deservedly so. Great music, funny gameplay and decent upgrade system with loads of unlocks. Well worth a blast if it's in your library. Controller recommended.			"

												Bardbarian is a tower defence game with a unique twist, the towers are attached to the main character and you steer them around the battlefield to take out the creeps.	There are elements from many games here, the lane approach of Plants vs. Zombies, the grind and slowly improve of many IAP games and even playing guitar riffs like in Brutal Legend to buff your group.  The cartoon graphics are beautiful and the various towers look great.	You troops come in many familiar variants, from glass cannon ninjas to de-buffing Shaman to front line tanks and healers.  There are even some familiar faces from the Indie world that make an appearance!  There is a decent amount of strategy in the choice but you can only bring 3 types of towers at a time, I can't help but think if this limit was relaxed it would have provided a more interesting game.  It is increased to 4 after you complete the game once but still...	You can be constantly on the move, attack from angles with high damage low health units to attacking front on with the tank taking the damage while shooing down lanes or even some variation thereof.  I used a front line of ninjas with shamans and an engineer to provide support.  Looking around there does seem to be a nice variation of viable builds, a definite plus!	The grind is the biggest issue here and shows the games IAP roots.  Taking out IAP and just making the game paid for the PC market does not a great game make, it seems as though the grind is the primary game mechanism at times, not fun.  There is only one map in the main game and even though every 5 levels out of the the total of 20 the time of day changes and you get a unique boss, there is no discernible difference apart from slightly different creeps.  There are a couple of other modes, survival where creeps come from all angles and and escape mode where you navigate a maze of creeps and obstacles to see how far you go.  	There are a few cosmetic bugs, but nothing major and I'm sure they will get patched at some point.	If steam reviews had a “meh” category this game would fall into it.  It's too grindy for a paid game and doesn't really offer enough value for it's price.  Pick it up in a bundle or on sale and wile away a few hours or don't!			"

												Bardbarian is one of these games I went into ""just to try"", and find myself returning to now quite regularly. It has quite an original concept, being a tower defense with more than a twist. There is a central point to defend, and there are enemies coming in to attack, ever more, ever more strong. So far, so good.But. The towers to defend your stronghold are not static, but are attached as party-members to the Bard you can steer around the battlefield, destroying enemies ""on the fly"" as it were. You do not attack yourself, but one can enhance the attacks of your party-members by playing short guitar-riffs, played free by collecting notes. Extra attack, speed, defence and a short freeze of the enemies come in handy as the waves of enemies get stronger. As usual, units and your Bard himself can be upgraded, for this one needs the coins the enemies drop in abundance.In order to succeed, fast reactions and speedy thinking are necesarry. I found it difficult at first to keep an overview of the battlefield, as several issues need attention: where are the enemies coming in at thier strongest, which buffs are needed, did any of my units die so I have to summon a new one, is my stronghold still going strong, .... But after a while I got used to it and enjoyed running all over the place, with my little but brave party. Playing it with an Xbox 360-controller certainly helps and feels most natural.Enemies get quite strong before halfway in the game, and so sustaining the 20 waves is no easy task. Every 5 levels there is a boss, but for the most part enemies do not change that much during the game. Still, with an extra ""free run"" mode (try to get as far as you can dodging the enemies) and with a ""survival mode"", one can come back to this game again and again. As can be expected nowadays, there are Steam trading cards and some inviting achievements, which really help to appreciate the game to the full. No classic, but still very enjoyable. Don't hesitate to buy this, especially when it's on sale or in a bundle.Gameplay: 20/30Graphics: 12/20Sound: 9/10 (the combination of the sound-track and the guitar riffs works admirably well)Longelivety: 14/20 (thanks to the extra modes, and to an extra difficulty level)Technical & stability: 9/10Personal rating: 7/10Overall: 71/100			"

												First off, very fun game.  At first I thought this would be an easy game but obviously as levels progress hordes of mobes get tougher but as you kill you collect gold which you may use to upgrade your hero, your minions and few other things.  You unlock new units the further you survive.  This is a great Tower defense/RTS game, dont think i played another like it but soon as I saw trailer I bought it.This is a well done game thats pretty challenging.  I'll be playing this for a while.			"

												Great and very addictive simple indie game with few RPG elements. Honestly one of the best indies i ever played. Got it from bundle, but i need to admit that £5.59 is not much for such production. Anyway I'm a bit sad, because Bardbarian lacks of replayability, which is really needed in this genre in my opinion. Didn't really like the survival mode, but who cares when the main features are fantastic.So if you didn't get it yet, i can strongly recommend Bardbarian to all RPG/tower defence fans, especially if you are bored and willing to have some fun.My rating: 85/100			"

												Supposedly the protagonist Brad got tired of the grind for XP and decided to retire to be a bard, but this game is still nothing but grind. Brad doesn’t directly attack enemies, but instead plays music to summon members of his party that are selected before the game starts. Half of the game is spending coins to upgrade all kinds of passives for the town, units and Brad himself, but the single upgrade paths are all standard. The player gets some sense of strategy by picking which units to include in their party, which is kind of like selecting what towers to build in a TD game, except being mobile takes away figuring out the puzzle of a good maze or what tower combinations are most efficient for an area. The other part of the game is spent as Brad running around while his party auto attacks enemies. After a while the game kind of feels like it plays itself for the most part.  It never seemed like I got better at fighting the same handful of enemies over and over again while listening to the same melody, in the same environment. I bought in for the promise of more content, mainly co-op, and for the crossover characters. The crossover novelty was cool, but wore off, and the promised content has yet to come. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more with co-op, but overall it was a lukewarm experience. Bardbarian is functional and can be fun for a while, but it’s not really that engaging.  "

												It's a bard, it's a barbarian. No, it's Bardbarian! Castle defense never felt so...musical? There's actually a fair amount of fun gameplay running around and killing waves of monsters and bosses. Plus the decent amount of unit types makes for a lot of different play styles. Definitely worth whatever bargain price you pay for it.			"

												This game is actually pretty fun and fairly unique. It combines bullet hell, tower defense, and RPG elements in a pretty compelling way. So why the thumbs down, you ask? Well, this version of the game is priced higher than it should be. First off, the claim of ""Steam exclusive"" characters in this version is completely false. Don't believe me? Download the FREE version on Google Play or the App Store and see for yourself. The only item that costs money in the free (and virtually identical) version is the golden axe, which is obtained with in game currency in this version but costs only $3 in the free tablet/smartphone version. This game is normally priced at $8 and thus, I cannot recommend it unless you get it on sale (for controller support, I suppose). However, tablet controls are not bad and you can even play it on an emulator if you don't have a tablet. So, skip this version unless you happen to see it for at least 50% off.			"

												Barbarians were known for their ruthlessness and brute strength in battle, but did you know they were also known for their tasty riffs and ability to shred? In Bardbarian you’re charged with protecting a village rather than destroying one. You don’t do it by clobbering your foes with axes and hammers. No, you use the power of music to save them!As you might have surmised from the game’s title, you play a bard in Bardbarian. Well, to be more accurate, you play a barbarian who decides to trade in his weapons in order to take up shredding on a different kind of axe; in this case, a musical one. It just so happens the day he makes this important, life-changing decision, his village is attacked by a bevy of orcs and other baddies. With axe in hand, he uses the power of song to inspire his fellow townspeople to rise up against the invaders.The premise of Bardbarian is fairly simple, and therein lies the fun. All of the action takes place in the village and your main goal is to protect its crystal. Waves of enemies will stream in from the forest to the right, so it’s your job to have Brad round up townspeople to defend their homes. Brad can call upon archers, healers, brawlers, dwarves, storm knights and other kinds of units.These guys can provide ranged damage, melee/projectile damage and healing for Brad and his party. The right combination of units can help you plow enemies en masse with ease, so pay careful attention to your party makeup with relation to the enemies on the field at any given time.Your party’s makeup matters a lot because spellcasters and ranged damage dealers will flank Brad while tough melee units will act as tanks and lead the party. Different classes have different aggro ranges, so you’ll either have to move Brad in very close to have units like Brawlers activate their attacks or kite enemies at a distance so that Archers can loose their arrows. As the game gets more difficult, more enemies appear onscreen at the same time, so you’ll have to be very judicious about your movements to make sure you’re inflicting optimum damage while also avoiding enemy projectiles.Gathering units expends Notes, which Brad generates by jamming out when he’s standing still. You merely need to tap on a portrait of a unit to spend Notes and have Brad play a sick solo to summon them from their homes. Once you’ve gathered your units and are ready to defend the town, killing baddies is as easy as dragging Brad around and getting his party within range of the enemies. They’ll fire off their shots, destroy enemies and continue following Brad around.Fallen enemies drop gold coins, which can then be used in the Item Shop. You’ll be able to purchase upgrades for Brad’s buffs, increase the size of his party, hire different units and even make upgrades to the town. The game can be very difficult, but it is also very fun and rewarding. You’ll have to tackle stages over and over to amass enough gold to upgrade everything to a level that gives you a fighting chance against bosses, but that’s part of Bardbarian’s fun.Bardbarian’s action is made all the more enjoyable thanks to the hand-drawn, cartoony graphics. The style is reminiscent of the multiplayer game, Castle Crashers, and adds the right amount of goofiness to the proceedings. If there is one thing that really holds Bardbarian back from being a truly perfect game, it’s the fact that it’s so challenging. While the difficulty may be fun for fans of the genre it kind of hampers the story a bit and may cause other gamers to lose interest.Bardbarian is a heavy blast of cartoon violence that slowly but surely develops into a concentrated and exciting action game, that's not quite like anything you've played before.

												I didn't really know what to expect out of this game. Thankfully, it's not so hard to pick up. It throws you right into the game without any notable intro/knowledge but don't worry, figuring everything out is a matter of few minutes. It doesn't take long and you will be addicted to Bardbarian.======OVERVIEW======Bardbarian takes the Tower Defense genre to a whole new level, where you can actually influence the outcome of a battle, whether you just move differently or have other units spawned. Every level usually somehow differs each time you play it. However, if you play a certain level few times, you can actually remember when and where a specific enemy spawns. That being said, it is not a big deal since you'd have to spend too many hours in this game to actually remember the pattern of spawning. Besides the regular adventure/story mode, there are two more game modes: survival and escape. Both of them bring a fresh air if you're just burnt out of the main mode and I must say that surprisingly enough, I've enjoyed these. Plus you can unlock some of otherwise not approachable units and you can come up with some other interesting strategies. So far I'm using ordinary units more but might give those specials try if I ever struggle with some specific level. And yeah, you'll find yourself struggling with a level more often than you're willing to admit but don't worry, it gets better with almost every upgrade. Far better when you find yourself some comfortable unit combinations. One more noticable thing: sound. The way this game works with soundtrack and sound effects is just beautiful.PROS- visual side- controls/gameplay- trading cards- sound effects and soundtrack- grinding- replay value- achievements + trading cards- crossover features with other indie gamesCONS- lacks events/seasons updates (last update was on Halloween, still in the game to this game which kinda doesn't make sense)======RATING======I love this game. It sets the standard for Tower Defense games too high and it'll honestly be a hard quest for other games to overcome the great experience I've had playing Bardbarian. I'd highly recommend it to every casual gamer out there, heck, even to those hardcore gamers, you can spend some quality time playing this game as well.For recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												You are a barbarian that is tired of pillaging and wants to be a bard instead.So, Bardbarian. The entire backstory is there in the title.Unfortunately this new devotion to music and abhorrence of inflicting violence could not be timed worse, since an invasion force of monsters is approaching the quiet town you live in.Why? Nobody knows. There is no plot beyond the setting.This leaves the town in a pickle though, without the barbarian they will need another way to protect their town.Despite no longer fighting directly the Bardbarian has decided to help. The local adventurers' guild has plenty of warriors around and all they need to join the defence is some encouragement. Musical encouragement.So the Bardbarian runs around the battlefield, playing (monotonous but fun) music to gather a resource called Notes. These notes can be spent to recruit warriors from the adventurers' guild who will start following you around the battlefield, attacking any enemies that come close.This turns the game into a defence game, you navigate your group of adventurers around the battlefield to keep the monsters away from the town square where a magical crystal does... something important, apparently. Wave after wave, until you get a boss fight and move on to the next segment of the game and do it all over again.After your almost inevitable failure you spend the gold you earned from the enemies the adventurers have vanquished to upgrade... quite a lot of different things. Upgrade your units, unlock new units, upgrade your own stats, research spells and facilities around the village that make your time just a bit easier.A weird item that you can buy is the Golden Guitar, which doubles all future Gold income. It's a relic of the time where the game had a cash shop on mobile, but fortunately it can be bought with regular currency in this Steam version. You should do that as soon as possible.All in all the game gets a bit repetitive as it goes on, and some of the later units are so much stronger than the other ones that you don't really feel like you're customizing so much as levelling that one unit until you get past the level you're stuck on.However, it's a pretty game with a lot of content and a solid soundtrack.Recommended if you're looking for a fun defence game.

												Repetition in video games can be draining sometimes. There's only so many times you can jump on things, slash them, shoot them, right? And if that's the case for you the player, what must it be like for the characters actually doing the work? Bardbarian's a game that explores that a bit.You play as Brad, a barbarian mercenary working to defend a nameless town and its giant magic crystal, which does...probably something important, since every monster in the area wants it smashed, although they never get around to saying what. Trouble is, Brad is having a bit of a mid-life crisis: surely there must be more to life than constant killing? The answer to that he finds is embracing his artistic side in the form of music, and helping other people kill things!Bardbarian takes place in the town for the whole of the game, as twenty waves assault the crystal over the course of a single day. These make up four sections, with five levels each and a boss at the end. To combat them, Brad has to jam on his guitar and summon allies from out of the local barracks and wizard college; they move in to close formation around him, not unlike Tiny Guardians. This game is action-based, however, and you'll be moving back and forth to let your allies shoot down monsters with either the arrow keys, WADS, the mouse or a controller. You start off with a simple archer-wizard-fighter combo, but as you unlock units by passing waves you'll find more interesting ones, like a necromancer who curses enemies, and resurrects them as a zombie minion if they're killed under the effects of it. There are also some indie cameos from Octodad, a Super Meat Boy/Isaac tag team, and Shellrazer, who's from a mobile tower defense that isn't on Steam.If twenty waves sounds a bit short to you, well, it kind of is. The length mostly comes from you kind of having to go back and upgrade your allies, Brad himself, and the town with the gold you get from killing enemies; even if you're very good at dodging they'll simply get too spongey. After every boss you'll have the option of starting at the next area whenever you do, so you won't have to start at the beginning every time. There are also upgrades to make gathering gold easier, such as the Pet, who will grab it from dead enemies so you don't have to.Even with upgrades, though, the game can be quite tricky, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people without experience in shooters. Most enemies have some sort of projectile attack, and it isn't long before it a minor bullet hell, with you weaving in and out to protect your squishier allies and Brad himself. You'll need to be proactive when dealing with enemies, too, as letting even a couple goblins get up to the crystal can lead to quite a bit of damage. Naturally, it's also a game over if you die yourself. And if you really want a challenge, there's an even harder difficulty you can pick right from the start.It took me about nine hours to beat the game, although it might take a bit longer for someone not as good at action games. There are two optional modes in addition to it; a challenge mode where you try to survive against an endless horde of enemies, and a sort of runner minigame where you try to avoid obstacles. They can both give gold, but it still felt like the main campaign was the most efficient method of doing that, and it doesn't feel like they'd extend the playtime very much.Bardbarian is definitely a good game if you can put up with some grinding, although I'm not certain I would buy it at full price. It's been on sale a bunch though, and can be found in one of the permanent bundles on BundleStars. It's a decent game with some charm for in-between larger ones, I'd say.			"

												been playing it for about an hour and so far this game has been a ton of fun. sure its a very casual game, but i just love the art and the music on it, plus the gameplay itself is solid even if very simple.there is no difference from the mobile version which happens to be much cheaper, but if the devs keep on their promise to add steam workshop and more content then i cant recommend this game enough. all in all this is just a fun time killer and you will end up not noticing how fast the time flies when you playing it			"

												I actually lanched this game to get the trading cards that comes with it. I tried the game out and im surprised on how good it is. You play through levels, kill enemies and try to defend your throne. When you kill creeps they drop gold, which you can use to upgrade your followers health, damage, etc. The graphics are okay. Looks like a cute cartoon-ish style, almost like a mobile game. The game runs fine though and the PC port seems to be solid in every way. Since there's a lot of grinding involved in this, you might wanna play this game for short periods at a time.I'm enjoying the music that comes with it. It's a rock song with some nice drum rhythm, and I think it suits the game really well. As you progress you unlock new followers that have different abillities, and like I said, you upgrade them with the gold you collect. It starts of easy but it gets hard pretty quick. definitely a nice little game, but due to the repetitive grinding you might want to pick it up on sale or in a bundle. It depends on if you like that kind of thing or not.			"

												I bought this game on sale and I barely payed a dollar for this game. This game is a creative tower defense and it seems like it'd be a fun app but its more then an app for your phone because I dont regret buying this. It is addictive and you can just read any other reviews and the majority agree with me. This is a very fun Game and i am loving it so far and It seems short but its longer then some games ive played. Infact the game goes on for ever there is always something to do and you can challenge your friends to be better then you or beat your score on certain gamemodes. I recommend this game while its on sale and while its not. Worth buying 9/10			"

												Bardbarian is a action tower defense game where movement, upgrades, and abilities are key. Song notes represent the unit currency of the game that allows you to hire or buff your recruits.. Units are active, which makes movement important, staying still will result in them being hit, or worse you being killed. The focus relies on player movement rather than building towers to re-route enemies. Endless and Survival are two side mini-games which provides cash based on performance, that helps upgrade units for the main campaign. You can unlock characters by accomplishing certain feats on both modes. Endless mode is when you are running and trying to survive all the bullets on the screen, accumulating as many miles as possible which I found a welcome mix-up from the normal gameplay.			"

												Funny graphics and characters, unique gameplay, addictive and simple.I love to see how sometimes a simple and cheap game like Bardbarian can beat many expensive and complex games. I guess the point is on creating something completely new and easy to understand rather than making your own version of a thousand-times-versioned and explored genre/topic. Doing this last thing will require a lot of work and money to get a good, newfangled and attractive game, while I'm sure Bardbarian had a short budget and less (but not little) work and it still got an amazing output off that.

BardbarianEstimated gameplay hours: 6-7-10.Game Genre: 2D Mixed Strategy-Tower Def with RPG elements.This game may look like one of those cheap internet / app games but it is very enjoyable to play.Gameplay: Your goal is to defend the town by killing the enemies round after round, but what makes it good is the RPG aspect.You have 20 rounds, 4 bosses & more than 15 units & hero/town upgrades that would help you sucessfully survive each round.If you're not getting bored from random games very fast and have an open mind for this type of game, you will find it fun to play therefore, I recommend it.Overall Score: 8/10*Game Tips*-- Units -- I used Archer & Mage at lower rounds and few Wizards + 2 Tank & 1 Shaman at higher rounds, it works well.(Necromancer at mid rounds is also recommended).-- Hero Skills -- 'Golden Axe' first, Damage,Speed,Party upgrade(more units) & Note Regeneration+Distance between units.-- Town Upgrades --  'Friends', Pet skill is a must, Magic castle (for magic units XP Level) & 'Town Drunk' is also nice.* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale.****** Recommended On Full Price.

												Don't bother. This game isn't awful but you can find better similar games for free on Kongregate.Your a bardbarian and you summon different units to fight waves of enemy and protect the crystal. You can use powerups and a stun attack to affect the battle but most the time your dodging projectiles and trying to get within the proper range of an enemy. You can upgrade the main character, the units and the town.There just isn't much to this game. The campaign is actually pretty short but it pads itself out by making you grind gold for upgrades, which could be fun but the gameplay gets stale pretty quick so it just becomes a chore. The unlockable units are frustrating because you're not going to want to replace one of the units you have already upgraded - so you probably wont be changing your roster until later levels.  You have to pick 3 units you can summon for each run through, so a lot of the others will fall by the wayside. Your minions will miss constantly, especially long range ones.  The units give you a pretty wide hit area with how they stand around you (without upgrading), so a lot of dodging will involve turning another direction so your units mash together to get to the other side of you. So everything is pretty inprecise and skill doesn't come into play much, it's just comes down to grinding for those upgrades. The controller support is flawed, often you wont be able to preform the stun move and you have to restart the game for it to work again (at least on 360 controllers). Also, the soundtrack and sound effects are annoying and repetitive. I could see how this would be a better IOS game if you just wanted to mindlessly kill a few minutes but I wouldn't suggest buying it on Steam.  On the plus side it does have nice art and the Steam exclusive characters are pretty cool. "

												It helps for a game to have a clever hook, but it needs more than just that. Doing something outside the norm is great as long as that's expanded into a full game and not left to prop the whole thing up. Bardbarian has a cute premise but really doesn't go much further than that, seemingly expecting the one joke it's built around and a few cameos from other indie games to carry its terribly thin gameplay. That works for an hour or so, and then it just becomes a grinding slog without a punchline.Bardbarian is the tale of Brad, mighty barbarian and defender of some dinky village with a giant, important, and otherwise unprotected crystal at its center. On this particular day Brad doesn't feel like vanquishing evil, instead opting to fashion a guitar out of an old battleaxe and jam out. Luckily for him, the villagers, and you, this inspires all manner of mercenaries to come to his aid, shredding monsters as he shreds and drawing power from his power chords.In other words, you control Brad but you never attack on your own. You can call in one of three chosen units when you have enough chords (generated passively) which will follow you around and attack things within their range. At first you can only call three helpers at a time but through the game's gold-powered upgrade system you can raise that limit, as well as upgrade each mercenary. Brad can also spend chords to buff his team in various ways, and stun enemies when he reaches certain killstreaks.Monsters come from three lanes on the right and trundle towards your crystal on the left, and if either that or Brad is destroyed, game over. Your minions also have health, so you'll need to weave your whole formation through the lazy projectiles your foes will lob. The game is broken into four chapters of five lengthy waves each, with a boss on the fifth wave. Everything drops gold for you to buy upgrades with between runs; once you start playing you're locked into what you have until you win or die.This is where the game starts to wear thin, because death is going to be stopping you pretty regularly. There's a significant jump in difficulty between chapters, mainly because of enemies getting huge health and damage boosts. Little critters you could kill in 3 arrows suddenly take 12. It feels like the power curve of a mobile game, forcing you to grind on your current level before unlocking enough upgrades to stand a chance at the next. That's exactly what I did, too, playing chapter 1 until I had the archer units fully upgraded, along with a larger squad size and higher base levels and other stuff. Chapter 2 was still a challenge but I pulled it off, and then Chapter 3 immediately kicked me in the balls until I died.Ultimately the upgrade system is going to be your main focus, and it isn't even that interesting to begin with. Unit upgrades just make them generally beefier but the early units don't hold a candle to the later ones you unlock, so you can waste gold on guys that can't carry you to the finish line. There's a 2x drops unlock that's basically mandatory but terribly expensive, and the squad size upgrade is obviously the most important but scales ludicrously in cost. It's going to take a lot of grinding the same waves over and over, which will exacerbate how slow and long they tend to be, and how little you actually need to do besides dodging bullets.Even the actual combat is underwhelming, with slow projectiles and weak sound effects for all of them. You get virtually no feedback on damage, either, with a hit doing a sliver of health and a hit one-shotting you looking and sounding exactly the same. There's very little variety in enemy behavior as well, and that extends even to the bosses. And forget about the survival and escape modes, because they dumb down the gameplay even further. Like I said, it's a cute concept to hang a game on but Bardbarian is paper-thin, offering little in the way of content or challenge to keep you rocking along.			"

Though its really hard to get alot of money and getpassed the levels and get acviements. But well , I love this game.    Right now this is my FAVOURITE tower defense game. I think they should add multiplayer or co-op in the game though. That would be awesome.If you could play in co-op with 2 controllers or 1 keyboard and controller and in multiplayer mode withyour friends , online ! That would be epic !    The cartoon style in this game brings that enjoyment. Its really nice looking and totaly worth your money and time.I recommend this game to everyone , every gamer. Modern or old style.			"

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/269490		

5/10 tis cuteThis game is like a action rts.Your main character does not attack but can summon or rally his troops.He has a little racoon pet that can be upgraded to fetch things like gold or items from the town folk.You pick 3 out of up to 15 classes to take into battle to summon them and help you fight.Bard will slowly gain notes over time or they can be dropped from enemies.These are used to call in a unit or to use 1 of the 3 buff that will increase your party's attack, defense, or speed.The villagers and fort can also be upgraded so they give you items and add defenders to your fort.In the main story you play through 4 sets of 5 levels with the 5th always being a boss (there is also a days 2).In Survival enemies and friendly units will randomly spawn on the board and you try to see how long you can stay alive without any bard powers.In escape mode you have no bard powers and try to see how far you can get wile avoiding poison pools, enemies, & there shots.Overall its not a bad take on rts games and the units do vary and will change your play style depending on who you bring.

												Surprisingly fun little game. It's a nice mixture of tower defense, ARPG, strategy and bullet hell. Thankfully, they removed any kind of IAP from the iOS version and instead, everything has to be bought using ingame currency. It's a little grindy at first, but soon enough you'll find yourself winning obscene amounts of gold and buying any upgrade straight away.It's really addicting, and for the asking price, it's well worth it			"

A decent ""tower defense"" game where you play, get gold, die, buy upgrades, and repeat until you're finally able to fend off all the advancing hordes.So in that sense...it's pretty repetitive, especially the beginning levels since you have to play them so much to level up your favorite companions to then make it further in the game.  Your companions are the only way to attack enemies for you are the bard player, their leader, and they trail behind you or just in front of you whever you go.  For companions, you do get a wide variety that unlock as you progress in the game, from short range heavy damage, to long range low damage, healers, and other abilities, etc.  I found if I just picked a couple to focus on and upgrade those, I found I could go farther.For what it is, the game is pretty well done and I had a pretty good time, but the game could definitely use more music -- that just added to the repetitive feeling of the game.The Good:+ Nice graphics.  I like the style and the theme of the game.+ Nice style of gameplay.  Leading the companions to do the attacking for you.+ Entertaining.  I not only finished the campaign but continued on to complete some additional Steam Achievements.+ Nice upgrade options.  You can upgrade yourself (health, speed, number of followers, etc), your companions (health, damage), and your town (pet, health/gold bonuses while playing, strength, defenses).+ Couple other game modes. Survival Mode where you just run around (not in town) and see how long you can survive where you are given a few periodic random drops like bacon (for health) and followers.  And Distance, where without any followers you see how far you can run without taking a single hit.  They're both fun for a few attempts, but I like that they were included.The OK:~ Every level the same.  It's always your town.  The monsters change.  Nothing else.  Not even the lighting despite the levels being grouped into different times of the day.  (Morning, Noon, Evening, Night).The Bad:~ Too repetitive.  Felt too much like grinding the same levels over and over to get gold to level up your guys to survive longer.Overall:  This is a fun Tower Defense game with a 5.7hr campaign (for me), suffering only from being too repetitive early on.  7.5 out of 10.

												Stuck on a wave? Buy some friends! Bacon can be the difference between life and death.Bardbarian is a casual RPG ""tower defence"" game. You play as Brad the Bardbarian and your aim is to protect the town crystal, which is conveniently placed at the end of the town, with a huge field of open grass separating it from the forest. This game is different to other games in the RPG tower defense genre, however, because instead of the main protagonist, Brad, fighting, he summons troops using notes that he has played on his lute to fight for him. The troops can range from wizards and mages to knights to even mechanics, so you can make some pretty interesting crew combinations.The main idea of the game is very similar to that of ""Earn to die"". You obtain money as you play and you can use it later to upgrade things in three different categories. Your troops, your town, or yourself. This can lead to some extremely repetitive grinds for gold, but other than that the gameplay is excellent. There are 2 different types of difficulties: Casual, and Insane. Casual would be for people who haven't played much of the genre before, but for me, insane was just the right amount of difficulty to make it fun. Having to dodge while still being in range to shoot makes this like no other tower defence.All in all, I'd say that everyone should give this game at least a shot. It's very enjoyable and the price is pretty fair for the content you get.			"

												The game is nice for people who love music . In game you're  a hero who fighting agaist monster with you're unit. So of unit you unlocked by waves or taking other gameplays mod. There's no checkpoints between games. Checkpoints is only when you done of area then you can start from there. When you come in wave 4 you will unlocked mage. She can heal you but when she   heals you she gonna lose her life and if you want to she heal you will need to stay. First boss will be in stage 5 last stage of morning. Then is second boss in wave 10 then in 15,20 and last boss in 25 wave. You can upgrade you're hero,unit  and castle.In game you have skills which take 10 notes attack,speed and defense. Notes is in battle money you need for using skills and buying units. You have a special skill which stun enemy for  few second it's useful.My rating for this game is 10/10 I love it and i don't need checkpoints between waves			"

												mobile port, a simple twist on tower defense with mobile defend units and upgrade. to slow for me, and units can only be uppgraded when you die. so you need to die to get far in to the game. making you replay boring maps so you can get the money to continue where you left off. for me this is way to slow and to much repetition.

												Bardbarian is a casual action game with hints of tower defense. I wasn't a huge fan of the game's cartoonish look, but tower defense is my favorite casual genre of game, and I go out of my way to try any game of the genre, whether it claims to add something new or not.Bardbarian is fun in doses, but it quickly wears out its welcome. It adds something new to the tower defense genre, which is the fact that your ""towers"" are various characters that you can upgrade and you can influence their actions using music. You also have no stationary units (other than a full upgrade later on in the game where you can have units defend from on top of two buildings), and you are in charge of moving to the enemies and killing them off before they get close to your town center. While this is a new take on the genre, I didn't find that it added much enjoyment gameplay-wise, and in many cases, it turned out to be frustrating. You essentially have three entrances where enemies spawn, and the screen isn't large enough to cover the entire ""field"", so it's easy to be focusing on defeating enemies on one side of the screen and completely miss enemies coming through on the other side, because they are not visible on screen but only on the mini-map.One of my favorite things about the tower defense genre is conquering maps and moving onto new challenging maps, and figuring out the best strategies for handling the routes enemies would take. Unfortunately, Bardbarian has one map, and one map only. It's understandable, in a way, because your towers are not stationary, so therefore new maps wouldn't be necessary. However, the game quickly becomes dull and repetitive because your surroundings are never changing. To add insult to injury, this game is one of the biggest grindfests I've ever played. Reading other reviews that state it was developed for phones now that I've played the game makes total sense, because this game sure does play like a phone game. Expect to play the same levels and waves of enemies over and over and over and over in order to save enough gold to buy even some of the most basic upgrades. Also, there are 20 waves of enemies, total, in the game. 20 waves TOTAL, which is equal to about one or two maps in most other tower defense games. The game only saves your level progress at every five levels, so if you don't beat the boss at the ends of levels 5, 10, 15, and 20, don't expect to start back on the level you died on. You have to go all the way back to the beginning of that ""section"" to try again.Another issue I find with the game is the fact that your units are so easily killed, even when fully upgraded. Playing through a grindfest of a game to save enough for certain upgrades can be somewhat justified if those upgrades make the player feel as if it was worth it, but upgrading anything--anything, from the Barbarian's own health to his units or the town itself--feels ultimately underwhelming. The game also sports a survival mode (with one map to choose from) and an escape mode (one map). Both are ways to post high scores, add small value to the game, and potentially make a little extra gold. Survival mode is fun for a few tries, but escape wasn't really my cup of tea.In summary, I began this review with the intention on giving the game a ""recommended, but only on sale for $2.00 or less,"" but the more I thought about the game to write this, the more I realized I couldn't justify recommending it. In the end, it's up to you to decide, but I implore those fellow tower defense fans out there to find a different game of the genre to try. Bardbarian removes more enjoyment from the genre than it adds, and to be completely honest, it's possible that tagging this game as tower defense does it an injustice, because I went into this game wanting something that I ultimately did not get. Bardbarian can be fun, but it plays like an action casual phone or online Flash game. If you are willing to pay to purchase it with that in mind, you probably won't be disappointed. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this.Edit 4/29/2016: I've noticed that an abnormal percentage of people have marked this review as unhelpful. As I always try my best to cover all aspects of a game in a review to be helpful to potential consumers, I would appreciate any comments on my review letting me know the information I've left out, or any questions you have about the game which my review left unanswered. I will update the review as applicable. Thank you!			"

												This game is tons of fun! You can easily get lost in it for a good amount of time.Although It sort of has a grindy feel to it, kill enemies - get coins - die - upgrade - fight more, etc.. It is very fun and can be quite challenging as you get towards the harder enemies before you've upgraded your hero and his units. It is quite rewarding though, as you try to survive and unlock more characters and better stats for your group and battle area. Good Fun, Do Recommend.			"

												What a fun game! I am not a tower defense games player, but this one is really good and addictive. You collect gold to upgrade your minions, your city and your hero. It's not really hard and you can experiment with all the different minions what's the best team for you, so high replay value. The more into the campain you go, the more difficult the levels and the bosses are... but it's always  a fair battle. There are also 2 (3) survive mode.It is possible to get also 100% achievements, if you are into them ;-)Support the devs that made this little gem and buy it, you will not regret it! "

Captains Log, 19.01.2016Setting sail for Uncharted Waters! Destination: Bardbarian. Guitars! Rock music! Monsters! Upgrades! But is that enough to make a Barbarian become a Bardbarian?First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]Bardbarian is an interesting mix of skill based dodging and Tower Defense elements wrapped in a casual game with comic-style graphics and a music theme behind it – the Bar(d)barian:You control a Bardbarian (a Barbarian who decided to go all pacifist and only jam on his Battleaxe made Guitar – “okay”) and lead a small group of fighters to defend the towns vanity item, a crystal, from thieving goblins and other monsters. So far so, so trivial – completely okay for a casual game. And that is the end of the story folks. Seriously a sad story. I really don’t want to tell you. But here goes:         - It is a sad port from Android to PC. Sad because of three things:        - UI Controls are pretty horrid if you don´t have a touchscreen.        - There should probably be more music in this music-themed game than one music track on infinite repeat with slight alterations to speed when activating one of the three active skills. *rant mode on* damn it! It´s called Bardbarian and is about music…how could a developer not add more tracks? The whole darn world is full of musicians who would have loved to contribute a full-fledged album to this game! *rant mode off*I am serious, though, with a 12 to 24 track album behind it, this game could seriously be awesome. Of course, there are balancing issues with the normal and insane gameplay mode. And yes, it may be a casual game. But that is not the issue. I know it is a casual game. I only want to play it for 30 minutes maybe. But I definitely go insane after 3-5 minutes because the single track of music is repeating. And it isn´t even very engaging in itself. And as soon as I decide to turn off the music, I also turn off the guitar shredding sound effects of the Bardbarian – so no own music along the shredding -, which is so sad I cannot write any more about it.Look and feel and sound:Looks casual, plays casual, misses all the music a music based game should have. Controls during the wave based fighting are okay. Not perfect, but solid enough for a game of this genre (TD, Casual, Bullethell – maybe not a genre but a mix of) Navigating menus is horrible and directly taken from Android to PC without alteration – guess what – sad.Captain's Orders:I cannot recommend this. It is a game I like to 40% (well primarily the idea behind it)  but the 60% that don´t work for me hit me too hard in my face / brain / ears that I just cannot go around it to give it a second look.Verdict:Overboard! Quickly to be marooned on a lonely forgotten Island!For more Reviews visit  CaptNemo's Log[captainnemoweb.wordpress.com]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit CaptN3mo's twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] "

												Bardbarian is a delightfully charming tower defense game. As Brad, the guitar playing barbarian, you lead your merry gang of friends (towers) around with you, defending your towns crystal from exploding. There are a large assortment of upgrades (both to your friends, yourself and your city) and the simple yet challenging game play makes for quite a bit of variation in your individual defending style. It's like Caterpillar meets Brütal Legends meets Dungeon Defenders. Solid 4/5.			"

In the game itself you have to protect your town crystal and try to not die. You have to fight the incoming waves of always getting stronger enemies. What I also like is that you can fairly achieve all of the achievements to get the 100%. I strongly recommend this game, especially because it is not that fame.			"

YouTube™ Video: Bardbarian! A First Look 

			Views: 172		

			I take a look at Bardbarian. Don't forget to like and subscribe!		

Video Review Above!What a fun addicting game this is.  Treefortress really hit this one out of the park.  I picked this game up thinking it might be interesting and 5 hours later it was 2 am and I frantically went back and forthfrom the different game modes trying to earn more gold and discover the hidden minions.Bardbarian is like a RTS/TD game where you are brad and by using your awesome axe-lute you can summon different minions to destroy waves of enemies attacking your village.  You are also able to buff yourminions with power rifts using notes that you passively generate.  There are three modes story, escape and survival.  All of which you earn gold to level up all of your minions abilities and even someof the village, like the town drunk( he vomits everywhere to slow the enemies down :)).  As you progress through the story mode you are able to unlock more minions which gives you vast flexibility on your playstyleand strategy as that you can only have 3 minions to choose from any given attempt.the game has two difficulty settings normal and insane.  Insane is... well pretty much insane.  The story mode is split into three parts morning, noon and night I still haven't been able to get through noon on normal so there is a lot of game here for the $.  Speaking of which at 6.99 this game is an absolute steal.  If you are still reading this, what's wrong with you, go buy the game you won't regret it!			"

It's very simple and costs a meager 7 bucks.In this game you will protect the crystal on the left from the dudes coming from the right. Everytime you fail you will be given the oppurtunity to upgrade your stuff. In general this is the entire game. You kill things, get gold, get further, die and upgrade. It's not a bad game if you enjoy this and I found it fun for a bit, but it doesn't hold a lot of variety. It also doesn't help that the metal knight dude is full on OP and makes variety a joke. I'm also not a fan of the fact the healer kills herself to heal your units. That makes them somewhat worthless.I'd still recommend the game as something to mess around with, but I would not recommend it for serious play. It's also got a survival mode where you try to live as long as possible and a mode where you run along and try not to get touched by anything, but 7 bucks is stretching it for this. Average game I would say.			"

Singleplayer mode's in this are fantastic and is very controller friendly. The description of the game tells you alot about it and manages to nail each word. From the art, to bosses, to looting gold. The simple storyline of Brad is also fantastic and you soon forget that you are the one leading. The crossover content is a big win & love not just the art, but SFX and music is very good too. The game is put together very well & Co-op features would be a real big seller. Workshop if they add it would spice up even the spicy'es of dishes.I highly recommend this game, especially for that cute, adorable, silly ratcoon :)10/10			"

The upgrades are all worth getting to hel power up your hero. This is a great Tower defense/RTS game for giving something new to the tower defense genre. If you haven't gotten this game yet,it's worth it even at the full price. The only bad I could say about this game is when I play endless mode a couple of times my left arrow key locks up and I have to restart the game. Am not sure if it's my laptop or the game itself.

												I didn't make the connection while playing, but I can now easily see where someone would classify Bardbarian as a 'tower defense' game where you move the towers around a big map.  Though, by that same definition, Robotron and Smash TV might also be called 'tower defense'.  **mind blown**Fun, quick and humorous. I've enjoyed this delightful little overhead shooter for a while on Android, but was frustrated by having my finger in the way of the action -- plays much better with a gamepad or mouse/keyboard.  Glad to see the developer brought it to the desktop.On the down side, it's not particularly deep, and it's eventually as repetitive as one might expect. But hey: video games.			"

												""Bardbarian"" is a kind-of tower defense game with the towers being minions that you can spawn around you.The further you get in the game, especially on Insane mode, it becomes a bullet hell shmup with different strategy approaches using a combination of 3 out of 15 minions like archers, mages, healers etc. It's your choice if you want a tanky front of paladins, followed by a group of mages to bomb your enemies and healer to support you and your team, or an army of knife-throwing ninjas and a single necromancer behind you, giving you a zombie meat shield up front (I chose that for Insane mode) or something completely different.In addition, you get an awesome catchy Metal theme, cute graphics, lots of upgrades to purchase and the additional game modes Endless and Escape. All in all an awesome deal of many fun hours for a cheap price (especially when reduced).I highly recommend this game to anyone that isn't disgusted by tower defense games and (not too hard) bullet hell shmups.

												This is a really enjoyable tower-defense game. There are a lot of unique characters, each with pros and cons, which are fun to mix and match in each playthrough. The game takes a good five hours to finish and then you can play ""day 2"" or try Insane mode. There's also a survival and 'escape' mode which are surprisingly fun to waste time in. For the price, this isn't a bad choice and worth picking up on sale if you think you'd like it.			"

												Bardbarian is a great game. You fight to survive against waves of enemies while also defending your town. You don't directly attack enemies. Rather, you play as a Bardbarian who shreds on his axe (this 'axe' being an actual axe, not a guitar), summoning other classes to aide you. There are quite a few classes to unlock, each with its own uses. You can level up these classes, and you can even level yourself up in the process. You can even employ the help of the townspeople, even the town drunk.I highly recommend this game. It's tower defense done right, and I'd argue that even people who don't tend to enjoy tower defense games should give it a shot. It's that good.			"

												I'd have to say this game is very fun. I was very pleased to buy this game and look forward to playing much more. Singleplayer mode's in this are fantastic and is very controller friendly. The description of the game tells you alot about it and manages to nail each word. From the art, to bosses, to looting gold. The simple storyline of Brad is also fantastic and you soon forget that you are the one leading. The crossover content is a big win & love not just the art, but SFX and music is very good too. The game is put together very well & Co-op features would be a real big seller. Workshop if they add it would spice up even the spicy'es of dishes.I highly recommend this game, especially for that cute, adorable, silly ratcoon :)10/10			"

												You play as Brad, the bardbarian (Sorry dyslexics). The goal is simple: defend the town crystal in a wave-defense system. There are quite a few different units to unlock by getting to higher waves. The enemies have a good variation in strength and speed. Art is simple cartoon style, but fits well and goes well with the game and the music is well done. You can also have a pet raccoon. Would recommend playing bradbarbadarian.			"

												This game was a positive surprise for me. The game is about a former barbarian who was sick of fighting with weapons and decided to turn his axe into a lute. With his lute he summons different warriors by his side to attacktheir enemies. The game is a basically a tower defense game but you can only place towers next to your character, and then you run around the field protecting the village crystal. It's a common concept with it's on twist, and the music is really good. Charming graphics and nice controls makes this a fine game. You also have 2 other game modes except the story. Survival which is one big screen, lots of enemies, and you running in circles to survive. Then we have Escape mode, which is screen scrolling mode, where you simply try to escape the darkness coming in from the left. In total the game has many hours of gameplay, and lots to give. 7.6/10			"

												So, played for twenty minutes. Here are my initial impressions:Very high production value. Great art. Well made music. Concise introduction and tutorial to the game. The suggestion to play with a controller in the beginning was spot on. Very smooth controls. In fact, the game mechanics are tight and extremely enjoyable. This isn't a ""tower defense"" game. It's actually a very refreshing take on that dynamic that I would argue sets it apart from tower defense. You're constantly running around, avoiding projectiles, while navigating your units in positions that will inflict the most damage. Gold collecting to boost the cards you have, along with collecting more cards adds a lot of replay value to the game as well. I'm already interested in trying all the different game modes to see what cards I can find. Not mention, indie game references to boot (Meat Sack card? Yeah, I want that).A+ Best $2 I spent on Steam this year.UPDATE: I ended up 100% this game, buying it for iOS, 100%ing it on that, and buying three copies for friends. Yeah, I ended up loving this game.			"

												--------------------- Intro--------------------In this game you are put in control of Brad the local Hero. One day monsters attack Brad's village but when the local townspeople call upon his help Brad does not really feel in the mood for fighting.So he picks up his custom guitar to play some tunes instead. With his massive tunes Brad can summon forth units of all sorts and sizes to protect him and fight in his place.Will Brad be able to protect the towns Crystal and will he be able to fend of waves of foes come to destroy it?--------------------- About the Game--------------------To control Brad you can use either, keyboard or controller. Though a controller is highly recommended to get the best fun out of this game.While standing still Brad plays his instrument which only then generates musical notes that can be used, like currency, to summon forth several units. Those units will follow Brad around and do the attacking instead. The units are anything from close to long range combat, each with unique attacks, strength and weaknesses.At the beginning your maximum party size can only contain 3 summoned units, though this can be increased through upgrades you can purchase with gold coins that drop from enemies.Musical notes are also used to allow the purchase of temporary buffs, such as increased speed, strength or raised defence.Brad also has a special Stun skill that charges with each kill and is your out of Jail skill when things get hairy.The game is progressing through waves of enemies which will try and destroy the town's Crystal. If the Crystal or you die the game ends and you will have to start from scratch again.Though after several waves a Boss is encountered and upon defeating the boss you unlock a save point you can choose to continue from after you die.Between deaths, you can use collected gold coins to upgrade the town, Brad himself, your units or purchase general perks.Upgrades can be anything from stronger units to higher health, bigger party sizes (allowing more units to be summoned at any one time), increased musical note generation and much much more.During each wave of enemies you must run around to get close to the enemies so your units can attack them. Be careful though as your units as well as yourself can get damaged and die.If you die the game ends, if your units die you can re-summon another unit at the cost of Musical Notes which are not endless as they only generate when Brad stands still.Sometimes musical notes are also dropped by enemies or can be given to you by supporting town folks you can purchase as perks in the upgrade store.--------------------- Summary--------------------The game is a lot of fun and the upgrade store has a lot to offer to make the game more interesting as you continue to play it adding great replay value. Death is expected in this game as it gives you then a chance to spend your hard-earned gold coins on upgrades and perks to support you to blast through more waves than before.I definitely would recommend this game.--------------------- Known Bugs--------------------Brads special Stun skill is most of the time bugged and cannot be executed by keyboard or by controller.The game is still fun and even without that skill very playable, just a little more challenging.I don't know if it effects all users or only users with controllers or certain combination of things but either way the developers have replied in this thread that they are aware of it, had even released a fix in July but it still is bugged. (For me anyway).I assume/hope another update is soon to follow.			"

You dodge enemy attacks, while recruiting ""towers""  which will follow you around while shooting back at the enemy, the goal is to protect a building while at the same time not letting your Bard die. You can cast a small number of buffs which last a short while to boost your party.People may disagree with me on this, but it reminds of a lot of Geometry Wars.			"

												I just can't recommend this game, even though that puts me in a small minority. I play a lot of casual, quick games. They key thing is they need to entertain me quickly, easily and just have short bursts of fun. I started this game, and realised I was just... well... bored...Take games like Guild of Dungeoneering, The Binding of Isaac. Diehard Dungeon, One Finger Death Punch or a lot of other awesome casual games. They are fun, quickly. This honestly wasn't. I was just running around dodging while my summons fire. If I compare it to The Binding of Isaac, which is also broadly about running around dodging and shooting, this just isn't in the same league. I know they are different, but ultimately, one is fun, the other just isn't. Sorry, but casual shouldn't equal mundane. The team have tried. And it's a polished game (other than sloppy text not lining up with the dialogue boxes). But it's just plain boring unfortunately :(			"

												I usually avoid games with the Tower Defense tag, but this one looked interesting and I enjoyed it more than I expected.I played it on a large screen with an Xbox 360 controller.  The game was well-suited to living room play and I'd recommend playing it that way if you can.The variety of units is good and allows some customization of your party.  You start with basic units like an archer and a brawler, and can unlock more specialized units like healer, tank, ninja, etc.  All of the units I tried seemed like they would be useful in the right circumstance.  My favorite was the necromancer - she raises the dead, who can be used as an unwilling meat shield in front of your party.			"

The progression of leveling up abilities for you, the town and your group draws you in for one more go after each failure.Only minor draw back is the game tells you during the tutorial that its best to play the game with a controller which is fine for me but then when your back in the menus you really need to go back to using mouse controls.

												A cute little game with the addictive qualities of both tower defense and bullet-hell games.=-=-=-=-=ADORATION:Great Price, Excellent Replay Value, Leaderboards kept on Steam, Charming and colorful, Plenty of gameplay time for my $8. ""Tower Defense"" rather cleverly combined with ""Bullet Hell"" tactics.CRITICISM:I know its also a bullet-hell game, but the tower defense bit is badly balanced. I was juggling the toughest enemies in the game with push-backs and stun before it was even close to over. Waves 1-18 are child's play, and then 19 and 20 will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don't have a balanced party of stuns, slows, and push-backs at your desposal. I felt too powerful most of the time in Normal Mode, making it feel kind'a grindy.TIPS TO THE UNWARY:-Skip normal mode and play on insane. You'll do less gold-grinding that way, and the game is actually better balanced. You also won't have to play the game twice to get all the achievements. (I got all but one)-Don't forget to SCROLL DOWN in the unlockables and permenant upgrades screens. I didn't get the ""double your gold"" item until almost the very end, and felt very much the fool for it.-The wizard's pushback/stun is the most potent thing in the game. Upgrade him early and JUGGLE all your enemies!TDLR:Definitely recommended! :D			"

												""Bardbarian"" Is a fun fast paced party shooter with play styles much like a mobile tower deffence. The gameplay is fun and exciting and very fast paced. Some situations can literally put you in bullet hell firestorm adding to the intensity. The upgrading system awesome, their are so many upgrades! There are a few different play styles included in the game, aswell as what seem like an endless gameplay mode after the game is beat bosses and minions double up and become stronger. There are several different kinds of enemy which provides for much diversity. There are also a lot of different kinds of party members to be used that helps make the playing experience that much more unique. Graphics are pretty well done, vibrant good clean coloring. Sound fx are basic, music is fair but i would've loved to hear a more intense sound to the music aspect but eh. Pretty fun addicting game and well worth the play!			"

												My wife bought this for me and surprised me with it while I was feeling crummy. It was definitely a pleasant surprise. Allegedly, she got it for around $1.00, so the stakes weren't high if it turned out to be not the best. I will say that it was absolutely worth $1.00, but I'm not sure if its worth almost $10. I got every achievement except one by playing for less than fifteen hours. Doing so involved beating the game on both difficulties (Insane and Normal). Maybe if it had multiplayer (though I'm not sure what that would look like), it would have more replay value, but I pretty much played it to completion. I really enjoyed it, so I even went back and beat it with a couple different team configurations than I did the first two times. After doing so, though, it does start to get repetitive (especially the music, which is good, but can grow to be annoying after multiple hours of play). If you can get it for five bucks or less, I'd recommend it.			"

												A bit hard to classify this game closest would probably be bullet-hell, except without you firing back as your hired NPC henchmen do that for you, with a touch of RPG and Rogue to finish it off. The cocktail is surprisingly good.You can get notes (resource) by killing some foes, a certain unlockable structure and by standing still (generally ill-advised). With this you can then hire your henchmen, stronger ones unlocked as you proceed through the day (read: levels) and of course the more powerful the more costly. Upon dying you can use the second resource (gold) to permanently upgrade yourself or your henchmen.It also comes with 2 minigames (to help gather some gold, both also unlock a henchman), one a running (just prevent getting hit) which is the least fun one IMO and a 'survival' mode where you randomly get henchmen to you with increasingly difficult enemies, which is a little more fun. But the best fun is of course gotten from the main game.			"

												Fun little game thats a mix of Tower Defense and Bullet Hell. The gist of the game is you have to defend a town from huge waves of enemies and while you, the Bardbarian, don't actually attack anything, you will summon and buff a large assortment of minions with the power of ROCK! All the while you'll be dodging and weaving through enemy shots as your minions unload hell into the baddies!From the lightning bolt firing Wizard to the stun hammer tossing Dwarf, you'll find tons of combo choices of units to best suit your style! All sorts of upgrades as well will keep you playing as its rather addicting to unlock and upgrade everything!			"

												This is a pretty simple and fun title. You are a bard who builds his team out of warriors, archers, wizards or even mechanical turtles to defend your city. It is attacked by waves of diversified enemies, which gain in power every consecutive day.While playing different war tunes to raise your team’s attack damage or restore their health points you battle bosses, level up, collect gold and unlock new companions. The goal is pretty straightforward: survive until the monsters ♥♥♥♥ off, but prepare to farm much gold as the game is rather difficult.   "

												BardBarian is the typical game that someone plays once in a while when is bored or just want to have some fun.It has a story mode, with 4 chapters/20 levels, a survival mode, and a ""run as long as you can"" mode, that increases the gameplay length, which it's something positive.Basically, you just use the keyboard or gamepad to control Bard, and recruit other characters to fight for you. They will stick with Bard and they will automatically attack the enemies.No, you can't attack with Bard, the only thing you can do is to use some specials to increase the damage, defense or speed of your characters.But it's fun anyway. You can unlock and combine multiple characters, each one with his special ability/attack.I acquired this game on Humble Bundle, so it was very cheap. And it came with android version too, which is very solid and enjoyable like the PC Version.			"

												Brad the Barbarian has grown tired of the XP grind, but he can't stop the need to have to farm gold.Bardbarian is a clever twist of taking elements from RPGs and Tower Defense into an action game where you are protecting your town's crystal from monsters, except that YOU are not. Brad decided he doesn't want to be a fighter, but a musician. So now he plays rock music. He summons warriors, temporarily boosts their stats, and stuns enemies with his music. The power of music eh?There is a Campaign, Survival mode, and Endless (running as far as you can) mode. The last two are both challenges where you can compare your skill against your friends and the rest of the world, and also sources where you can earn gold to upgrade for the campaign. The campaign is pretty tough. Mainly because it will require a combination of skill, and the right upgrades from the countless times of playing.You'll definitely get your money's worth buying this game, if this is the kind of thing you are into. If you like Tower Defense, and you don't mind working the hours needed to earn that ""in-game"" money, you'll probably dig this game.			"

The difficulty system is a bit unbalanced and after you finish it there is not much else to do, but definitely recommended, specially with a controller!.			"

I like the massive amount of upgrades and characters. i wish you could do more as the bard than just jam out and call your friends to do the fighting for you. I'd recommend this game to a friend, it's definitely worth a try.			"

												Awesome game.Defend the tower (or the crystal) with you summons. Play some riffs to bring your summons.You always start from 'wave1' and work your way up. You can pay (in-game currency) to start at another wave (if you reached that wave already).You can buy powerups, unlocks summons (some of them from other games), upgrade your 'town'.Easy gameplay, nice cartoon graphics, nice soundtrack.It's a funny game.

Depending which units u choose for your little party can make a big difference on how u play. its not a huge game but well worth the small price tag.			"

												8/10An incredibly fun game. It feels a lot like a combination of tower defense and arcade games... As if it would be a tower defense game, except you have to move the ""towers"" around with you while making sure that not only enemies don't reach their target but also that you and your ""towers"" survive too.There's a large ammount of characters to use and a lot of different strategies with combining different characters and plenty of unlockables and upgrades will keep the game fresh for a long time. Other gameplay modes adds a bit more variety and Insane difficulty adds quite a lot of challenge while also not being impossible to beat.If there's ever a second Bardbarian game, I'd love to see a longer campaign and perhaps multiplayer!

												   A fun little game where your offense lies in your allies rather then yourself.    I got to say, I love the premise of this game. Being D&D player for many years, I've always seen Bards get the short end of the stick. This one puts the bard center stage at the heart of the party in a funny action-packed way. Lots of dodging, explosions, death, and all in a nice little pg-13 package.    Gameplay is good, though I've only played Bardbarian on PC. The wealth of party members make for some interesting combinations, giving you a lot of leeway on play style. It's a simple, straight forward game that can give you hours of entertainment.   Not real complaints on this one oddly enough. Thoughrolly enjoyed this one from start to end. Even managed to clear all the achievements, which almost never happens with me.   Bardbarian is definetely one to add to the library.			"

												I'm personally a big fan of tower defense style games, my absolute favorite beig Orcs Must Die! 2. Bardbarian, however, is a very close second.With Bardbarian, you don't actually do any attack yourself, or set up towers that attack lanes of enemies. Instead, you move freely about the battlefield, commanding your troops who you bring in with ""Sick Lute Licks,"" which in turn attack the enemies who come in from the right side of the screen. With a variety of attackers (Some long range, some short), a variety of enemy types, and a slew of upgrades to make your life easier, it's a fun game to play...if only for a few hours.The main issue I personally have with the game is that there is litle longevity to it. Once you learn the enemy types and ugrade everythin to max, you could probably beat the game within 6-8 hours, even less if your quick about upgrading your stuff. Even the addition of an insane mde, which barely amps up the difficulty itself, isn't enough to satisfy me for very long. The game does however, have three main games modes.The campaign is split up in to four sections with five levels each. At the end of each level is a boss. Beat the waves, beat the boss, move on. Simple enough. The other two modes aren't so standard. Survival has you in an enclosed area with enemies coming from all angles. Instead of summoning your troops like you do in hte campaign, you find them on the field. This is nice because the notes you generate to normally summon units can be diverted solely on powerups for them. It stinks because they don't spawn into the gamtoo quickly, and you are often times left defenseless, seeing as you are unable to attack on your own. The final mode is Escape, and its basically a run right as long as you can while a wall of death follows you. You collect gold along the way and avoid enemies, making it a good mode to make some quick gold if you need to.All in all, the first few hours of the game were just plain fun for me. Unlocking new allies was always nice, and upgrading them, the town and myself added that extra touch. The other games modes were a lot of fun too. But as I stated befor,e once you get into the 6 hour mark, and have upgraded almost everything...it get sold fast. If the game has any future updates, I'm unaware, so as of right now, it's a good experience, but for a limited time.If you want a game to kill a few hours with, I highly recommend it. If you want something that will keep you entertained for a long time...this will help ease the pain of waiting for Fallout 4 to download...If you thought this review was helpful, let me know! I like doing these, and plan on doing more for the other 190 games I own, so please let me know if this helped! Also, check out some of the other reviews I've done, and have fun playing!			"

												very fun! you are Brad, a barbarian in charge of defending the town, who got bored of midless brawling and decided to become a bard. so you into this arena and have to defend the town against waves of monsters. the goal is prevent them to destroy a big diamond (kinda like the emperium in WoE, if you've played ragnarok online). to do that, you summon some fighters by playing solos with your axe-like-guitar. you can also play solos to buff yourparty, one for attack, one for defence and one for speed. there is also a stun solo, which you can use after playing a few songs (5 in a row if i'm not mistaken); this stun solo does literally what it says, leaves all foes inside a certain radius paralyzed. to perform your songs you spend musical notes, which generate with time (faster when you stand still) or when it drops. monsters also drop gold, which you can use to buy upgrades (buffing summons, buffing songs, increasing your life and many others). there are also two other game modes: survival and i forgot the name of the other one. but i haven't played them yet. in my oponion, only two problems: 1) every 30 minutes there is a bug that doesn't allow me to play the solos anymore. i have to restart the game so it starts working again. the first two times, you think that's ok, but it gets very annoying when it keeps happening.2) the soundtrack is cool, but mind-numbing repetitive. even the solos and the summoning songs are cool at first, but get boring once you've heard them for the 100th time.other than these two issues (which are frustrating) i think this is a very cool game!

												-Very good, both with a controller and without it.-It has a very good upgrade system, not too complicated. -Original Tower Defence, and good for PC, too.-Worth buying, even at full price.I have nothing bad to say about it, other than very rarely the game glitches whilst you're upgrading and the only way I've found to fix it is to force-quit and reopen - but this really isn't a problem, it's not like it takes forever to open it again, and I don't lose anything.Also after two and a half hours solid I probably should turn it off for a bit :P10/10			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Tower defence   game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play this game Fullscreen or windowed mode.There are some other Languages.You are able to change your controls on the keyboard.You can only turn off the Sound and music. There is no Volume bar.You can play this game with a xbox controller.About the game.You are playing with a barbarian that is only able to move around. He can't attack enemies by hisself but he is able to call his friends or units. You are walking around and the units are following you, You can pick up enemy gold if they has been killed and you need to dodge their attacks to avoid damage. Most of the units are surrounding around you but you and them can still take damage. If one of your units has been destroyed, they will drop some of the musical notes. Musical notes are needed to call units. You will get musical notes overtime or sometimes from enemy drops. You can spend gold to upgrade your hero, Units or even town supplies. You are somewhat dependant on your units, because the only thing that you are able to do is walking around. Your units will upgrade themself during waves but these are only temporary. There is a small map on the top, where you can see enemy movement. There are 2 other game modes. Called survival and escape. If playing Escape, you will have 1 health and you run as much as you can on the right side of the screen. Avoiding enemy bullets and grabbing gold on your way. There is a ingame tutorial.Upgrade Shop (Units/Hero/Town).Has small map on the top.Has 2 different game modes. (Survival mode and escape)Units upgrade themself during waves.You can Pause during waves.Game progression feels slow. (upgrading and clearing waves).VERY Dependant on ur units and your units are a bit MEH in term of play.Super Grinding.Game Goes too slow and makes it Semi-BoringOther things.Some Easter eggs. Like Characters from different games.Playing Challenges could spoil some locked units or enemies, as you can use and see them.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												In Bardbarian, you play as a barbarian whose dream is to become a famous hard rock bard. As such, you hang up your axe and arm yourself with an, um... axe, and enlist the help of your friends to battle alongside you to protect your town. This game is really cute and there is loads of replayability with there being several different game modes as well as two levels of difficulty. The graphics are cartoony, with the animations well done, and even though it's all set in the same place, the backdrop doesn't seem to get boring. I highly recommend this game if you want something to do for half an hour or so at a time.			"

The music is awesome and the gameplay addicting. This is already one of my favorite games ever. So for the money to me is a must buy and it only came out yesterday. Tip: If you decide to buy this game buy the Golden Axe, Town Pet, and upgrade your archer at the beginning. Thanks for taking the time to read this review. Now go buy this GAME!!			"

												This is an incredibly fun game. To me, it feels kind of like a blend of Binding of Isaac/Robotron type 'bullet hell' mixed with tower defense. You move the Bardbarian around but he doesn't actually do any attacking himself. You have sidekicks (of different types) who follow you in a tight formation, doing the attacking for you. You move around, helping the group avoid bullets and enemies, playing songs (in true Bard fashion) to inspire their attack, speed, and/or defense. It's really quite a clever way to make an action game where you truly play as a Bard. I only have 2 hours in right now, but I know there will be many, many more put into this gem.  Here's some gameplay footage:

												Brutal Legend + Plants vs ZombiesUnlike Brutal Legend, Bardbarian is honest about what it is (the irony... because it’s a mobile port...mobile games are prone to neglect mentioning just how expensive they are; not really honest... anyone? Jokes); there is no open-world or sidequests tacked on***Unlike Plants vs Zombies, you are free to move about; not bound to setting up your towers/plants.You are Brad, a barbarian who has rigged his axe into a lute. Monsters are attacking the village. You use your axe/lute (so ""axe"") to call companions; you've further solo's to buff yourself and those followers. A dynamic conga-line, you weave between enemies' projectiles, enabling your companions to return fire. You collect Gold (you can buy a Ratcoon to collect the loot for you) to purchase upgrades.Very addicting.***There are two other game modes in addition to the Campaign:--Endless plants you into the thick of it; you only have your three Buff solo's at your disposal. Companions/Health randomly drop. The challenge is to recruit those Companions and not have them die THE SECOND they start following you. The game claims that this is a good mode for farming gold. Too bad your Ratcoon is absent; So sad that Companions (your only means of dispatching enemies) survive for mere seconds. Totally unfair, in my opinion.--Escape has you running from a wall of darkness. No companions to worry about, no strategy in using solo's; strictly a runner mode - one hit kills you. It's much more fun than Endless, though hardly related to the main game.Parting Words: Town Drunk's barf slows down enemies; Super Meat Boy and Octodad are unlockable companions.The HUD is too big, even though the UI is said to have been ""revamped.""...I just now read ""About This Game"":""An awesome Rock/Metal original soundtrack by Maximum Satan ""...why...j-just why?... Damn :/EDIT 2: Get on Insane Mode ASAP and farm Escape; that's where the money is. Granted, I think the prices of Upgrades scale with the larger amount of gold you receive, but progress still seems to go faster than it does in Normal Mode(?)			"

												Bardbarian manages to give something new in the tower defense style games, while being fun and chalenging. The graphics are nothing great, they are flash based, the music while not bad starts to become repetitive because there is only one track at the hordes. Gameplay is where you'll find the fun here. You control the bardbarian Brad, and you summon an assortment of other units to help  you deal with the hordes while defending a town crystal from being destroyed. The units you summon while follow your steps and auto atack enemies based on their range and abilities.You have tons of upgrades to the units, town and Brad himself wich you unlock with money from the loot of your runs.7/10			"

												Personal Rating: 8 of 10A different twist to Tower Defense with RPG elements. You basically controls a Bard which summons characters to your side to try and stop incoming waves of enemies. I know this was originally a mobile game but the PC port was great with different resolutions, balanced gameplay (upgrades are purchased with in game earned coins), keyboard supported plus 3 addtional units.The reason I only gave this game an 8 instead of a full 10 was because I think it still lacked of content such as having more heroes, items, skills or perhaps, longer campaign. After completing the campaign, you can still replay them to earn cash or play the unending mode. The unending mode however automatically resume on the level you last died and it can be frustating specially when you cannot fully summon all units at once to resume but the enemies comes in hordes. I do look forward to Bardbarian II with more witty ideas and content to the game from the developers!			"

												Personal Rating: 8 of 10A different twist to Tower Defense with RPG elements. You basically controls a Bard which summons characters to your side to try and stop incoming waves of enemies. I know this was originally a mobile game but the PC port was great with different resolutions, balanced gameplay (upgrades are purchased with in game earned coins), keyboard supported plus 3 addtional units.The reason I only gave this game an 8 instead of a full 10 was because I think it still lacked of content such as having more heroes, items, skills or perhaps, longer campaign. After completing the campaign, you can still replay them to earn cash or play the unending mode. The unending mode however automatically resume on the level you last died and it can be frustating specially when you cannot fully summon all units at once to resume but the enemies comes in hordes. I do look forward to Bardbarian II with more witty ideas and content to the game from the developers!			"

												Bardbiarian is a baby MOBA. No kidding! Its a single player MOBA on 1/2 a MOBA stage. You've got the 3 lanes spawning creeps and the goal is to defend the MOBA doohickey that will make you lose if destroyed. Its not difficult or complex.On normal difficulty, this game stinks. Its insultingly easy. Bad enough I was going to give a negative review.Hard difficulty... Well, that's where the game actually gets fun.Bardbarian has a distinct newgroundsy free flash game feel to it. It also has annoying bugs that should be fixed but haven't. Also they didn't try to make the music loop properly which is way more annoying than you'd think. Anyway, I found myself enjoying the game. $5 is a bit much for the state the game is in. If its on sale and you've got pocket change burning a hole in your pocket, you can't go too wrong. Just wish they'd f-ing fix the obvious very common bugs though. If they did, I'd say, ""yes absolutely. This game is worth throwing $5 at.""			"

												If you are into bullet-hell, mouse-manipulation, defense, and/or snake-style games, you should really enjoy this game.I had played a similar style of game on the IOS, and it was super responsive because it was all through the touch screen. The app was very fleshed out.This game is just as fleshed out, and I have enjoyed playing it thus far.You play as a bard, so your player character does not actually attack. Instead, you summon support units (ex: archer, fighter, mage; party limit is initially 3 max) who follow you around, snake-style, and attack the closest enemies. In the beginning, you will notice that the party is a little spread out, and this is fixed by upgrading ""body spray"" in the store. The game is very charming and comical, the art and music is very good. Enemies spawn on the right side of the map and make their way toward your town gem on the left. Over time, you slowly gain ""notes"" that you use to summon units (you can select 3 from you unit pool to take along with you into the levels) and also to trigger buffs like enchanced damage, speed, or defense. The upgrading is pretty well fleshed out, as you can upgrade your units, your hero, and the town. For your units, it is basic overall upgrades like health and damage. There are also unlockable characters like Octodad and Super Meat Boy, which is a cute addition. Your hero can upgrade health, party size, party closeness (body spray), and other things. It is critical to upgrade the bard, as once he is dead, your round is over. Upgrading the town is crucial as well, as you can unlock things like a town pet who grabs gold for you (allowing you to effectively dodge more enemy projectiles and not worry about disappearing loot), a town drunk who periodically vomits, slowing any enemies that enter the bile radius. Later, you may unlock a high level barracks or college, which generates extra free units to help you in defense of the town.The game is really, really fun if you like this style of gameplay, and you can easily spend time playing this if you enjoy upgrading to completion.The controls are very responsive, you can easily play with just the mouse, but I recommend you either use the keyboard (WASD) to move + mouse to trigger skills, or to use the mouse to move and the keyboard hotkeys to summon units and trigger skills. The tutorial is short, skippable, and very helpful. Learning curve is minimal, however, the game is suprisingly difficult in thr beginning - I had thought I was fighting the boss, but it was only the ""pre-boss"" (indicated by a skull on the minimap. The real bosses come when you move onto a red (vs. blue) square on the minimap. Needless to say, I got served very hard.Give it a try, definitely recommend.			"

It has awesomeness very similar to Plants vs. Zombies. PvZ is better in my opinion, but this is certainly up there.

												Bardbarian is a nice tower style RPG action defense type of game (if that is even a thing?!)GameplayIn Bardbarian you play as Brad who set's out to defend the precious towns Crystal (and protecting all the residents of the town) calling upon the help of various useful warriors, ninja's, medics etc that are all available for you to choose your own army.The core mechanic of the game is basically a scrolling from left to right action fest where anything that moves or comes your way from the right you must use your own chosen small army to ensure they are taken out before they come anywhere near the town's crystal and inflict damage.Bardbarian is a large game that has tonnes of replayability and XP grinding (that doesn't seem much of chore). It has a nice mechanic that keeps the game flowing along nicely allowing you to upgrade your arsenal of chosen Warriors after each fight is over!Graphics/MusicBeing an Indie game it is sometimes hit and miss with what graphics can be on offer but I personally found the overall 'sheen' and 'quality' to be of a very high standard. The music seems to suit the game well, I liked the touch of the little guitar 'licks' each time you engaged Brad to summon a warrior or power. I accidently left the title screen music playing for about 30 mins on once occasion and it didn't grate on me either which is definitely not a bad thing.Pros/ConsPros + Pleasing high-quality graphics and production.+ A Casual game but still has that 'one more game before I turn it off.. appeal!'.+ Wide arrays of characters for your arsenal of good guys.+ Extra game modes to play alongside the main campaign.Cons - Took a long time to figure out the correct (and best) upgrade paths for your team.- Can have a frustrating one hit death to your main character Brad at the most inconvenient times.Final/Personal ThoughtsBardbarian is a high-quality Indie title that I personally enjoyed playing through, yes it can be frustrating at times but as soon as you have put some time and effort into the game it will reward you with revisiting the same levels but the game being a lot easier to conquer (having a team with fully upgraded warriors!).Recommended purchase if on sale or part of a bundle!---------------------------------------------------------------------------https://twitter.com/osgamegeek - Check out my Twitter Feed			"

												While this game looked really cool, I'm glad I bought it while it was on sale.Simply put it is a mobile game ported to steam but nothing feels like it has been added.It is a pure time waster as you must grind to get coins to upgrade units to get further, but with a limit for 3 followers (for the time being I haven't seen any hints of being able to unlock more) and units who just gain more HP it really feels like a pure grind with no real end point.Also I found it frustrating to have to work out what the other two powers ups do as the tutorial only covers the first one (which in my mind is the only one worth using now I have played a bit more) This really doesn't feel like a game I will keep playing past another the 2-3 hour mark and even then I only played for so long just to see if it went anywhere else.TL:DR. Pure mobile game port and not worth the money in its current state.PS: I hope you prove me wrong in future updates BardBarian, as I like the concept but the game-play is boring and repetitive.			"

												Yet another port of mobile casual game where you need cerebellum, not brain.Only this one is of good sort. While it's not even pretending to be original, this mix is nice from every angle (if you'll not be looking for too long).You'll be playing for the partygoer who can't fight monsters himself, but good at avoiding hits and making friends. And with help of those friends you'll be defending your village from the onslaught of gremlins, lizards, beholders... and so on. The main catch of this game is that those Bard's friends acts very differently, so you can develop various tactics of the best team around you. Some of those helpers will be taking damage, some - dealing it to the enemies, but it's only for start! An engineer, per example, will be setting shooting towers, so for some time you can play it as basic tower defence game - two engineers in your team can overrun almost everything in the first half of the game! Glory to the engineers!And glory to the rock music!But seriously, it's a short break game. It can create some fun, but it's a very simplified game experience. I cannot praise that game highly, despite the fact it is a well made stuff. I'll mark it as 7/10.You surely can buy Bardbarian in some bundle, or with good discount, and spend 3-4 hours of your time. Just don't overdo it. It is mobile casual, and not a chess game. Timekiller.			"

The formula also involves a grind to become powerful enough to get further.  Overall, this did not feel like a worthwhile challenge.			"

												Bardbarian is a td hybrid. Your characters are ""towers"" that can move around, while trying to avoid getting hit by enemy projectiles. Simple, easy to learn, fun gameplay that gets better as you unlock and upgrade using gold from killing enemies. Has a few game modes, different difficulties and boss battles. For the price its a must for td or twin stick fans. Has more depth to it than most tower defense games.			"

												I thought I would change my review mainly because I looked at my play time for this game and I found I played it a lot more then I thought I would. The game is easy to pick up and play and does feature a long list of good guys to help you out after you play thru the game and advance far enough. It is a grindy game and could get old if played for a long stretch of time. However I have played the other game mods besides the reg. mod. I wasnt very good but did manage to get some gold out of it. The best and wisest power up to buy would be the *2 gold it does costs a lot but pays for itself very quickly.I will say that I think I judged the game a little harshley at first. It does have zest to it and the extra characters are very unique. I would give it a 7/10 its a good game. Plus I made some money selling the cards.			"

												If you enjoy a good (?) grindfest just to play a tower defense game, in which your only task is to run around dodging bullets, then this is what you want to buy.To me it felt more like a chore. There is no real motivation, your whole aspiration is basically trying to amass enough gold to buy all the upgrades and then breeze through the game. Problem is, that you don't really have to invest much effort gameplay wise and even if you do, the rewards are just more gold and some unlockable characters, which might or might not have a use to your playing style and whose upgrades you have to pay for with that good old gold again. The whole ""grind gold"" aspect really shows that this was/is a mobile game and the model might work there with their f2p games, but on a PC game I expect a bit more meat on the bone.Other than that it can be an alright 10 minute time waster but nothing you'd wanna play for a longer time. You're basically that barbarian guy, who's tired of grinding for xp so he decided to now grind for gold, which shows us why barbarians have such a low intelligence stat in every rpg ever. To fulfill that tedious task, you're equipped with an axe that is used as a guitar and you're able to summon some followers (who actually do the fighting for you and follow you in a weird snake-like fashion) and to play three different buffs (speed, dmg, def). Your job is to protect the core from baddies, there's a bossfight every 5 or so stages (20 stages in total iirc) and that's that. You are also only able to upgrade your things once you die, so be prepared to start over quite a few times. Sounds thrilling ?			"

A kite training program.  Learn how to dodge with your pack of summoned protectors through a bullet hell while trying to protect your crystal.  Good traing for Diablo and many MOOs.I liked the simple level and play design, enemies come in waves you disptach them with your minions and super powers.  Few buttons make is playable w/a kb/mouse or controller.  It comes with a RPG-lite leveling system to keep it fairly adictive.  If I'd haven't played a dozen simular games this month, I might have stayed with it.			"

												Bardbarian is a somewhat fun game that mixes elements of bullet-hell and tower defense.  The gameplay feels interesting, at first, but lacks more than a few hours of gameplay.  I beat the game on Insane difficulty in about 3 hours.  I have basically everything unlocked and maxed except for a few units (which would require grinding for another hour or so).  Even on Insane difficulty, I found myself standing at the front gate killing enemies before they could even get a single shot off.  Eventually you'd hit a wave / boss that's a brick wall and would require you to die and upgrade (sometimes a few times) before you could pass it.  If the developer could smooth out this progression, it would feel much more exciting to play.Besides all of the cons I've listed above, the game is some sort of Flash port.  I have a gaming PC, and I get about 3 frames per second on the main title in windowed mode.  In fullscreen mode, the main screen doesn't even load and the game crashes.  I spent the first few hours after purchasing this game trying to solve this problem.  The game is littered with other bugs as well.I would avoid this game, personally, but if you like grindy games, I suppose I could recommend it at $1 or in a bundle somewhere.2/5 Stars			"

												The game is not that bad... Reminds Plant vs. Zombies a little, or Poof vs. the Cursed Kitty or Zombie Pirates, or even maybe Orcs Must Die and Sanctum - meaning that you must protect your base (here: town crystal) while fighting ""personally"" and developing new tools of destruction, new defences etc. It's easy to pick up, easy to play but...CONS:- really awful, unesthetic graphics- a game for maybe 3-4 hours (then it becomes boring and very repetitive)- should and could be better- looks like a poor mobile port (which it probably is)- sometimes a little bit too difficult to proceed to the next levels- this electric guitar sounds get quite annoying after a while...- I've lost my savegame after a few hours of gameplay- it's nothing special to be honestPROS:- it's easy to pick up and play- it's funny- many items to buy- good for a few hours if you have nothing better to doVERDICT:IMO all the games that I've mentioned above are simply much, much better than Bardbarian. After 3-4 hours it became very repetitive and boring. If you're looking for this kind of game I would  rather recommend Poof (with 2D graphics) and of course Orcs Must Die (3D graphics) instead. But this one here is also palyable, so if you have a chance to get on a sale for less than 1 Euro maybe you could give it a try... You shouldn't have huge exspectations though. It's a funny, little game with ugly graphics, but it's good only for a while. Generally speaking: nothing special.			"

												I do like this game, but think its is best suited to mobile/touch screen devices. I can't recomend it for a PC (and definatly not a Mac PC in this case), the main game has noticable lag (at the moment). Even if the lag is fixed, I can only say that this game is best suited to a mobile/touch screen device.The second reason I can't recomend it  is because of the repetative grind. Constantly playing through to a death hoping that you have enough gold to make an upgrade to yourself, the town or your units. The games description does state ""The usual grind for XP has grown dull, and he has decided to pursue his dreams of making music instead of shedding blood."" Note that this does not mean that there is no grind.While there are two other modes to continue the grind for gold through, they are briefly fun but challenging. The current price is also steep comparing it to the Android version. If the price is similar to the Android one, then it worth checking out at that point.			"

												This game has the potential of being fun. Unfortunately, I use the aroow keys to move, and there is no place to change the key bindings. Using the keyboard letters for everything, slows me down.			"

												This one has some unique ideas, but I personally find the gameplay a bit too awkward. There's no way to attack anything directly (aside from expensive special attacks) and the only things that can routinely attack the enemies aren't directly controllabe by you. (They just sort of follow you around.) So it's hard to get them to dodge attacks, etc. Basically this game uses some good ideas, but the execution just isn't quite there.			"

												I love this game.  If you're a fan of defending stuff and dodging stuff, why haven't you gotten this game already?  If you're not, you should probably still get this game because it's pretty fun.  The only flaw I've found is that sometimes your allies aren't quite looking at the same things, so maybe like 5% of the time they'll shoot in completely the wrong direction.  This becomes less of an issue the more allies you have, so you'll really only notice it in the early stages of the game.			"

												As a pc game I can not find a good reason to recommend this game to anyone. While the game is not broken in some fashion, it holds to many of its mobile base making of the game, which in turn makes it only fun if that in very very short spurts asking for way to much grinding in return, with no pay off.

			Barbarian is more of a snake, tower defense type game with up grades, ported over from mobile which turns out to fall short, in some key areas.

												Multiple times i have had to shut down and restart the game completely because the ""Stun"" move simply stops working. It will be fully charged and ready to go and it just won't work. Simple as that. Lost many long sessions because of this bug.And the game does a poor job at explaining its own gameplay mechanics (see below)-Game tells you that you will recieve an additional unit to defend the tower if you upgrade the barracks to the max. But they fail to inform you if that unit is effected by levels, buffers, powerups and they also fail to tell you what type of unit and if that unit can score critical hits or not. Things like this are important to know in strategy games.-Game allows you to upgrade your player speed and health but fails to inform you if those upgrades carry over to the other gametypes like survival and escape.-Game lists a ""Healer"" but feels no need to tell you that the healer sacrifices her OWN health to give you more.-Towards the end of the game enemies leave a random skull and crossbones stake in the ground and i have no idea what they are. The game does not tell you.-One perk says ""Keep shops open longer, increase drop rate by 50%"" which costs 2000 gold, while another perks with a golden axe says ""Double your gold drop rate and look good while doing it"". Well i purchased the 2000 gold perk and enemies who dropped 13gold before still drop 13 gold now. So obviously that perk is only referring to musical tune drops which would have been nice to know before i spent 2000 gold.-Game allows you to upgrade your units but fails to explain why characters still ""Level up"" after killing enemies. Why are my maxxed out units still leveling up? -Game tells you units can score critical hits at higher levels but fail to inform you what chance the unit has to score a critical chance or how much more damage a critical hit does.-Game shows a speed boost buffer but doesn't feel the need to inform you that the speed buffer also increases your units rate of fire as well as movement speed. These things would have been nice to know beforehand.-Game tells you that the bards rate of musical notes increase while idle, but do not inform you how much more. Same goes for units like the mechanic which build turrets after standing idle for a period of time, they don't tell you how long it takes standing still before he builds a turret and they do not tell you how much damage the turret does or if the turret can score critical hits or not.-Game does not have a counter to tell you how many active units you have out on the battlefield at once, In the early stage of the game it is easy to count but good luck when you are able to have 9 at once and you have maxxed out ""Body spray"". Yeah good luck counting 9 individual units all twirling/spinning/sprinting around with thousands of rocks/missiles coming at you. It just seems silly to fail to explain simple gameplay mechanics in a game where strategy is key. A small strategical difference can mean the difference between victory or defeat. And the fact that this company does not even feel the need to explain to you what is happening on the battlefield in complete detail is extremely ignorant.And the overall gameplay setup of the game is just poor. Instead of perks being a bonus to give you an edge over your opponent, its mandatory pre-requisite required to proceed through the campaign. The game is purposely setup to force the player to grind for experience/gold. For example, in order to get past stage2, you need about two hours worth of gold farming to upgrade your characters. Even if you do everything properly in terms of strategy, you simply will not do enough DPS to stop the kamikaze bomber before he reaches your base.And ironically, for a game that is called ""Bardbarian"" and is centered around guitar shredding and musical notes. It only has one mediocre background tune for all three game types.And p.s.The vote up/down option is to determine if the review was helpful or not. Its not a damn like or dislike button			"

												This is a flash game, and not a very good one, AND you have to pay for it. It's not worth to pick it up even if it's on sale. Just go on Kongregate and play games that are much better AND FREE. Why is it bad?1. The pacing. It's pretty tough untill you get Wizards, a cakewalk afterwards. You don't need to use other units.2. The GRI-I-I-IND. There's a ton of grind in this game, and it's not even satisfying. You grind for gold, you spend it on upgrades. And there's no visual difference between a maxed out unit and a lvl 1 unit.3. Isn't that enough?DON'T. BUY. IT. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ timewaster, there are better ones.			"

												For a tower defense-style game, it's really not bad. Instead of direct attacks, you command minions to do your damage for you. It's a gimmick, and content-wise the game is shallow. I could easily see a game like this put on AddictingGames and doing quite well. The learning curve is fairly tame and the achievements come easily. The only real downside is scaling cost for upgrades; grinding weak monster bosses for hours seems to be the most cost effective way of gaining gold and fleshing out a small game. For a casual gamer willing to spend less than $4, go for it. This game is 5-10 hours of fun, depending on how low your tolerance is.			"

												I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. Plenty of Characters that you can upgrade and use in many different combinations. The action never stops. The fun is endless. You can upgrade your town that helps you out. This game reminds me of a classic arcade game that I would have played when I was a kid. VERY ADDICTIVE. You can play just a few minutes or you can put hours into it. When I saw it I thought it looked fun so I bought it and it is one of my favorite games. It has elements of strategy, tower defense, rpg like upgrades, and a fast paced arcade game. I recommend it to anyone that reads my review and thinks it sounds interesting. It also does not cost much plus they will be adding future levels, upgrades, and possibly characters. A GREAT game I highly recommend.			"

												A fun little game.At present there are lots of bugs with the game crashing out every now and then, and on load the resolution is set to a wierd size that goes off-screen.It's worth the couple of quid that they are asking for it, but it'll be a LOT better once the bugs are sorted out!All in all, a decent iOS portAdditional:Ok, pretty much all the big bugs (That I've seen) have been squished by now, less than a week after release. They have been very good about fixing issues, getting it all playable quickly.The game itself just gets better with more play, as you increase the number of unit types that your BardBarian can have assisting him.A very fun game, 15 different units to play with in whatever combinations you choose. A couple of other game modes other than defend the Village Crystal, Escape and Survival. Both a good challenge, as is the Defend game type.A great little game and huge value for money at such a bargain price!			"

												lazy ppl scroll to bottomI very much enjoyed this game and would point any TD fan to this game, def worth the 6.99 i paid for it. It has a GREAT replay value with several different modes to keep people happy, and the story mode has a continuation after you've beaten the final boss. The art style is great and reminded me of kingdom rush, which is probably my fav TD of all time.I had a few comlaints that dampened its score with me. The first is that even though the units are pretty uniquethere is no way to improve anything other than their stats, for instance one of the ""towers"" that follows you around throws 3 glowing (bullets? Rocks? i'm not really sure) and there is no way for you to upgrade to say 4 of them, or make them split when they hit an enemy. The music is classic metal style, but it gets a little repetitive after a while, the solos that brad shreds to summom units and use his powers i think were spot on though Also i found 1 bug and what i think might be 1 more. I had the game freeze up on me once, but when i alt tabbed out, came back in and pressed start the game reponded again. During the game you'll get a pet racoon who goes and picks up gold for you, i had troubles with him actually picking up MORE gold that was dropped and putting it into my coffers from an npc i had unlocked that makes golf for you (i wasnt complaining but i knew it wasnt supposed to be this way). The last thing that i had a comlaint with was the 3 steam only characters ""meatstack"" (super meat boy), octodad, and shell razer. Over all these characters were INCREDIBLY underwhelming, i was very dissapointed, plus they recycled other units sounds. For example meatstacks shoots tears. . . but they soujnd like the archers arrows, octodad didn't make any sounds at all.overall 8.5/10Pro'sInnovative TD gameHas unique units for the genreLOTs of replayabilityUnder 10$!

												It's hard to categorize Bardbarian. It's like a mix of tower defense and roguelike, but the best way to describe it is that it's like Soulcaster. It's your task to fend off waves of invaders, but you don't actually fight. Instead you summon different units who automatically fight for you at your side while you cast buffing spells in true RPG bard fashion. The result is an incredibly fun and addictive gaming experience that lends itself to a lot of strategy due to the vast unit combinations available. It's simple enough to pick up, but has enough difficulty to keep you coming back for more.			"

												This game is a fantastic twist on a simple idea. Unit summoning games, which have similar formats to tower defenses, can often be uninspiring, but Bardbarian steps out in front and slaps you in the face. With its pleasing graphic style, unusual twist on a classic hero plot and simplicity of adjusting to game style, Bardbarian is a must have game. Play time can vary depending on how many achievements you want to pick up, but you can spend as little as five minutes on this game and still have a great time. Survival mode is challenging to even the most hardened player and the Escape style mode is a great way to earn yourself some extra gold while actually testing your reflexes and mental sharpness.I wholly recommend this game to everyone and anyone, but especially those that enjoy the format of summoning or tower defence games.

												This game is awesome. It's a partial ""rogue like"" in that you play, die, and the money you make carries over, and can be used to upgrade your town, player, and party. You play as a bard-barian, that doesn't attack, but struns his awesome axe, and calls for varying party memebers (archer, mage, healer, brawler, etc.) and then can strum to add buffs to your party (increased speed, defence, attack, etc.). Great game to play if you want to kill some time and have some fun.			"

												This game is sooo much fun!!! :)  You basically run around the area summoning different ""friends"" to protect you while you make it through each section.  Your ""friends"" will attack for you as soon as you get near enough to any mobs.  It seems deceptively easy to start with but at some point you will fail.... that is where the item shop comes in!!! :)  You can upgrade your hero, the base itself (crystal thing...think Dungeon Defenders! lol) and also you can upgrade your ""friends"" that you can summon!  This means that even though the game hands you your butt on a plate quite often... you will think to yourself ""I'm pretty sure I have a chance now I upgraded that wizard a couple of times"" and you will try again.... and again... and again... but you will enjoy every second of it while you retry again and again!  Great replay value here and great fun to load up for a quick 15 minute blast at a time or even to play for hours at a time. ;)  It's very cheap right now (Humble has it for a measly £1.49 (approx $2 to $3) as I write this!) so what are you waiting for? :) Go grab it! :)			"

Every time you fail, you collect gold that will give you access to new content, and you'll be able to go further in the game.

												lazy ppl scroll to bottomI very much enjoyed this game and would point any TD fan to this game, def worth the 6.99 i paid for it. It has a GREAT replay value with several different modes to keep people happy, and the story mode has a continuation after you've beaten the final boss. The art style is great and reminded me of kingdom rush, which is probably my fav TD of all time.I had a few comlaints that dampened its score with me. The first is that even though the units are pretty uniquethere is no way to improve anything other than their stats, for instance one of the ""towers"" that follows you around throws 3 glowing (bullets? Rocks? i'm not really sure) and there is no way for you to upgrade to say 4 of them, or make them split when they hit an enemy. The music is classic metal style, but it gets a little repetitive after a while, the solos that brad shreds to summom units and use his powers i think were spot on though Also i found 1 bug and what i think might be 1 more. I had the game freeze up on me once, but when i alt tabbed out, came back in and pressed start the game reponded again. During the game you'll get a pet racoon who goes and picks up gold for you, i had troubles with him actually picking up MORE gold that was dropped and putting it into my coffers from an npc i had unlocked that makes golf for you (i wasnt complaining but i knew it wasnt supposed to be this way). The last thing that i had a comlaint with was the 3 steam only characters ""meatstack"" (super meat boy), octodad, and shell razer. Over all these characters were INCREDIBLY underwhelming, i was very dissapointed, plus they recycled other units sounds. For example meatstacks shoots tears. . . but they soujnd like the archers arrows, octodad didn't make any sounds at all.overall 8.5/10Pro'sInnovative TD gameHas unique units for the genreLOTs of replayabilityUnder 10$! VERY much worth itConsmusic can get slightly repetitiveno upgrades to units actual mechanics, only statsThe game is new so hopefully they will update the game with more bosses, and additions soon. Possibly with some way to upgrade units mechanics  . . . please :c			"

												Finished the campaign and tried the side games. Worst game I've played this year so far, I'm mostly baffled by how they completely missed the point of a tower defense game: it's the first game I can remember where you're supposed to lose countless times before winning, you literally can't win the game on your first try. That's a pretty big design fail in my opinion: one of the most important mechanics in a tower defense is being able to buy and upgrade units on the go, in order to adjust to what the waves of enemies contain; here you can't, you just choose three type of units at the beginning and that's it, you can't even upgrade on the field, you have to lose to do it (but you have to grind the money playing and dying soo thereafter), of course the units are severely underpowered at first so the whole system falls on itself and crumbles. Disappointing in almost every way.			"

												Extremely fun game and several hours of playtime guaranteed. The graphics are a bit like Castle Crashers and the game mechanics feel similar as well. I played this game from start to finish with my xbox 360 controller and it worked flawless with the game. The replay value is 'meh' since you can unlock more characters to assist you and you can try new tactics to finish the game faster, but nothing you'd want to play weeks on end. There's also the challenge levels, which are pretty alright, but the most fun for me was the actual campaign.If the current pricetag of 8 euro is too steep for you, I would definitely recommend getting it during a sale.

												As someone who buys a lot of game bundles I tend to jump into numerous indie titles site unseen, something that usually ends poorly. Bardbarian however was a pleasant surprise, a game that takes two genres I'm usually lukewarm on (tower defense and shumps) and manges to combine them in a way that I found super addictive. It does get a bit grindy towards the end, but I found the mechanics entertaining enough in their own right that I never felt too bored. The charming art-style was a big plus as well. An easy reccomendation for anyone looking for something to tackle in bite-size chunks (it's a great 15 minute break game) and for the achivement hunters out there, they're a pretty easy 100%.			"

												Short: Flash game like. Lot of farming. Fun for some time. Wait for sale.This game is basically a flash game, but a good one. You destroy waves of incoming enemies before they reach the town crystal (deliberate silliness). You cannot attack monsters directly, though: you have to chant out a small band of warriors which will follow you closely. The goal is to dodge projectiles, while coming close enough the enemies so that your soldiers can kill them. Which means: you basically only have to move. Simplistic, but it proves efficiently entertaining.Of course, as it has a flash game mechanics, you won't be able to go very far on your first run, but you win money with which you can upgrade yourself and your followers (as well as diverse features). Everything is quite basic, so do not expect much. It is fun, though, even if you have to repeat endlessly the same few waves. There is some diversity among the monsters, and a good choice of different followers. Developers have surely been imaginative on that side. It gets boring after a few hours of gameplay, alas. Plus, the additional modes (survival and run) are most boring. In the survival mode, you can not do anything but dodge every foes for entire long minutes. Running is slow and devoid of any interest. Only the main game mode is worth playing; the other two are for achievements only. Do not spend more than 3 euros/dollars in it.  "

												This is my favorite game I picked up on this year's Summer Sale so far, though its worth full price.Basically make a party that follows you around, and lead them to fight bad guys and dodge their attacks. You can also buff them in a couple different ways. There's a lot of characters to unlock and upgrades to earn. Really fun casual game that makes you want to play just one more round- and there's a lot of rounds to be had.Some people have said its grindy, but I don't mind. I felt getting the golden axe as soon as possible dramatically helped. I also think you should concentrate on a few things at first, and don't spread your money around too much other than some of the cheaper upgrades. I found the pet to be well worth unlocking, and the town is helpful to keep you going.Using a controller definitely makes gameplay better- as soon as I switched from keyboard to controller, I was doing noteably better.

												Nice casual campaign game, The story line, story/campaign mode, is fairly simple, you play as Bert the Bardbarian, a barbarian who's tired of fighting and who's taken up playing the lute and comanding a troop of minions. You protect the town from evil creatures which are trying to steal (or destroy) the town's decorative diamond, and throughout the day more and more powerful creatures come at you in 'waves' (levels).If you've played Rouge Legacy, this game's shop functions similarly, minus Charon stealing all your money. New minions are unlockable through playing through the end of levels, with the exception of two characters which are unlocked by playing the non-campaign levels. And, if you've played Octodad, Super Meatboy, or The Binding of Isaac and are a fan of those games, rejoice, you can unlock them as your minions too. They should really sell these games in a pack sometime.			"

The artwork, design, and the fact that it's a tower defense game all sum up to the game looking just plain fun. 4 hours in,  and it's so far solidly fun and entertaining with good progression design. As for negatives, I'd say the biggest reason why I had it in my library for a while and didn't play it was because of the fuzzy concept of a 'bardbarian'. Hard to picture what that means when you're browsing games to buy/play. Also playing as a bard seemed kind of lame. Probably would've been more compelling to just call it ""Barbarian Defense"" or ""Monster Slayer Defense"" :).			"

												First of all, I started off ""recommending"" the game but after I wrote the review, I think it would be better the other way.I have mixed feelings about the game. Even though I liked the game and finished the ""Normal"" mode, I don't feel like playing the ""Insane"" mode because I got bored a bit because of the repetitive gameplay (and the ""Insane"" mode doesn't seem to be offering something other than stronger/faster enemies in the same levels).Gameplay[\b]: Gets repetitive easily like most of the tower defense games and after the first boss, that's pretty much what you're going to see the entire game. ""Survival"" and ""Escape"" modes are not very addictive to play.Graphics[\b]: Nice but not the best. Some of the boss animations could have been better.Music / SFX[\b]: Really weak. You have pretty few sound effects in the game and 2 different background music, that's all. I think the developer should add ""More Music and Sound Effects"" to the future wishlist.I recommend this game if you are a tower defense genre addict. Other than that, I don't recommend the game. "

I saw it on sale for 69 pence, so thought it was worth a look.  It is definitely worth full price at £3.99.  If there is a sequel I'll definitely be adding it to my collection.

												This game is a fantastic twist on a simple idea. Unit summoning games, which have similar formats to tower defenses, can often be uninspiring, but Bardbarian steps out in front and slaps you in the face. With its pleasing graphic style, unusual twist on a classic hero plot and simplicity of adjusting to game style, Bardbarian is a must have game. Play time can vary depending on how many achievements you want to pick up, but you can spend as little as five minutes on this game and still have a great time. Survival mode is challenging to even the most hardened player and the Escape style mode is a great way to earn yourself some extra gold while actually testing your reflexes and mental sharpness.I wholly recommend this game to everyone and anyone, but especially those that enjoy the format of summoning or tower defence games. You may come away with finger cramp, but you won't regret it.			"

												Buy it for cheap, never at full price, here's why:PROS: *it's fun*cool idea of leveling up attributes, minions, and your town and NPCs*100% achievements is possible*diverse unit composition, can try different combos to spice it upBut CONS:*music (it's the same 45 second tune on loop for the WHOLE game)*100% achievements possible, but you'll want to punch something doing it*no replay value past 100% achievement score. there's nothing to do after the 8-12 hour farm*it's the same thing over and over for the most part			"

												It's a neat little Whats the best word for it... Tower defense or more like an rts because you control your self and summon units that do the fiighting for you and you can use power ups to beat baddiesand protect your crystal. I found my self shifting between keyboard controls and just using the Mouse simply because I could.I would recommend it if it's on sale or your really interested in what you see gameplay wise.			"

												This is a fun little ""casual game"" which I actually found a little hard to figure out at first. I actually really like the song that plays in the background and the concept is actually pretty interesting! I'd like to see a larger 1v1 version or something. One thing I really like is that you can't heal and when you fail you have to start over again (of course if you upgrade those upgrades will continue to work).			"

It's a cute little game, fun and great to play if you're looking for a game to play whenever you're in that bleh kinda mood, bored with the usual games. It shares a familiar feel of flash games, but if you're like me, that's just a plus. It's fun, unique and I would recommend it to anyone who loves flash games. Maybe buy it on sale though. At the $5 price mark, it's a little much for it in my opinion.			"

												Couple of guys working in a basement brought about this lovechild of ""A Bard's Tale"" and ""Plants vs. Zombies"".Simple theme:A warrior who's tired of killing vows never to swing his axe again and makes a lute of out it.  A few seconds later goblins start attacking.  You build up notes (form of currency) over time, and use them to hire different troops and buy 10 second buffs.  The goblins are trying to run up your yard and destroy the Town Crystal (a building at the other end of the yard) but will attack you if you get close.  There are several different types of goblins and monsters and after about 5 rounds, a boss of some sort, then you move straight on to the next level.  You can play a Day Campaign (the levels Morning, Noon, Evening and Night), start from a previously-reached level, Survival Mode or Escape Mode (dodging scroller variant w/ no fighting).Killing enemies also generates gold which can be used to upgrade just about everything multiple times.Epic music, simple controls, fast gratification, and easy on the harddrive makes this good for a gamer's quicky.As they say,Go play some notes and kick some scroats.

												Not the kind of game I ordinarily would have picked up, but after watching my girlfriend play it I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.Gameplay sort of resembles a tower defense game in that there are hordes of attacking enemies, but instead of placing towers you defending it. You do this by controlling the main character who is a barbarian turned bard (hence the name) who summons a party of characters (of up to three different types) that follow him around and do all the heavy lifting.Between its humorous nature, the upgrades, and the increasing difficulty it remains enjoyable despite, or maybe because of, its relative simplicity.

												Nice casual campaign game, The story line, story/campaign mode, is fairly simple, you play as Bert the Bardbarian, a barbarian who's tired of fighting and who's taken up playing the lute and comanding a troop of minions. You protect the town from evil creatures which are trying to steal (or destroy) the town's decorative diamond, and throughout the day more and more powerful creatures come at you in 'waves' (levels).If you've played Rouge Legacy, this game's shop functions similarly, minus Charon stealing all your money. New minions are unlockable through playing through the end of levels, with the exception of two characters which are unlocked by playing the non-campaign levels. And, if you've played Octodad, Super Meatboy, or The Binding of Isaac and are a fan of those games, rejoice, you can unlock them as your minions too. They should really sell these games in a pack sometime.			"

												Bardbarian is way, way cool.  It's a remarkably-good mashup of tower-defence, overhead-view arena shmup, and console-RPG, with a couple of extra modes that not only add to replay value, but help advance the main game, too.There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor going on here.  The gameplay is really solid -- I've never felt that I've been defeated unfairly -- it always feels to me as though I've screwed up something simple to get myself given out.This game has a whole lot of ""just one more go"" in it... and the nice bit is that almost every go, no matter how poor it turns out, will help advance Brad, his entourage, and the town, just a bit further towards surviving the onslaught of evil.In short, you will get a helluva lot of fun for your $5 (or less, on sale).  The artwork oozes character and style, and so does the writing (which is mostly descriptions of units and items, but still.. the humor and thoughtfulness shine even there).  It's a totally charming game and a great bending of the tower-defence genre.   I love that it plays very much like a bullet-hell arena shooter, though maybe not quite as hellish as real BH shmups.

												A simple game with a simple premise. Bardbarian, *a Barbarian who just got sick of the barian part, and just decided to be a BARD-bariann instead* has to stop the evil, kinda cute goblins/trolls from destroying the towns prized possesion, a decorative crystal. Very fancy.   By playing through waves, which many a gamer should be familiar with, you kill monsters, level up your team and collect gold. As the bard yourself, you don't actually attack anyone, but your teammates do automatically. They can be upgraded via the gold you earn. The town and bard can also be upgraded. You can have more health for your crystal, get a Ratcoon. *Yes. Rat-coon* and have a town drunk spit speed reducing and health reducing vomit. Have a college to make your teammates stronger when they first come out, and give yourself extra speed, among several other things.   The game does exactly what you would expect it to do if you are familier with with such... Let's say tower defence games already. Perhaps Plants vs Zombies is a better example, but only slightly. It doesn't try anything new, but what it does offer for the price is a good game.  You are getting what you see in the video, plus a survival mode and a deathrun minigame as a quick way to earn coins if you get tired of playing the main mode. A reasonable, casual like timewaster for a price that seems right for such a game. Get it when you have the opputunity.			"

												  I saw this game on sale and read the reviews.  Many people talked about it like it was a tower defense style game.  I'm not real big on tower defense.  You play a couple you've pretty much played them all.  But being the sucker for a good deal that I am, I picked it up anyway.   Buying this game was like expecting a heat lamp hot dog from 7/11 and getting a finely crafted gormet meal with many layers of flavors I've had before but never in this blend and the preperation makes me want more.  Another review called it a mix of Binding of Isaac and tower defense.  I would like to refine that a bit.  It's like Binding of Isaac mixed with Plants vs. Zombies.  You have the action of Binding of Isaac with the right to left enemies like Plants vs. Zombies.  Toss in a dash of Dungeon Defenders with the defending a giant crystal and a heap of Brutal Legend with playing your guitar to summon help or buffs.  Not to mention the great metal music like Brutal Legend.  Add just a pinch of bullet hell, except instead of flying a ship between the projectiles, you're steering a group through the gaps, and you have Bardbarian.  Most of this game has been seen before here and there but put together like it is, it's one of the best surprises I've had in some time.  Even at the full price of $5.00, this game is a bargain.  I would definitely recommend picking this one up.  My first sitting with the game lasted over 5 hours and I have a short attention span and switch games frequently so that should say something in itself.  Controls (with a controller.

												I'll admit that this game does seems clearly made for tablets at first, but the controls aren't terrible and it's fun regardless. It feels like a relatively well fleshed out game and doesn't have any weird pay to progress features. I feel like I""m consistently making progress every time I play, even if I don't get particularly far. It's a game that I play ten minutes at a time, but it's something I can reliably come back to and have a good time with every time I play.I completely recommend Bardbarian for a few bucks if it looks interesting to you. It's pretty well executed.			"

												Nice casual campaign game, The story line, story/campaign mode, is fairly simple, you play as Bert the Bardbarian, a barbarian who's tired of fighting and who's taken up playing the lute and comanding a troop of minions. You protect the town from evil creatures which are trying to steal (or destroy) the town's decorative diamond, and throughout the day more and more powerful creatures come at you in 'waves' (levels).If you've played Rouge Legacy, this game's shop functions similarly, minus Charon stealing all your money. New minions are unlockable through playing through the end of levels, with the exception of two characters which are unlocked by playing the non-campaign levels. And, if you've played Octodad, Super Meatboy, or The Binding of Isaac and are a fan of those games, rejoice, you can unlock them as your minions too. They should really sell these games in a pack sometime.			"

												Bardbarian is way, way cool.  It's a remarkably-good mashup of tower-defence, overhead-view arena shmup, and console-RPG, with a couple of extra modes that not only add to replay value, but help advance the main game, too.There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor going on here.  The gameplay is really solid -- I've never felt that I've been defeated unfairly -- it always feels to me as though I've screwed up something simple to get myself given out.This game has a whole lot of ""just one more go"" in it... and the nice bit is that almost every go, no matter how poor it turns out, will help advance Brad, his entourage, and the town, just a bit further towards surviving the onslaught of evil.In short, you will get a helluva lot of fun for your $5 (or less, on sale).  The artwork oozes character and style, and so does the writing (which is mostly descriptions of units and items, but still.. the humor and thoughtfulness shine even there).  It's a totally charming game and a great bending of the tower-defence genre.   I love that it plays very much like a bullet-hell arena shooter, though maybe not quite as hellish as real BH shmups.

												First of all, I started off ""recommending"" the game but after I wrote the review, I think it would be better the other way.I have mixed feelings about the game. Even though I liked the game and finished the ""Normal"" mode, I don't feel like playing the ""Insane"" mode because I got bored a bit because of the repetitive gameplay (and the ""Insane"" mode doesn't seem to be offering something other than stronger/faster enemies in the same levels).Gameplay[\b]: Gets repetitive easily like most of the tower defense games and after the first boss, that's pretty much what you're going to see the entire game. ""Survival"" and ""Escape"" modes are not very addictive to play.Graphics[\b]: Nice but not the best. Some of the boss animations could have been better.Music / SFX[\b]: Really weak. You have pretty few sound effects in the game and 2 different background music, that's all. I think the developer should add ""More Music and Sound Effects"" to the future wishlist.I recommend this game if you are a tower defense genre addict. Other than that, I don't recommend the game. "

												An addictive and simplistic action-tower defense. Something of a hybrid between Defender's Quest, Nimble Quest and some shmup. Isometrical, fun and challenging - endlessly playable and cheerful, yet feels a bit hardcore in that you'd die a lot to progress (somewhat similar in the feeling as Rogue legacy, yet much more inviting). The upgrade system has unlocks for the longest of time, yet farming for gold never feels as such - there's always somewhere to progress and challenge to cross whilst doing so. Follower-character types are varied and gameplay is solid.Recommended.			"

												Bardbarian is a neat little game, as long as you don't expect too much from it - in some ways, it feels like a slightly-higher-quality version of something you might find for free on Kongregate. The visuals and art style are great, the gameplay is interesting but ultimately a bit shallow. It does offer a fairly unique mix of genres - to narrow down the pile of genres listed in the 'about' section, I think it's pretty fair to call it a tower defense / shmup hybrid. You build a party of units over the course of each run with a gradual income to buy more or use special abilities, while protecting the town crystal from an onslaught of enemies. As you defeat enemies, you get cash which you can spend to upgrade units/yourself/the town/THE RATCOON and in turn have the power to get farther, etc., etc., eventually you win.The upgrade system (though this is by no means a complaint unique to this game) is not great - while the wide variety of units should encourage experimentation, in practice you're incentivized to pick a lean and mean loadout and max them out (I completed the game with a strategy of All Ninjas, All The Time). The game also suffers a bit from consisting of one 20-wave campaign - for a variety of reasons (resources, unit xp) it's best to start from the beginning each time, and that means sitting through some thoroughly outmatched waves before getting to the interesting bit. The endgame is definitely a strength, though - by the last few waves you're nearing bullet-hell territory, and all the dimensions of the gameplay come into focus.So is it worth getting? It's a bit tough to say - I enjoyed it, but it does have its faults. Ultimately, if you think it sounds or looks intriguing, you may as well pick it up. If not, you may as well pass it by - you're unlikely to regret it either way.			"

												This game... was not great. It has a good idea and its setup is alright, but it was executed poorly. The game isn't optimized so it uses more system resources than Civ 5 (Why?) and the gameplay is basic. You move around avoiding attacks, occasionally using a buff during the harder waves or the boss fights. At the end, you get some gold, you buy an upgrade, you start again. That's the game. Some variation would go far with making this game worth the price. It should also use up resources like the basic game it is instead of sucking up more CPU than a AAA title. Neither of these changes are going to be made, so I would reaaaaally recommend against getting this game unless it's at a severe discount.			"

												A fun little tower defense game with an interesting premise but not worth the $8 asking price. Buy it when it's on sale for 75% off like I did and you won't feel bad at all. I mean, it's pretty much a slightly more polished Kongregate game and honestly, there are free Kongregate games that are actually more in-depth and flat out more fun to play. I can't write the game off completely because I did get 5 hours worth of play out of it. But honestly it was more because I truly wanted to like the game more than I did because it is sort of an interesting take on tower defense style games and it is fun for a while as you progress and unlock new characters and perks.My biggest gripe with the game is the fact that it's called Bardbarian and the entire premise is based around you controlling the Bard (essentially a pied-piper type character) and everything about the game revolves around music and, well, being a bard. However, the soundtrack is so depressingly lacking, it basically becomes little more than background hum if you play it for any real length of time. Sadly, the ONE song that is the entire soundtrack is actually quite decent. But it's one freaking song. And not even really a complete song but a riff on a loop. I honestly feel that if they were more inventive with the soundtrack and how it played into the game, the $8 asking price would not only have been reasonable, but it would have been a deal. IMO, games like this live and die by their soundtrack and sadly this game died with it's.The overall gameplay is extremely satisfactory for a casual tower defense, the key word here being casual. I mean, you don't aim, you don't shoot anything, there is no placement of towers, you basically weave your band of hand-chosen characters, each with their pros and cons, through waves of increasingly difficult levels. That is, once you start progressing and unlocking more characters with increasingly different character traits. This may sound like an extreme bore but it really is balanced when it comes to difficulty and satisfaction as you unlock new characters and/or perks. Sure, you're only essentially bobbing and weaving and leading your charges into battle but, it's really not as easy as it sounds and there is a real emphasis on choosing your characters and perks wisely.I'm giving this a recommend overall but at a warning that I honestly don't think it's worth the retail price. Put it on your wishlist and catch it on sale. I paid $1.99 during the Summer Sale and feel like I certainly got my money's worth for that price. I certainly don't mind supporting indie devs, especially when they release truly enjoyable content, but at some point, I have to ask myself if the price is worth the product when there are so many similar titles out there that you can play 100% free.

												Short: Flash game like. Lot of farming. Fun for some time. Wait for sale.This game is basically a flash game, but a good one. You destroy waves of incoming enemies before they reach the town crystal (deliberate silliness). You cannot attack monsters directly, though: you have to chant out a small band of warriors which will follow you closely. The goal is to dodge projectiles, while coming close enough the enemies so that your soldiers can kill them. Which means: you basically only have to move. Simplistic, but it proves efficiently entertaining.Of course, as it has a flash game mechanics, you won't be able to go very far on your first run, but you win money with which you can upgrade yourself and your followers (as well as diverse features). Everything is quite basic, so do not expect much. It is fun, though, even if you have to repeat endlessly the same few waves. There is some diversity among the monsters, and a good choice of different followers. Developers have surely been imaginative on that side. It gets boring after a few hours of gameplay, alas. Plus, the additional modes (survival and run) are most boring. In the survival mode, you can not do anything but dodge every foes for entire long minutes. Running is slow and devoid of any interest. Only the main game mode is worth playing; the other two are for achievements only. Do not spend more than 3 euros/dollars in it.  "

												Bardbarian is a cute casual wave survival game.The story doesn't exist, so check that off.The graphics look cartoony and nice. It's pleasing to the eye for sure. It runs well. The achievements are easy to get and the soundtrack is really good. After writing this review, I'll find a way to get it. You can play the game on either normal or hardcore, but all achievement hunters should want to play on hardcore. After that you have the main survival mode, runner mode and a Day 2 mode that unlocks after the game's been beaten. It's all good and fun. It works and that's what matters.Overall, I'd recommend this game if you want a casual experience.5/10(All games start off at a 5/10 and the grade raises and lowers for every pro and con present)			"

I played this game from start to finish with my xbox 360 controller and it worked flawless with the game. The replay value is 'meh' since you can unlock more characters to assist you and you can try new tactics to finish the game faster, but nothing you'd want to play weeks on end. There's also the challenge levels, which are pretty alright, but the most fun for me was the actual campaign.If the current pricetag of 8 euro is too steep for you, I would definitely recommend getting it during a sale.

Bardbarian is an evade-'em-up game.  You play an overmuscled Conan figure who has decided that he's sick of hacking foes to death and only wants to play music, which might be a more noble attitude if his village wasn't presently under siege by the usual forces of darkness.  Thankfully, your music (plus money, earned by killing enemies) can inspire less-squeamish types to follow you around and do the dirty work for you.  Strategy revolves around getting close enough to enemies for your followers to attack them, but still avoiding enemy fire, and recruiting and upgrading an effective mix of followers.This game doesn't have much depth, it isn't all that compelling, and probably won't hold your interest very long, but it's just different enough from typical games to make it a good short-term casual game.  If your expectations are modest, it will meet them -- that's about all it's fair to ask from a casual game like this.			"

												As someone who buys a lot of game bundles I tend to jump into numerous indie titles site unseen, something that usually ends poorly. Bardbarian however was a pleasant surprise, a game that takes two genres I'm usually lukewarm on (tower defense and shumps) and manges to combine them in a way that I found super addictive. It does get a bit grindy towards the end, but I found the mechanics entertaining enough in their own right that I never felt too bored. The charming art-style was a big plus as well. An easy reccomendation for anyone looking for something to tackle in bite-size chunks (it's a great 15 minute break game) and for the achivement hunters out there, they're a pretty easy 100%.			"

												Bardbarian is a pretty cool little indie game which is hard enough to complete but thrilling enough to put in the time.  The mechanics are simple, the upgrading system is good and the mini-games are fun enough. Not bad at all... not bad at all...			"

												A very different and fun take on the ""tower"" defense genre as you defend against evil as an axe-guitar wielding Bard (ex-warrior).  I know that's a bit of a mouthful but the formula works quite well.  Music was enjoyable and I found myself waiting to hit the guitar rifts whenever I activated my abilities. Here's some gameplay footage.

												This game is amazing! I bought it because I thought as my friend had spoken about wanting being a Bardbarian in DnD and you know what? So worth it! It's the kind of charming funny little game I would expect around the whole Bardbarian idea. Also his lute is an elctric guitar and that is awesome!10/10 would buff team with solos again.			"

												Fun game. Easy to get addicted to!In the beginning you'll be just playing shortly, but after a few upgrades, it will draw you into the game even more. The name of the game is really chosen well: it's sometimes hard to fight, but still always a bit funny. The music and sound effects fit great in the game!			"

												A fun game to play but I would recomend playing this with a controler because keyboard controls are usable but arn't ideal. I can see people being able to complete this in a day or two however it still offers additional gamemodes once you complete the story. Also playable really well with the steam remote with the circle pads working really well with this game. The concept of the game is something many would enjoy and the massive choice of upgrades makes it addictive. I think the achievements and thier names are great and there are a few easter eggs in the game that are fun too look around the game and find. Overall this game is worth the money you payed for it and you should get buy it. buy it for everyone ever!  "

												Its a mobile game ported to PC without much addition from what I can tell. Youre playing one map over and over with very slow progression (unless you play one insane mode apparently.) It starts out pretty fun but quickly becomes repetative and boring. Youre going to have to replay the same bit over and over and over to upgrade your units to advance.There isn't much skill involved. Its mostly just a level your guys higher than what you are fighting and you win.I would have liked to see different parts of the town for each section to help vary it up a bit. It would have also been nice to have something for the player character to do as youll just be running around letting the npcs do all the work.The soundtrack is good but its just that. A track. As in singular. It plays on repeat the whole game and gets old pretty quick.All in all I dont feel the game really belongs on PC with the minimal effort put in to the port. It wears its welcome out realy quick. However, I would imagine it would be alright in short 10 minute bursts on the toilet. So if your pc is in the water closet then go for it I guess?			"

												BardbarianAbout The Game: Bardbarian is a mix between a side scroller hack n'slash, a bullet hell, and a tower defence game. You play as Brad the barbarian, turned bard. It is still your job to defend the town from goblin and demon hordes. This time you let your groupies do all the hard work as you riff and jam about the place. Chose 3 from up to 18 different groupies, along with 16 upgrades between you and the town. After death you get your collected gold to make upgrades, and then try again to beat your record.Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)Graphics: 3.5 Nothing epic but still clean and not really glitchy. Although i find monsters hiding under the bottom HUD.Playability: 4 WSDA movement with changeable hotkeys for summons and solos make the controls enjoyable.Fun: 3.5 This game is pretty fun but after a while it gets tedious keeping your groupies from eating bullets.Sound: 4 Metal jams and solo riffs entertain the ears. The background music is upbeat and keeps the action flowing.Replay Value: 3 There are extra modes including an insane mode, Halloween mode, survival mode, and an escape mode. As for the main game, once you fully upgrade everything there isn't much left to do.Final Score: 3.5Final Thought: At $7.99 it is worth waiting for a sale but on a good note, it is offered in a bundle with another Treefortress game, Jump Jet Rex, and soundtrack for $14.99.

												I have to say, I had a blast with this game.  It’s essentially a type of DOTA/tower defense game.  Your role is to summon and buff an NPC party that follows you automatically performs its roll.  Attackers target and attack enemies in range, healers heal when you stop walking, defenders deflect ranged enemy attacks when they are struck and so on.  You earn gold as you play which you spend after you die to improve the town, units, buffs and other aspects of the game.  The music is pretty great too, it was stuck in my head for days.  There are 3 gameplay modes, which lets you switch things up a bit, as well as a harder dificulty to select when you create a new game file.My list of complaints is pretty short.  Some of the units felt pretty underwhelming, and if you pick a good group you are essentially unbeatable, which can hurt replayability.  Since you only get one town and never go anywhere else there isn’t much opportunity for the game to present situations where using specific units or combinations is very impactful.  There isn’t much variety of enemies, which isn’t a big deal, but I think is worth noting.I would love to see more locations added in an update, but as is it is still a great little game I would recommend picking up.

												Hey this is a fun game.  You control a bard who has a group of warriors wizards etc. that you can lead into battle to fight off waves of enemies.  The waves are like what you'd find in a tower defense game, and you pick and choose your crew that follow you around on the battlefield, attacking enemies that are near.  The strategy comes in who you add to your party, and taking money earned in rounds to buy upgrades to you, your recruits and the town you are defending.Its a good simple game.			"

												Unit upgrades affect your progress in the game.   Might be fun for a challenge to try and run through it using a new game save with as much stuff maxed out before starting day 1 since unlocked units don't show up between waves again after you have unlocked them.  Ignore the developer's description, whatever nonsense that is.  Stop enemies from reaching the left side via controlling a large hitbox of grouped units.  Music would be good if there was more than one song the entire game.  Beat it using necromancer to provide a wall, rune knight for attack, and shaman to slow mobs down.  Sadly, more necros don't result in more zombies and you're limited to six.  The final boss fight was a little unintuitiive at first.			"

												After completing the game, I would recommend it. I'd say 5 dollars is a resonable price for the game, but not 8 dollars.Even then, the game is really fun and addictive (or at least for me) but it's a bit short.8/10 from me. Maybe not worth its price of 8 dollars, but it's great.			"
