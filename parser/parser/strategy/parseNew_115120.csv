UPDATE May 26, 2015: DoubleFine have removed GFWL from the game, added Steam matchmaking, and this fixes the infamous ""stutter bug"" (and also wipes all old saves). (source)Co-op Iron Brigade is a lot of fun!GFWL is not dead. I had a working GFWL install from playing FUEL, and was up and running in 5 minutes. However, if you haven't, you probably need the updated client, which is here: http://www.xbox.com/Live/PC/DownloadClient You can probably download and install this before you download iron Brigade, or you can install Iron Brigeade, uninstall GFWL, and then install the newer version. Make an account, copy and Ctrl-V paste the serial, done. (GFWL often takes a minute ro more to connect, and sometimes needs more than one attempt.)You need to play two missions in singleplayer; after that, you know the basics of the game and get access to the ""radio room"" where you can invite friends, search for games etc. ""Friends"" means GFWL friends and not Steam friends, of course, so you need to add each other on GFWL. You can do in-game text-chat with ""T""; if you have configured speech in the GFWL settings, you'll also automatically have voice chat with everyone in your game (if your microphone isn't claimed by Steam). The co-op missions are the same as the singleplayer missions, so you advance in singleplayer as you play co-op.I like the co-op rules. You need to collect ""scrap"" (= drops from the enemies) to be able to build turrets; any scrap you collect (or that scrap collector turret collects) gets shared equally (as are the random chest drops), but any turrets you place go off your own budget. You can only build those turret types that you have equipped (they're called ""emplacements"" in the loadout screens), but you can upgrade any turrets on the battlefield regardless of type. Of course you can revive each other.Tactics for us was to go into each new map with the same loadout as the previous one, slightly modified by the hints the game gives you. We were only defeated once, but then we do go back and refine our strategy for gold star performance. This means talking about weapon and turret loadaouts, turret placement strategy, fire sectors (very loose), and the like. We were already on the chassis that has a maximum of weapon slots and a minimum of turret slots, but careful planning was still necessary to get that coveted gold star: even at that extreme of the game balance spectrum, you can't just adopt ""shoot everything that moves"" as a viable tactic.Game balance is excellent: chassis types allow you to trade weaponry (fps) against turrets (tower defense) -- this affects both the turret types you can equip and their cost. Special skills are equipped via legs, and they're balanced as well: ""quick reload"" means you're stationary while that skill is engaged; ""sprint"" means you're fast, but can't turn while running, etc. You need to use your skill wisely, i.e. tactically.The ""stutter bug"": 6 hours into the game, after 7 missions, the game started stuttering when scrap is being collected. That bug is not present in the Xbox version, and the FAQ says that since it seems related to GFWL, it is difficult/impossible to debug, and Microsoft is not being helpful. So that bug is there to stay. Since you can't shoot while collecting scrap, you tend to only do that when no enemies are around, which means the bug is an annoyance, not a showstopper at this point.I got Iron Brigade for free when I bought ""Hack'n'Slash"", possibly because I previously owned a lot of Double Fine games, including at least one bundle (Amnesia Fortnight). Getting it on sale seems definitely worthwhile even now, but if you have an Xbox, you're probably better off getting it there, because of the stutter bug.As a game, Iron brigade is exceptionally well designed: it is easy to get into, has tactical depth, and allows for a wide variety of approaches to beating a level that are well balanced among each other, both in singleplayer and co-op.

												Iron Brigade finally removed Games for Windows Live. The stutter bug is fixed as well. Now I can definitely recommend this game! Iron Brigade has Double Fine's signature humor and great gameplay. If you like tower defense mashups (such as Sanctum or Dungeon Defenders) you will like this, as it has a good blend of all the classic elements.			"

												Ignore the steam hours, I had this on 360 when it was first released to XBLA. This game is incredible. It's a TPS, coop Tower defense mech game that is an absolute blast to play. There's a lot of customization options, lots of enemies, lots of towers, lots of fun. If you're looking for a gem for a friend or 3 to play with, definitely pick this one up. Most of the negative reviews are because of GFWL (Games for Windows Live), which has since been removed and replaced with steamworks. The main negative now is it's a bit buggy and has a 30FPS cap in some areas, but I say it's still worth it Pros- Lots of weapons- Lots of customization- Lots of enemies and bosses- Level/Exp system- Very enjoyable- Coop- Removed GWFL- Full controller supportCons- 30 FPS lock at base- Some bugs- Can't play more than 2 player coop - WOO THEY APPARENTLY FIXED IT- Coop can stutter quite bad - WOO THEY APPARENTLY FIXED IT HAVE YET TO TRY IT			"

												This game is something! Something for a few reasons.First of all it's something fresh. Mix of TPP shooter, tower defense and mech simulator. And surprisingly this mix works very fine.Second of all, it's very good game with great replayability.Third of all, it's difficult game, in old-school way. For me it's advantage, but if you like easy games, I warned you.VERDICT:If you like tower defense games and looking for something fresh, try this one.If you like shooters and mechs, you definitely should give this game a chance.Like this review?

												Update: ======GFWL has been removed. Original:======A game about loveThere are no regrets about love. You can't buy love. But you can buy Iron Brigade.Where there is love, there is always something to hate too. Here it is gfwl. But love is bigger than hate. Iron Brigade is bigger than gfwl. While this gem has it's flaws, it's a most enjoyable experience.If you aren't burned by the hate of a thousand suns, when youhear the acronym gfwl, you will find something unique here.There are also a bunch of decent folks around the forums,looking to form a merry suicidal squad for coop games.

												A third person view mech shooter variation on tower defense genre, dipped in signature Double Fine humor sauce. If that sounds appealing to you, think no more, get it. It does its job very well!You're a pilot of so-called mobile trench in a campaign against Monovision ravaging the world after mysterious Broadcast. The tongue-in-cheek campaign consists of missions tasking you with defense of a strategic point(s) from waves of enemies spawning at concrete locations on map and converging on their target. You fight partly yourself directly, dealing out punishment from guns mounted on your mechanized trench, and partly you summon turrets for help, paying for them with scrap gathered from fallen enemies.There's a big selection of guns at your disposal - machine guns for relatively small but sustained damage, with flak variety focusing on airborne enemies, and a wide selection of burst damage weapons varying in range, area of effect, and reload times (shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, even artillery cannons). There's also a unique type of weapon - broadcasters, with huge, continuous damage, but very short range and long time to replenish (sort of like EMP version of flamethrower, I guess).And all these guns also come in a standalone, turret version, automatically tageting enemies in their range, except broadcaster type of turret is not for damage but rather a support one, slowing enemies down, and there's a type of turret that lays mines rather than shoots at enemies. Other support turrets include magnets that  automatically gather scrap for you or can repair your trench.(by the way, normally your mechanized trench CAN'T be blown up during a mission, you're just disabled for a short time and only lose when defended target is blown up, however stages of campaign end with boss fights where you yourself can be considered the target and then repair turret sure comes handy - or pretty much required)There's a gotcha however - a harsh limit on what you can actually bring with you to a single mission, and mixing and matching a loadout before launch is big part of your success. Generally you can either go with a chassis that can dish out huge damage itself with lots of gun mounts, but very poor selection of turrets to summon, or a chassis that can deploy powerful turrets but has very limited space for guns on itself (there's also a middle ground, having an average number of gun mounts and limited only to light offensive turrets). These also differ in speed and armor values, and come with a choice of legs that give you some special move, for example let you sprint very fast in straight line, or give option for faster reload times if you root yourself in place. There's also a smashing variety of legs that complements your damage potential.The selection of guns is ever expanding in their power and sometimes additional effects (like more scrap, or magnetic effect on grenades - very useful perk), you have this feeling of constant progress in power as you level up your pilot, very well realized indeed (but of course mission difficulty also ramps up to match it).With rumors on GFWL closing down soon-ish and Double Fine not planning to port this game over to a different platform, it may be highest time to get this one, too, before it becomes unplayable (though it's not clear if it won't work at all or just the co-op version? btw yes there's co-op)			"

												This game was ""re-launched"" a month ago, removing a performance-killing bug along with the terrible Games for Windows Live nonsense. Great news right?Unfortunately, a new bug was introduced that causes the game to crash if more than 2 players start a game. Since the whole point of this game is multi-player, this is a critical gamebreaking bug. It has persisted for over a month now, and the devs have honestly said that they are more interested in the supporting the recently kickstarted Massive Chalice than supporting this game.It's shameful, and another example of DoubleFine giving their customers the shaft. Get it together.Update 12/3/15: Revisited the game tonight with 3 other friends based comments from DoubleFine that ""Multiplayer is Fixed!"". No, multiplayer is not at all fixed.The synchronization error crash seems to be fixed (edit 1/16 - it's not, according to posts in the forums), but the game is just as choppy as it ever was two years ago. My group got through ONE multiplayer map, then the second map stuck on an endless loading screen.My review stands. Do not buy this buggy pile of garbage. Not even for a buck fifty.			"

												This game is from 2011/2012, but it feels like brand new. I quickly snatched it on discount for under $4 during the 2015 mid year sale. Definitely worth more than that!It's a wonderful coop experience. I'll never forget all the times the game crashed with authentication state error on each start-up when organising a game with sauce and trash. We'd all go crazy, revalidating Steam cache files, restarting Steam, restarting the PC. In some cases the game would crash sauce's PC. trash and I would be like, ""sauce you still there?"" as we watch his Mumble name disappear off the screen a few seconds later in dismay.  Sometimes we'd hit over wave 30 and for some reason sauce decided that it would be a good idea to unplug his Ethernet cable from the back of his PC. Who'd knew the game would be smart enough to detect that and show a message!? Meanwhile trash came up with this brilliant theory ... we must all press the ready button within 2 seconds of a mission launch in order to stop these connection problems. I guess ... sometimes it worked ...?Essentially this game is a 3rd person mechwarrior (trench) tower defence genre. There is a levelling up system with item drops to enhance your trench as you progress through the campaign and survival modes. You can customise the chassis to standard, assault or engineer. The chassis differs mainly by how much emplacement (towers) slots you can take, the amount of weapons you can arm yourself with, the costs to build the emplacements and speed at which you move. All in all we figured out that for a team of 3 players, it's good to have 1 engineer and 2 assault.There is some really classy Charlie Chaplin style humour with the characters. Dynamic lighting and weather. And a very generous amount of survival maps ... three in total. Thanks devs. Each map was fun whilst it lasted, but with all those tubes collected with the collection prongs, sad everything had to end at wave 100.Had great fun figuring out the strategies cooperatively. There is some history to be dug up in the very tiny community. You'll find tips and tricks like knob traps, tactics and the best loadout for your trench. I would rate this game something like an 8.3 out of 10. All dem crashes was worth the pain.			"

												As it stands, this is an amazing game. If you enjoyed mech warrior then this game style will be a whole load of fun. There seems to be a lot of talk about bugs here in the comments but myself and 3 buddies played the game for almost a solid 7 hours and the only 'Crash' we had was one of our internet connections going down. None of us had any real issue getting in or playing the game. I will agree, the game need to be rid of Window Live and just work off of steam but the dev ""Double Fine"" has much bigger things to work on. So as much as I'd like to see more people playing this game, I understand why they haven't done much. It is hard for a smaller team like ""Double Fine Productions"" to keep up on all their games. I would recommend this game in a heartbeat.			"

												The game NO LONGER HAS GFWL and that is a huge deal!Iron Brigade is an immensely fun hybrid of 3rd-person Mech combat and Tower Defense, filled with lots of weapons, mech parts, and turret types to collect, to support different strategies and play-styles.It's a gorgeous-looking game as well, and the animation work on all of the weapons and mechanical parts of the mobile trenches is so good, you may just find yourself activating your leg mechanisms and needlessly reloading your weapons, just to watch!  I know I did, many times.Really the only negative I can think of (now that GFWL is gone)  is that the game itself is really short, IF you consider that a negative.  Me? I like a game that doesn't cost much and gives me a dozen or so hours of high-octane enjoyment; none of my time felt wasted, I left satisfied, and got to move on to other games.  I'll probably play it again, though, when more of my friends pick it up!			"

												I've lost count of the number of times Iron Brigade has soft-locked my rig today. This a great game, full of all the aspects we all expect from a Double Fine title. But this port fails technically. Audio bugs, graphical stutter, and the dreaded full-system crash abound. Matchmaking is miserable. Even if you do get a game going, you're almost guaranteed to crash out of the client at the end of the round screen. Removing GFWL was not the magic bullet the community expected. Don't be sold on the hype. This game is still very broken.If this gets patched, I'll update my review. PC Master Race, you're better off picking this title up on console.			"

												This game checked so many of my boxes it was kind of a guaranteed sale. It spans many of my favorite genres, has plenty of content, co-op! I will just list things :)Why this compelled me* Tower-defense, more so when playing single* Shooter, more so when playing multiplayer* Mech-game with customization; weapons, chassi, legs, towers, paintjob* Character progression, challenges, achievements, all doable without much grind outside of completing the game.* Customizable player character, only cosmetic, but fun when running around in the lobby before starting a multiplayer game.What impressed me* The multiplayer lobby is the same as single player, other people just loads up in the empty slots on your ship. It's great design really, and you can look at other people's mechs and gesture at their characters :)* Anyone you have invited to a multiplayer game ends up in your regiment, which has separate challenges to complete, it just happens automatically and it's kind of great :o* All customization on your mech and character are visible immediately in game, has custom animations and models, so nice :3What I found interesting* Many of your towers can actually be killed, and they are not at all used to build labyrinths, you cannot block enemies with towers. It's just different :)* The whole game design seems built around quirky humor, at first it's quite odd but after a while I just ran with it. Game mechanics sold me on the experience.What I missed/issues* An overhead map, on some symmetrical levels it can be really tricky to know where you've placed towers, makes for quite a bit of running around. It does make sense though as the player characters probably do not have any radar och satellite to provide map data.* In the shop I would love to see if I actually own an item already, especially the cosmetics for the marine, it's a minor gripe but it felt like an obvious feature.* Playing during a summer sale makes Steam a bit glitchy, several times one or several were disconnected from Steam during multiplayer which boots them from the game. Sadly you cannot rejoin, this was kind of annoying in Survival which can take 1-2 hours depending on your success. There were no issues while the USA was asleep though.* Some maps have places where you can get stuck, and you cannot jump or even walk over very low  walls, this is pretty annoying when it happens. But then I always try to get to places I'm not supposed to go :x* I took me a while to realize why this felt exactly like playing on a console, I think the game is locked to 30 fps, which is kind of a bummer when using a 120Hz monitor.All in all I was very impressed by this game, I was looking for another tower defense game, saw this in a short clip on YouTube, and kept an eye out during a summer sale. Played it for an entire weekend with my brothers and a friend, great times was had :P			"

Iron BrigadePublished by: Microsoft Game Studios (2011-2015), Double Fine Productions (2015-)Developed by: Double Fine ProductionsReleased: 2011 (Xbox Live Arcade), August 2012 (GFWL & Steam)Indie budget hybrid Tower Defense/Third Person Shooter with a very appealing post World War I alternate history setting, where players have to defend the world against the deadly ""Broadcast"" by defending various installations and eventually taking the fight to end the ""Monovision"" threat, stomping about in mechanized battle trenches shooting guns and placing turrets to defeat a wide variety of cool looking ""TV and Radio"" themed enemies.Pros:Very competent action tower defense gameplay.A lot of mobile trench customization options where you can mount up to three different weapons on each attack button, or if you prefer traditional tower defense, sacrifice gunpower for cheaper and larger selection of turrets.I love a good setting, and Iron Brigade has it!  Awesome 'pulp alternate history post-WWI' design and overall art style, crammed with attitude and goofiness.Up to 4 player online co-op.  If you got the friends for it and can get it working, probably THE best crafted and most fun to play co-op tower defense you can find.For a long time after Steam release and after GFWL requirements were patched out of the game, the developers were very active in the community gathering feedback and letting the players know they were working on fixes for technical issues.  I LOVE seeing this, and wish more developers were as involved as these guys.Full controller supportSteam version includes a nice DLC 'expansion' in which you travel to Mars, free of charge!Cons:Game is locked to 30 frames per second.  Impossible to unrestrict.While playable in single player, IB is clearly not designed for it and most of the time is spent sprinting between lanes before defense points are destroyedOnline connectivity is a MESS.  This is a huge drawback as this is what the game is designed for, yet starting a game with 3 or 4 players is in my own experience 100% impossible without disconnects.  Some say they've had some success with it, but me and my friends were far from alone in not getting this game to work, AT ALL.  Playing with 2 players is slightly less disconnect prone but even then I see occational disconnects during levels.Despite working on the above point and many others for a long time, DF were never able to fully fix a number of technical problems with IB, most important being the co-op disconnect issue.DF then posted a check list of improvements they had made to the game and declared everything fixed, and that they were done.  An obvious lie right in our faces, and IB sits in the Steam store to this day pretending everything is great.  Such a disappointment seeing this after they had done such a good job being on the level with the community about the ongoing attempts to fix their game.In summary this game has a lot of things going for it and is possibly the best co-op TD action you can get, IF you can get that to work.  The online connectivity problems this game has and Double Fine's dishonesty claiming this was resolved is why this game lands on a thumbs down, from me.			"

												A third-person shooter/tower defence blend with plenty of loot and DoubleFine humour - what could go wrong?It's pretty good overall, though none of the aspects are at their sharpest. There's interesting and varied loot, plenty of customisation for your mech and a variety of enemies and battle scenarios.Unfortunately, there is one significant misstep. This is a game built around a degree of repetition if not grinding for loot, XP and better results which by itself is fine. However, it contains unskippable dialogue and cutscenes. Something which was amusing the first time around is less so the second and third, and downright grating after that.Thankfully you can get through at least the main campaign without grinding much. It might be a bit more of an issue if you want to finish the DLC or Survival mode, but you should well and truly get your money's worth before that.			"

												Excellent all around game.The gameplay is focused around tower defense, sort of like Sanctum or Orcs Must Die. You are actively engaging enemies as well as building turrets to defend your base and yourself.The game becomes ever more difficult as you advance through different stages. As you earn funds and acquire loot the battle mech can be built out with more powerful weapons, turrets, etc.And best of all, it's all built around a hilarious story line that is actually entertaining to watch as you progress through the game.I'd recommend picking it up on sale for $1.50, but even if it's more expensive it's probably worth it.

												I do not write reviews. These Devs have made me go outside of my comfort zone to write a review. So when I say this game is 11/10. It is not just due to its replayability. It's not because of it's customization. It's not even for it's amazing multiplayer. It's because the Devs never gave up. For that Double fine, you are in my top 3 game companies that I think still hold it's followers above the dollars! 1 Million and 1/2 rep for you			"

												This is a very fun game. Pros: Well designed gameplay, unique enemy designs, easy to jump into and try different mech loadouts. Each level will favor certain weapons, but you aren't punished for experimenting. Cons: May be dead online so BYO friends. I havent noticed any stuttering that people have reported in other reviews, but I havent been able to play online yet so maybe that's why. I've been playing with maxed settings with a GTX 970 with game installed to an SSD and everything runs super smooth so far. Even with all the mech loudout variety, eventually the replay value will drop without a stronger online community. Also GFWL (Games for Windows Live) is required to play. Doesnt matter to me much, but I know others will mind. Tip: Buy this as a pack with other double fine games to take the sting out of buying this alone and getting stiffed on the dead online community.			"

												The most ""gamey"" of Double Fine's efforts so far and arguably the best of them. I like mechs. I like loot. Mix the the two together with a funny premise and Double Fine's signature offbeat humour and you have Iron Brigade (Trenched for us purists out there). Best consumed with company, Iron Brigade is a great co-op game. Play alone and you'll be bummed out.Unfortunately, the game is locked at 30 frames per second. Though that's perfectly playable, my laptop can do better than that. Moreover, the shadow of GFWL hangs heavy over this game. Microsoft owns the IP, which means you have to go through another layer of tedious account verification to play this thing. Recommended with caveats.			"

												Played this on Xbox 360.. and it was one of my favorite games to date!Multiplayer, humor, fun customizable shooter elements, tower defense elements, endless waves of enemies...It was awesome.But the multiplayer community was never really there... and much less so today.On one hand, I want everyone to give double fine money for this game, as it was worth it.On the other hand, the multiplayer is total garbage these days. Worse that it was.Used to spend nearly an hour just to get a team of 4 together to play....and it's worse now.DOUBLE FINE! PLEASE HELP THIS TITLE!...and maybe make it so you can skip the cutscenes. ;)I'm probably still on the top 10's on all three survival maps on Xbox.I want to do that on PC, too, but it's just not possible to connect anymore.

												A great game, solo or co-op. The Games for Windows Live drawback is only temporary and not worth missing out on this gem for.There is lots of places to dish out the pain and a wide array of weapons and turrets to do so with. The choice of weapons, is up to you. Enemies vary from your regular, fairly unarmored resistor to the large and potentially game losing Amplifier.Well worth the cost, many times over. Feel free to message me as well, should you decide you want a team mate to try a game with.BUY IT!			"

												Iron Brigade is a very fun game no matter if you are to play it in solo or co-op mode. It is even better if you have friends to play it with so you guys can communicate via mic. If you like tower defense game, you find might this game entertaining. There are quite a lot of weapons for you to unlock/find in this game; you can also equip different mechs depending on the maps you're going to play.Dont let the stream pictures fool you, the in-game graphics are actually pretty nice. As of the moment I am writing this review, they dont have GFWL anymore and I experience no lag or connection issues.			"

												Ignore the amount of time spent on this game. I played this when it came out on Xbox.What is the gameplay?Well, you are in a mobile 'Trench' that can hold weapons on it. There are different ""Chassis"" which give you a certain amount of weapon slots on each side. A ""big"" chassis gives you 3 weapon slots on each side. A medium would give 2. A small would give you 1. Certain weapons take certain amount of slots. A machine takes 1 while a artillery will take all 3 on the one side. Snipers take 2 slots. Also, the weapons get stronger as you progress in the game, some getting ""special"" abilities. For example, an artillery that has shock, which stuns the monovision. Second thing is there are turret slots. Like machine gun turrets, Sniper turrets, land mines etc. they each take a slot and depends on what type of slot. There is a support, light, and heavy slot. Snipers and land mines are heavy, machine guns and shotgun turrets are light, a support would be a repair crane, Dampening Genarator, or a Magnet prong. What am i fighting? They are called monovisions. Essentially, its kind of like an alien life form, but look allot like electricity and blue wires. There are unique monos that target certain things, or attack in certain ways.All in all, i bought this game out of Nostalgia (i think thats how you spell it) and dont regret it at all. the game has replayability for the achievements, loot to find, and even has survival mode. *Kinda like Zombies on Call of booty* how long can you last. You even get loot from the survival mode. There are 3 survival maps from what i know. I got to 56 on one, 76 on another, and my favorite map, i got to 100.Truly, if you are into strategy, and want to use defences and even your own trench to protect a building, drill, or gun. Then you arent far from finding an amazing game. Look up some youtube videos and watch. Good luck on finding the game you want.			"

												( 7/10 ) MECHA! MECHA! MECHA!If you like the Mechanized Titles Like:Front Mission: Evoloution, Lost Planet, Natural SelectionThen chances are you may be drawn to this game!PRO'S:Game has a moderate amount of content for a $15.00 2-Gig Game.While there are some games out there that are just as interesting that arecheaper, it's hard to find a good Mecha game on steam (I've Tried) it's evenharder to find one that you can play with your Mecha Finatic Friends.The game ran decently well on a 4-Year Old Gaming Laptop.You can use WASD+Mouse or Joystick if you like, Reccomend (Thrustmaster)There is a lot of subtle but very amusing humor that helps push the story along.CON'S:$15.00 is kind of up there for a 4-Year old game, so if you can catch it on salelike I did (90% OFF) and get it for you and a half dozen of your friends that's great!Sometimes the Multiplayer Aspect does experience Lag or a Disconnection but I havefriends all around the world, so that is subjective to my situation possibly.You can't fight each other in the Mecha, only help each other out in the Storyline,similar to the same concept as in (Borderlands).

												I've only played an hour of the Steam version, but I played the heck out of it on XBLA when it first came out. Iron Brigade is one of the best hybrid tower defense + third person shooters I've played. I had a lot of fun with it in single player mode, but it really shines in co-op. Having a friend take care of anti-air while you focus on ground targets makes things a little easier, but it doesn't make the game a cakewalk.This game probably could have sold better if it weren't for it being saddled with GFWL at release. Couple that with the fact that there was a weird stutter bug associated with GFWL that got worse the longer a game session lasted and you had a lot of unhappy players. Fortunately, they did patch out GFWL, got Steamworks in, and fixed the stutter bug!			"

												A fun tower defence game. Customize your mech (known as trench) and go out into the field to defend the objective. Iron Brigade combines the 3rd person shooter combat with the classic tower defence gameplay of strategically placing turrets of various kinds to help you make a stand.There is a large variety of enemies, which are introduced bit by bit throughout the campaign, ranging from fast fliers to slow yet durable Big Willies, to suicidal Blitzers, and hordes of spiky balls known as the Knobs. Each enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses and therefore you are required to outfit your trench with optimum weaponry for each mission in order to be effective. Most of the enemy designs were pretty creative and had a sort of personality.I've played throughout the whole game solo. The early missions are fairly easy, but latter ones do pose a substantial challenge and might require several tries to get your strategy up to perfection. It's fun if you like a challenge. The game also has a handful of boss fights, so to speak. They do feel kind of different and out of touch with the rest of the gameplay though, especially the final boss of the original campaign.There were some small annoyances, like there being too little time in between the waves and cutscenes/dialogue not being skippable (not that I've found anyway), but other than this, it was fine.I didn't realise there was also an expansion act to the game, called 'Rise of the Martian Bear'. After playing the first mission, I'm a bit disappointed with it. It seems co-op play is encouraged much more here than solo play (so I might have to try them out on co-op), not to mention a strange lag that wasn't present in any of the previous missions. You also get some survival missions where you fight an endless horde of enemies.Overall it's a fun game. It has a nice sense of humour to it with a hint of silliness, but it certainly works and can often give you a good chuckle. So if you like tower defence games, you should find Iron Brigade worth playing.			"

												I must say I love this game, I played it on Xbox 360 with my console friends and now I'm here again playing it with my PC friends. I would have liked to see a little bit better of a port, but the gameplay is still good.In missions I get 60fps it's just in the lobby I get 30fps, not terrible, but this is PC, we need 60fps all around. That is probably my biggest complaint. I wish there were more Options to mess with though. Not being able to disable the Voice Coms is kind of annoying, but I edited the game file and got it muted, so its ok.I would LOVE to see a part 2.With some optimization and more weapons/legendaries and stuff, and add some random stats drop mechanics maybe with some added effects and damage types. Who knows what else.Anyways.Great Game!			"

General Overview:Essentially a tower defense game, but not so much in the sense ""you"" may think. You control a walking WWII mecha with a variety of WWII and retro-like futuristic fantasy (WWII imagination) weaponry assortments ranging from machine guns, to sniper rifles, to futuristic ""radar"" like microwave guns and more. Towers to an extent are important, but this game focuses more on what YOU must do as the player/mecha, which you control. The main damage you do, is from the mecha and the assortments of weapons that you attach on it. As turrets are generally♥♥♥♥♥♥poor at dealing damage, and if you choose to ONLY use turrets, it can only carry you through the first level. As with later levels, it becomes more and more challenging, making you, the mecha/player and your strategy and weaponry, your involvement first hand more important. Pros:- Mecha WWII machines of war- A lot of customization options- Really fun grinding for rare items and customizable clothes, weapons and paint jobs- Stupidly easy to play- Learning curve is on the softer side- Beefs up and becomes harder appropriately near the end - Co-op- Replay value is good- Amazing graphics, the main advertisement screenshots do not do it justice- Got the hang of the game in about 4 missions (learned how to play that is)Cons:- Tutorial for me at least, threw me off a little- Wish they had more missions- About 4 different campaigns, with 4 to 6 missions in each- Co-op can get a little laggy at times- Replay value is cut short after you acquire all rare items and complete all missions and survival missions on gold- Wish they had even “more” weaponsConclusion:I am simply aghast, amazed that this game isn't more popular. The graphics are great, the missions are fun, replay value is huge (especially co-op) and the price is cheap and out of this world. The ONLY reason this game doesn't have a lot more popularity and was put into the gutter and I did some research into this. Is, as I saw some other reviewers comment about this, and I did not understand what they were talking about. So bear with me quickly. Is because, the game was licensed to only be played/playable on and through the Microsoft Gaming Platform Program, the equivalent of Steam. Apparently playing the game through the Microsoft Gaming Platform really made the game laggy, crashed, and near impossible to play when it was streamed through the Microsoft Game Platform Software. The game owners then switched their accessibility to Steam and everything is all o'kay now. P.S.: (If you didn't understand, let me make this clear, yes, you can play this on Microsoft computers just fine, it is referring to Microsoft's attempt at making and implementing an online gaming platform equivalent to Steam and they failed horribly at it, which the above mentioned is about.) (The game runs fine.)All in all, I am surprised I didn't find out about this MUCH game sooner, give it a chance, and I can promise you, you will be throughly impressed and satisfied.

												1 month ago, I would have said this was an absolute waste of money because of GFWL. But, thankfully, Double Fine has regained the rights to Iron Brigade and it is again one of the best games out there. The mix of Tower Defense and 3rd Person Shooter based in an alternative gritty world is an amazing genre choice.I played this on XBLA and loved the experience. I'm playing this again on Steam and love it. Must Buy. Great Game.			"

												Iron Brigade is a great game that you should not buy. The concept and gameplay are great - tower defense plus mech action is a great combination, especially in such a clever and amusing setting.But the bugs and other problems make it nearly unplayable. The game is locked at 30 frames per second. There are persistent performance issues that cause frequent half-second pauses (the infamous ""scrap stutter"" bug). Sometimes scripts don't trigger and you have to erase all of your progress (manually, since the game autosaves frequently and doesn't have an in-game option to clear your data) because the game has been rendered unfinishable. And it uses Games For Windows Live, which Double Fine has ""no plans"" to remove, despite the service's impending shutdown in the middle of this year.			"

As a dad that works full time with a young kid I still some how found 5 hours to play this on day one. The gameplay is solid. The controls do not feel off and work very well. My normal gripe with mech games is that the sounds are... weak. This one pulls through and the sounds feel like they carry the correct umph for what your are shooting. At first the customization seemed small but opens up very quickly. The mech consists of 2 pieces and each can come with its own special bonus and number of weapon slots.... Im rambling.. This game is worth it and only gets better with the addition of steam multiplayer. Id buy that for a dollar			"

The stutter bug still exists unfortunately, despite many saying it has been fixed. Though it is nowhere near as bad as it was back on GFWL. But since TakeTwo now have IP rights, we should see some patches and fixes.Should you get this game despite the bugs? Definitely. It's 80% off and the developers have acknowledged fixes are on the way. So it will only get better (Also maybe more DLCs are on the horizon? ;D)10/10  "

Why isn't it already in your Steam library?EDIT: Some people are having issues with the game. I'd like everyone to keep in mind the fact that this is the first time in three years Double Fine have been able to update this game. There are going to be issues. Instead of complaining about them in the review section, why not go and report a bug? Personally, I had no issues running this game.

												I originally had a negative review for this game, but that was when this was run by GFWL. What you have here is a game that is good when played solo, and fantastic when played with friends. It has a short campaign but a tremendous replay value. I don't have many hours on it on PC< but on xbox 360 I had about 100+ hours into it. The graphics aren't that bad, the humor is dry but funny, and you can spend 10 minutes running after your friends on the ship in between missions making weird gestures at them.It does have an endless mode with at least 3 maps. Overall this is a fantastic buy and there are not many games like it. The only ones I have played that are similar is Sanctum and Orcs Must Die and this game blows them away. It has Tower Defense, Mech warfare, and even customization. Want to wear a gas mask and flack jacket and charge in with a mech decked out in jungle camo? Go for it. Want to buy a tux and a top hat and charge in with a mech made of gold, platnium, and silver, by all means good chum have at it.			"

												The following was written prior to the GFWL removal - the game is now fully recommended.Unfortunately, as the game current;y stands (May 2014), I can not recommend this game.   While the concept is quite fun, the number of bugs that exist due to Games for Windows Live makes the experience unenjoyable.  This is not a condemnation of GfWL, but rather entirely due to a bug caused by its implementation.   In short, a memory leak is introduced that, after a couple minutes, causes the system to begin delaying frames.   As levels drag on, this eventually renders the game unplayable.While this bug can be remedied in the campaign missions by quitting the game and restarting it after every mission, this option is not possible when playing the survival modes (which I would consider to be the most challenging aspect of the game.)If Double Fine is ever able to remove the GfWL loader, then I will whole-hearedly recommend this product.  But until that time, any enjoyment of the game is ruined by the experience.			"

												It's a mix of the popular tower defence genre and Fisher Price's Armored Core - and somehow, it works. It really works. A budget title, and yet it's one of the most solid and enjoyable things I've played in years. A seriously excellent and gleefully imaginative third person shooter that I haven't seen the like of since Planet Moon's days. Only got a few criticisms really - a way to save custom loadouts for your Trench (what they call the mechs) would be appreciated. Because switching between my Selker Mk 1 and the Karlsson is a little annoying - though attaching the guns is always pretty satisfying (props to whoever was in charge of sound design). Though on the same note, I probably don't need the character barking every couple minutes about how my machinegun's ""shred"" ability gets me more scrap (in-mission currency) off enemies - thanks.Oh, and no playable Coach Oleander? Seriously? Anyway, play it. Solo or co-op or whatever. This is REAL good.			"

												All in all a very nice game and I can really recommend it for everyone who likes a 3rd-person-shooter towerdefens game.About the game: (spoileralarm)You are a marine standing in a big♥♥♥♥♥walking killer machine fighting on different maps against all kinds of electrical aliens defending your base or bases. On some maps you also need to attack the aliens and kill a boss.Between the missions you are on the ship modifying your trench (the thing you are walking around with), adding friends to your game/joining other games and choosing your next mission.Modifying your trench:There is a level system which grants you to use specific items. There are a lot of items like many different types of legs, chassis, weapons and towers. All of them are also available with different abilities. Of course you can also change the color and the look of your trench and your marine.Adding friends/joining other games:The multiplayer system works good. You can add your friends on steam and join random games. You might join games with people on a much higher level so with much more difficult missions. And from time to time (maybe once per hour) the game looses the connection to the lobby. The maximum number of players in a lobby is 4.When you are in the lobby you can see the other players and their trenches on the ship and together you can discuss the next mission or whatever.Choosing your mission:There are different areas with different maps you can choose from. Furthermore there are some survival maps where you fight as long as you can. But all in all I would like to have more maps in the game.Enemys:Like there are many different enemys (fast and small, flying, heavy) there are also items effective against the different enemys. So you always need to check the equipment you and your teammates are using for the missions.I bought the game when it was on christmas sale and I do not regret it at all. ;)			"

												It's not the greatest console port, that's for sure. But it's worth it for the cooperative play and the great humor throughout the story, dialogue, descriptions, even the loading screens.Also c'mon, tower defense using pseudo-WW1-era mechs? Pretty awesome.			"

												Awesome 3rd person tower defense style game by Double Fine.Unfortunately it's infected with GFWL which causes lag/stuttering issues for some people, and is going to be shut down soon as well.It's ok as a single player game but it's best played with other people.Sadly there are very few people actively playing it so the best way to get a game going is probably with the forums. If the game gets GFWL stripped I would definitely recommend it, but until it does you're just going to get your heart broken.			"

												So, they fixed the game and removed GFWL! Great! Unfortunately the multiplayer is broken now and you cannot play it without a lot of connection issues. Multiplayer is 2/3rds of the purpose of this game. So unless you can get it dirt cheap for the limited single player (Which can be fun.) then the game is a total waste of time. As I said in my review before, there is a great game hidden under there somewhere, it just needs to be fixed.			"

												8/10Overview: Third Person Tower Defense The Good:+ The main feature of the game is that you can customize a mech in a variety of different ways. First you choose the chassis which allows you to carry more weapons or tower placements (but not both) . Then you choose the type of weapons you want to use: machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles etc. More powerful guns require more weapon slots. Then you choose the type of towers you want. Different maps require different load outs. Experimenting with different weapons and towers is part of the fun.  + Plenty of weapons and towers that can be bought or found + Lots of enemies that require you to change up your tactics, some enemies target your towers, other target you etc. + Killing enemies and completing levels allows you to level up allowing you to use more powerful weapons and towers+ Good voice acting+ Full controller support+Coop+Removed GWFLThe Average:Maps that require only one area to defend can feel repetitive because the basic strategy never really changes.   Big difficulty spike in the last few maps The Bad:- multiplayer/coop is dead and thus completing certain achievements will be hardConclusion:A fun if not short tower defense game that focuses more on third person shooting than actual tower placement. A fun diversion.  "

												Double Fine makes great games, and this one is no exception. Tower defense + Mech offense = Helluvalotafun.  Unfortunately, as mentioned in other reviews, this game has some serious problems on PC.  Serious lag/stuttering in the later levels make the game barely playable.  I got up to level 13, where I really needed some help, but I heard things even get worse in multiplayer, so I didn't bother finishing the game.  Double Fine blames Microsoft (publisher) and Games for Windows Live, but really the game shouldn't have been released in this state. If you get a chance to play this on XBox 360, it is well worth your time.  It is fun on PC as well, just realize you may not want to play the last few levels.			"

												I got this game first on XBox Live a few months ago when they gave it away free to XBox Live Gold members. I honestly thought it would suck but its a really fun game. I played many hours on my 360 till my 32"" TV fired a month or so ago, and I have not played since. I ordered a new 24"" Monitor with HDMI so once that gets in I am more then likely going to play it again on 360 also. I have it now on Steam which I bought two copies of one for myself, and the other for a friend on 360. Getting connected to each other to play seams like a real chore being he is in Netherlands, and I am in the USA. I don't know if there is an issues with the two locations or what but we didn't have this issue with the game on 360. I did manage to get into a game with 2 Japanese players which was cool until I got kicked from the game as it dropped when the game started. I also played with two other players after that so who knows. There are not a lot of people playing this game on computer so if you want to buy it keep in mind you may be playing alone or have huge wait times to find other players.Is it a good game: YesIs it worth the money: YesWould you recommend this game: Yes (If you don't mind playing solo)			"

With up to three friends you can go nuts crushing all kinds of broadcast means (hello, YouTube haters ;) and building your own fort. Yeah, defensive turrets are here too - it's a tower defence after all... Yet, your personal turret in not just idly standing, waiting for the enemies to come - it's a lumbering warmachine, that can walk right to the big, ugly tube and beat the crap out of it!			"

A tower defense game that you are in like Sanctum or Orcs must die, but with the explosions and bolt pickups of Ratchet and Clank.  And a WoW treasure system that makes replaying always worth it.

												Iron Brigade was a bit of a let down for me. While it is a solid tower defense game, the enemies and maps just lack any personality and originality. I know Double Fine isn't the biggest company there is, and that there were several teams working on three different games basically all at the same time, but Iron Brigade lacks the charm  (not the humor) of Stacked and Costume Quest. For a TD game Iron Brigade definitely has a lot of customization. Pretty much anything can be customized. Your trench, marine, turrets and weapons.Killed enemies will sometimes also drop loot boxes that give you random new gear.The game certainly doesn't disappoint in that department.And unlike other TD games, the game will (properly) increase in difficulty as you progress.There was a bit of a performance issue later on in the game, where it would freeze for a second while collecting scrap. Nothing major, but worth noting anyway.Now if only the maps and enemies were more diverse...[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Tower-defense with giant, upgradeable WW1-era mechs with a colorful cast of characters and a pulp flavored story filled with tons of alien weirdness. Best played with co-op. This game can be so much fun. I mean, you have loot in the form of equipment that you can customize your chosen mech with. You can pick different types of frames, treads, and other gadgets like a ""scrap magnet"" to make gathering the game's currency that much easier and grind missions by repeating them to buy even crazier weapons when they become available. You can lay down anti-aircraft guns, turrets, wield railguns, missile launchers, giant shotguns...there's lots of great action in this across plenty of maps. You can also unlock costumes for your pilot, extending its replayability if the weapon drops aren't enough. Want to wear a top hat while riding your mech into battle? Go on and do it then, good sir. The battle will wait for you. Overall, it's kind of like a mech-version of Crimson Skies (the PC version). Just with tower defense features.Two reasons dogged my experience in playing this -- one is the scrap lag which is already well documented in the forums and other reviews by other users. Essentially, the longer you play the game, the more unstable it gets before it just becomes unplayable and you just have to force it closed. I can't count how many times that spoiled co-op with my friends, having to exit the game and then come back, sometimes more than a few times. Argh.Two is its reliance on Windows Live. If you don't have the client, you'll need to install it. Apparently there was a plan to eventually remove it by Double Fine, but their hands were tied by Microsoft and that's apparently where the initiative died. The game is all but abandoned at this point.It's pretty much why I'm sad in giving it a very marginal thumbs down. If it weren't for these two issues, I'd wholeheartedly build an army of steam powered mechs to preach this game to the masses because if you can live with a buggy game that will never be updated, there's some awesome fun tucked away behind these problems.It's a bit like recommending milk that has turned into cheese in your referigerator. I guess it's edible, and if you strain enough of the cheese out, you might be able to enjoy your Fruit Loops just fine with what's left. Just be ready for when your stomach disagrees with you later.

												Look its a fun game, and all.  I am thumbs up... TILL you get to multiplayer.   Thats what kills it.  You and your buddies are playing.  One hint of lag, latency, frame drops, and boom: You lost that member of the team.   You add a thrid player: GAME COMPLETELY Crashes.    And there are levels where you need more then one or two people to complete.   SO untill this game is updated to handle lag better, and extra players... Its a full thumbs down.			"

												This game is hilariously fun, those of you familiar with Tim Shaefer and Double Fine Studios wll already be familiar with the kinds of quirks their games provide and this is no different. Its essentially a tower defence game only its fought in the third person and you control an active unit on the battle field, a massive hulking robot called a Mobile Trench. In each area you have several areas to defend and a certain time limit to set everything up before the enemy come in. Rather than do this from an overhead view, you stomp your trench around and set up assorted turrets on available building platforms, trying to create the right sort of deadly crossfire. You have to think on your feet once the attacks starts as they foes will becoming from all directions and you can only be in on place at a time, so what do you rebuild? Your own trench is heavily armed and can be upgraded between missions depending on your performance. The games atmosphere is an over the top setting remeniscent of a fictional world war one with anachronistic technology. The sense of humour is kinda crazy, I chose as my character a dapper British dude whose trench came equiped with a humidor for his cigars, at the end of every battle he would light up a cigar.......with his pistol. Also has multiplayer as c0-op or competitive. Get it.			"

												Its not often you get a game with its own unique characters in a cheesy setting that stragely enough works well for it and then throw in the gameplay which is surprisingly simple but can be unforgiving at times if you don't pay attention and you have a good game called Iron Brigade...oh did i mention it has MECHS!!!While i LOVE this game the fact that it requires Games for Windows Live to play online is a big detractor but not many play this game that much anymore and you'll be hard pressed to find anyone willing to put up with GfWL and all the BS that comes with it to even bother trying to play online.overall 9/10			"

												As of July, 2015, I guess that since GFWL has been removed the scrap stutter bug is gone. I haven't played enough to see if it has and I probably am not going to but I trust other users saying that it has. Even so, my vote still stays at a downvote for two reasons: 1. It is still 30fps capped and 2. It took years for this game breaking bug to be fixed. They blew their chance to have a good game upon release years ago and never fixed it so they get no sympathy from me no matter what their reason is. The game was broke on release and failed and nothing can undo that. Is the game worth buying now? Only if you like games in slow motion at 30 fps. It is a very good game that was broken and forgotten. Now that the scrap bug is supposedly gone, catch this on sale for a fun time. In slow motion.			"

												4.5/5 for this one, Double Fine delivers nicely.Being a fan of the more hands-on third person defense game genre, I had high hopes for Iron Brigade, and it met those expectations beautifully. The personality in the game had me chuckling as my mates and I, kitted out in our multi coloured walking 'trenches', blast away wave after wave of downright impressive looking enemies. Diverse story maps, a hoard of loot and a garage load of customisation made this game a sure win.Gameplay is entertaining and flexible, three types of trench giving you the choice between 'I'll kill it!' and 'Build ALL the turrets', and somewhere in between. Tactical placement decisions and rationing upgrade costs keeps your gears turning, and unique weapons and alternatives to standard turrets keep evolving your playstyle, which all comes together in the adequately challenging survival modes.The negatives are few, but are as follows. I personally found the final map to be a bit underwhelming, the end of the game putting a single sour note on an otherwise awesome storyline. Wrestling with Games for Window's Live also made getting set up a bit of an issue, but that really can't be helped by Double Fine, so I won't hold it against them. Lastly, the game stutters nastily if your computer isn't up to scratch at handling the numerous turrets placed on an extended map, but that's likely just my old laptop struggling.Overall, this is a game I'm very glad I bought, and will likely put more hours into it in the future. I didn't expect any less, and I wasn't even slightly disappointed. A definate must buy for all fans of the defense strategy franchise.			"

												This is an underrated Gem that came out of Double Fine's stable during the height of their Costume Quest and Stacked releases on Xbox Arcade. After going through a copyright issue in the EU over a boardgame simply called ""Trench"", the name went from Trenched to Iron Brigade. Because the stompy bots are actually called a Trench, y'see.That aside, this game is one of the most solid productions Double Fine has managed to offer; Gameplay is very energetic and hectic, there's plenty of variety to build/pilot the kind of robot you want to play, and the enemies have a decent variety that take a combined arms approach. That said, in general the game is fairly accessible, if slightly difficult if attempted in low numbers of players.Since it went through the GFWL grindmill at some point, then later got converted to Steam multiplayer, I can't be too certain of the stability multiplayer; It's worked fine for me in the past but it's also failed me, in part due to instability in foreign connections, I can only assume. One of the updates after that claimed that the netcode was fixed, but most of my friends only had a passing interest. However, this game definitely deserves your attention for the price of one cheap sandwich.It's an unique stompy bot experience.			"

												Pretty decent game, I'd wait for it to go on sale though.This game is decent if you get it at a low price. The combat is fun enough, gearing your trench and testing out different play styles with the guns is entertaining enough. The story is pretty sparse, you never really find out what ""The Broadcast"" is, or why it made one guy want to rule the world with tv monsters. The difficulty curve is also a bit random. It could be just because there were only two of us but most levels were simple enough but about 3 of them utterly destroyed us repeatedly till we got some lucky gun drops. Interestingly none of the levels that were hard were the boss levels which are pretty simple. Alone this game would may be a bit boring since later maps have you guarding objectives that can be pretty spread out. Also the turrets may not help much since there are enemies that target turrets, this was a bit of a bummer for me because it made it so I wouldn't upgrade any turrets since it felt more useful to just buy as many as I could so it'd be harder to destroy them all. It's short but worth a shot.			"

												Surprisingly Addictive...The Mixture of Tower Defense and Gunning a Mech is just great. And its even implemented very well.If u want Fire Power on your Mech, u got to sacrifice heavy Turrets and the other way round.Speaking of which, I think there could be even more Chassis with different Turret loadouts and Weapons.Cant actually remember which combination it was i wished for during Playtime, but well, you might encounter the very same wish during playthrough. So lets say its a feature of the game, since u have to adapt to the possible choices and loadouts to figure out a good strategy to beat the later (and harder) maps.Unfortunately u will have to do quite some grinding now and then for leveling and upgrades, but it also offers ways to experiment different approaches on same maps.Anyhow, I bought this game when it was very cheap a few weeks ago b4 summer sale. Even for 5 bucks its still a great bargain			"

												Fun as hell, I highly recomend it if you want to play with your friends. While early parts of the campaign can be done solo they are best done with friends. The graphics are nice and the plot while predictable is enjoyable and fun. You won't find incredible depth to the story but the game allows yo uto customize your Trench (the griant robot machines of carnage) to your playstyle with loot you earn or buyable shop items.THE BAD! The worse thing has to be the co-op right now, the match making system can take a new player that is literally on the 1rst campaign mission and toss them with players that are at the end game, the new player ends up being like a flat tire on the team as they don't have the firepower to be useful on later missions. Sometimes the co-op slows down big time- whether its because of junky net code or game engine is not optimized the very thing that makes this game enjoyable also hinders it. A promising game if they improve it and they should, cuz its fun			"

												Update: There are still some issues with GFWL implementation in this game. It is very common to experience dropped sessions in multiplayer, and doing so often causes you to be booted out of the mission entirely. Additionally there is an extremely annoying sound glitch on the free-DLC missions (which represent about 25% of the total game length), which evidently also has to do with GFWL but occurs in whichever mode you play. When GFWL is phased out soon, it is uncertain if Iron Brigade will ever be patched to continue supporting multiplayer at all-- Microsoft is the publisher for Iron Brigade and DoubleFine can't fix this unless Microsoft tells them to, reportedly. Even so, as things stand now the lobby system drops your friends constantly and there's no way around it, so multiplayer as it stands right now requires a lot of patience and luck.Original Review: It's very good. I've stayed up late two nights playing it already (16 hrs total, haven't finished it yet, though I've been replaying missions a lot to get gold medals). It's skewed heavily towards action but it's still a tower defense game, which I usually avoid but big stompy mechs make it all good. It does have GFWL, which is still clunky and terrible, but after getting to grips with it and setting it to auto-login it's stayed out of my way entirely.. could suck if you lose internet for prolonged periods while playing though, since a GFWL connection is used to save your progress. However, I've still really been loving this game and couldn't recommend it heartily enough.			"

Looks like they lost the rights to publish the game in this time XD and now they regained those rights, and patched game adding steam matchmaking. So the games for windows live problem seems to have been fixed.After playing it again, the changes are all positive:-2x and 4x supersampling option added when launching game! resulting into a still very nice looking game-its now a normal game, no game for windows live logins and problems.-matchmaking through steamworks seems to work fine-the stutter that happened when collecting scratch (game resource to build) seems to have also gone!So overall now I do really recommend this game, im myself gonna play it from the begin again!

												I really enjoyed playing Iron Brigade, whether solo or co-op. The mixture of WW1 and mech asthetics definitely worked for me, especially when mixed with nice touches of humour and the gameplay did not disappoint either. Blending TD with mech combat to overcome ever more challenging levels provides plenty of fun.			"

												IRON BRIGADE. that name sounds cool right? how about trenched? well its the same game. iron brigade is a hard game,well if your alone.a team of 2 is good but you cant hold off the tubes on later missions. 3 is great but you'll see why friendly fire should be turned off.4 is the best. i recommend a team of 4 because, well , would you rather never get past the first boss, or would you rather murder tubes together as a team while blowing through the whole game? yea thats what i thought. a thing i wanted  while playing this, was if your trench died you would jump out and it would be sort of a fps where you can still place turrets and you can get into your broken trench and use it as a mounted turret.but its sucha good game i can push it aside. oh wait i havent even explained the plot. just after ww1 a signal hit earth that killed any people that listened to it.two soilders listened to the signal (named the broadcast) and survived. it gave them higher than avrage IQs. one of the soilders, Frank Woodruff, lost his legs in the war, so he used his newly given smarts to build ""mobile trenches"" to let wounded soilders walk again. Vladimir Farnsworth, the other soilder, used his smarts to build the     Monovision, allowing people to experience the world from the comfort and isolation of their homes. he was driven insane by his own invention and created tubes,creatures that were made to spread the broadcast and take over the world. you as the player must get in your trench and fight them and kill Farnsworth.well its a very good game. i would recommend multiplayer but whatever floats your boat. so yea its a good game and i would recommend it!

												Purchased the game in the Double Fine bundle, which is the only way it's worth your money. It's a passable Tower Defense title set in an alternate timeline where World War 2 is waged between giant mecha and psychokinetic, electric monsters. Customization options are surprisingly deep: you can select a character, modify the chassis and weapons of your ""Trench"" (the bipedal walking tank that carries you into battle), and the selection of turrets you want available for construction on the field. The gameplay itself is shallow and poorly balanced. Iron Brigade, like many other Double Fine games conceived during Amnesia Fortnight, is a generic game too reliant on the classic Double Fine charm to appeal to gamers.The most obvious comparison would be Dungeon Defenders, a game that offers similar gameplay mechanics, but with much more varied monster and level design. Unilke Dungeon Defenders, Iron Brigade hardly acknowledges the third dimension, with generally flat levels and straightforward monster pathing. Turrets are separated into offensive and support turrets. Weapon and turret progression is so poorly balanced that you can progress through much of the game with simply support turrets to slow monster advancement. Though the concept of combining Mechwarrior and Tower Defense is a fresh one, it's poorly executed. Was unable to test online capabilities as the player base is non-existent.If you're looking for a 3D TD-Shooter hybrid, Dungeon Defenders II offers greater community, more robust gameplay, and a better pricepoint (it's Free-to-Play). Though Iron Brigade will be an enjoyable, if occasionally tiresome, few hours of your time, it's impossible to recommend you spend your money when a better, free alternative is available.			"

												I'm a big double fine fan and the idea of Mechas in WW2 was enough to prompt me to buy the game. It's not a bad game, but it feels really mediocre. The tower defense setup feels like it's wasting a lot of potential here and even though the game says it can be played solo, the boss battles pretty much require at least 2 players. There's just not enough here to make it worth buying and I really wish I didn't have to say that.			"

												Fun when it works, but GFWL really sucks. Buy it with a group of dedicated friends and play to your hearts' content or avoid it completely ... not worth the heart ache of trying to meet up with strangers! WW1 mechs are pretty neat, though.Also, Double Fine. I'm really sorry to not be recommending one of your games. :(Update: So, now that GFWL has been removed, I figured I would try playing the game. Loading seems fine, but matchmaking seems to be worse. I'm going to give it a tentative thumbs down simply because it is playable by myself, but I was unable to stay loaded in the game with another player (and it was not from connectivity issues, because we were talking on Skype at the same time).Here's to hoping for another patch!

												Since I'm finally able to play it since they removed the MSN login, I can finally play it.  That's the good news.The bad news is it's a mediocre.  This third-person tower defense, similar to Orcs Must Die.  Not all items can be purchased in the store and can be obtained from loot boxes that drop from the larger monsters.  Good customization with chassis, legs, weapons, and costume options with some of the setups looking like HERCs from Starsiege, but gameplay is what brings it down, along with the humor falling flat in several areas.

You want to go back and get perfect scores on maps to get extra experience points and bonuses, but that seems to me to max out a bit too soon.The idea and the awesome mechs and fun characters would do well within a bigger game.If it's on cheap, you like mechs, tower-defense games and/or FPS shooters, then it's definently reccomended.

												Iron Brigade is definitely one of the more enjoyable experiences from DoubleFine in the gameplay department. You pilot a Mobile Trench Unit (basically a pair of robo-legs with guns) and fend off incoming beasts built out of TV's and electronics, with the aid of some deployable towers and possibly a friend or two. You gradually unlock bigger and better guns and turrets, and it's great fun to just slap an artillery cannon on your trench and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥away. It's a decent game in solo, and a much better experience with other people who can run loadouts that complement yours.Which brings us to the issue of multiplayer. Sadly, despite GFWL finally having been stripped from this beast years after the fact, the netcode is still tempermental at best and outright shoddy at worst. You can usually get a 2-player game going without much issue, but attempting a 3 or 4 player session has ended in crashes, hangs, and disconnects within minutes for me every single time I try.2 players insofar works just fine and dandy though.

												I bought this because they said it was better with Steamworks. Well, if crazy hitching accompanied by what I would describe as an audio massacre is better, things must've been pretty bad before.I guess the lesson is don't ever buy this game, no matter what it's called, or what online service it's using.

Product received for free
												I was gifted this game by a friend after we watched and read reviews portaying it as a lot of fun. The depth of story is to be expected for a TD game, shallow. We weren't expecting a masterpiece, we were simply expecting fun, this game left us yawning after 4 levels and so bored we couldn't continue shortly after that. There is no feel in combat, poor interface and a complete lack of depth. If a game can't even engage me in cooperative mode with a friend when we are trying to like it, it has failed, utterly and completely.No stars.			"

												""Iron Brigade"" is a rd person mech-themed shooter mixed with tower defense elements, with the signature Double Fine humor and quirky visual presentation. In  a world overrun by the Broadcast and its evil minions called Tubes (TVs, in fact), the last line of defense is brave soldiers fighting in trenches (mechs).The game features a fairly lengthy campaign mode, where each level consists of defeating a set number of enemies while defending key targets. At the player's disposal are its trusty trench, and emplacements - autonomous units that will provide offensive, defensive or support aid. AKA, your towers.The trench itself is highly customizable. You have a choice between core elements: the chassis and the legs, with each providing different abilities and possibilities. Double Fine did a mighty fine job on balancing each build. There's no ultimate trench, no ultimate loadout. Instead, a certain loadout will make you blast through some levels, while on others it'll cost you your victory. The core gameplay encourages experimentation with many kinds of light and heavy weaponry, short- or long-ranged, etc. New enemy types are introduced at a constant rate. Just when you think you've got it all, some shiny new Tube appears forcing you to adapt your strategy to it.There's also survival mode, which is very fun to play, and the ultimate way to test your winning loadout. And, of course, multiplayer.Thumbs up.			"

The second game I tried, the same thing happened, but it Crashed To Desktop (CTD).I'll try again later and post back.Edit 2: Been playing this a lot lately, online connectivity is fine, but the online matchmaking could be better implemented.  As far as playing with friends, it's a great time and experience, and what it should have been from launch.			"

												Fight giant robot lizards with giant robot walkers with the help of robot turrets produced on a giant robot boat. Unfortunately the multiplayer is currently borderline unplayable. Co-op w/ more than one other person causes the game to crash or lag up a storm. So I'd recommend waiting a bit for the bugs to be fixed before buying if multiplayer is a big thing for you. Multiplayer is now fixed! It still suffers from the occasional lag or crash, but no more than any other game.			"

												A fantastic four player foray into combative alterative history. Think of if a Metal Gear had sex with a giant mech from Kogoro Kurata and you have ""The Trench"", the player's personal battle bot with guns and grit (minus a cover so the character is completely open to fire, however it doesn't seem to matter).One downside I came across is that the later levels will require grinding to complete. So if players aren't fans of replaying levels to grind for cash for the oh so important and necessary weapons, gear, etc they might not favor this game.Besides replaying levels the game isn't half bad.The characters aren't complete cardboard and actually have life in them. The game is fairly balanced and the enemies aren't similar so the player can expect to be kept on their toes.I give it an 8 out of 10.			"

												Bought this game to try out some trenchin' co-op with my friend and was not disappointed. This game is unique and has a cool concept, good humor, and some fun mechanics. The only letdown that I have with the game is the lag that seems to increase as gameplay goes on and you're picking up scrap (hopefully it gets fixed soon). It is a fresher take on mech warfare, with some added tower defense esque gameplay. You play as a marine in your mobile trench (cool concept imo) and are faced off against an enemy known as ""the broadcast"". Your main goal of the game is to takedown the broadcast and pretty much build the best trench you can. The trench is customizable with a nice selection of cores, legs, emplacements, and various types of weapons. The emplacements add the tower defense aspect, and they assist you in different ways (flak guns for air, machine guns, repair cranes, etc), I just wish they were a little more useful then they tend to be. Anways... buy this game. You won't be disappoint.			"

												It's SUCH a fun game, if only multi-player worked reliably, which it does not. SO much potential lost of this fundamental problem!Despite the confident Dev claims from a couple of months ago, playing in multi-player mode, one or more players WILL lose their connection at random. Thus, you get a long way into a Mars mission, only to have one or more players disconnected, and then everybody else quickly dies while the unlucky one(s) try to rejoin: Failed mission.After several retries like that, it gets frustrating that the maps are designed for multi-player, certain achievements are based upon multi-player, but the game engine CLEARLY does not yet solidly and reliably support multi-player. So, until it is truly fixed, my friends and I are tired of the frustration and wasted time of trying to beat hard missions and having key players dropped at crucial moments.People contemplating buying the game should understand that multi-player is NOT fixed nor reliable yet, so there is a core frustration to the game (particularly on the harder settings) that make it more luck (will everybody's connections hold?) than skill whether you'll be able to complete particularly the Mars maps.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Iron Brigade is a game developed by Double Fine Productions and moves very differently from it's original cute point and click adventure games and takes on a wave based tower defense game with a sort of interesting storyThe game at first is fun to play and with the addition of co-op makes it ten times as better, however, for me personally after three hours into the game playing mostly singleplayer, since not many people seem to play the multiplayer portion and I have no friends, it got kind of repetitive and boringThe game is split into Europe, Africa and The Pacific and all you need to do is place turrets and protect your base from alien creatures after a certain amount of waves (usually 15 waves) you win. After a while it can get repetitive and very very boringAnd that is what made me stop playing Iron Brigade, the constant tower defence and wave based gameplay gets very boring after a whileIron Brigade is a mixed bag to me, it is getting a recommend it because it is a fun little indie game to play but it can get boring after a while. Iron Brigade is only recommended if you like tower defence/wave based game or you are a fan of Double Fine Production and their gamesPlus, the game is locked at 30FPS, why? Have no idea why... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Now, though I only have 2 hours on it, before this came out on computer I had it on the Xbox 360, and put many hours into tubesomping solo(Recommend playing with a group) until I just started matchmaking.""Iron Brigade"" is basically a tower defense with mechanized heroes with large cannons and even larger egos. Each Trench has it's own setup for towers and each tower is color coded to fit into only certain slots, up to a max of four towers depending on your trench. Got a good selection of towers from disorienting slow fields, to mortars and snipers! Your main source of damage *early* in the game is, for the most part, inflicted by you. Not your towers. Don't get me wrong, those towers become godlike late in the game.. If you have a good selection, and even better placement.  It's a great way to kick you into the world of Tube stomping. I would give this a solid 8/10 based only on gameplay. It's definitely worth the buy if your into defense type games. Hell even robots.			"

												A good third-person shooter / tower defense hybrid very similar to the Sanctum series right down the four player co-op mode with only slight difference in the way the games are balanced.Where Iron Brigade really shines, however, is the aesthetic; your ""mobile trench"" (battle mech) looks like it just walked off of an Alt-History WWI battlefield and the weapons and emplacements you have access to as well as the USS McKinley fits right in while the the various Monovision monsters are dark cyberpunk creations that somehow look right facing off against your Diesel Punk combat walker.A warning is required however as it is difficult/impossible to play co-op anymore due to the game's reliance on the largely defunct Games for Windows Live service.EDIT:As of a June 2015, Iron Brigade now uses Steamworks instead of Games for Windows Live, improving game preformance and making multiplayer far more easy to play.

												Iron Brigade is an excellent Tower Defense/Mech Shooter hybrid, with fairly satisfying weapons and a nice WW1 theme-with-a-twist.Also, the game has now been ported over to Steamworks and the 'stutter' bug that once made playing the game migraine-inducing is gone.  As it stands, the only bug I've encountered is random disconnects in the multiplayer lobby, and even that's a minor inconvenience at worst.All-in-all, I find it very hard not to recommend Iron Brigade, especially if you have friends on hand who are also fans of Tower Defense or Mech games.

And, of course, multiplayer.Thumbs up.			"

												Great game, but can't recommend it with GFWL :-(Edit:So I've tried it twice and no luck so far.  The first game I joined it and I could see everyone on the ship, but once we readied up I got stuck at the loading the level.  The second game I tried, the same thing happened, but it Crashed To Desktop (CTD).I'll try again later and post back.Edit 2: Been playing this a lot lately, online connectivity is fine, but the online matchmaking could be better implemented.  As far as playing with friends, it's a great time and experience, and what it should have been from launch.			"

												A fantastic four player foray into combative alterative history. Think of if a Metal Gear had sex with a giant mech from Kogoro Kurata and you have ""The Trench"", the player's personal battle bot with guns and grit (minus a cover so the character is completely open to fire, however it doesn't seem to matter).One downside I came across is that the later levels will require grinding to complete. So if players aren't fans of replaying levels to grind for cash for the oh so important and necessary weapons, gear, etc they might not favor this game.Besides replaying levels the game isn't half bad.The characters aren't complete cardboard and actually have life in them. The game is fairly balanced and the enemies aren't similar so the player can expect to be kept on their toes.I give it an 8 out of 10.			"

												Iron Brigade is an excellent Tower Defense/Mech Shooter hybrid, with fairly satisfying weapons and a nice WW1 theme-with-a-twist.Also, the game has now been ported over to Steamworks and the 'stutter' bug that once made playing the game migraine-inducing is gone.  As it stands, the only bug I've encountered is random disconnects in the multiplayer lobby, and even that's a minor inconvenience at worst.All-in-all, I find it very hard not to recommend Iron Brigade, especially if you have friends on hand who are also fans of Tower Defense or Mech games.

												A fun First Person Shooter Tower Defense game that is enjoyable for a little bit.Iron Brigade is a FPS tower defense game similar to Dungeon Defenders, Sanctum, and Orc Must Die to name a few.   You control a character on a map, the camera is in 3rd person, you have the ability to place towers and traps, and you can also directly engage the enemy.  If this all sounds par for the course, that is because it is.  That isn't to imply that this is a bad game, it just doesn't do much that is different.For the most part, the only thing that this game has over other games in this genre is charm. And this can be seen in its visuals, VO, animations (saluting is hilarious), and the general game's setting.  I know a lot of people like to use the saying that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but in this case, you can for this game. Watch a trailer or two, and if you enjoyed what you saw, then you'll probably enjoy playing this game. However, if the style doesn't grab you, than there isn't much that the game will do that change your opinion.In the end Iron Brigade is a competent  FPS TD game. And as such it has the same things going for and against it. I personally found myself getting fed up with the game about half way in, when the game's design started to show that the maps were design for multiplayer (big maps, lots of spawn points, and defense mission objects). And given the game's age and popularity, I wasn't able to find any random people to play with. However, even with that being said, I still enjoyed the game, to the point where I feel that other people would enjoy this game too... well, they would enjoy it for a bit.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Iron Brigade is a game developed by Double Fine Productions and moves very differently from it's original cute point and click adventure games and takes on a wave based tower defense game with a sort of interesting storyThe game at first is fun to play and with the addition of co-op makes it ten times as better, however, for me personally after three hours into the game playing mostly singleplayer, since not many people seem to play the multiplayer portion and I have no friends, it got kind of repetitive and boringThe game is split into Europe, Africa and The Pacific and all you need to do is place turrets and protect your base from alien creatures after a certain amount of waves (usually 15 waves) you win. After a while it can get repetitive and very very boringAnd that is what made me stop playing Iron Brigade, the constant tower defence and wave based gameplay gets very boring after a whileIron Brigade is a mixed bag to me, it is getting a recommend it because it is a fun little indie game to play but it can get boring after a while. Iron Brigade is only recommended if you like tower defence/wave based game or you are a fan of Double Fine Production and their gamesPlus, the game is locked at 30FPS, why? Have no idea why... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Bought this game to try out some trenchin' co-op with my friend and was not disappointed. This game is unique and has a cool concept, good humor, and some fun mechanics. The only letdown that I have with the game is the lag that seems to increase as gameplay goes on and you're picking up scrap (hopefully it gets fixed soon). It is a fresher take on mech warfare, with some added tower defense esque gameplay. You play as a marine in your mobile trench (cool concept imo) and are faced off against an enemy known as ""the broadcast"". Your main goal of the game is to takedown the broadcast and pretty much build the best trench you can. The trench is customizable with a nice selection of cores, legs, emplacements, and various types of weapons. The emplacements add the tower defense aspect, and they assist you in different ways (flak guns for air, machine guns, repair cranes, etc), I just wish they were a little more useful then they tend to be. Anways... buy this game. You won't be disappoint.			"

												Now, though I only have 2 hours on it, before this came out on computer I had it on the Xbox 360, and put many hours into tubesomping solo(Recommend playing with a group) until I just started matchmaking.""Iron Brigade"" is basically a tower defense with mechanized heroes with large cannons and even larger egos. Each Trench has it's own setup for towers and each tower is color coded to fit into only certain slots, up to a max of four towers depending on your trench. Got a good selection of towers from disorienting slow fields, to mortars and snipers! Your main source of damage *early* in the game is, for the most part, inflicted by you. Not your towers. Don't get me wrong, those towers become godlike late in the game.. If you have a good selection, and even better placement.  It's a great way to kick you into the world of Tube stomping. I would give this a solid 8/10 based only on gameplay. It's definitely worth the buy if your into defense type games. Hell even robots.			"

												It's SUCH a fun game, if only multi-player worked reliably, which it does not. SO much potential lost of this fundamental problem!Despite the confident Dev claims from a couple of months ago, playing in multi-player mode, one or more players WILL lose their connection at random. Thus, you get a long way into a Mars mission, only to have one or more players disconnected, and then everybody else quickly dies while the unlucky one(s) try to rejoin: Failed mission.After several retries like that, it gets frustrating that the maps are designed for multi-player, certain achievements are based upon multi-player, but the game engine CLEARLY does not yet solidly and reliably support multi-player. So, until it is truly fixed, my friends and I are tired of the frustration and wasted time of trying to beat hard missions and having key players dropped at crucial moments.People contemplating buying the game should understand that multi-player is NOT fixed nor reliable yet, so there is a core frustration to the game (particularly on the harder settings) that make it more luck (will everybody's connections hold?) than skill whether you'll be able to complete particularly the Mars maps.
