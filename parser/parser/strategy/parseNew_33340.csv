												Day 1 - Settled Peacefully and founded the City of Innsmouth, defended by the stalwart ship Heart of Gold. Bless this verdant land we have found.Day 7 - Explored the Orient, opening peaceful diplomatic channels and arranging for settlement rights, offered me a free bag of ""spice"" to take home to my peopleDay 10 - the Citizenry of my city have developed an inexplicable craving for the ""spice"" that can be procured from the Orient and refuse to act like civil tax payers without itDay 13 - Established the Colony of Asheron to settle oriental peoples and harvest their ""spice"" farms. Financial markets are begining to teeter if supply of the substance cannot be maintained.Day 18 - Upon discovery of further ""spice"" farming by a nearby settlement, plans are being drawn up to privateers their spice trade and capture it. Shortages in ""spice"" lead to psychotic breaks in common people and looting and riots.  I must admit, this stuff makes my daily porridge quite palatableDay 21 - War was declared between the impotent Bard and his foolish people who hold the ""spice"" lands i want for me and my peoples. Civilization itself now depends on seasoned porridge and fish. It goes well with everything!Day 23 - Let the annals of history record my glorious victory over those musical legions, This shall form the start my personal ""spice"" stock. Odd, this morning my eyes were glowing a bit blue. maybe i should cut back on the seasoning . . .Day 28 - War was declared upon Innsmouth by the crusading legions of a nearby warrior. she claims our work with the Orientals is blasphemous, despite her OWN ""spice"" trade routes. To the depths of the inferno with her! I shall lay claim to her mining operations AND her spice fields. That giant mountain at the center of her mines looks like a grand site for my next castle. Hmmm . . i'm out of spice for my tea. I'll have to fire the maid again, or maybe that's not sending a strong enough message.Day 31 - The War rages! Amidst the screams of battle, i heard the earth speak to me. He is coming, and our glorious spice crusades will wake him. I shall send in arsonists and sabateurs to burn that overzealous warrior womans's town to the ground. The spice must flow!Day 35 - I should never have come here. My cities riot and burn in demand for spice, the mountain screamed fire into the sky this morning as we prepared to invade; my legions are lost. That zealous harlots troops have stolen my bardic spice fields and burned Asheron's spice fields to the ground. The Heart of Gold is all i have left. I must flee.Next time, next time i'll do it without spice . . . but just one more jar of it on my porridge won't hurt, will it?9/10lacks sand worms and freman			"

												This game has recently became available on Steam again... So I bought it right off the bat. Otherwise, I had the differently named, but exactly the same game: Anno 1404 and Venice. Let me tell you, I have put probably put as much time into this game as Anno 2070 on my profile--over 300 hours. Anno 1404 (which is what I'll call it) is a fantastic game and I slightly prefer it over Anno 2070. Anno 1404 is simply beautiful and you get drawn into it easily. You get to craft your empire and your production chains and keep people happy. Getting to the point of building the Imperial Cathedral is fantastic as well. It is a beautiful crowing achievement for the time you spent in the game. The screenshots you can take of the world and what you build are simply beautiful as well. Playing it with a few friends is fun too. However, Anno 2070 is better for that in the end. Though make no mistake, they are very similar games... just set in a different time period. Anno 2070 will have a few more challenges, and funner enemies to square off against (Keto and Strindburg). Though, Anno 1404 has much larger maps, which is what 2070 needs. After a while, 2070 feels quite small when you get fast ships and air vehicles. Regardless, having both Anno 1404 and 2070 in your library, if you love these type of games, is simply great as they are great games! We can only hope Ubisoft and BlueByte make the next Anno game just as great! I fully endorse this game to anyone who likes games of this genre!			"

												Dawn of Discovery Gold (The original including the Venice add-on) is the American version of Anno 1440 AD Gold Edition which was released in Europe.  The game is identical and I could find no changes apart from the game title.Graphics are well implemented and fully customizable to suit player's hardware and operating system environments.  Sound is atmospheric, NPC's are well vocalized and have convincing characterization, music is of good ambience and is non-intrusive.There are four difficulty settings and the game supports both single player and multi-player.  There are a number of campaign missions with pre-defined victory conditions, and a sandbox mode for infinite play.Starting conditions may vary significantly depending on difficullty settings and gameplay mode.Essentially the player is tasked with exploring islands, establishing a colony, expanding the settlement and ensuring that resources are acquired to meet the needs and demands of the colony.The player can place fishing huts, lumber yards, mines, quarries and a variety of farms and manufacturing plants to generate resources.  Various facilities such as places of worship, fire departments and taverns will increase the safety and status of the colony.  As the game progresses additional storage and manufacturing and mining facilities become available.The player can adjust tax rates and either approve or deny colonists access to building materials.There are NPC's (Non-Player Characters) that will offer quests from time to time, these will usually be either fetch and deliver, find and deliver (Zoom in on the town and find a person or persons), explore an island, escort a ship, or sink a ship.  These missions usually have a time limit and need to be completed before the time expires.The islands are of two main types (Northern/Occidental or Southern/Orient).  The resources that can be cultivated will differ depending on the type.Players can trade to purchase goods, or opt to produce and sell goods.  Trade routes can be automated or the player can manually operate a trading vessel.  Trading can be set at each player harbour.Players may during mid to late game decide to acquire additional expansion potential by evicting one or more competitors by force and taking over their islands.Pirates will occassionaly be either a help or a hinderance depending on difficulty settings and diplomatic status.Dawn of Discovery has a lot of depth and is a great time-waster.  The game has a sense of progression and accomplishment and will unlock features and rewards.Dawn of Discovery is a highly addictive and fun to play game that comes highly recommended.9 / 10			"

What:Island-based real-time strategy citybuilder. Venice is the expansion that adds multiplayer, among other things.When:15th century.Where:Randomly generated temperate and desert island maps.Why:Simulate a romantic section of history.Significance:Dependence on resources, commodities, and logistics makes this game a potential tool for teaching both economics and history. Out of all my games, I've played this one the most - Get the Gold version though.Pros:Simplistic yet insanely steep learning curve. A great sense of achievement for overcoming the impossible. Hundreds of hours of challenging gameplay. As real-time strategy as it gets. Warfare is there, but mostly naval-based. Beautiful water, vegetation, and effects.Cons:Extremely time consuming. Eight hours of gameplay and barely having one scenario finished can be mentally draining. Land-based combat is limited. Ubisoft's DRM prevents the game from being popular.			"

												One of my favorite strategy games ever and my personal favorite time/setting for the Anno series got a wonderful expansion pack.Wonderful graphics for its time, fun gameplay and a wonderful expansion pack are just some of the joys that Dawn of Discovery and its expansion pack Venice offer.If you want an older strategy game that you can sink many hours into pick this up, while I don't find it has quite the depth that 2070 had, I do like the setting and time more personally. If you are going to check out the upcoming Anno game I suggest you check out this one and 2070 to get ready for another entry to this wonderful and in depth series.			"

												Dawn of Discovery aka Anno 1404 is a fantastic, detail-driven city/economy simulator with a bit of RTS. DoD is relaxing, gorgeous, and a great example of sandbox citybuilding with a challenge. You're encouraged to make multiple cities/islands and trade route them together, micromanage and setup production lines and creating a very pretty visual balance between the environment and buildings, which all look incredible and detailed. For what it is, and with no major flaws in my play experience so far, I'd say DoD is pretty dang good.Sadly it's not on sale on Steam at the moment cause, to the best of my knowledge anyway, Ubisoft's last patch for the game never made it to Steam, so Steam pulled it, saying it's an incomplete game. Unfortunately the last patch means Steam versions are incompatible saves with non-steam, so you can't really play much with non-steam owners of the game. Hopefully it goes up for sale again soon... However, Anno 2070 is almost identical and highly reccomended.EDIT: DoD is back on sale! I very much reccommend it still, although there does still seem to be the issue of occasional crashes or multiplayer disconnects, if anyone has an idea why, I'd be happy to hear it. It's every once in a while, but enough to be a little distracting. Although it auto-saves pretty damn often so you usually don't lose much progress. Still worth it, incredibly fun.			"

												Eventhough the game was developed in 2009. It looks great for its age! I've been playing it for 2 days now and I already have 35 hours on it. Go Figure!! Needless to say this game is not for all audience, its a very slow but rewarding game. There is a lot of content but I will not exploit that for anybody, go find them out yourself and be amazed on how much you can actually do in this game.The Multiplayer aspect added with the Venice DLC is exceptional. First off, it DOES NOT REQUIRE a UPLAY LAUNCHER. The games that you play are saved online if you have an online profile selected. COOP allows players to manage a single faction together. Players playing as separated factions and playing COOP by forming an alliance is also an option. There are a bunch of regulars online but I have not really explored that much, mostly playing with people that I know.The Modability, the games does have a few mods out there. I have yet to try them. I will try to exhaust myself out of the vanilla game first and then maybe install those MODS that adds items and such in the game sometime in the future. Considering there are a lot of game contents that I can unlock a wide range of content from ornamental in-game structures to customizing my profile. There requirements to unlock these items is what I would describe as a slow but rewarding process. I'd say it will take me a while before even considering installing the IAAM 1404 Mod.Just an FYI if your just starting out. Play the Campaign for a quick tutorial by launching just Dawn of Discovery. There are a lot of different videos out there on how to build an effecient settlement/city. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. This is a city building game people. Be creative, explore and have fun. Develop your own style of playing. I also recommend disabling some of the natural disasters while you are just starting out to avoid begginer's frustration.Play your music, start your game. Continious Game Mode. You'll be in for a treat.I highly recommend this game.			"

												Fantastic game. ♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft.Lost my save profile and all of my achievements because Ubisoft fails to recognize it anymore for no apparent reason. Well, okay then. RIP all of the progress I've made in the 100 hours I've played this game.Just to be clear, this game is just fantastic. It's a wonderfully relaxing, yet complex strategy building game. You can take it completely at your own pace, and that is what is so amazing about it. It's an excellent experience to play casually, slowly building up your island(s) and sipping on a cup of coffee, and humoring leif erikson, fledgling bard. It is equally as fun to play on a more competitive level, grabbing up all of the land you can and taking down your opponents. Overall, it's just great. Highly recommended. Except for the DRM/network component. You'd think after all this time such things would be sorted out. ♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft.			"

												Strictly speaking, I can recommend this game - but there are two major caveats, which is why I'm writing this review as a warning.People have been complaining of crashes. I experienced the same. The issue turns out in most cases to be that the game is poorly optimized, graphically, such that even if you're getting great frames on any given setting, the game might overload the memory and crash. So you might be forced to play at lower settings than you'd like to avoid this.Second (and for me this is quite frustrating), multiplayer does not work. Or, rather, if you're going to play with anyone, make sure you do finish the game within thirty hours (of real-life, not in-game, time). Why? Because Ubisoft, in its infinite propensity for poor decisions, has taken the validation servers offline, but online profiles are given a thirty hour grace period during which they aren't validated. Thus, once you make a profile, you have just over a day until it tries to validate with Ubisoft only to find out that they've managed to ruin yet another online experience.Apart from that, it's a wonderful game. A substantial step up from Anno 1701, with just the right additional mechanics, and a beautiful setting.			"

												This is a really good game in my book. No bugs or crashes. The game is very sim strategy based. You colonize an Island build your empire then while doing this your making allies trading goods and taking down your enemies.... All while building your settlements... There has been a few other games of similarity like 1602 A.D.. I think the company that produce this game bought the rights to the game and created a very similar updated and better version of it. I think they did a very very good job.... So its very good game to try and if you like things like this I would suggest this hands down... However you don't have to take my words for it... :D			"

												This game has become my favorite city builder of all time! It has a perfect mix of everything. Whether you like peacefully building a mega-city, trade, diplomacy, or war, it has it all! It's also both single and multiplayer too.Most of the game will be spent expanding your population and setting up the required production chains to sustain them. It's not as easy as it might sound, you can only grow so many crops, and harvest certain resources from different islands. Trading: both internally and externally is a must.The best part in my opinion is that the AI is actually rather good. It's hard to keep pace with the AI's building, and it's compentent enough in sea & land warfare to give you headaches.If you're looking for a solid city builder and then some: get this game!			"

												Bottom line, it's an ok game.  The single player remindes me of Caesar III.  It's fun, but like pretty much everything else made by Ubisoft it was coded by a bunch of zoo animals.  Don't expect to play it online, because you can't anymore.			"

												Leave it to Ubisoft...That's right, the company that can't even do Tetris right... Ubisoft is the destroyer of good games. This particular game is a prime example. This series was originally a part of Sunflowers studios which was purchased by Ubi. The first two games, 1602 and 1701, were incredible, but once Ubisoft took over they spun it into a politically correct, broken game. Not only did Ubisoft give us the worst games of this series, 1404 and 2070, but they refuse to put the best in the series (1701) on Steam. 1701 A.D. doesn't function on Windows 7 or 8, so I'm stuck with the worst games in this series. Thanks Ubisoft. HASHTAG ASSASSINS GREED			"

												The only game i paid 50$ on steam for. Couldn't launch it for few weeks, before i found a solution (non latin characters in a game folder path) and shared it with everyone else on forums. Meanwhile ubisoft didn't reply on forums or tickets and introduced a fix TWO month's later. Disgusting.The game itself is good enough though - graphics are pretty, music is nice... gameplay however is slow, especially multiplayer since you can't speed it up.I can't recommend it since Anno 2070 has been out for a year and its basically the same game with different graphics. But it instead if you want classical chain production strategy game.			"

												Set in the day where men could be men and there were no environmental activists to limit your potential, Dawn of Discovery allows you to conquer the world through trade.

												An amazingly polished sim styled game, with a nice blend of informative UI and beautiful attention to detail.The gameplay is a classic supply chain styled game, similar to early Settlers games and the Stronghold series. However unlike those games where it felt more as though you were, to some degree, directly in control of each individual unit, this one abstracts it. Such as armies aren’t individual units, but whole groups which are move around, forming camps from which attacks can be launched.There is a sense of not wanting to compromise gameplay, while also wanting to keep a believable level of ""realism"". Keeping the two in a good balance, and while each mission can on occasion feel a little slow to progress, it's a good idea to try the free play. Where like a Civilization game, you customise victory (if any) conditions and just sit back and watch your island cities grow.A slick, well executed and well crafted game.			"

												The most addictive game I've ever played, ever! If you like strategy, economy games, with a touch of violence, this is your best bet. You will constantly try to fine tune your trade routes and city production for the most well oiled machine.I tried Anno 2070 but the charm of this over that is the historical colonial feel. The only negative I have is the save system really struggles and can lock up the game and the engine struggles a bit in multiplayer. But for an older game, who cares! Also I wish I could rearrange the chronological order of my trade routes without having to remove and then add warehouses all over again.11//10			"

												A continuation of the ""Anno"" series, under a new name (but not in Europe), and everybit as good as you remember.  I have sunk many an hour into Dawn of Discovery, and Venice does a great job adding content.  With a new NPC faction and 15 new scenarios, this expansion completes the game nicely.At its core, Anno 1404 is a city builder.  Games last around the same length as a Civ game (5-10 hours).  You'll spend time managing resources and the different levels of your population, making them happy so they can promote to the next tier.If you enjoy slow paced games, sometimes without competitive motivation, this is an excellent game for you			"

												Oh my god. This game is amazing.Also known as Anno 1404, Dawn of Discovery is a city-builder with many RTS elements. I've only played the Master Builder scenario, which has taken me almost 70 hours, and the game has literal dozens of scenarios with different goals, so consider that as you read the review.Dawn of Discovery is a resource/economy management game that manages to feel really unique. I've only dabbled in the other Anno games, so I can't weigh it against the previous or current Anno games, but this game is amazing on its own. You are given a set of random islands at the beginning of the game and through trade, exploration, and conflict, you are to build a thriving kingdom. The game has a lot of depth in managing land that rivals juggernauts like SimCity 4 and Cities: Skylines, but also places a large emphasis on trade. The key to winning this game is networking your islands in a manner that lets them support each other. There are a plethora of resources available that differ from island to island, so making sure that the needs of your citizens are met requires you to take advantage of all of the land that you have available to you.The resources mentioned above are of course used by the populations of your islands. Your people start off as peasants, but as you build more structures and obtain more resources, your lowly peasants can become rich nobility. This is more than just a title, though. As civilians elevate to different levels, their needs change and keeping them happy becomes more challenging. Your economy can easily go into the toilet if you have inefficient trade routes or a lack of services. Civilians also damage structures and move down in their ranks when needs aren't met. This manages to be fun despite the challenges and there is a lot of variety in how you can manage these civilians due to there being two major types of civilians with very different needs.Combat is fun and easy to get into. There is a diplomacy mechanic that allows you to trade or war with other AI or human players. Much of the combat is sea based, but there is also land based RTS-style combat to keep things interesting. Warring can be extremely expensive, though, and can be frustrating if attempted too early.Building in this game is really, really flexible. You want an island dedicated to making beer and wine? It's doable. You want to make a mansion the size of a continent? Go for it. There are dozens of structures that can be built and managed, and the game becomes a city-builder fan's wet dream after a short time of playing.The music and visuals are phenomenal. The music is extremely pleasant and adds an atmosphere of beauty to the game. The game looks amazing and runs well on my GTX 960m. The only problem with this game is that by default it only uses 2 GB of Ram. This almost always causes the game to crash on highly populated kingdoms. There's a fix for it, but it's 3rd party which is a tad disappointing.This game is a must-buy for any city-builder fan. Even if you do not like RTS games, the game is phenomenal and allows you to play without having to worry about combat at all. Buy it. It and the expansion are definitely worth the $15 price tag.			"

												Great game with many simple possibilities weaved together to create a realistic complex island trading game. There are story modes to walk you through the basics of the game while following an interesting thread. You can also enter an open world with mulitple AI to compete against for land and resources. I've played this game over and over in the open world mode.You have tons of options and complete freedom to deisgn your cities how you want. I enjoy this version over Anno 2070 by far. If you like strategy games give this one a shot, you won't be dissapointed. This is mostly a city building / manufactuering game. The fighting is simple or non-existant if you choose. You can simply run away from the pirates if you want so that would be more fun if there was another level to that...but you get so caught up in keeping your peoples advancing and happy that I don't feel that I'm missing out.

												I've played this a couple of times solo in sandbox just to pass the time. The real fun comes with playing co-op with a friend. This game sets the bar for cooperative multiplayer. It lets you both play for the same team in real time.Not separate funds or resources. The same.This is how many games should allow for co-op. You can also play as two different teams that are allied together and trade with each other but it's not the same. One person working the north to keep the nobles under control and the other in the south to make the resources the other needs. The spice must flow!Unfortnately you also need the base game, so find gold edition when it's cheap.			"

												Dawn of Discovery (aka Anno 1404) is a very fun and entertaining city builder. The graphics are nice and the gameplay is relatively well paced. If you're looking for a game with heavy content concerning war and military victories, then this is NOT the game for you. This game eats away hours as you build up from a sall settlement to a vast city. Nonetheless, once you've played one round of this game, you'll realize the next round is the EXACT same process. There is little variation concerning how AI opponents act, thus once you learn your tactic, you can just rinse and repeat every time you play... Overall I give this game a 7/10. It is worth a buy if and only if you're a fan of city builders.			"

												They had to put in the ""you've been playing for two hours"" warning for a reason!  Just don't ever expect a quick game.DoD (or known elsewhere as ""Anno"") for me was the right amount of challenge and relaxation.  This meant that I could spend a good deal of time on it without being frustrated or bored.The challenge part stems from managing all the complex supply chains that you'll need to get your cities up and running.  From harvesting crops to gathering fuel, from smelting to ship building you'll be constantly checking your stocks, trying to predict impending shortages and clear out stuffed wearhouses.  Or when you're not doing that the game throws random quests at you, which lead to rewards that are actually worth pursuing.Yet if you want to you could also always pull back a bit, and spend some time on urban renewal.  Plant some trees.  Build a part in the city center.  Watch the waves lap on the shore.  The music definitely helps this portion.  And then when you're feeling less stressed, back to the never-ending grind of supply and demand!The military gameplay is pretty lackluster, but if they made you play a RTS and this game at the same time that would be simply overwhelming.If you play co-op, you and your friend can fight over where to send precious building materials or what development plan to pursue.  This is all the more fun since you share all your units and resources, and both of you can control the same unit at the same time.Overall this was well worth the money I spent.			"

It's exactly what I wanted: the same gameplay and style of Dawn of Discovery with Venetian additions.As with the original DoD, it isn't for everyone due to the extreme micro management but if this is your thing then this game delivers in spades.The end game can get a bit overwhelming with the sheer amount of resources and trade routes to keep on top of but that's part of the fun.The Scenarios keep the game interesting by setting limits and objectives so the game feels like it has a point.Brilliant game and a worthy addition to my collection!

												(This review is for the base game, Dawn of Discovery). Apparently, this game was made 7 years ago. I can't even tell! Along with the amazing graphics, this game brings to the table engaging stories, as well as guidance to staring your own ""empire"". I found it fun and challenging, and definately reccommend it.			"

												This game has pop-up notifications every 2 hours of gameplay telling you how long you've been playing for. They exist for a reason. I've seen the 16 hour one so far. It'd be sensible not to play this game if you find optimising systems addictive and also want to have a life. Play this game anyway.			"

												Multiplayer is spotty and unreliable. Nor is it easy to set up, but the single player options keep your interest.			"

												Oh my god. This game is amazing.Also known as Anno 1404, Dawn of Discovery is a city-builder with many RTS elements. I've only played the Master Builder scenario, which has taken me almost 70 hours, and the game has literal dozens of scenarios with different goals, so consider that as you read the review.Dawn of Discovery is a resource/economy management game that manages to feel really unique. I've only dabbled in the other Anno games, so I can't weigh it against the previous or current Anno games, but this game is amazing on its own. You are given a set of random islands at the beginning of the game and through trade, exploration, and conflict, you are to build a thriving kingdom. The game has a lot of depth in managing land that rivals juggernauts like SimCity 4 and Cities: Skylines, but also places a large emphasis on trade. The key to winning this game is networking your islands in a manner that lets them support each other. There are a plethora of resources available that differ from island to island, so making sure that the needs of your citizens are met requires you to take advantage of all of the land that you have available to you.The resources mentioned above are of course used by the populations of your islands. Your people start off as peasants, but as you build more structures and obtain more resources, your lowly peasants can become rich nobility. This is more than just a title, though. As civilians elevate to different levels, their needs change and keeping them happy becomes more challenging. Your economy can easily go into the toilet if you have inefficient trade routes or a lack of services. Civilians also damage structures and move down in their ranks when needs aren't met. This manages to be fun despite the challenges and there is a lot of variety in how you can manage these civilians due to there being two major types of civilians with very different needs.Combat is fun and easy to get into. There is a diplomacy mechanic that allows you to trade or war with other AI or human players. Much of the combat is sea based, but there is also land based RTS-style combat to keep things interesting. Warring can be extremely expensive, though, and can be frustrating if attempted too early.Building in this game is really, really flexible. You want an island dedicated to making beer and wine? It's doable. You want to make a mansion the size of a continent? Go for it. There are dozens of structures that can be built and managed, and the game becomes a city-builder fan's wet dream after a short time of playing.The music and visuals are phenomenal. The music is extremely pleasant and adds an atmosphere of beauty to the game. The game looks amazing and runs well on my GTX 960m. The only problem with this game is that by default it only uses 2 GB of Ram. This almost always causes the game to crash on highly populated kingdoms. There's a fix for it, but it's 3rd party which is a tad disappointing.This game is a must-buy for any city-builder fan. Even if you do not like RTS games, the game is phenomenal and allows you to play without having to worry about combat at all. Buy it. It and the expansion are definitely worth the $15 price tag.			"

												This game is very nice. It's a beautiful mixture o city building, economy/trade/resources handling, diplomacy, rts and warmongering. In the beggining it may be confusing, but after a little while you can learn its mechanics. For some people the game may have some issues, but they can be fixed. In short, it's a very nice game and it's multiplayer/coop is awesome. A must buy for lovers of this genre.May Shai-Hulud cleanse this land			"

												Great game with many simple possibilities weaved together to create a realistic complex island trading game. There are story modes to walk you through the basics of the game while following an interesting thread. You can also enter an open world with mulitple AI to compete against for land and resources. I've played this game over and over in the open world mode.You have tons of options and complete freedom to deisgn your cities how you want. I enjoy this version over Anno 2070 by far. If you like strategy games give this one a shot, you won't be dissapointed. This is mostly a city building / manufactuering game. The fighting is simple or non-existant if you choose. You can simply run away from the pirates if you want so that would be more fun if there was another level to that...but you get so caught up in keeping your peoples advancing and happy that I don't feel that I'm missing out.

												I've played this a couple of times solo in sandbox just to pass the time. The real fun comes with playing co-op with a friend. This game sets the bar for cooperative multiplayer. It lets you both play for the same team in real time.Not separate funds or resources. The same.This is how many games should allow for co-op. You can also play as two different teams that are allied together and trade with each other but it's not the same. One person working the north to keep the nobles under control and the other in the south to make the resources the other needs. The spice must flow!Unfortnately you also need the base game, so find gold edition when it's cheap.			"

												Picked this up because it was on sale for 5$ and it was tagged as a city builder... Holy crap this game is good. Really good. The graphics are amazing, game play is really fun. Time does not exist when playing this game. If you enjoy city building/sandbox games, dont even think about it. The game is simply well worth the regular price of 15$.			"

												The game has plenty of detail and complexity to keep you playing, but it can be dull with the little combat it provides. Easier to pick up than Patrician IV though. If you want a trading game get this, if you want a Civ builder with more action get Civilization.			"

												Amazing Game. For the past year and a half I have been looking for a good city-builder. In one week i already have 30 hours. So much fun. I just wish there was a tad more to the land combat. Ubisoft also kinda messes with it. I cannot recommend this enough.Even more fun with a few friends.10/10BUY THIS GAME. ITS SIM CITY 4 IN 1404.

												It is an amazing game! I love building my own cities and towns the way I want. Lots of chances to do things your own way. Also love the inovative trading and ship control system. Great graphics and visuals. Only a few hours in.Would definately recommend buying the Original Dawn of Discovery game.HOWEVER, I would suggest just buying the Dawn of Discoverdy original, not the Venice Add-On. As for some reason when you have both, it becomes hard to find the original campaign, which also acts as a tutorial.			"
