												Now that the game is fully released i can give a full reviewGraphics - 6/10 by modern standards the graphics are quite poor, they chose to use directX 9 along with unity, The Graphics look ok at first but when you look closer you realise how basic they are.  Water looks terrible, no 3d grass for light rough and rough, lighting is very basic and the performance is inconsistant from course to course. I have to turn settings down on an I7 4790k@4.6ghz and a amd Fury to maintain 60fps on some courses.Gameplay - 7/10 RTS is broken, it is way too sensitive, move the mouse back 2 pixels and thats a full back swing at 800dpi* on a 1080p screen, only increasing the screen to 1440p and the mouse DPI down to 400 is the RTS some what controlable,this is using the lowest sensitivity setting in game....Even then there is no feel and putting is a joke, with the ball rocketing off the face after the smallest slowest movement you can possibly do with a mouse, to top this the game gives zero feedback whilst on the course has to what you are doing right or wrong, the only way to get feedback is to go to the practice area (no putting green btw), and you will get feedback through a launch monitor,  not that it will be any use to you as there is zero explination of what the numbers mean, so if you have never been on launch monitor in real life and had the number explained to you, you are screwed basically. This wasn't thought through at all and they listened to totally the wrong people when implementing this.*Mice used Roccat Kone XTD and Corsair Vengence M65However mouse swing using the meter isn't bad at all,  although it will be very difficult for the beginner. so max assists is recommended..Presention - 6/10 simple menus very easy to navigate....nothing to write home about Value - 5/10 Thought long and hard about this, if the game was £14.99 i would say yes the game is good value for what you get, but they have released it at £26.99...and on top of that have release an extra course as day one DLC (if you have DLC ready for day one, it should be in the game at no extra cost) and are planning more micro transactions.  So id say this game isn't good value, as of now there is no career or progression system, there is a planned course designer, but has yet to materialise (no idea what its going to be like)...there is online play, and solo rounds, for a golf enthusiast maybe just enough, but for a gamer looking for something to play, £26.99 is going to be poor value.Overall 5/10 This game offers nothing for the causual/gamer player, the learning curve is very steep, with zero understandable feedback from the game ( A launch monitor is jibberish to the none enthusiast Golfer, even to some Serious golfers), The gameplay is kind of there, you just have to put is stupid amounts of hours to find it, and you will have to go on the forums to find out what the numbers on launch monitor mean....I do like parts of this game, but i can not recommend it (not at £26.99), so its a thumbs down from me.Edit... I was banned from the forums for critizing thier micro transactions implementation in this game, the game is on its way to pay to win, with being able to buy balls and clubs that change the way the game plays.....Avoid this game and do not support this GREEDY developer.Edit... I just found out that this developer is going to make you pay for ""major"" updates to the game, disguising them as DLC....So this means if you want to keep your game upto date you are going to have to keep sheling out your hard earned cash to do so, and this is after they have the nerve to charge £26.99 for a half finished game.....Edit... This is a quote from the Dev reguarding the future of the game""Once additional Feature driven DLC is available access to play user created content will be limited to those players who are on the new version."" This means courses you create yourself you will not be able to play anymore once the DLC update is released unless you buy it....This is disgusting from the dev its not enough that you have already paid for the game, they just want to fleece you out of more money.....Devs if you read this, its not the peoples who bought this games fault you underestemated how much this game would cost to develop and its not right to ask them to pay extra for updates, no matter how substantial the update is, The way good developers work is once you buy a licence for a game or piece of software it entitles you to updates for life, unless specifically stated...This was not the case with this game, you waited until we had paid our money, and then unleased the news that we would have to pay money for ""milestone"" updates....Sorry but this is morally repugnant on your part, and you have shown that you are just going to milk this community for a long time to come...i really hope more people see through you.Shame really because your game isn't bad, and if you had used directx11 from the start (oh one of things they want to charge for is porting the game to DX12)  and polished the game a little more before releasing it, the game would have sold well and you wouldn't have had to resort to such shaddy practices.

												The entire Bug Reporting section of the Perfect Parallel forums, is not even available to the public. A user must register in order to view the Bug Reporting section of the Perfect Parallel forums. Here, try to find it, otherwise: http://www.perfectparallel.com/forum/26-perfect-golf-bug-reporting/ Instead of taking bug reports seriously, the developers have religiously deleted legitimate forum posts, and fabricated TOS violations out of whole cloth... in an obvious attempt to muzzle legitimate criticisms.When a developer starts deleting on-topic forum posts, devoid of any rules violations, whatsoever... than, they have reached a new low. The developer has now fully retaliated against these criticisms... by issuing a permanent forum ban; as of December, 19, 2015.Only, that's not the good part. The good part; is that, the developer actually dredged up a forum post from May, 2015... as a pretext for a permanent forum ban, that has now been issued over 6 months later! So, basically... Necroban. Here's the screenshot to prove the surreptitious hilarity. If you'll notice, there isn't even anything listed under the all important, ""Ban Reason."" http://s19.postimg.org/3tdzlgav7/2015_12_19_pg_forum_ban.pngThe fact that, a game developer, would actually peruse back over 6 months into a user's post history, as a pretext, to ban them from the forums - and still not be able to come up with a legitimate reason - is both sad, and pathetic... on so many levels. (The ban has since been revoked)Forget about the game. One would reasonably expect more professional behavior from the developers.Nevertheless, here are the rest of the issues with this game:While there are multiple control methods; the controls – particularly when attempting to navigate through the menus and the settings - are both clunky and frustrating.There exists no tutorial, despite the entire piece of software being anything but user-friendly.While there does exist an official Practice Facility, the player is not able to move around, nor follow any shot within said facility; nor can the player putt in the practice facility.The sound is somewhat intermittent, with the impact of golf shots oftentimes being completely missed.The graphics are not entirely terrible, if one is able to use their own imagination... with several obvious gaffes, relating to blending, or the lack thereof; as well as, poor water reflections, and nonexistent edge refraction.For example, the outline of the rough - that separates different types of rough - often bulges, and causes shots hit there to bump squarely up against the outline of the rough, as if the golf ball were coming in contact with a street curb, as opposed to - thick grass.Another example; is that the cart paths hover above the ground. The developer has stated this is intended, as it is apparently a workaround to another issue. – Okay.Another huge issue is the lack of smooth undulating surfaces, particularly on greens. There are jagged creases and geometric shapes with straight lines protruding from the ground; oftentimes causing the golf ball to veer off of its intended path, unnaturally.The latest golfer avatar looks horrendous. The setup positions are largely incorrect, down to the backwards hand positioning. Also, the swing animation has a terrible hitch in it. – It's all just very amateurish in appearance.There is no user customization, whatsoever. Each and every user is required to use the exact same character. The only variation being, some pewter-like shirt color adjustments.The developers have repeatedly made unproven claims about the accuracy of their physics engine, as it relates to actual Tour Golf... despite the actual in-game physics being routinely over-corrected, with each subsequent new draft version of this game.Hitting three-quarter shots makes the ball roll forward excessively, moreso than would be realistically attainable with any given club.In this game; shorter, more-lofted clubs, will oftentimes actually incur more roll-out, than longer, less-lofted clubs... when struck in the same exact manner. Go figure that one out.Or, shots struck with more power, right on the sweet spot, will oftentimes inexplicably lose distance... regardless of the trajectory of the shot.Occasionally, the golf ball will actually penetrate underneath the surface of the turf, warp underground, and pop back up above the surface. This is completely inexplicable, and destroys all immersion.There have been ongoing issues with ball markers; not showing up, nor being in their correct location.There have been ongoing issues with Gimmes; freezing the game progression entirely... when hitting a par 3 tee shot that lands inside Gimme range.The Concede Hole button oftentimes causes the wrong player or team to win the hole.There have been ongoing issues with multiplayer connectivity failing.There have been ongoing connection issues, which may cause undue stuttering while spectating shots.There are ongoing issues with lag, and unexplained disconnections.The Course Creator has yet to be released. However, some beta testers have managed to create courses. The issue is that the system is entirely disorganized, causing users to have to download each course from varying download services, and manually extract each file individually into the correct game directory. There are also no Auto-Updates in place, which also can cause users to have different versions of courses. Yet, there are also false positives, that prevent users from joining games, when the two users in question actually do have the same course version.The lobby itself, is setup rather haphazardly, with inaccurate and incomplete references to player locations.The game is constantly being pirated, and the developers cannot seem to figure out how to kick multiples of obviously hijacked Steam accounts, from the lobby. Chat boxes oftentimes fail, rendering in-game communication inoperable. Also, Multiplayer games are not automatically setup for Voice Chat. Players have to either setup Steam Voice Chat, on their own; or use utilize an outside Voice Chat service.There is no Shot-Clock to dictate a fair pace of play, which is part of the official rules of golf. Since there is no Simultaneous play option in this software... the lack of a Shot-Clock becomes a big deal, as multiplayer stroke games tend to run quite long; or at least, much longer than they conceivably should.It is not possible to convert a grouping to Custom difficulty settings. The difficulty settings chosen must fall under a default difficulty level. The alternative is to allow “Any” difficulty level to join the game; which creates obvious mismatches.The putter head is not at any time squared up at address. Not only that, but the putting itself seems to impart far more break than would realistically occur on similar greens, in real life. One of the most egregious issues, is the lack of Competitive Purpose, anywhere in the game. There is no Career Mode. There is no Official Tour. There are no Rated Multiplayer Games. There are no Win/Loss Records. There are no Experience Points. There aren't even any In-Game Statistics, nor any track-able Player Averages.While anyone can play or join Multiplayer games with and against other users; there is presently nothing whatsoever to play for.“Perfect Golf,” is like a less polished version of the Tiger Woods Golf series. A Poor Man's Tiger Woods Golf, if you will. It originally showed some promise. But, as of yet, there are too many game-breaking bugs, ongoing... as well as, occasional physics anomalies, and the glaring lack of any Competitive Purpose, whatsoever; which would compel any fair-minded individual to - in its current state - give it a thumbs down.

Product received for free
												I got this game for free as a birthday gift because I have been a fan of games like Mario Golf Toadstool Tour. It was a fantastic game in the pre-release and the core gameplay still stands. However, as soon as the end product was released the name ""Perfect Golf"" was changed to ""Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf"" and micro transactions were added. This seems to range from little things like shirts and pants for your character to golf courses. The prices for this adds up to $250 a year for a season pass?This game was originally $19.99 before release and now stands at $34.99. I was thinking $20 was too much... this is abysmal. A game developer cannot simply add a $250 microtransactions to a game (PER YEAR?!?) and price the game as $34.99. This is unacceptable. Total cash grab. I cannot believe my eyes.If this game were to get rid of it's microtransactions and put the price down to about $15 I would recommend it. However, as the current price stands, it is simply not worth the money.			"

												Not a chance...The game it self is quite good but it's more aimed to the ""Arcade"" fans but tries to pass it'self off as a game for the Sim golfers..Then they have gone and released it and the 1st thing they do is to add DLC's..So all the ""licenced"" courses will have to be paid for.. on top of the money you have paid for the game..Money grabbing♥♥♥♥♥♥bags!!!!PS.. You even have to BUY golf balls if you want better than bog standard.. and no. not in game cash.. $1 for the golf balls.. GTFO..So the 1 course you get that has a license.. Over $4 / £3... For 1 course ????No. No. No.Do the whole gaming industry a huge favour.. Boycott this money grabbing game and buy ""The Golf Club""The Golf Club in general is a far far far better game and has the best non paid commontator around.. (I think it's one of the devs and he is SOOOOO sarcastic at time.. You get +3 and he'll say some funny comment, make you laugh and you move on to the next..This is the poor mans version of The Golf Club.. so suck it up and go get that one instead.			"

Early Access Review
								Much like real golf, the things that are the most unrelated to golf are what cause the most frustrations.Happy to change my review later, but as of now the Alphaness of this game is just too frustrating to deal with. I mean, this is golf ... a game who's purpose and intent is to fill one's time with it's own inherent frustrations as a way of rejuvenating one's soul from the frustrations of day-to-day life. If I am frustrated in this game, it should be because the greens are fast and it's especially windy that day, not because my swing suddenly develops some kind of Charles Barkleyesque series of pauses and stutters for some unpredictable reason. That would be a sign that I should see a neurologist. Clean up the bugs and make this game run snappy and I'll be back, otherwise, I've paid for your dinner at the Olive Garden, enjoy.			"

												Rediculous! You want me to pay 150 bucks for a season pass? WTF? There is absolutely no depth to this golf game. No real way to judge the apropriate striking power for a good shot and the controls overall are just ""thick"" and ""clunky"". So disappointed, there is not even a career mode and no skill tree to follow or upgrade your golfer. No options to obtain newer better clubs or clothing, no sponserships, no, no, no, no!!!!!!!   NO!			"

Early Access Review
								Seriously guys,  I don't mean to be harsh,  but it's been along time since the launch of this gof game  and the game looks nothing like the original videos and screenshots that you presented us with before the game was released!I remember viewing a spectacular video of a mountain course with a beautiful waterfall and stream and to be honest with you,  the graphics in those videos are on par with 'The Golf Club',  but 'Perfect Golf' doesn't look anything like the videos or screenshots that Parellel Perfect portrayed their game to be, even when you look at the three screenshots on their homepage the graphics are not as good in the game!I am running the game on a 4k monitor at 3840x2160 using a Nvidia GTX 970 4GB OC and a i7 4970k @ 4.6Ghz with all the settings on high,  with the exception of changing the amount of trees in distance and detail.I was an old Links LS fan who played the golf sim from the very beginning when the first version of Microsoft Links was released rouglhy 20 years ago,   and Mike Jones who is one of the founding owners of Perfect Parellel use to design and sell the best DLC courses for Links LS,  and incidentally I owned everyone of Mike's courses.When I first came across the previews for 'Perfect Golf' and saw the screenshots,   I knew straight away it was Mike's work,  and I sent an email to him asking him about this new project.  I was extremely excited when Mike told me they were developing a new golf Sim for the PC similar to LinksLS,  and I was even more excited after viewing the screenshots on their website, as well as the amazing flyby video of a mountain course, and the actual hole had this amazing looking stream and waterfall, and the green sat on a small island! However, so far I am personally very dissapointed with Perfect Golf,  and it's not just the visuals,  but the way the game plays as a simulation!I'm sorry Mike,  even though it's still in developement,  it has taken far too long to produce a golf sim that's on par with 'The Golf Club',  and the reason my review is so harsh even though the game is still in development,  is simply because before the game was released,  the work in progress looked amazing, just like the screenshots and videos that are currently on your website.   If this work had already been developed,  how come the initial release didn't look as good as the pre developed work!Personally I think it's deceitful and dishonest to place work in progress shots that look amazing on your website and on the Greenlight section of Steam to gather as many followers and potential buyers for the game,   and when you finally release the game,  it looks nothing like the preview screenshots and videos!  The performance of the game is fine,  but really, it looks and plays like a cheap game, and yes I'm aware that it's still in development,  but as I said,  the work in progress should've been implemented into the game by now!The other important fact  is that eventually they will charge for additional courses and the course designer (Architect Application)!   Most people won't pay for additional courses,  when you have golf games like 'The Golf Club' that comes with the Greg Norman course designer and all courses a absolutely free!However,  if the Jones's can make Perfect Golf look amazingly perfect,  hardcore golf Simmers like myself will pay for quality, especially if the courses are designed by Mike!Perfect Golf should be perfect by now,  but it is far from being perfect!If you guys at Perfect Parellel want to dominate the Golf Sim market,  you need to deliver what you originally presented ASAP,  before the interest dies off.I won't give up on Mike and his team at Perfect Parellel,   simply because I know they have the potential to make the best Golf Sim on the market!  I will continue to check on the progress of  Perfect Golf from time to time to see if it does deliver what it was set out to in the first place!Hopefully one day,  the visuals and the game play I saw on  Perfect Parallel's website will be implemented into 'Perfect Golf',  and it may very well become the perfect golf Simulator!

Product received for free
												Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf features, to borrow words from one of their devs/fanboys, quite possibly the worst communicated season/annual pass and microtransaction systems that I've ever seen.Not once on any store front or this very page on Steam is it explained that the season pass is NOT for the majority of Steam gamers even though this is very clearly a Steam game. Players who enjoy the game and would consider the season pass on the basis that they want the next twelve months worth of content (an annual basis) are left to make the decision to pump $200-ish into the game without any knowledge that they wont get any benefit from it.Steam users have become accustomed to purchasing season passes to their games that are detailed and communicated professionally to the point that that they know what they are going to receive for their money before purchase. They are not thrown into the deep end and face a high priced annual pass that they have little to no way of knowing what they are getting let alone whether the investment is the right one for them -- which it really isn't going to be for a significant percentage of your Steam player base. For those that do fit the bill, you're right, it is a bit of a bargain (ELI5 - other golfing simulation software that serves a very niche audience are generally priced in the vicinity of $1000+ and occasionally upwards of five times that so in effect the devs have made the market much more accessible). Although I have had positive communication with ONE member of your team the others that have contacted me along with your fanboys have been quite aggressive. This aggressiveness has reached the point of almost being considered criminally abusive. I have personally elected not to respond in kind. In fact, I argue that silence in this instance is the appropriate response. PERFECT PARALLEL, Your game may be one of the most playable golf sims on the market but your behavior and inexcusably woeful communication abilities are the overriding reason why the game suffers such a mediocre review score on Steam. Perhaps if you improved your communication skills your player base would have a much better idea - anything is better than none - of what they are actually criticizing you for. There's a reason why all but one of the most 'helpful' reviews of your game on the front page, as of writing, are thumbs down.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played golf for over 25 years. Also, I've been playing the best golf-sim till now, the RTS swing in Links 2003. I thought it would be impossible to better that. Other games, like Tiger Woods, WGT or The Golf Club have lot's of glitch 'n glossy of course, but they don't have that 1 definitive thing: a true golf swing. It's just not there. And that is what a lot of people have been waiting for: the true dynamics that go with immerging yourself in a virtual golfing environment. Swing plane, swing tempo, clubface angles, it's all there. And more. Much more.But it's here now! For the very first time, we now have 'The Motion Swing' in Perfect Golf. A true masterpiece of computer engineering. After spending a couple of hours on the driving range in PG, I've started mastering this great simulation. Everything is there, albeit in embryonic phase, not polished and glitchy yet, but it's there! AND it works beautifully. For every golfer out there, real or otherwise, Perfect Golf is going to be your game, I garantee it.Once you get past The Motion Swing (3-click is also on board for the diehards) you'll discover courses and other options to keep you happy for ever. Not right now of course, the game is being build as I write this, but in the coming months PG is going to become the new standard in simulation golf. One reason for this, is because it has a man on board who has been at the forefront of golfcourse design: Mr Mike Jones. A one time golfpro himself, he started dabbling in PC golf years ago, and ultimately became a major force is this departement. It helps if you KNOW what the game is all about.A sublime golf swing, real weather simulation, all kinds of gameplay, on- and offline, courses come to life with moving objects like trees, water etc, Perfect Golf is going to be everything golfing adepts have been waiting for. All we now have to do is wait for it's completion.			"

												If I was given a demo vs ea and I had to say weather I would buy it or not, I would have to say no. Here are just a few reasons why;Graphics are sub standard, washed out, no real definition, like someone else said ""Links 2003 looks better"" Which brings me to atmosphere, it just doesn't feel like I just steped out one a 18 hole course. No career mode. I think that speaks for it's self. What sports game comes with no career?Game mechinics; while it seems to work ok in mouse mode, the controler is at best week. example, push left anolog stick once you get a stick one the course you can use for directions, push it again and you are able to see on the little map the distance and direction to the pin, sounds great till you have to move the curser from 3 holes over just to get it back to the hole your on. And it must be done everyhole or your shoting blind.Must reset my controler everytime I play. (really?)All in all combersome game play, substandard graphics, no career, and now DLC for the courses we asked for in the first place(making it appear as a money suck) As it is right now I say no and I am very diapointed in the final product and would not recomend			"

												What is it with golf games on the PC these days? The PC used to be the home of golf games, these days the available library of golf games on PC are a joke.The problem with this game is the same as the problem with ""the other"" one (The Golf Club), the swing mechanics are inconsistent. Golf is a game of consistency and finesse, especially on the green. The control system in this game doesn't allow for either of those things. Having said that, I'm referring to the motion swing mechanics as I'm not a fan of the 3 click method.If you really want a good golf game on PC and you're not too fussed about graphics, Links 2003 is still available and is pretty much the only worthwhile golf game on the platform right now. Don't waste your money on this, it would be better spent on an actual round of golf.			"

												Not a terrible golf game, but there`s a number issues that prevent me from recommending it. 1. No career mode. Unforgiveable IMO. Without it the game gets OLD very fast.2. Even with it`s simplistic graphics the game is a resource hog due to it`s terribly optimized game engine.3.Overpriced add on courses.4.Sterile, boring game environment with very little ambient sounds.5.Bugs galore. On Windows 10 it can be annoying, but if you`re using Linux don`t even bother  it`s virtually unplayable.6. A developer who begs people on their forums to post positive reviews on Steam because of all the negative reviews it`s been getting instead of just fixing the game.			"

												Warning!Wow, with all the years and development since Links and Tiger Woods, I expected a visually stunning game. This game is destined for the bargain bin. I feel sorry for Jack Nicklaus that his name is attached. Putting model is diabolical (multiple instances of the ball stopping at 0 inches from hole from a short putt) No appreciable interaction with the course (trees are no obstacle) Player animation is from the original Links 98 (not fair Links 98 was better)SAVE your money, do not purchase!

												Have played golf games for years. Played the Jack Nicklaus golf game years back and made some custom stuff for it. I got excited when I saw this game and bought it right away. It has to be the most confusing game I've ever purchased and I'm very good with computers and played many different types of games for years. While I understand this is an indie game, there has to be SOME documenation or direction on how to play. I couldn't get a golfer to actually make one shot. The meter goes as I click it, but the golfer doesn't do anything. Tried moving my mouse around..nothing. Also can't figure out how to add a computer golfer to play a round. A lot more thought and effort needs to put into the helping the consumer know how to use their product. It's too bad as visually it looks ok.The only thing I know how to do this game is request a refund. I would avoid this product if your are looking for a game you can just pick up and have a nice game of golf.			"

								Lack of instruction..Meter jerky.Needing to adjust graphics per course.,I see the participation has dropped quickly.course forge? why are the elitist folks getting such a head start in course creation.clearly courses are being made. why is this being held back?now you can cheat in this game?some of the certainties in the life of this game... a private beta tester will take every chance given to let the lobby and forums know their special testers.unless of course when it comes to taking blame for all the mistakes that get poassed them,the time one sits in the game lobby counts as time played in the game total.. I see many folks sit and do nothing as they sleep in the game lobby piling up hours of noted game time as if it means anything.course forge is being used to create mostly playable courses. yet it's not ready for release to the public?talk about getting left behind in early access.still no course forge? April of 2016.  It's that time of year when golf season starts and the dev's will be busy doing other things rather than fix the bugs.I see the developer of this game is friends with known cheater ""crusher"" .. seems about right.goes to show the integrity of this game.

												No way is it worth the price, even if you buy from elsewhere rather than steam. Still a bit buggy. Playable, fun for a while, but the ruination and damning thing is they want micro-transactions. Haven't seen this since the TW Masters Online fiasco a few years back from EA. Why can't we buy cool new gear/clothes  when we level up from hard earned in-game winnings like all decent golf games ?All the Tiger Woods games apart from the Masters are just as good, more polished and are more fun than this. Glad i got into this way back in Alpha as i would never buy such a lame duck.If you want to buy when no other golf is available, go ahead during a sale. You will enjoy it for a time, but bigger better golf is on the horizon...			"

												Update: Even with a new machine and renewed attitude, this game still sucks a big pair of Golden Bear nuts.This game is so realistic, it will make you rather play the real thing than stumble through this confusing ""reality"" rich pre-pre-alpha.I've tried to give this game several chances, but upon playing the latest build of the game I give up, for now.I'll probably be back after a few updates, but to the average or casual gamer, this is not the game you're looking for.Inexplicable crashes, buggy graphics, and only ONE character model (which is hideously ugly) make this feel like a rushed, empty shell of a game waiting for content. A visit to the poorly designed and buggy developer website only made me feel like this game doesn't have a future.Micro-transactions seem to be the ultimate goal here with their confusing ""Season Pass"" and one ball that you can buy. I'm not spending anymore money to think I'm helping make an unplayable game more playable. I've experimented with all swing styles presented in the game, and again, without taking the time to suffer through the learning curve (putting is the worst) you will never feel you've gotten anything out of this game.This is more of a ""reality golf simulator"" than a golf video game. The reason successful sports games become successful is they often find engaging ways to make the player feel they are doing better, or making an impossible shot possible.I'm sure someone will get on me that ""THIS GAME ISN'T FINISHED"" and to give it a chance later (which I will) this is more of a shining example of reasons we as a community should stop this wave of pre-alpha games from mudding up and getting mixed in with finished games. Since when did unfinished products get a green light to be rushed to consumers? Basically you are paying to test an un-fun real life golf simulation. I'd rather just go play golf, it has fresh air, exercise and sexy beer cart girls.			"

												TL;DR Gameplay is pretty fun, but the potential for lots of micro-transactions (new maps) may ruin the game for some.PROS- Gameplay is fun- Controls are pretty goodCONS- Microtransations- Feels overpriced- Graphics are fairly poor by today's standardsThe game itself plays pretty nicely. At $20 during early access, I would say it was worth it. But at $35, plus microtransations - no. Time to move on and wait for a proper golf game on the PC.			"

								Not recommended. They need to fix the swing, either it is motion swing or power meter.  The motion swing should be the best simulation for golf swing as you can control the speed or power with your mouse just like real golfing. At present, only the power meter is working for the long shot, but not those chipping or sand. Way out of control for close range, If you expect this game to be similar to title likes tigerwoods or PGA gameplay, you will be in for disappointment. I should have wait for the ""Real"" perfect golf.			"

								At this point in development, 1/27/15 the game is lacking in the control department.  If you are coming from Tiger Woods series or Golf Club you will have a steep learning curve.  You can get the hang of it but why try so hard when there other options to play.. to be honest I rage quit (while trying the motion swing) this game and went back to Tiger Woods 08.. The only reasonable control scheme at the moment is the 3 click in this game.. The graphics are ok.. I assume they will get better, overall I'd rate this game a 5 out of 10 until further development fixes problems and the odd nuances.			"

												I wish I could recommend the game overall - I'm very conflicted about it.The graphics are so old and basic looking - Looks ok from a distance, but when you're playing it's very poor.The actual golf game play is probably the best of all options right now if you focus solely on the swing options, physics, ball spin, wind impacts and so forth.  Also, a multiplayer lobby and a multitude of game modes are great to see, but sadly no career mode or ""pro mode"" or anything like that.But there also are endless strange bugs and interface weirdness, especially using a controller (which is the newest way to play, so hopefully that gets worked on more).The main hangup is the old looking graphics.  The game has no grass, really basic looking water, trees with an odd sort of sheen look to them (something weird about how they look especially in the distance) and overall just appears to my gaming eyes like something you might have thought ""looked great"" in the early to mid 2000's.  Now I'm used to such a higher bar of quality in most every other game, genre and platform, that it is really hard to look at and enjoy for me.  It's all just flat textures draped all over for the most part.  Thumbs down on that for sure.I guess if you can get past the really old looking graphics, it's a great game of golf. But for me I can not do a ""recommend"" on it with graphics this behind the times.  Being on a golf course involves natural beauty and graphics quality is a main part of this type of games' appeal to me....and perfect golf lacks in this area big time.			"

								Since the death of Tiger Woods Online we've been yearning for a replacement. Perfect Golf suddenly appeared on the horizon promising unrivalled visauals and gameplay. After ages in development we finally have a playable version. Anyone hoping for a Tiger replacement are going to be very upset. One word sums this mess up, tragic! It is truely aweful, gloomy dark looking visuals, golf ball looks like a grey blob, no ball textures at all, no background sounds, confusing club selection, no tab to as we're all used to, it's a mess. I realise it's early access but is this some kind of joke? It looks like it's been in developement for a couple of days, let alone years! The bones are there but that's about it, the devs need to seriously look at the future of this, forget the glorious youtube vids, it looks nothing like that, back to the drawing board or give it up, it's that bad!

Early Access Review
								UPDATED 2-20-16 To potential buyers, be warned that the developrs have askd for poeple to post reviews. So the flood of recent reviews stem from that request.Even with the latest updates this game still has a long way too go. The RTS mouse swing isn't as good as PGA2k, TW series or CPG/WGC. It just has no feel, you have no idea what went wrong when the swing motion that just worked fine now sends your shot shanked off into the woods or a hazard. Ball physics are still unrealistic. This game is more frustrating to play than real golf a lot of the time.  I would love to say yeah buy it. But if you do just know there is still a ways to go yet.Recommend this game? yes with a caveat. It is FAR from ""Perfect"" Golf. ball physics are terrible, putting is unrealistic, motion swing isn't real-time or tied to the golfer, wind has no effect, multiplayer has issues. Graphics are good (not as good as The Golf Club, better than World Golf Challenge 2011, the other 2 golf games I play).The other caveat is to play this (and most new games) you'll need CPU and video card horsepower to run  it at high graphic settings. Basically this is Links 2003 updated to a 2009-ish game. If you like Links 2003 you'll really like PG. For those of us who like a golf game with a real-time mouse swing buy this early access release and see if the improvements over time make it better. $20 isn't a deal breaker. Right now I've stopped playing it and will try it again in a month or so to see if any improvements have been made.UPDATE 8-13-16many patches later this game still has issues. Latest patch introduces some ""anti-cheat"" into the software. So if you make a number of good swings the game says ""must be cheating, using some outside swing aid on the mouse"" and then will cause a mis-hit resulting in an errant shot. So you get penalized for honing a swing?!?Ball physics still not realistic. Lob Wedge  shot lands, kicks forward?? no back spin? Yet out of the rough or sand ball checks up and spins back.They really need to bring back the original programmers who initially did the game so the code that keeps getting broken with every patch can be fixed. but given so many have now worked on the code, it's probably really messed up for good and needs a complete rewrite.So still can't recommend this game, just be aware of all the faults if you do decide to buy			"

												1-4-17: Overall rating is mixed with only 64% positive, last rating 65% 1 before 66%, 1 before that 68% as this game continues to plummet.The continued ignorance of the detestible Mike Jones and the total mis-management of this game are making it a shambles, as more and more haters pile-on to it with bad, bad reviews every week!Mike Jones had no right and no reason to delete my entire profile - he just didn't like it, and what is the -100 all about on my reputation score when it was at 93, just utterly peevish and child like behavior from Mike Jones.. Mike Jones also had no right and no reason for putting me on mod queue for pointing out St Andrews as it stands is woefully inadequate as the supposed flagship course of the game, I put snapshots of the PP St Andrews up against photographs of exactly the same scenes and it is hugely obvious the texturing is nowhere near up to scratch and the bushes/ bramble are either non existent of have been done very very crudely indeed it's either an amateur job or a rush job (compare it to snapshots of Royal troon on their social site to see what is possible when done to a high level of design) - but again he just didn't like it, suddenly I was 'trolling' for saying what most of the top designers must surely have been thinking and instead of getting his honest opinion that I requeasted on St Andrews he immediately sabotaged my account and openly baited me in to writing a negative review on steam, not exactly a team player for the company!***I just want to add here - I actually tried to pursue his disgusting treatment of me to their public relations department giving a full account of what had happened to me and asking them to investigate the whole matter with a 3rd party from within the company - guess what they did? SHUT DOWN MY ENTIRE PROFILE SO IT WAS NON RETRIEVABLE no doubt to get rid of the evidence of sabotage!!! UNBELIEVABLE AND DRACONIAN TREATMENT OF A PAID UP CUSTOMER!!! just to check it was a result of my complaint I created a new temporary profile and resent the request for a 3rd party investigation - account completely shut down again.conclusion: - SO WE KNOW THEY (Perfect Parallel and it's employees, particularly Mike Jones) ARE SCUM, THEY OPERATE LIKE SCUM AND THEY SHOULD BE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY A CONSUMER WATCHDOG!!!!!!! ***But these observations have to be stated and addressed for the good of the game and it's standing in the future because proper course critics who do get commisioned to evaluate courses would laugh our St Andrews out of town - hands down they would it would get savaged in any magazine review for instance!! But that says a lot about Mike himself, the qualities of the man - he's peevish, if I wanted to say it more succinctly - he's a very awkward man with terrible judgement and limited scope - you get them usually as security officers and they have that regrettable nature about them, that's why they stand the gates 11 hours a night I suppose, but not nearly qualified for a position Mike Jones finds himself in. The management of this game is also woefully inadequate and the forum best exemplifies that - they have let 3 or 4 of the most unfortunate people run riot here and spoil it for the rest, and as The Golf Club starts up societies and captures the mass market this one has been left behind in the sticks through poor project planning and will end up nothing more than a backwater of a few gnarly old men who know their life is spent and have nothing better to do than henpeck all day. They are still stuck in a cycle of patching up and re patching up bugs and performance issues when they should really be doing time-cost-perceived benefit analysis, there are many soft-fixes that I can see that would result in a considerable perceived improvement to the game, but as it stands there does not appear to be any kind of project planning utilizing the most effective tools in this regard.In fact I percieve the game after a while away from it as actually being 'MORE BROKE' than it was over a year ago with the constantly disappearing swingmeter in 3 click mode standing out like a sore thumb, I mentioned it several times but got zero response from the team as they only seem to take the word of a few select. One of their very very top level designers I have chatted with has called it 'the clique' and described them as 'in their own world', and it has done absolutely nothing for the furtherment of the game over that time period I mentioned.Badly badly run indeed, I play it, play it a lot but I can't recommend it.

This game is on par  graphics-wise with JN6 (released 1998?), and plays less than well. I played 9 holes and promptly refunded my purchase.I recommend Tiger Woods Masters Edition for the best modern representation of golf out there.Avoid Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf. "

												After playing this game for 70 hours or more I can confirm that this game is a complete turd.Do not waste your money on this game.It has been in development for years now but it has not improved one bit at all.This game has failed in every way possible from the shoddy patching and unreal amount of payed dlc addons.I payed $20 for this game in early access and it was the worst $20 ive ever spent on a game.After numerous patches and fixes it will not even run on my pc anymore and it used to.Never felt so ripped off from any purchase on steam ever.Nevermind the fact that the devs banned me from the forums for kindly explaining my issues with the game.The devs do not know how to deal with criticism in a human like manor.Stay far away from this piece of crap do not waste your money on it. Its a complete joke of a game and always will be.The devs making this game have no clue how to properly implement patches that successfully fix anything.It will be a never ending turd for the rest of its life do not buy this nightmare of a game.The price has actually been raised for some unknown reason since the time that I bought it but this game isnt even worth a $1.00.As I said stay far away from this cancer.

I've got AI with a broken arm.  This is what months of testing has produced. crashing to desktop. This is what you get when a cheerleader tests this game. no matter how many mistakes the devs make.. the testers cheer um on!  I'm sure I'm the only one who noticed though with all those great reviews.the complete wussification of this game now that you can choose a controller that hits straight everytime. fanboydom runs rampant as the llollypop guild post positive reviews based on lies used in one sentence words at best. I notice the shine wearing off on this latest update as the flock of players is dwindling each day.a promise of being able to move the swing meter still not worked in any update... but we got to get dem divots in der!the devs are now trying to manipulate negative reviews so that they can not be updated.be aware! this is as low as it gets.If you need any proof.. contact me and I will provide you to a link...

								The game has huge potential and promise. Granted, the EA version has a few issues upon initial release but they are being caught by the new users and the Devs have a good list of things to work upon. That said, the game is beautifully playable offline and only limited today, by the online connections many games suffer from. It's best to begin offline anyway and play the game as it was made to be, a golf simulation. I wouldn't play a real golf course without learning how to hit a ball..! The graphics on my 4yr old system run fine. I'd love to improve them, but to ensure the game runs with a good frame rate, I opted to keep the graphics down. However, the view is good, I have no tears or glitches and the screenshots I've taken look great. I can play the game at fullscreen in 1920 x 1080, so everything is as I expect. Gameplay is almost spot on. It puts you in total control when playing using the 3 click system. The other control method is still being developed, so I'd expect that area to improve alot over the coming months. I won't comment any more on that, as I've not really tested it. This isn't like older or other golf games, it feels more Sim than Arcade. Granted it has a few elements that are needed to transfer anything simulated to a computer game, but they are minimal and necessary. Real Time Weather is pretty cool, and works a treat. The Time of Day setting is one of my favourite things, being able to visually see the sun rising or setting, and playing a twilight game has the good old feel of those summer evenings, with time on your side.  Currently the 5 courses are just about right. With the promise of many more to come, it will soon become a tough decision choosing what course to entangle yourself within. Plus of course the Course Forge (Designer) a little further down the road.  I'd certainly like to see alot more improvements, walking the hole, first person perspective to name a basic few. However, reading the forums and discussions from the Dev's have made it clear these guys want to deliver something similar too. It feels like a winner to me.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, a big thanks to the devs on bringing us this Early Access version of Perfect Golf. I'm running the game in windowed mode 1280x768 on a 5 year old laptop with AA on and Bloom on. Trees are set at 350, shadows 200, Grass 100 and camera view distance 1500. All things considered the game runs good apart from a few stutters here and there that I can live with and haven't yet affected the playability.Ball Physics: the team has done a wonderful job on the ball physics, especially after the latest update. I considered the ball physics in Links v1.07 to be one of the best I've seen in a golf game but in PG they've taken it to another level of realism. Sure, there is still some work to be done but having played a few different golf games this is the best I've experienced as yet .......BUT .... while I feel that tee to green the devs have created up to now the best simulation of real golf yet seen in a computer game, I do feel an element of realism is then lost with the putting model. To help explain this I should point out I am a novice real life golfer, having only played the game for around 18 months. So it is fresh in my mind what it is like to be a beginner and having to learn the game. I feel a simulation should have the same sort of difficulties and learning curve with all aids off as the real thing. That may also mean I'll never be able to shoot under par for a round as in real life. A par on a hole should feel like an achievement. Unfortunately the putting model destroys this sense of achievement because it feels like I have too much help. Sometimes I misjudge my long putts on a real course massively - and that never seems to happen to me in PG due to the putting meter. And sometimes in real life I've putted from the fairway just off the green and given too much power and ended up off the other side of the green. I can't seem to do that in PG as my power is limited by the meter.My suggestion - a straight swing bar that follows the movement of the mouse. The putter head placed two thirds down the bar with movement then for back swing and power and length of follow through for movement. Putting aids can be markings on the bar to help judge distance but true simulation mode with no aids would be with no markings and just from feel as in real golf. Don't know if something like this is possible. It would mean that by selecting a putter the graphic would automatically switch from an arcing swing meter to a straight putting bar. In simulation mode full back swing (of course restricted to a point) and full, fast follow through would always result in a maximum power putt.A free roam mode would be nice, even if it was only restricted to a 20 or 30 yard zone around the golfers position, to allow for better planning of shots like in real golf when views are restricted. Of course, these restricted views should also be set to golfers eye level for realism.Look forward to future update improvements and hopefully more courses. Great job so far and the closest to a simulation of the game I've yet to play.			"

I think they tried to do too much, like linking my realtime weather with the game's weather, why would you do that?Overall I really was looking forward to playing some relaxing golf. I hit some balls and turned it off. The game lacks something. Not an enjoyable experience.			"

I've seen and played better golf games a decade old. Don't care if you think I don't play it long enough. I had it set to max settings, running on a beast machine, and it looked like F2P mobile game for an iPad. I'd like to play Torrey Pines please...oh wait. Augusta? Riviera? Pebble?...no?

								Terrible!It's not a golf game, it's a shell of a golf game with no internals. There is no AI, no season/career options, no stats, no tournament play. You can play a round against yourself or an online opponent and that's it! Graphics are average but it does however still require serious PC juice to run. Menus are few because there are no real features that require menus. Visually the menus have a very simplistic layout and are certainly not intuitive to navigate. There are no great new features in Perfect Golf that other golf games don't have. The features it does have are nothing new and are extremely basic with many bugs/issues.You would think the developers would do something great with one of the most important areas of any golf game, the swing meter! Well, no, it's as basic as you can get! I like to click. You have some very basic difficulty settings you can adjust for the game difficulty and that's the end of the swing meter feature list. There is no option to change the swing meter speed to something of your liking. There is no option to add markers to the meter. The meter links to the graphics engine so if you don't have a silky smooth running game, you also won't have a silky smooth meter making it impossible to play. These are simple meter options golf games over a decade old provided. Perfect Golf gives you the most simplistic of meters with virtually no options to tailor it. If you use the mouse method for swing, same deal, extremely basic with little to no control. There is not even a horizontal mouse swing option! There is no feedback on how well you did with your swing as in Tiger Woods games so you never know what area of your swing needs work.Considering how little of a golf sim Perfect Golf provides, you would think the developers would nail what has been done before in golf games and improve upon those features. No such luck! Here we have first time developers and it shows in every bland detail of the game! One final example to leave you with. The game contains a follow the ball in flight option same as a ball-cam from the Tiger Woods games. In Tiger Woods the camera follows the ball through flight and as it hits the ground the camera smoothly follows behind the ball as it bounces and comes to a stop. In Perfect Golf, as the ball hits the ground, the camera bounces along with the ball! The entire screen jumps up and down. Talk about annoying! Talk about motion sickness! Talk about the feeling you are playing arcade golf! You find youself expecting the golf ball to explode or some dude to come out from behind a tree and start shooting at you every time your shot hits the deck!It's an early access game but it's not too difficult to see a game that no amount of time and patching will help ever become a good one. Complete waste of money and time!			"

												EDIT: Review changed in 9/16 to reflect a lack of progress in providing features that were supposed to be in the release. Specifically, the course designer for PG has been long discussed and was supposed to be in the game on release. 4 months later it's still not there. Beyond the course designer, there still is no career mode. The game still has performance issues. There still is limited character customization, no announcers, very limited stats, poor UI, etc. Essentially almost NONE of the negatives have been fixed even though many of those things have been promised. Thus I can't recommend the game because I don't see tangible progress in improving the product. -----I've been arounds since PG's failed kickstarter. I bought the game as soon as it came out on Early Access. However, that doesn't make me a fan. It makes me a fan of golf games. PG does some things right. It does some things wrong. Because it's a mixed bag, it's easier to list what is good and what's bad about it. As always, YMMV.Pros:- numerous swing type options - there are multiple though I'm a three clicker all the way and very impressed by the smoothness of the meter. The mouse swing is challenging. They've tried to implement no-cheating modes but they broke the mouse swing while doing so.- various levels of challenge - play this with all the aids on and you'll be in birdie city. Play this without them and you might be lucky to break 90. I'm not nearly as good as I once was, but at one point I was in the top 10 on Case's Ladder on Links and #1 on another ladder. So I'm glad it's challenging rather than the ""Shoot 48 at Augusta on Tiger Woods"" mode.- good physics - I'm still not happy with the backspin but generally the physics are good and better than any other golf game. Backspin still is off and I generate more backspin on my short irons (and I shoot in the 90s) than my avatar in this game. Other than that they're spot on. For instance, if you play a course at higher elevation the ball will travel further. That's a nice touch.- weather / time of day settings can add some real challenge to your game. I think the wind feels spot-on.- many different courses to choose from and quite a few to download- multiple modes of gameplay, including solo, multiplayer and tournaments with match play, team play, alt shot, etc.- no micro-transactions that improve your game- no stupid characters that drive the ball 400 yards. Over-driving distance ruins so many golf games and they've prevented that here.Cons:- no career mode built into the game yet- course designer hasn't been released yet (it's now 4 months late and counting)- I don't like the way the skies look and the trees can look a little jagged- limited current player animations (no lefties, no females yet though they're coming)- very,very, very limited character customization- it requires a decent computer and user made courses don't always run well. In fact, the user made courses often exceed the RAM allowance in the game causing major problems from a chunky swing meter to crashing.- slightly too limited shot shaping options. I wish I could position my swing path and feet differently to get inventive when shotmaking. - very limited stats- no announcer and limited sound effects- no Steam Workshop integration (a cardinal sin for a game with downloadable courses)- really poor and frankly butt-ugly user interface when you enter the game (though it's fine when actually playing a round)So it's up to you whether to buy it. I can tell you it's a better game than that ""other"" golf game on Steam and probably the best one available on the market today. But it's by no means perfect yet (pun intended) and while I had hoped that many of the cons would be fixed, this doesn't seem to be happening. The product feels more and more abandoned with a lack of substantial progress since release. If you want a golf game now, this is the one to buy becuase frankly it's probably your only decent choice. Since I'm a fan of the old Links games and golf games in general so I continue to load up PG from time to time. But if you aren't a golf nut, this game isn't for you because it's just too limited in the features and progress to appeal to a wider audience.			"

												They have a long ways to go with this game. The lower I set the AI's abilities his shots just get better and better. With all ability settings on the lowest value (""1"") he repeatedly drives within feet of the hole. With the greens settings at ""easy"" the undulation of the turf reminds one of the swells on the Bering Sea--with radical pitches and slopes. On some holes you might think you were playing mini-golf because the cup actually sits atop a mound. The AI makes improbable shots from the tee, from the fairways, and on the greens. To be fair the AI shots are sometimes what you would expect at a setting of ""1""--but then there's those ""wow"" shots. Very inconsistent. Also, there is no way to ""save"" your preferred settings from one session to the next. Each play time requires that you re-set everything to your preferences. Also, some graphics are below ""par"" (pardon the pun). I cringe everytime I look at the deformed wrists of the avatars. It looks painful!On the positive side, the scenery is very pleasant.I won't play this game for a month or so. Maybe there will be some significant improvements by then?I will recommend this game based on the chance that the short-comings may get fixed.--------------------------------UPDATE: PC games should be fun even if they are challenging. This game is NOT fun. It is NOT relaxing NOR can it be enjoyed! If you want FRUSTRATION then this is your game. Nothing has improved. The inconsistencies are the only constant. Hit a shot ahead of the ""dead center"" line and watch your ball slice wildly! Your best guess as to how to make your putt will never be correct. The ""easiest"" settings are NOT easy. If you want to be AGGRAVATED buy this game. Do NOT believe the PC Gaming review. If this game is still in development why are they charging $34.95!? I'm terrible at real golf and I have allergies that are exacerbated by grass on the fairways and greens; but still real golf is less frustrating and a lot more fun than this game. At least in real golf I know that everytime I hit the ball it's gonna go right!			"

												I want to like this game. It is beautiful and it appears to have a good physics engine. But the UI is atrocious and extremely aggravating. It is hard to see how far shots will go, the lay of the green, how to control shots - everything is a pain to figure out. This feels half-baked but there is a great game underneath this horrible, aggravating, good-for-nothing user interface.			"

								This IS NOT Tiger Woods, and it doesnt promise to be. The lack of controller support makes the game completely unplayable from your couch. This is a golf SIM, not a casual golf game. If you attempt to use your mouse with motion swing, your ball will fly left every time. The graphics are sub-par at best which is unfortunate. If you have played golf games before, this one is VERY easy to pick up and start playing. Very simplistic. I didnt want another Tiger Woods game. I was however, hoping that some of the positives that made those games so much fun would be incorporated in this. Who knows, its early access. I hope the DEVS have everyone in mind while making this game. Not just the die had golfer, but the casual gamer/EA fans as well. Controller support would go a long way in making this game more fun, lets get that done quick. Looking forward to seeing the completed game. "

								This game is no where near what was advertised... Photorealistic courses... nope... motion swing controls... so sensitive as to be unusable... three click controls... wow just wow, so sensitive that any little sliver outside the normal results in the ball taking a slice or hook so terrible that the ball travels miles off course... I'm a decent golfer and have been playing golf games since the early 90s. This game is just not worth it at this stage. They have way too much to do to it and I don't know where they got the screen shots and videos from, but the look and feel of the game was straight up terrible... and clunky... that's the term... clunky.

												I have been playing this for a while now . When you get it you have to find the best settings for your system . Graphics level , camera views , etc. You can pick the clubs you want to use . It looks like they may have custom add on clubs and cloths in the future too . You will have to play for a while to see what settings you like for game play . Try out the different difficulty levels and see what you like to swing with . Mouse or click . Lots of different settings to play with .I have downloaded many courses from the website . Users also have courses made and most are free and pretty fun . I downloaded 2 different par 3 courses that are a blast and fun to learn your short game on . This game is fun and well worth it considering all the courses you can get . There are some pay courses too . I will probably try one of those out too . Can it do everything Links386 did , no . Is this game fun , YES . It gets updates and we just got a free new course called Rio .UPDATE Feb 23 , 2017I waited long enough for this game to get fixed . The more they fix bugs and tweek it the worse it gets . The guy developing this doesnt know his♥♥♥♥♥♥from a hole on a green . Why Jack would even allow his name on it is beyond me . This is not a simulator like some might say . Its not even as good as Links 386pro made 20 years ago except for graphics . Options are just not there .  When its not laggy it is fun but when its laggy it really screws up the swing with the 3 click method . Ball flight is not smooth either . This was taken out of beta and does not work properly for everyone . Developer doesnt seem to think there is a problem so I take anything good I said about this game and call it plain crap . One day maybe someone that knows what their doing will create another great game like links 386 with all the options . I gave it a chance . Sorry Snowflake . If you buy this make sure you have a super computer .Update March 14 , 2017Just contacted Jack Nicklaus with an email . Waiting for response as to why he would put his name on this crappy game which was one reason why I bought it . Guess he isnt bankrolling it or it wouldnt be so lousy . Cant wait for an answer .			"

								I've been looking for a pc golf game to play since it looks like the big studios have abandoned them. Really think I've hit the jackpot here. The game isn't super easy but also it's not so hard you just want to stop playing. I only play 3 click but thank God they didn't try to reinvent the wheel here. Click to start click at 12 and click at 6. As far as I can tell so far the speed doesn't change between difficulties on clicking just the margin of error on the final click at 6. Haven't jumped into a multiplayer game yet but the times I've been on the lobby looks to have a good number of people in it. Just an all around great game.			"

								Hands down the best golf simulation ever created. Things that seperates itself from other games:-A real time physics engine combined with real ball flight data(launch angles, spin rates and ball speeds) taken from launch monitors put this game in a class of it's own. Once you experience the before mentioned there really is no going back to other golf games.-The Motion Swing mouse mechanic is a first of it's kind that introduces D plane swing theory. What is D plane theory and how does it realate to the mouse? Well, the simplified answer is the tracking of the actual swing path plus the tracking of the clubface angle. Your swing path is determined by the direction you move the mouse and the clubface angle is determined by the tempo at which you move your mouse.-A real time weather and lighting system allow you to input a geographic location and play in those weather and lighting conditions. Never before has a golf game recreated weather and lighting conditions like this game. The lighting and shadow effects are exceptional and really change the look and feel of a course. You can even play in a thunder and lightning storm. Even though you wouldn't do this in real life it's worth doing in PG just to see the lightning effects.-The last thing worth mentioning, and maybe the most important is, this may be the first game to offer up realistic scores in competition. I see no way to shoot in the 50's on a consistent basis, especially with aids turned off. I see scores being very close to real life, maybe even higher. Since tempo plays such a high role in the swing, straight edging or trying to zero out the x axis on the mouse is not going to get your far. Also, since the game uses a real time physics engine to determine spin you can't put artificial spin on the ball and throw darts at every flag.$20 for this game is a steal. Buying it now will save you $10 to $15 when it goes retail. Once the course forge is released with the retail version and courses start pouring in, there will be no reason to even talk about another golf game. The potential this game has is limitless. If done right, this could be one of the greatest sports sims ever created.			"

								Well 58 hours into this game and I am surprised and delighted with it, an exceptional program for a test release.I was a Tiger Woods player from the very first and enjoyed each version and I have a strong liking to the three click swing meter.I think many who do not like this game are still committed to the unusually low scores attainable in the TW range. Even I had my 15/20 under par rounds at St. Andrews. The swing meter has sever punishment for a pulled or pushed shot, but this only encourages me to take more care on the third click.I have only played the easier settings but the wind seems to have little effect on the flight of the ball.At times the roll seems excessive especially on the fairway slopes.The graphics and ambient surround sound have an exceptional quality.I have experienced two bugs, one irrelevant and the other annoying.(a) : At times the lower half of the players legs disappear in the bunker.(b) : The program freezes after a final putt is made and there is noway to restart the program or PC except to reboot. When the PC is rebooted the game continues from where it froze. This has happened on about six games to date.I am convinced that if this program continues and expands as it has begun it will be an extremely addictive game to play.Anticipating the future.			"

								I love golf games and Perfect Golf seemed very promising. But if you are used to golf games like tigers woods, you will have a hard time adapting to this game. The physics engine is very hard to predict and it lacks alot of things that tiger woods games did very well. All in all, I really do not think $20 is worth it. The game has a big learning curve, and maybe it is rewarding to learn it, but the game is just kinda boring. I understand it is an indie game and still is in its early stages. But even still, a 20 dollar price tag is a bit too much.5/10			"

The recent update has added some eye candy with little things like divots and tee pegs flying up, small but quite important for a golf simulator.I have played golf games since Leaderboard days over 20 years ago and for the current £15 cost, if you are a person looking for a true golf sim that will test you, with user designed courses now being available, free course designer to come...Perfect Golf is for you.Couple that with a great Tour event host at onlinegolftour.net  ...there are busy times on the course ahead.

So far this is the most realistic golf game I played in a while.However, a few items are missing from the beta:-	A career mode-	Easier options to choose a flop, punch shots.  When you are in the rough on the other side of a bunker you should still have a loft option.-	Bots to play match-play against.  Not always possible to complete an 18 hole match play against real people.  Against bots you can play a few holes at a time until the game is complete.Really looking forward to the final version of the game. "

								I have been playing Tiger Woods '08 PC on a regular basis since it came out back in 2007.  No modern golf game has come close.  That is until PerfectGolf was released.  The graphics are top notch and very realistic.  You can see all of the undulations and slopes on the fairways/greens very clearly unlike some golf games.  The addition of trees and bushes from SpeedTree last year improved the visuals a great deal.  The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s Turf Effects tool.The newly implemented Real Time Swing for controller and mouse has enhanced the game immeasurably in addition to the availability to download fine user made courses (around 24 available as of the date of this review).  That brings the current number of stock and user made courses up to around 37, a number no other modern golf game can touch.  These course numbers will continue to grow and grow once the CourseForge tool comes out and also once the developers start making licensed courses available.  Online play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to tee off with up to 8 players.  You can stop and resume your round at a later time.  There are loads of different play modes available in PerfectGolf.  If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online as well as ones on onlinegolftour.net.  The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last shot from a number of different angles.  Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.Another big plus for PerfectGolf is the freecam mode which allows you to more effectively read putts and scope out your next shot, even while your online opponent is getting ready to hit.  Take a virtual tour of the entire course from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.PerfectGolf has lived up to its potential as superb golf simulation.  Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month.  This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come.  Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.  "

								Thanks Perfect Golf staff for what is in my opinion going to be the best golf sim ever. The physics while still being tweaked in this EA version are awesome. The game can challenge you as much as you want which is a great thing. Golf is a game with so many variables and this game really brings that to life. You can dribble a ball off the tee or bust it 300 yards down the middle. All dependent on the quality of the swing you make. Just looking forward to how this game improves with the final version and all the courses that will be released. I couldn't imagine a better start a golf sim than what these guys have given us with the hard work they have put in.

								Haven't played a golf game in quite a while. Although used to play the Links games a lot, which this reminded me of. It looks lovely and offers what I always wanted in a golf game visually and physically.Little things like the player model clipping through severe slopes and clubs not being obviously accessible can be overlooked at this stage because the core of the game works well enough. There were very minor visual things that actually bothered me. The courses look wonderful, and the ball physics are pretty close to spot on which swayed me to buy it. My only real gripe is I'd like a fixed player camera, having the camera zoom in on the ball after impact gets a bit annoying after every shot.Right now I'd recommend it because if this turns out to have its own easy to use course editor/creator, and has all of the important tweaks and suggestions addressed, then right now for a golf sim, it is a total steal. Looking forward to seeing what comes from this!			"

Early Access Review
								I've been playing golf and computer games for about 25 years now, ever since I was about seven years old, so I feel reasonably qualified to comment on something that combines the two.The early access of Perfect Golf is a fantastic start and the devs appear to have every motivation to bring the game to full fruition. Unlike many early access titles, the devs at Perfect Golf aren't promising heaven and earth just to get people's money but they are promising to create a great golf sim for real golfers, something I firmly believe they are very capable of delivering.The current basic build is solid and enjoyable enough to hint at what is to come. Of course it has some bugs and it is missing many features and some areas require polish but these are all being identified and dealt with systematically and professionally as far as I can tell.For anyone looking to buy this game in its current form, note that it does not yet have the following features which some may want to wait for:- Computer opponents- Career mode- Golfer appearance customisation- Statistics and TrackingI would also say that, while the game looks very nice on my machine in ultra high detail at 1080p (you need a proper gaming graphics card here by the way), the golfer animation could be doing with being more fluid and the feeling more solid when the ball is struck or impacts the turf. It just feels a little floaty at this point with the golfer, terrain and ball all having a slightly disconnected feel. Additionally, the wind conditions seem to have no effect on the trees or flag; at 50mph the trees move identically to when the wind is at 10mph.On the other hand, the in flight ball physics are awesome and the mouse control ""motionswing"" mechanic is brilliant and is easily the closest feel to a real golf swing that I've experienced in a PC golf game. This mechanism puts the onus on the tempo and rhythm of your swing rather than just how straight you can move the mouse back and through (anyone remember table edging?). Downswing too fast and the ball is going left, too slow and it's going right, similar to real golf. If you let the pressure get to you and you lose your tempo, you're in trouble, just like real golf.Also, the real time weather and sky conditions make everything feel a lot more realistic and help with immersion.At this point there are no computer opponents and no sort of career mode but these are planned. Additionally, there is no golfer or gear customisation beyond being able to select which 14 clubs you want in your bag.If you are a new starter (or even if you're not), here are my top ten tips for bringing down your scoring and increasing your enjoyment of the game:1) go to options and change the camera to track your shot because it's a static camera by default which is boring2) bring up the map using the button on the top right of the screen to allow for easier aiming3) right clicking in the power circle allows you to change club and select normal or chip shot type4) right clicking again in the power circle allows you to alter the trajectory or add fade/draw bias5) read the instructions and practice with motionswing. It may be tough to start with but it's worth it when it clicks!6) The marker on the putting green has nothing to do with power, only direction. The centre point on the putting power bar is the power needed to reach the hole on a flat green. You need to go past this point if you want to putt uphill7) activate the terrain slope graphics for normal shots as well as putts because the ball being above or below the feet will send the ball left or right respectively8) wind seems to have smaller effects on the ball than in other golf games but once the speed goes above 20mph it starts to have more of an impact9) go into your golfer settings and swap something out for a 64deg wedge. This is easily the most useful club in the bag behind the driver and the putter10) if you want to chat in a multiplayer game, hit enterAs far as multiplayer goes, it is currently based on a peer to peer hosting system with the normal modes of play you would expect and a few unusual ones. Since there is no central server yet you need to ensure you have a fast and stable internet connection if you are going to host a game. Otherwise, ask someone with a better connection to be the host. My experiences have been mostly positive as both host and guest with no disconnections but perhaps I have been lucky with my opponents.From memory I think there are 6 courses currently to choose from and new ones are being added regularly as part of the updates.If you are a fan of golf and you are looking for a proper golf simulator you should buy this game now.If you enjoy golf games in general but want a career mode, customisable equipment and computer opponents, check back in 6-12 months.If you want to pretend you are a superhuman who can drive the ball 400 yards and impart spin with the power of your mind, go play Tiger Woods.

								Having played EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 for several years, it was nice to come across Perfect Golf, the game is still in it's beta stage at this point, but i can say that so far i am very impressed, game play is good, although there are a few teeathing problems which will probably get resolved over time before the game is released in its full capacity. Graphics are awsome. Things that need attention is at  this stage the arrows on the key pad have no use, it would be very usefull to incorporate tha arrows to move left ,right, forward and back as in TW 08, also at this moment you cannot choose your own cloathing clubs etc, i am sure these both will be in the game when released. But bottom line is i am Impressed with the game so far, and would encourage you to try this out if you are a keen online Golf gamer.			"

Early Access Review
								It's a pretty golf game for sure. Nice layout, easy controls, gorgeous graphics.The camera is clunky, the shot replay sucks and it feels very dull with nothing highlighting Birdies, Eagles,  and Hole in ones.POST EARYLY ACCESSI reviewd this well before it was called what it is. I would never have signed my name to this game, it is hot garbage. The graphics are still gorgeous, but for any seemingly amount of fun, or enteractivity as a gamer, it sucks. My games keep crashing when trying to play a CPU opponent, sad. FPS is dog shti slow and I can run Fallout 4 on 80FPS. Don't bother with it, it's a sad cache in on a golf genre.			"

								I have followed Perfect Golf for over two years and looked to participate in Kickstarter.  The release of EA finally arrived and I duly jumped and bought.  My initial reaction was one of regret because I couldn't achieve any level of gameplay.  Obviously my somewhat aged system was not up to the job.  Following advice posted around the forums I downgraded my graphic settings to minimum and suddenly I was playing the game.  My old eyes don't appreciate HD graphics so what I was seeing, looked fine to me.  What I'm trying to say is that I've needed to take the graphic demand to the minimum but am still finding a game I can play and learn.  Learning that there is little or no margin of error on the snap; the effect of moving the ball forward or backward in my stance; the influence of real time weather on the view of the game.  As an EA version of the game the potential seems massive and perhaps one day I may be able to afford a system to run it properly or perhaps I just need a new graphics card but in the meantime, I can still knock the ball into the water or the rough.

												""this is based on not even an hour of gameplay as i have to go to sleep so i can wake up for work which starts in an hour.Firstly this is quite possibly the best golf game in recent years that i have played certainly better than alot of past titles (im looking at you EA) liking the motion swing and i really like the way the shots just feel right.The graphics though not amazing are really good, though really what can you do with a golf game graphically without taking away from the whole simulation end of it. I would add though that the course that i played on seemed lifeless, i mean it would be great even in solo play to see some other people or a caddy or something. Also noticed a little bit of jitter on the comet trail when the ball starts to drop after the peak of the shot.AI is needed for solo play The only other bad thing i can think of is the sound design, in florida glades i can hear the ambience track looping. This may not sound like that big of a gripe but once you notice it it becomes infuriating and to have the same sound effect on all 18 holes in the track... well just play it and you will understand. I dont know if this is the same in the other courses but this must be a testament to how good the game is i cant wait to find out cos it is a brilliant game.Also. this is early access but i couldnt help but notice there is a pro shop... all the values are $0 at the moment but i cant help but wonder if this is going to become a game that ends up cashing in big style after its release. If you can win money during games thats okay but if you are going to be asking $200 for a golf club that absolutely obliterates any competition this game is going to go south fast! Other than that early access is good i like it and i will continue to play more of it.. And now im late for work bye""I was correct on one thing, this game is a cash grab after release, save your money and actually buy a set of golf clubs, trust me its cheaper			"

								Ok so this game is pretty fun for a golf game. There are only a few concerns that i can bring up that they need to fix.1. Sometimes you can get your ball to bounce out of a bunker and as far as I know, bunkers aren't trampolines.2. Putting power and the power system. There is a a line that is what is the recommended strength for the the putt but it says you may have to adjust yourself based on the incline/decline of the putting green. This is false. If you go above the line on average putts it doesn't change the power at all. Same goes for if you go below the line. Chips and bunker shots have the same kind of wonky thing happening. 3. Wind. Wind seems to have little to no effect on the ball's trajectory even at 17-19 mph.4. Your persons legs disappear when standing on an incline.5. The in game sound is insanely loud, even when  you put everything at 4% of the 100% possible. For me, 1% is about perfect.6. Ball spin. If you position the shot to where you get underneath the ball when you swing, backspin should accompany the shot as well as the shot going shorter than normal because it should increase the arc on the ball. No such thing happens. The ball goes farther and when it lands no backspin happens. Instead when you don't position it at all and just swing normally your ball will get this weird ghost backspin that happens for no reason. Topsin has a similar effect where the ball doesn't change trajectory at all other than it flys shorter than normal. No ball spin happens when it lands as well.If they can touch up a few of these mechanics they have in the game but have no effect on it then this game will literally be perfect golf. Except for like, real golf...			"

I had to check out a video on youtube for a tutorial ... BUT it makes the game!  The graphics have some tweaking for sure, but the trees, water, and sunlight with the weather....look very nice. I would like to see more fluff stuff on ball striking and grass flying etc.. The quiet intensity of the game is being captured for sure. There are many skill adjustments so all are challenged.  Online play: I just played a game and it was smooth with two of us.  He was on PC, I am on MAC.  Looking forward to being able to edit the players ""look"" and the other improves that are coming.   Now: if I can just get my sons to buy it!  Thanks Devs...keep up the good work! "

								While this game is still in early stages of development to give a full review I have to give props to Perfect Parallel for listening to their fan base. Being disabled myself and haveing friend that are disabled Perfect Parallel let us use the option for the 3 click swing which for some is the only way they can play. So thank you PP for listening, can't wait to see what the future holds for Perfect Golf. Thinking of The Golf Club by HB Studios instead? Don't. Search HB Studios in Steam and check out the reviews for their games. HB Studios absolutley does not support or listen to the disabled comunity or even their own fanbase. Like I said listening to the community is a big plus for Perfect Parallel.			"

								Perfect golf has something that I just can't quite nail down.  All I can say is the more I play it, the more I like it.  At first I was not impressed.  The up close texures of the grass and rough were so bad that I almost gave up on it.....but I didn't.  I kept playing and have really enjoyed how the game plays.  The overall look has grown on me, especially since I figured out that I can change the time of day using the ""dynamic sky"" feature.  When I changed the time of day to evening it really made a big difference to me.  All of the sudden, slight elevation changes were more noticable and the shadows cast gave everything a more lifelike feel.  Being a golfer, the ball flight physics seem very realistic, although some tweaks are needed in certain areas which is to be expected in early access.This game is still in ""rough draft"" form but I can see the potential for a really great golf game.  I hope the Developers have the time and are driven to make the necessary changes during this early access period because this game has the potential to be great!			"

								As noted several times this is an early release game and shows great promise. Well done to the team at Perfect Parallel! Listen to your users and implement what is practical and achievable and a magnificent game will result. I did enjoy comments from another reviewer regarding the ""emergent physics"" used. If this is the differentiator to other golf sims then with further gameplay and feature development this has the potential to be better than the Green Jacket wearer of golf games being Links Golf.Works well on my 18 month old MAC. A little ""choppy"" at times but still adjusting graphics settings to find the sweet spot.I'm a keen golfer playing off 12 and much prefer the sim style of game, i.e. rounds of 65s - 80s and NOT the 50s you'd often see at the top of leaderboards on Links. Hopefully a blend of EA Tiger Woods (ease of play and visuals) and Links (gameplay and options) can be found.Finally regarding the Course Forge tool. Agreed this will be a welcome addition to enable continued course development although BUT without a ""perfect"" gameplay experience the product will be lacking.			"

								Updated reviewRating 1-10Realism = 10Graphics, physics and RTS and you feel like your on the course. Just set the difficulty level to match your real game or lower it to beat the real Pros. If your a masochist just play Tour Pro and Real time swing but be prepared to shoot a higher score then you do in real life. I'm not sure the RTS Tour Pro level can ever be mastered, but time will tell.Graphics = 9.5Color and textures are awesome, Other then walking out my back door to the course i believe it's as close as you can get.Physics = 9It has varied quite a bit over the updates and it's just getting betterSwing types = 10 Three click, Motion Swing is awesome, Real Time Swing just added and love it, it brings me to my real game of golf. Game play = 6-9 Varies due to updates and working bugs out each update, which is pretty timely and usually the same day for a major bug on new update release day. Swing difficulty options are numerous and you can adjust as you progress. Career mode upcoming and Season of play at off sites (OnlineGolfTour.net). Community small but growing. Shift WASD Key for shot setup would be great one day. Icon next to player to verify swing type or filter to allow only certain swing types. I get some game freezes and disconnects at times, but again early access. Older end pc's may have some issues on Higher graphic settings. With all that PG is my game of choiceCourse Quality = 9 Colors and textures are very nice. Older end pc's may have some issues on Higher graphic settings. Course Creation = 6Just improved with last update and seem to be rolling out for user created courses of Beta Course Forge. Full release of Course Forge Pending and untried by me personally.Player ANI = 6Work in progress, clothing options just added. Equipment updates are in the worksCompared to other Golf games, the Best out there if you want the actual feel of playing golf in motion swing or Real Time Swing. Early Access its a bargain and it's only getting better, for some it can be frustrating with updates and working through bug issues. For $20 my playtime in game is down to 1 cent per hour.			"

Early Access Review
								Pros: The graphics on Ultra High settings, look great. Of course, I only expect them to get better as development continues, and as the community gets ahold of the CourseForge to create custom courses.As would be expected, the Early Access version of this game has some issues with the swing meters. However, I still feel that this game has a good foundation to build on with the current meters. Looking forward to the later builds to see what each swing meter feels like.Also, the simple, in-game match making and chat is decent for an Early Access title. Cons:There still seems to be a lot room for growth in this title. Most of the things I would say need to be fixed have already been touched on by other reviewers. However, I would have to differ in my opinion of the severity of the negative comments. I think that the main areas that will help improve the quality of this release are more player customization options, refined motion swing meter / character interaction, and more courses(...CourseForge).Overall, I am happy with the quality for such an early version of what has the potential to be an amazing golf game. Like I said, I am truly excited about the release of CourseForge, as I believe it will add a great deal of value to this release. I think that some people expect more from Early Access titles, and may be a little harsh on the developers. I hope that they will be able to take the feedback they are receiving, and turn this game into the next big thing in golf simulation software.			"

								I've been following the development of this golf simulation for a fair while, really pleased to have a chance to play on EA.I am using the three click meter, and having spent a bit of time on the practice range, I have just completed my first full round off of Members tees. I think they have got this just about spot-on as regards ball physics. I play golf off of a handicap of 12 and it is the first time I have played a golf simulation that just seems to feel right.I have played golf games in the past, and you won't be seeing ridiculous rounds with scores in the 40's and 50's, you will not see this here. There are obviously areas where the sim can be improved, as would be expected for EA. I think some of the users who have been critical need to give the devs some time to get things implemented and improved upon, as I'm sure they will be.I really think Perfect Golf has a bright future, especially when CourseForge is added.

								No idea how many different golf games I've played over the years, just say alot. This being an early release keep in mind the retail version will be much improved. I find the game very entertaining and highly addictive, motion swing is awesome, tried mouse swinging before and did not like it. 3 click swing works well also. While there are some things not quite perfected the game works extremely well, it's only major downfall is the horsepower required to run it (maxed out), I run it on the lower end graphics wise and it plays very smoothly, on the higher settings it looks fabulous but I get a tiny bit of lag. So if you love a good golf game that could become great, check it out now, it's cheaper.Some 300 hrs later, this game is so worth 20 bucks. to many good things added since last year to mention.			"

								I've played golf games since the mid-early 90's (Links) and leading modern titles like Tiger Woods Golf and Perfect Golf is among the best of them. What is amazing is this game is 'early access' and yet is still capivating to play, despite the rough edges which will, no doubt, be smoothed out as the game development progresses. Top impressions include: stunning procedural computer graphics (my machine is Apple iMac w/ i5 CPU) and the best golf physics engine I've seen on a game ever. Like real golf, Perfect Golf isn't easy. You won't be breaking par anytime soon, and perhaps ever if you turn off all the ""aids"" and tackle the courses at the hardest settings levels. I'm a former 3 handicapper and take my real golf seriously. There are no gizmos and fake PGA tour galleries...just great, accurate physics simulated golf. This is good virtual training for good real golfers and will help you hone your 'course management' skills. One last point, at some point users will be able to tap PerfectForge and design their own courses with a tool that is much more professional and capable than the Greg Norman Course Designer at The Golf Club game.

								Have had limited experience with computer golf games, really only a few years. I began playing WGT on a recommendation from a friend but quickly realized the game was just not what I was looking for. A quick web search brought this game to my attention and I must say it is fascinating, addictive, challenging, frustrating...everything I love about golf IRL. The game physics, swing choices, difficulty levels and available courses at this time provide all the entertainment value anyone could ask in an extremely affordable EA package.The Forums are friendly and extremely informative. What really has my interest is the pending addition of Course Forge where you can try your hand at designing a golf course. I have never even imagined trying something like that, and when it is released, I full well expect to spend a great deal of time developing the necessary skills to create an experience for mouse golfers and SIM's alike. As the game sits right now, I find it playable and it can only get better. The adjustability of setting allows me to experience fantastic graphics and a very immersive experience.I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

The Devs are responsive to what people are saying about thier product and are making the right changes. Thats the best thing about this sim. the graphics are great. the online play is alot of fun. I guess my only complaint would be the sweet spot on the three click needs to be widened out for the casual gamers to fully enjoy playing a casual round.The hard core golfers will use the mouse to swing. Keep up the good work on fixing issues as they pop up. You devs have hit a hole in one with this sim. Best golf sim I have ever played.			"

								Recently discovered this game and I am loving it so far.  Throw back to my old Links days only far better looking.  Ball physics work well and a decent community with tournaments organised on a regular basis.  Looking forward to watching this game develop in the future with the introduction of course design as well.  The PC I have is not a top spec and really struggles with TGC, Perfect Golf however runs very nicely indeed.			"

								Excellent entertainment.  With game play difficulty from hacker (beginner) to Tour Pro (very challenging) and multiple swing types (3-click, Motion Swing,  soon to be added real time swing with mouse and controller) you will find a style of play that suits you. This game/sim has come a long way since early access began.  With each update developers have added great playability/features and have listened to the community incorporating many of the suggestions from forum members.I highly recommend Perfect Golf! "

								Starting to really like it. I played my first full round with Motion Swing and it felt really good, it gives you a more tactile feeling of timing and speed instead of the usual 3 mouse click thing. Theres's still some bugs to iron out and some optimization to be done but for an Early Release it's very impressive. I cannot wait for Perfect Golf to support some launch monitors !!!			"

								I have been playing computer golf starting with Hi Res Golf for the Apple II with 64K of memory.  I have played just about all the golf games out there including Tiger Woods Online.  For early access I find the game very enjoyable to play.  The real time ball physics is a very good new innovation.  Real time ball physics will make it the closest game to playing real golf.  It still needs some work but I have faith that the PP team are dedicated to making this the best PC golf game.  They are fixing bugs and making small changes recommended by the players almost every day.  I am confident that eventually they will have most all of the features that other golf games have.  I was an alpha tester and compared to all other games I tested these people listen.  So if there is something you want or don’t like post your ideas in the forums.			"

								Perfect Golf has a diligent and communicative team of developers. They are constantly in-touch with the players as tweaks and upgrades are made to the game. As is true of any Early Release game there are gliches along the way that can be frustrating, but patience and ""smart feed back"" to the developers helps them immensly. I have been enjoying this game nearly everyday since it appeared as Early Release. Those of you reading this should know that for just $20 you are getting involved with the BEST EVER golf simulation for PC and Console. Without rambling on about the virtues of the game, I just want to say that getting onboard NOW will be the right time, the right price and all the help from devs and other expert members in the forum http://www.perfectparallel.com will keep you well informed not only about this wonderful game but also many technical question you may have about your computer and it's components.-Crusher			"

								Waited the year for the game release. realizing it is still early access, I was very disappointed that I can't join a game...only to be told that it was my firewall...and then when it wasn't...that I needed to open ports on my router, etc, etc...shouldn't the game just----work...without all the gyrations? that being said, the lobby is not user friendly.....the in game chat requires the 'secret handshake"" to know how to work it (you have to hit enter for it to appear),.... the swing meter has a lag...that varies depending on your settings....the ball is damn near invisible on the fairways....the putting grid is almost invisible as well......in multi player games (i can create them, just not join others) if another player quits...you're s.o.l., you cannot continue the game.....the shot types are limited...the avatar looks awkward (although the motion is good).....perhaps i haven't looked for it yet, but, a player profile page would be nice....all in all...definitely not ready for a ""general release""...next steps in determining whether or not I'd recommend it or not lie solely on the responses to customer feedback from the maker....they seem active and committed in the forums, so...I'll hope they take all our responses and act on them....unlike that other online game--WGT			"

Early Access Review
								In my opinion this is the best golf game available. I own others but now only play this one. The big difference for me is the swing mechanic. On the higher difficulty settings the real-time-swing actually requires a skilled effort at the swing. Other games I have played recently (such as TGC) are OK but the swing on those just seems so easy - also like you go on auto-pilot when swinging - and gets a little boring. Not so with Perfect Golf as you need to pay attention to your swing.I also like that the physics of the game determine where the ball ends up - it is not predetermined as some other games are.Graphics are decent as well, but I don't have a high end video card and so cannot comment much on that aspect. All I can say is that it is comparable to other recent PC golf titles I have played.As for the number and variety of courses, it is getting better now with more user-designed courses being released.  In my opinion the variety and quality of courses is what is important rather than sheer numbers. Currently, even in early access, I see variety of courses in Perfect Golf getting better and better. They are quality tracks with a good range of difficulties available.  As the Perfect Golf course designing community grows there will be even more courses of varying visual styles getting released on top of an already great set of courses. "

								Not a recommended game. Ball and its movement on greens is horrible. It's like shooting on wax paper. 3 click system is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You get no help, no preview of shot or anything. In 3 click if you like that, you will never figure out where your ball is going. If you miss center mark, you are screwed. You can play single player and take a million mulligans. Single player really all there is in this game. I just find this game very amateur and bare, missing lots of things. Calling it Perfect Golf is a just a lie. Nothing Perfect about it. I played PGA Tour/Tiger Woods, WGT and even Leaderboard golf in the old days. Hopefully that other golf game coming on steam will end this game.Don't bother.			"

								I've been a fan of golf simulations for many years.  I've played the original Links thru Links LS and have been waiting for years for the return of a premium golf simulation (since Links was discontinued).  I must say that Perfect Golf is hands down the best golf simulation that I have ever played.  There is not even a close second.  If you want an experience that simulates real golf, than this is the game for you.  And, the developers behind this game are just getting started in terms of where they will take this game over time.  This game is incredibile.			"

								Best PC Golf game in town.  Great ball flight and very realistic physics.  13 courses now but about to have 43 total sometime this weekend.  Multiplayer lobby works very well.  Makes it super easy to find players and friends to play with.  Multiplayer is very robust with numerous modes of play such as Team Alternate Shot and Team Skins match plays.Swing types includes motion swing and 3 click.  Next update, due out this weekend, will include realtime mouse swing and realtime controller swing.If you own a simulator such as GC2, Skytrak, or Trackman 3/4, you've got to get this game.  Playing PG on the simulator is as close to the real thing as you can get.  To watch my videos, go to youtube and search for GC2 skytrak online golf tour.			"

The got the mechanics of swing, tempo ect. right on, in my opinion. Remember game is early release and I've chatted with people working on this and they have lots of good things in the works, so I think this is by far worth $20, these guys are going for golf simulator not game, you can't buy extra yardage with money, so play a game or play golf.

								Scroll down for my updated review I LIKE THIS MUCH MORE NOW. (old review) This is absulotely terrible! You can't make a game that looks sooo pretty but plays terribly. I have played every Links Golf Series, ive played PGA Tour on the Ipad, ive probably played every golf sim since the Atari 800 XL The control of the power bar is completely rediculous the swinginmg is way way way off. If you move your golfers position farther to the left and then take a swing and it misses the mark and goes just a little bit the ball curves to the left WAY WAY WAY left not equalling the strength and the way the ball should be going. The Physics are all wrong. The Mouse buttons to stop on the swingdown is not consistant and sometimes it does not respond ir it responds late and the swing goes way to the left or the right.  There are not any cheers or announcers.  Links 2003 a game that is 12 years old plays better than this game, it may not look as animated and as perty as this game but at least you can have fun playing the game. This being said this is still in BETA and Im really hoping this game improves cause wasting $20 doesnt make me a happy camper.UPDATE**************** Ok im Liking it more the past 2 days. Ive figured out that i can change the settings to make it easier for starters. I was playing the Pro setting. Also the swing is easier than i thought HOWEVER its way too sensitive sending the ball right or left even if your barey left or right of the downswing marker. I have a pretty good PC with lots of memory and 3 core etc the graphics are very choppy when set to best, so I lowered it and it playes great and even though its not on the highest settings it looks 420X better than LINKS, Tiger Woods etc.. I wish there were more sounds of people clapping , announce team etc..  Im upgrading my review rom above..			"

Obviously it's an early release so not as polished and perfect as it could be, but the potential is huge. Can't wait for the new updates to start coming through. I hope the old PC Links golf community get behind this one as it deserves to be a huge hit. Best new PC golf game by a country mile.Microsoft don't buy this game and bury it enough said!			"

								Having played golf games for absolutely years, it's a really pleasant change to play something that feels like a simulator rather than the type of arcade thing that Tiger Woods has turned into.Playing Perfect Golf reminds me of Links and also PGA Championship - another old game that used the mouse (although that system was a bit flawed).The new swing model of Perfect Golf is genuinely good - it'll take you a bit of practice to get it, but what I like is that you can hit quite alot of decent shots (neither truly awful or perfect) that makes the game feel more like the real thing. I've only been playing it for the past few days, and my gripe is about  some of the graphics performance - it's pretty stuttery even with a Radeon HD7770, latest drivers and 8GB ram. But reading some of the other comments that may be just something about the latest release (it doesn't get any better using the lower graphics settings either). Otherwise, the courses look beautiful.I hope they keep up the good work on Perfect Golf - there's every chance it'll develop into the type of golf sim that's been simply non-existant for PC owners.

Early Access Review
								First, let me say that the gameplay and interface have overall left me with a very positive impression. As regards the gameplay in particular, it is indeed excellent, although even at the easiest setting the shot meter is very unforgiving. A slight miss off the center line, left or right, yields an erring shot in no man's land. So you better hone your reflexes. That caveat notwithstanding, the game is great fun. Kudos to the developers at this stage of development.Now, on the less positive side: the graphics are nice, but a bit disappointing, if we consider that they are roughly on par with the graphics in the game Links 2003. I must say, however, that I am here comparing the best and most recent offerings of this old game, with respect to available courses, and the likes of Shardowlands in Perfect Golf. Still I find that the vegetation, especially the foliage of leafy trees, could and should be better, more polished and photo realistic. I would likewise welcome some flowers in places to add a touch of color and variety to this green fest. Also, even with the antialiasing on, there are still some noticeable jagged edges. Keep in mind that I have the graphical settings at ultra high, with max resolution of 1440 P. In short, I believe there is still work to be done on the part of the developers when it comes to graphics.Clearly, and quite predictably at this stage, there is also a lot of work to be done when It comes to available courses, clubs, and avatars. Furthermore, I would love to see an array of AI opponents of different skill levels for off-line games.I suggest Perfect Parallel include a store in the game to give the option of considerably expanding the content at a reasonable cost. I personally have no issue with financially rewarding the developers (like the competent course designer Mike Jones) for this most promising game. Yes, I am hooked, albeit with some reservations at the present time. I am truly burning with anticipation, thinking of what is to follow for us golf lovers. Let us hope for the best.			"

								I've been playing this since day 1 of release and I can honestly say that it's the closest thing to real life golf you can currently get on PC.The motion swing alone provides a level of control that will be hard to beat and when you add-in the great courses and multiplayer you get a PC golf experience that promises fantastic things.Yes it's early access and there are plenty of issues to iron out, elements to add-in and areas to generally improve upon but if it this early glimpse is what we have to judge it by, the guys at Perfect Parallel will have a winner on their hands.If you're in any way interested in PC golf, grab yourself a copy at the early access price and enjoy the ride.

								This isn't the best Golf simulator I have ever played that distinction goes to Tiger Woods the Masters on Wii but Perfect Golf is a decent one,  Some reviewers have made a comparison to the now defunct MS Links. I can see the comparison but this game in its current incarnation isn't quite as good as that game. I have also played The Golf Club and that one I would say is the more polished game if I were to compare it to this one. The control scheme is also completely different, this game gives you the choice of swinging with your mouse or using a three click system which is my prefered method of control for this game. As others have stated there are a limited number of golf courses to play on at the moment but the game is still a work in progress so I'm sure that will change over time. If you have a spare 20 bucks to blow I would give it a shot if you are looking for a PC or Mac golf game that is easy to pick up and play but hard to master.			"

Early Access Review
								Been waiting for this for some time and it was thoroughly worth the wait. Didn't have to spend a year to learn the game as you can be shooting in the seventies by the second round as I was. It is not easy from there. It shall be many months before I could claim a round average in the low seventies even playing on the easier of the two modes of operation and on the easiest of four settings within that mode. You will get value for money with this game as I see myself never mastering it. The quality of the courses I believe are of a very high standard, better than any other golf sim to date. The in flight ball physics are, in my opinion, near perfect.  Some other ball physics, not so good. Irregular bounce and bounce height need to be tweaked, ball travels too freely through heavy long grass, inconsistent spin on and around greens and ball holds on a bunker face. There is no lie indicator and once on the green the putting, in general, I found it to be a little easy. But it is early access and as it is with early access there is some work to do which the PP team are already at it. I have no doubt that the team behind this game have their hearts in it and in my opinion they are in this for the long haul, because of this I am unable to see this venture falling over. The game has huge potential.			"

								Hi guys. For being a beta mode and playable, PP has a lot of potential. I can't compare  PP to the other golf game we know so well. PP still has a lot to dial in. But HEY it's a starting point. :) I didn't like the approach shots to well. When you hit the rough or land on the fringe the ball gets very squirrely like a pin ball machine. I hope that gets worked out. The graphics are decent. PP needs an ALT shot game. When you want to set up stroke game I suggest to lower the number of players from 8 to 4.Connection issues are slim to none. Haven't got kicked out or timed out yet woot woot!!. I'll post more as I play more. So strokem good guys and have funchilimatt			"

								Have been following this game for a while now.   The game, at this point, will not dazzle you with its graphics (I'm playing all graphics options maxed out, btw), but what it lacks in glitz, it makes up for with the truest golf mechanics and 'feel' that I've yet come across in a golf video game.    I originally started out with the 3-click meter, because that's what I would normally default to after toying around with other games' motion swings (be it the Wiimote, PS controller or mouse).  However, after deciding to give this game's motion swing a try, I'm hooked.    Finally, a game that nails it.  The motion swing is fantastic.   It feels natural and organic, whether on the full swing, chipping or putting.    It's also deep, and difficult (playing with the assists at 'minimal') but with practice, you see improvement as you start to gain feel and muscle memory, just like in real golf.   The game also provides you with numerical feedback (on the driving range practice mode) to illustrate the errors and there is a guide on Steam that explains the numbers.  In short, there are 3 components - tempo, swing path and face contact, all determined by the speed and directions you move your mouse.  The core game is solid.  Once they put some more spit and polish on this and throw in the course forge and other features, it may just be the definitive golf sim that people have been waiting forever for.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm a big fan of the Early Access model. It gives indie game developers a chance to release games that enthusiasts will help test and report bugs + have the opportunity to request new features. This obviously tells me that the game is far from complete and the only way it's going to get better [no matter what state it's in] depends on the participation/involvement of the user base.After having played Perfect Golf for a few hours it was clear to me that the skills of course design, that Mike, Andrew and the rest of the PP team have shown - time and again - in the courses they have released for Links 386, have been solidly brought forward to PG. The courses aren't just beautiful and difficult but the attention to detail is amazing. The live water, real-time weather, blend of grass etc. looks stunning and it makes the game very enjoyable. Although we currently only have 5 courses available, I'm enjoying every single minute of playing this game and helping to report back any issues I have found.The areas of improvement that I see as most significant are 1) make online-play smooth for everybody 2) improve the clunky interface where we join and set-up games, etc. 3) make the ball physics a bit more realistic/tough when rolling around in the rough.Features that I'm hoping will be added are 1) the ability to be able to create private games 2) the ability to see who is hosting/taking part in a game (Steam name) 3) the addition of a Break Line Indicator (similar to the one in Links).This game is only going to get better and better and be a huge success. I'm actually building a brand spanking new PC, so I can enjoy the stunning graphics to its fullest:-)Keep up the good work chaps!			"

								So far I like the mechanics of the game. The 3 click shot seems to be the better of the two methods, I find the motion swinging is somewhat limited without having the ability to alter stance or hand position. It also is very cumbersome when putting.One feature which is missing is the ablitly to view the green prior to shooting, I'm not sure why that would be omitted but I'm sure it will be in at some point. Good start. Woud be nice to seem some sort of incremental and significant update to game fairly early on.			"

My only problem is finding enough time in the day to improve my scores.  This game doesn't give you anything.  Only good golf gets rewarded with birdie chances, and that is a great thing.

								The best looking golf sim I've ever seen and a blast to play.... coming over from Links, it's taken all of the things I loved about the look and feel of that game and improved upon it - the course textures look and play similar, but now we have daylight, better shadows, moving water and plants, weather effects. I'm happy with the ball physics so far and the difficulty level is not overwhelming to start. Obviously some things in early access are limited, like the lack of courses and customization, but the beauty is that the developers of the game are open to almost any suggestion and are always out to improve the product. When this game brings about some of those features and also brings in the course design program to allow an unlimited amount of user created content - the sky will be the limit.			"

								Brutal at times, but rewarding.Like others have said, clearly the best PC golf game available. Don't expect an EA Tiger Woods console experience and you will be fine. A lot of work left to be done, but hopefully it will improve with each update. At it's purest it provides a great multiplayer experience, you won't find any reason to play alone except maybe to adjust your difficulty or swing format. When you make a great shot you really do feel the same satisfaction as you might with a real round of golf. I've tried motion controls and minimum assists but it felt too similar to my real life golf game. Much more fun and still challenging with the 3-click and help. Hoping this one gets the support it deserves so we can finally have a great PC golf game.			"

The courses are great and look realistic, ball flight and physics is pretty much spot on. You can tell a lot of hard work has gone into the making of this game, ensuring that it looks and feels like real golf. All thats really missing is a few more extras and a few more options, different avatars, maybe a career option in single player etc. But other then that, this game is almost there. 9.5/10			"

								I've been playing PC golf games for over 20 years and I have to say this is, bar none, the best golf sim I've yet to play.  Beautifully rendered golf courses are a pleasure for the eye but the real secret is what lies behind the surface.  Their use of real life physics in real time within the game creates a golf gaming experience that is unrivaled.  It is quite amazing how well it recreates the ""feel"" of golfing and that may well be the magic ingrediant that this game has.  Considering that this is early access it boggles my mind as to where the developers may take this game in the future.  If they keep this up, and I have no doubt they will, this game should become the gold standard in golf simulation.			"

Early Access Review
								I really like Perfect Golf. It has the look and feel of the PGA Championship PC game that I used to play, but Perfect Golf has the advantage of a strong and growing on-line capability thanks to STEAM. I have just several minor complaints about the game. First, I wish that the wind was more of a factor in the game to make players think a little more about how to shape shots. Clever  players could then hit fades and draws on purpose to hold the ball against the wind, or use the wind more to move around dogleg corners depending on the situation.Second, I don't believe that players are penalized enough when hitting into or out of the trees. I have seen many shots go right through the trees like they were thin air, when in real golf the tree limbs or leaves would have knocked the ball down. Fairway bunker shots also seem a little too easy compared to real golf.Lastly, I suspect that some of the players out there that are using the Motion Plus method to swing the club are using a track or some other kind of aid to move their mouse perfectly each time. It's too much of a coincidence that they have the same shot shape everytime, especially when consistently hitting it with over 100% power. That creates an unfair advantage over those players who use the tri-click method. I recommend that you allow just the tri-click method for on-line play to guarantee that no player has an advantage over any other.			"

								Be following this game and it's development for some time. When I heard it was coming out on Early Access I knew I had to pick it up. I've played early access games before so I knew what kind of ride I could be in for. I'll have to say that I really enjoy this game. I can run it smoothly on my system with Ultra High settings. The more I play it the more I like it, I love the multiplayer lobby and being able to chat with other players during a round. There are a few things that need to be tweaked but PP is aware of what those are and are getting to them as fast as they can. It's a very good looking game and will get better and better as early access moves on towards the final release of the game. I know some say it's just an updated Links and maybe so but that's not a bad thing in my opinion. Looking forward to seeing this game progress, well done PP.			"

Early Access Review
								Im just giving a quick review on this game as of right now being that its still a early access game i will come back to this once more patches get implimented. Now that that is out of the way, im always keeping my eyes open for a good pc golf game as i am a avid golfer and a country club memeber so i take it fairly serious,(more about getting better outside of just having fun). The king of the course to this day still imop is the Links ls series. I was on the interwebs and caught drift of Perfect Golf, not sure if this was true but i had read a few of the older designers from the Links series helped out with either the production/direction or programing of this title. Right off the bat that sparked my intrest because i hold Links LS is such high regard. After getting to play this now for a bit heres my thoughts what i like and what can improve.The graphics are pretty nice all things considering, i still need to really tweak the settings a bit yet. As for the performance its really hit and miss and i do hope down the road they OPTIMIZE this title a bit better.Im expecting high framerates with my setup, (i7 4770k 4.4ghz, MSI GTX 980 4g, m100 ssd and 8 gigs of rip jaw x ddr3 1866). My fps fluctuate from 80 (caped) all the way down to 28 or 30. Even with everything maxed i feel this game should run at a steady 60fps no problems with my setup, so better Optimization would be a great addition.I enjoy the ball flight and the way it behaves on the green;s (backspin/roll/ect) this is what i loved most about Links Ls and i would say Perfect golf gets this pretty close to what Links Ls had. No Tiger woods Bs where you can manipulate the ball spin in mid flight. The sound is good and animations are good minus the putting animation something bout short puts and how the golf holds the putter combined with the stroke seems a bit off to me.Im sure this will be added down the road but Crowds for tournement play should be here also a variation of diviot animantions would be nice. Also i just thought of this but to coincide with the divots they should add an extra meter (pro difficulty) where you also have to gadge weather or not you have hit the ball clean/slight divot or hitting it fat, heavy divot, i would really like this added! Lastly this wil take some time but hopefully this game will get a strong and rich following and it will mature into what Links ls has in its Links Corner. With there course designer and obviously a ton of time, there are so many real course replicated in great detail that users are able to play. The catalog of courses is so extensive most of the time when the real world tourneys start up i would say 80 percent of the time there is that same course i can download and play will the pro's are actually playing them. Its deep golf nerd stuff but some what of a guilty pleasure i have and will play that course while my laptop plays the golf channel right next to my comptuer!I would give this game Birde for right now. The drive is in the fairway with the approach shot was on the green but not to close followed by a 20 foot put that sink if your picking up what im throwing down. So far more hits then misses, can't wait for more updates from these developers keep up the good work and lets go for that eagle!			"

								By far the most realistic golf simulation game that has ever been made.I play it with real balls, clubs and a GC2 launch monitor as input device.The ball trajectory is spot on vs. real life and ball to ground physics is the best I have ever seen.While there are still a few minor adjustments to be made, I think that the most important point is that typically after 5 min in to a round, I forget that I am playing golf in my garage. The excitment, the fun and unfortunatelly dispare after a bad shot is exactly like IRL.   Regardless if you play with a mouse or a launch monitor it's important to have access to tournaments and advanced multiplayer functionality. I have very little exeriance from computer games and online play in general but as far as I can tell so far. Perfect golf  works great in that respect as well.			"

								As a former scratch golfer and a veteran of TW golf, WGT, and others, I truely believe that I enjoy Perfect Golf the best.  It seems to be the perfect combination of visual stimulation and skill; much the same as the real game.  I am mindful of the privilege I have of playing this pre-release version of the game.  It is exciting to anticipate the next patch, the next update, the next bug fix, etc.  To see and be a part of the maturing of Perfect Golf is a satisfying experience.  I have nothing but admiration for our knowledgeable software team working behind the scenes, and for those who provide the feedback for them.  Keep up the excellent work please!~Hank Cole			"

Early Access Review
								For Early Access it's an insight to how the game will play.  When things are added, and it is finally completed it will feel very competitive.  I am hoping we have character creation, as well as tournaments, or tours.  A levelling system would also be great, or some sort of handicap system.I have played golf for many years,and can play as good as the characters in this game, so I would say the ball flights are extremely accurate.  It's highly realistic, however it's a bit boring with limited game modes, so not sure If I was happy paying the £15 to begin with.  Though it will be great to be a part of the creation of a full game, with hopefully things added to the game before it goes on retail sale.  A few games here and there in the build up to full release will do me for now.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been looking for a golf game along the lines of the old Links for a long time, Perfect Golf is it. For an early access game it's quite polished already and the course selection out of the box is good. Course Forge and user created courses... I can't wait! The 3 point click system works well, the draw/fade controls are very impressive. The hole map is good showing where your shots should be landing for par. On the down side, the biggest deffiency I've found is the post-shot screen... It'll tell me how far I've hit it, how far to the flag but it doesn't tell me where the ball is laying, fairway, green, sand, rough etc. I can only find out by watching one of the replay options (which are awesome btw!), sometimes I just want to get on with it. There's also some work to be done on long distance rendering of the ball, not a big deal though. On rare occassions I can also set the aim marker but the player doesn't re-adjust, like I said it's rare and for an early access game the occassinal quirk is expected. I'm very pleased with perfect Golf, I should be going to bed but I might sneak in another round! "

								To start, this is simply the best golf simulator I've come across. There are times when I enjoy it more than the real thing, simply because I score better. I do, however, have one major complaint, that being the lack of a full range of practice facilities. In the real world I spend much of my golf time practicing the short game; pitching, chipping, putting and sand traps. Unfortunately all one can really do in PG in the way of practice is go to the range.  I do find aspects of the short game hard to adjust to in PG (particularly chipping weight) and would welcome the opportunity to be able to go to a practice green, place my ball wherever I wish, and try different clubs, swing types, etc.I would like to think this is in the works and can appreciate the challenges it may create, however to be ranked a great, if not the greatest golf game, it simply has to be part of the package. Can you imagine arriving at a world class golf resort and discovering there was no practice green. The Horror!			"

Early Access Review
								I'm recommending this game for what it is; a lot of others are reviewing it based on what it isn't (yet).So what is it?  It's a golf sim.  It's targeted at people who want the feel of real golf.  Good physics, accurately rendered real courses, lots of camera options.The game does lack a lot of features that modern gamers probably expect, career modes, avatar customisation, tee options etc.  But you have to keep in mind it's an indie title.  I'm not sure how big the development team is, but I doubt it's huge.  They've been making steady improvements and constantly provide informative feedback.  Progress has been slow, but the patient have been rewarded and they're getting close to a polished product as I write this.  Even those who have been hammering the developers with criticisms re: the physics are starting to quite down as adjustments are made.There has been some controversy regarding the direction Perfect Parallel will take regarding a possible subscription service to play user made courses.  I too am concerned, but to give the game a thumbs down based on something that hasn't happened yet is unfair.Ignore the 6/10 average.  As a fairly cheap Early Access game, it gets an 8 from me.  If you love your golf give it a go, get on the forums and help make it into something magnificent.			"

								I have been playing this game since the first day it was released as an Early Access game. With the release of every patch, I have been both pleasantly and amazingly surprised with the progress made by the developers. I was a beta tester for the original Links game, and have played most all other golf games in the last 20+ years. Mostly Links (and all its iterations), TW (didn’t like it), WGT since 2007, tinkered around with The Golf Club (never could get the hang of their motion swing), and now Perfect Golf. Each game has its own pros and cons, its own pluses and minuses; however, PG has shown me it is far and above best golf game out there.I am anxiously awaiting the 1.3.9.0 release due this weekend. For a mere $20US (for the EA edition), players wanting the best computer game to come along since Links, get on board the Perfect Golf train… you won’t be disappointed.Warren “Tresclub” PetersLakeside, CA USA			"

								Perfect Golf is a great golfing game.  Perfect Golf is not an easy golf game to play.  Do not expect to have below par scores out of the gate.  That will take time and experience because Perfect Golf is more of a golf sim than a video golf game. So it is not a game some gamers will like. This game offers five difficulty levels from beginner, to hacker, amateur, pro and the top difficulty level tour pro. The game offers 5 different swing types to play consisting of 3 click, vertical or horizontal motion swing, Controller and golf simulator support.  As of today we have 15 courses to play with more courses still in the pipeline waiting to be released.I can play individual solo rounds, either offline or online.  I have multiplayer rounds and team multiplayer rounds available to also. This game is still in Early Access and getting better with each update.    I get all this for $20.00 USD. Can't beat that.  :)			"

								The latest update to this game really shows the potential I was hoping for. The Devs have obviously worked very hard to add so much to the game, Such as new swing methods, including  real time mouse swing and real time controller swing. I think the controller swing will be a big plus to those that have played golf games on xbox  or playstation. Also now available for free are user made courses. While the Course forge has not been released yet to the general public those that were Beta testing it made some courses which you can now download and play in the game. This in itself is a huge step forward and with them being free it should open the doors for many that were a bit hesitant about the game. The life blood in my opinion of a golf game is the ability to add courses and play them for free. I know this was not the direction that  the game first looked at going but PP have listened to the feed back of the community and have changed their mind. This was a game breaker decision for me and probably for many more. The fact that PP listened and heard all the pro's and con's of free user made courses then decided that this is what the community wanted in itself  is not a small thing. How many times with other games have suggestions been made but fall on deaf ears. I can assure you I know of more then one or two. This isn't the only time that PP has listened to the community and either changed something or improved on it. That is huge for instilling confidence as a consumer that they actually do read the forums and not just pay lip service to it. When course forge is released to the public the list of courses will grow by a vast margin as many of us will try our hand at designing. Now some will fiddle with it and give up but others will hang in there to try and grasp all the challanges it will bring. Still the thought of getting real terrain data and to be able to create a real course with realistic terrain and elevation has me very excited. I too wondered if it was ever going to see the light of day but with this new update there is no doubt in my mind it will happen. So if you want to try a different kind of golf game of one where the devs do  listen to the community (That of course doesn't mean we always get our way but heck at least they take the time to respond and explain why they choose a way of doing something ) Then don't hesitate to get the game. I think in the near future you will see even bigger and better things to come and if you love to play golf games now is the time to get in on the action. Come check it out at the PP forums. Yes there is a lot of different topics to sort through but you may be glad you did. I know I am.			"

No other golf game has the features concerning ball physics, wind, effect etc. and it keeps getting even better with each update.  If you like golf this is the game for you.  It will also soon have loads of user created courses in addition to  thode provided by PG.  I highly reccomend this golf sim.			"

								Perfect Golf is without doubt the most realistic golf simulation ever made with impressive graphics to match. In due course you will be able to use a golf course designer which you will be able to create your own golf courses.			"

								Have been part of the EA for this game since it started and have seen the game develop over time.Having been lucky enough to be part of the private beta group, I have seen how comitted the small team of developers really are as they strive to give us the best virtual golf experience possible. Well IMO they are certainly well on the way. Work continues to keep adding and updating, but what is already available:- varition of skill levels and assists, various swing modes already available (with more being worked on), multiple methods of gameplay, solo or multiplayer, variable weather options, great graphics and sounds, real time ball flight physics and smooth gameplay, for any true virtual golf fan, this title is well worthy of a place in your golf game library.With only older versions of the Links and TW series still available on PC, virtual golfers were crying out for something to replace them. Well for me, Perfect Golf is definitely one of the current available option worth taking a look at.			"

								I've been playing PerfectGolf with my golf simulation hardware for a few months now.  The game was fantastic when I first got it and has only improved in the short time I've been playing it.  As far as simulation is concerned, it can't be topped.  It has hands down the best golf physics ever created for a golf game.  All types of shots play exceptionally well with my launch monitor.  Full shots, short game shots, putting, you name it the physics are spot on.  The game has great camera views, game modes, multiplayer play is solid on steam, tournament APIs.  The creators work closely with the golfing community to make sure the product is the best it can be.  And finally the graphics:  they are great.  The courses don't look cartoony or fake, they look real.  Fantastic work PP!			"

								I have been an online golfer since internet started.  My game of choice was always links 2003.   Tried TW but didn't like it.  The gentlemen who started Perfect Golf came from the Links community.  They are slowly putting this game together  so it   will be the best golf sim ever.  They are heading in the right direction.  Consistently improving the game and watching the forum, daily, for comments and what can be inproved.  They comment and they listen.  You cannot get that from any other golf game.  It is fun, entertaining, realitic, beautiful courses and many great people who play online together daily.  I never thought I would give up Links 2003 but Perfect Golf is just too great not to play 100% of the time.			"

Early Access Review
								In a few words, this is an excellent computer golf game!  It is quite advanced for an early access title.  The game can be very challenging or more relaxing, depending on what level you choose to play at and what aids you select to help your golfing experience.  I think eveyone can find a method to play to make Perfect Golf one of the most enjoyable golf games you've ever played.  I would highly recommend this game to all computer golfers!    What follows in this review is a lengthy discussion of some of the features (not all of them) provided in the game - analogous to the list of options the game provides!I bought Perfect Golf when it first became avialable in Early Access.  I played the Links series of golf, and played a very small bit with the PGA/TW series.  To me, PG is bit more similar to Links than TW games, but it's not a new version of Links.  The game developments over the first 13 months of early access have come reasonably steadily and each one providing new features and bug fixes of the reported issues.  I have complete faith that this will continue for however long early access continues; with the present state of the game, I suspect it won't be much more than a few more months until release (but that is only my guess).The game requires surprisingly (to me) high hardware requirements to get the most detail from the game.  The most important thing is you video card.  You really need to have a dedicated video card; an on-board video card will not deliver the experience that players will want, even at the lowest quality settings of the game.  However, lower end systems and middle-of-the-road systems with dedicated video cards can generally run the game reasonably well.Perfect Golf can be a very difficult golf game - perhaps as difficult as the real game for some.  However, there are many aids that can be employed to make the game more relaxing.  There are currently four options for input methods:- a ""traditional"" style 3-click swing meter suing the mouse button- game controller with thumbstick on the personal computer- mouse movement, now available in a real-time format, so the golfer swings as you move the mouse- golf simulator hardware (Trackman 3/4, Foresight GC2, SkyTrack)The 3C swing uses a round meter which is pretty familiar to most computer golf players.  I believe the 1.3.9.0 update coming in February 2016 will have an option to make the player avatar move as 3C swing meter moves.  I'm not familiar with the controller methods, so I can't comment on this input method.  The mouse movement method allows you to change the direction of movement from vertical to horizontal as well as the sensitivity to allow for various DPI settings in your mouse configuration as well as various resolution settings for the game itself (4K, HD, VGA, etc.).  The mouse swing can optionally be set as a real-time swing.  I also cannot comment on the simulator input, but from what I've read from those fortunate to have simulator hardware, all very much enjoy Perfect Golf.I really enjoy the challenge of the game using a horizontal mouse swing.  I haven't tried the real-time swing yet, but I definitely will be giving it a go.  I like how you can control the ball movement by making a different path with the mouse, and thus imparting draw/hook spin or fad/slice spin as required for the shot.  The physics of sideslopes, uphill/downhill lies, wind and elevation effects in the game provide the most realistic ball flight I've seen in golf games.  Courses designed in the Course Forge by users wil become avilable for all players very soon.  The previews of the courses as well as a few that have been released by Perfect Parallel with the game so far have been very good.  I suspect there will be many more coming, but I also suspect they will all of be good quality and not something slapped together in a few minutes or hours.  There are many modes of play (stroke/medal play, solo/team match play, and others) as well as the option to play online against other live players from around the world.  There are limimted number of official tournaments at this time, but other web sites, such as the Online Golf Tour or OGT, provide a very good complement to Perfect Golf.  I suspect after the game is release, Perfect Parallel will provide more official tournaments, but it's always good to have optiosn with other tournament providers as well!  OGT will also host user-created courses for free download/addition to the game.One of the few drawbacks in the 1.3.9.0 build of the Perfect Golf may be the lack of a career mode.  Many computer golfers want this, but it won't be provided by Perfect Parallel until after the release of the game.  The ongoing development of the game after release should ensure that a detailed and realistic career mode will be provided, based on the attention to detail and reality that Perfect Parallel have exhibited in the game thus far.  I have no doubt that whatever is eventually provided will be very enjoyable.Perfect Golf is currently only available on the computer (Windows, Mac, Linux), but Perfect Parallel have indicated it will be ported to XBox One and PS4, although no timetable has been provided.  Again, I strongly recommend Perfect Golf for any computer golf fan.  It's a steal for the price and will likely provide many hours of entertainment!!			"

								This game has now getting so close to being the ""Triple A"" hallmark needed,as of the last pacth things are going in the right way and graphically its a beautiful game to look at and play.The Community is very vocal on ideas and what they feel is the right or wrong way yo implement things,and being a good Dev 9 out of 10 things happen the community way.This alwayas bodes well where the Devs are closely looking at what the customer wants on this side I cannot fault them.They do have there own forum which probably gets a little more feedback than steam http://www.perfectparallel.com/home from there you can get to the Community pages and discuss your likes and dislikes.Not all ideas make it through but it helps the Devs know how the crowd are feeling and obviously bug reporting is a massive help.I have now also found other Beta courses that you can play via the http://www.onlinegolftour.net/course-reviews.html and if you  are a little tech savvy adding them to the stock courses is not an issue.The Game is a little PC intensive so please look at min specs advised before giving the Devs grief because it may look poor on your PC/Laptop.They are aware that there are still some tech things to tweak and more GUI tweaks but the game is so so playable that I would say to all ""old school"" PC golf gamers come get it.I have tried the other big Golf game on Steam but for me there is no comparison,this just feels great and there are three types of ways to control the game,as far as I know its 3 cCick,Mouse Swing and Gamepad Controller so plenty of variety for any new player.Hope to see this game expand and be the next big thing in video golf,keep up the work Devs.			"

								First virtual golf game I've been excited about since Links2003. Was fortunate enough to be involved in the beta testing of this game so I've seen it make progress by leaps and bounds over the last few months. Being it's an early access game it still has a few problems to work out but improvements are being implemented every week. Get in on the ground floor for a reduced price and enjoy the ride before it's ""official"" release date a few months down the road. Without a doubt the closest representation of a ""real"" round of golf out there. Various difficulty settings make it very playable for those new to PC golf games yet still allows those that are old pro's in virtual golf to rachet up the difficulty for a very very challenging round. Turn based multiplayer for up to 8 players on beautifull 3D hand crafted courses. This is the future of PC golf!			"

								Fantastic golf simulation on the PC and highly recommended. It has been a long time since we have had the chance to play golf on the PC. Even in early access this game shines in so many areas. The physics are hands down the best we have seen in a simulation. From the realistic ball flight, to the ability to hit different shots - the game pulls you in. The courses are also fantastic and a glimpse as to what is to come. This is the key - real courses, real physics, and gameplay that gives you a ""feel"" of hitting a good shot. You can tell the dedication and focus towards getting the game of golf right and resisting the urge to putt fancy features in. The framework is there as the latest update shows some future options. You also get tournaments and multiplayer out of the box. If you want to join a tour from a hosted website, you can do that as well. Two thumbs up to Perfect Parallel for dedicating their time to put this game together. It has been worth the wait. "

								I am a SkyTrak owner, and have been looking at Perfect Golf and The Golf Club for options to play sim golf. Both are soon to be options. I knew of TGC, but had never heard of PG until a few months ago. After playing both, I am leaning strongly towards choosing PG. Here's why. First off, you can play this across many operating systems. You aren't limited to Windows only. Secondly, so far this game is showing strong graphics without requiring the top of the line in hardware. These developers are walking a fine line in that regard and so far winning it. Thirdly, there is already a solid online community for this game, for people looking for casual play or competitve play.As for the game play itself it is very intuitive for the most part. I did have to look up a few things that aren't immediately evident from just jumping in and playing (like how to change clubs or shot types) but the learning curve is overall low. The courses available now are all top notch with a few real courses in there, and there are a lot in development soon to be released. For a game in beta, it feels an awful lot like a mature application. I have not run into any bugs at all really. And the price point is great. You should definitely give it a go.			"

								I have played just about every golf game that has been created.  I am not one of those that thinks there can only be ONE good golf game.  I think there is room for multiple games and that all can thrive.  I think of all the online golf options at the moment, PG has the most options and will appeal to the most people.You can use multiple swing methods as of the last update and each swing type has multiple skill levels incorporated.You can customize PG to be as easy or as hard as you like.  You can play different difficulty levels in the same game which is great because my friends and I don't all like the same swing type or difficulty.I am pretty sure you can also set games up where you can play from different tees which is great for setting up games between PC and sim players with real clubs.  Like I said, I have played them all and even though PG is still not officially released, IMO it is the best option out there at the moment for me.			"

												I bought this game since Day 1 and have yet to comment on it. I've played probably over 125 rounds, maybe more.  I will recommend this game based on the fact there is nothing else out on the current market like it.  First of all Links 2003 had set the standard for PC golf back in the day.  Best sim with the most user created free courses and game functionality.  Not many bigger title golf games have really come out since then.  That being said, this game does a couple of things better than the predecessor, but is still missing the mark in some key areas.Pros:- Beautiful Graphics (obviously better than Links 2003)- Nice simulation physics- Realistic environment sounds- Good amount of courses for the new user- UI pretty simple to figure out- Multiplayer and Private Matches work well- UIpcoming User Created Course Library starting to growMIsses- No commentary? Doesn't have to be a celeb.  Game feels a tad lifeless without it- Sound file sharing - Ok I am going to be nit picky but you should have the ability to play sound files during your game whether it be in a window(snap cam) or some other way. This was one of the best features of Links that should be standardized in every golf game.- The settings to go up and down on your shots doesn't affect the ball hardly at all.- Some default options missing  - Why is it every time I want to see the overhead view snap cam I have to click the button? Why can't I check a setting to leave it on? Or have the button clicked deafult to that until it's clicked off.  - Default view of a friend playing is at an angle. I understand you can move the view around manually every time but why cannot there not be a setting to default that view to straight on like your own shot?- $5 for an expansion course? (Bethesda)Overall I am still enjoying and playing this game.  All of my default option gripes probably wouldn't be that big of a deal to fix. The commentary I am sure could be a lot more complicated.  At the end of the day, this is a beautiful modern fun golf sim that doesn't quite have the functionality as it's long ago predecessors.			"

								I have had Perfect Golf since August 2015 and have now played over 400 hours.  It is absolutely the best golf game I have owned and I go back to the days of Leader Board golf.  In addition what really sets it apart is that developers participate almost daily at the PG forum and listen to the PG community.  There is going to be a significant update in the next day or so and to me describing this game as early access is not doing it justice.  The philosophy of the designers is to create the most realistic computer golf game yet and in my  opinion they have already achieved that.  I highly recommend this for anyone who plays the real game or  wants to learn about the golf while having fun.			"

The developers and beta testers have communicated very well and I hope they incorporate all these positive suggestions from all involved.

I've played around 100 hours using the traditional 3 Click input mode and more recently have experienced sim play using a SkyTrak launch monitor with my own clubs.  It's possible to play with a couple of friends online or from my house using the sim and also with friends using their PC's at their homes and all from our own desired tees.

								In the early days for me it was Links - 386 all the way to Links 2003 with all of the terrific mods that were user created.  I also played - and quite enjoyed - the Tiger Woods series.Perfect Golf is the perfect blend of each;  animations and 3D affects that were missing in Links and realistic ball physics that were missing in Tiger Woods.The amazing thing is that a group of people who were committed to developing a top notch golf simulation came straight from the Links community!  They breathed new life into that franchise, as much as they could make it better, and now their expertise is shining through with this game.The developers listen to the community, the updates are fulfilled as necessary, the quality continuing to rise with every ""change.""The purchase was a no brainer for me.  I'm an average gamer, not as hard core as I was 20+ years ago with the Links franchise, but I find myself venturing down that rabbit hole everytime I fire this beauty up......			"

								Well... they got my money... so they won that battle... all I have is a review.Multiplayer is ruined, b/c ppl drop when their score begins to rise.I only like multiplayer, or a full presentation pga tour experience for single player, none of thats here, I understand the licensing bit, so I would end up relying on multiplayer like wgt, and thats broken.The swing meter is inconsistent, no increments, even 50 or 100, the sweet spot is highly innacurate, as even just a bit to the right and your ball fades like a hurricane is following you around.No real camera control, no way to look at the course.This is not realistic, they try so hard to be realistic, but instead end up with something worse than an arcade game.So there is nothing here for me, I thought this would be a bit more complete(not all EA games are garbage), a different game, this was the first EA that I regret. My loss.Update: I tried playing this game again and it just kept crashing lol, no one was on, the lobby chat was off, and the first thing I did was hit a fade, then the game crashed. When I bougt this game it actually ran fine, now it's only gotten worse.I hate seeing this in my game list. Guess TW08 will have to do.			"

								I'm sure others have many more hours in this then I do but, speaking for myself, I was looking for a decent Golf game I could jump right into, looked pretty good (not too worried about trees swaying), was easy to learn, tough to play and hard to master, this pretty much filled that bill, even in it's current state.The game offers a learning stage where you can judge distances of your shots, make notes and have them be effective when you go to play some holes. I have not tried online yet because I don't think I'm that good yet but from the folks I've talked to in the Lobby Chat (yes, there is a chat room built in) it seems pretty good most of the time, and at this early stage, that's not bad at all.I have to give this a thumbs up, I tried another golf game on here and gave up because just making a shot was like rocket science, this one has you going in minutes with no problem.

								Straight up the best golf game I have ever played (been PC gaming since 1985). Game just goes from strength to strength.The developers are 1st class, they listen to the community and have direct contact.I highly recommend this game.Be aware that the majority of bad reviews are for past build of this game and the problems described no longer exist (some never did).10/10			"

								With the advent of the Real Time Swing control interfaces, Perfect Golf has established itself as a major player in the golf game market.  It was already a solid performer with its 3-click and Motion Swing (mouse) swing interfaces. but the all new Real Time Swing - Mouse (RTS-Ml) and Real Time Swing - Controller (RTS-C) broadens the appeal of the game by more dynamically engaging the senses in a live process.Both RTS-C and RTS-M require a sensual mastery over an analog control mechanism that has a reasonable and rewarding learning curve.  There are also 5 levels of difficulty to help you wade into the world of real time swing interfaces at a level suited to any skill set.  I've been a real time swing controller fan since Links 2004 on the original XBox, and Perfect Golf's RTS-C has finally taken a controller swing interface through the portal that Links 2004's opened and added dimensions to its performance that uncannily model the nuances of a golf swing in a manner I wouldn't have ever dreamed would be possible with a controller. I'm a slightly better than average skill player, and I've managed to break par only 3 times in 50+ rounds, using ""Hacker"" difficulty (the scale runs Beginner, Hacker, Amateur, Pro, Tour Pro) with my XBox 360 wired controller.  Some would say that someone who's used to shooting 62 - 66 in a computer golf game would be frustrated by this.  Au contraire, I find it stimulating to be challenged to fully think out and execute every shot.  A fairway or green in regulation is something you don't take for granted with RTS-C.  What keeps me going is I am seeing a gradual improvement in my game as I become more familiar with the intricately scaled analog interace the game uses.  I'm probably only a few weeks away from stepping up to Amateur!Perfect Golf has so much more to offer besides its cutting edge interface options.  Its course creation suite called ""Course Forge"" has already given birth to a couple dozen user created courses, many of which are commercial quality.  RobC's Bandon Dunes is as good as any of the stock courses that come with the game.  PG also has a bevy of multiplayer options in its Multiplayer Lobby, in addition to having an ongoing chat room from which you can discuss the game and learn from others.  There's also a facility to support user created tournaments that is proving to be popular with community sites like OnlineGolfTour.net, which hosts a number of Tours and Tournaments of various difficulty and control types, in addition to reviewing and hosting downloadable, user created courses.Keep in mind that Perfect Golf is still in Early Access and is still being refined.  It's highly playable in its current form, but it's also interesting to see the degree of enhancements this game is getting in these final stages.  The developers are also open to user input in these final stages of the game's birth so feel free to sign up at PerfectParallel.com and weigh in with your opinions, experiences, and suggestions.   Whether you're a casual player or a die-hard sim-head, You're not going to find a better value for $19.99!			"

								I have not played a golf game since the tiger woods series. I found this one difficult to get use to. had a hard time trying just to find keyboard layout. No beginner tutorial, no introduction into the game, no direction what so ever. I am a lazy gamer i guess, and enjoy when things on the UI are a little straight forward and easy to figure out to get started. This was not that game.			"

								looks like a good game at the beginning but a demo mode would have been prefered, as for the power meter real garbage,  a few help instruction would also have been apreciated especially in the putting and chipping area.  Another item no practice cane can be done on putting without being in game.  On a scale of 10 this game i would give it a 4.  I hope this gets to the eyes of the concepters so that a big fix can be done.			"

								A great game for anyone who wants a bit more depth and difficulty in their golf. There's a real challenge in keeping your shots straight and hitting the greens with right amount of roll. There's also a tempo-based motion swing available that has a lot of depth and a somewhat steep learning curve. It's difficult but fair, and it's a lot more fun (for me) than the traditional 3-click meter, which is also available.Because it is still in early access, there are a few bugs and rough edges, but these are slowly being worked out. It's a blast to play even now, and well worth the measly 20 bucks.			"

								Played a lot of golf games over the years and this is simply the best yet.Ball physics are excellent, the courses look beautiful and bearing in mind this is early access the small development team have been really helpful and are always present on the forums.Motion Swing using the mouse is the best swing method I've ever used becasue it is all about 'feel' and that is what real golf is about also. There are loads of options for people who want a less challenging experience too...but playing with no assists is best imo. The game will be packaged with CourseForge for creating user courses and having been fortunate to have a dabble I can say it is a wonderful piece of software, way more versatile than TGC's offering.The game is in Early Access...so it isn't the finished article just yet. But in the 6 months I have had Perfect Golf I have played 300 hours and enjoyed the regular updates. There are 10 great courses included...hopefully the real ones will eventually be licensed. Also worth mentioning is that Perfect Parallel do the graphics for Sky Sports golf. When you play, for example, TPC Boston in game (Massachusettes CC) you are playing the course as represented in Sky's golf coverage. I think thats a pretty cool thing myself. Highly recommended!			"

								Remember that this sim is still in development so let's review what we got up to now....controller support needs to come quick now imo, gone are the days were i hunch over a pc desk, my computer is setup more like a console.  The game has had a recent major update and performance has increased hugely, i have gone from playing on low/medium to high/ultra a fantastic improvement.     Gameplay is now solid and realistic and has surpassed the golf club in the simulation department, the short game is exceptional.  putting is much much better now but still needs tweaking slightly imo, breaks can be dramatic and give the ball a sliding feel, better visuals on the golf ball like logos and visible dimples may help with this perception.      All in all perfect golf is shaping into a classic golf title, throw in a workable career mode and will improve again, the acid test though will be controller support and how it performs, that i believe will make or break this game....updated for latest content....DO NOT listen to any negative comments regarding PG, this game is near perfect if you are a serious golf sim player, if you prefer a more arcade approach the the golf club may suit you better.  SO think carefully before purchase, sim or arcade, pg does everything right and nothing wrong and you will not find a bettter sim golf experience anywhere! Fantastic! 10/10			"

Early Access Review
								This game began Early Access on or about January 2015 as of today ... March 2016 it is still in early access this is ok because I have been involved in experiencing it so my comments may  be of use to you. They are serious about making a great pc golf game and it is also available on other platforms they are not perfect in meeting their suggested deadlines; however, they do care about the gaming golf community and thier customers. Early access as of this moment cost a measley $20.00 and is well worth it - will not be a waste of time for you. This game has continued to improve and is continuing to improve. You have many swing types to choose from and all kind of options in how you set up the game so even a caveman could enjoy this game. Currently I have it set up to where I have to focus on what I am doing but it is not aggravating to me and I get anywhere from -2 to +2 out of 18 holes so it feels good to get under par but this does not always occur what is great about this game besides all the features of it is that you get more genuine feel that you are playing golf rather then just a golf game. This is not arcade golf you can set it on a moreless arcade level though this is the beauty of this game for example if you wanted to enjoy this game with a child they could play it too given they had some basic computer gaming skills but it can be made too to where you must hit a decent shot to keep it in the fairway and on the greens. I have played owned whatever 15 or more other golf games and have been playing them via a computer for over 35 years and this one is the best so far.			"

I tried it again today, and it was just down right beautiful and pleasurable. The developers have done lots of improvements. The graphics rendered smoothly, the precision for power/direction gauge was perfect, and many golf swing settings automatically set up for you, such as the splash shot out of a greenside bunker.This suddenly became the best golf game I have played :-).

								Perfect Golf came as a surprise. Surprise that it was not more expensive and surprise as to the emotions it generated. I have been a golf player for over fifty years, not a good one, probably a bad one, but I enjoyed the challenge of the course and the chat with my playing partner. This is the first simulation that I have ever played that generates all those same emotions. The satisfaction at a great shot, the disbelief when the very next shot takes you into the rough, the failure to understand where it went wrong! It is an amzing simulation. I know the golf angle are sometimes peculiar, especially when stand up hill on a steep incline, I know that recovery from that situation is a lot easier than in real life, but wow! I love it.Do not wait for the retail version, get in there on early access and start enjoying the experience. It also helps the development as this is just a small indie operation. Even if it was never developed further I would love it.The pros:-Brilliant simulationFabulous GraphicsAmazing detailThe cons:-No statsLag when you are not the host in multi playerNo course builder (Oh I would love that!)Well done Perfect Parallel, can wait for the next version			"

								The game is still in early access, it is not yet in its final state. However, I have played PC Golf games from LEaderBoard to Jack Nick, to Links. I played Links until last year. I am now playing Perfect Golf almost everyday.I do not play golf IRL so I can not speak with any authority on how closely the game matches real world play. I can say I enjoy playing the game and it feels like realistic physics. I play 3 Click  swings, but mouse and controller support is available. ONline multi-player is supported, but I only play solo.  User created courses are becoming available and 3rd party sites are beginning to offer tournaments and ladders.  Computer players are available (some work left for tuning).Again Early access, but VERY playable and enjoyable as it is. IMHO most of the major features are in place even if not yet perfect. My biggest wishlist woudl be accumulated stats (they are available for each round played) and a career/season feature.			"

								Highly recommended.  A recent update added quite a few community made courses (along with updates to the stock courses in the game) and also added several new swing styles. A wide range of swing styles are available:Traditional 3-click with a power meterMotion Swing with the mouse that has a meter on the screen (your choice of swinging horizontally or vertically)Real Time Swing with the mouse (your choice of swinging horizontally or vertically.  No meter on the screen but the player animation moves in concert with the mouse movement) Real Time Swing with a controller The game can also be played on a home golf simulator.  The motion swings are my personal favorites.  Tempo has a large part in determining the outcome of the shot (as well as swing path and heel/toe hits)  so it's not as simple as straight back/straight through.  A truly wonderful way to play PC golf.  There are also a wide range of difficulty options so you can jump right in and enjoy the game.  The easier levels are a great introduction to the game.  Casual player or just want to have a fun round?  It's here.   The highest levels of difficulty are quite tough but it doesn't feel unfair or gimmicky.  If you can control your swing, you can still score well.  If you're not playing well, it can be a real grind, but  it is so rewarding when you put a good swing on the ball.  A great option for the hardcore sim player. The course designs are beautiful and the ball physics are the best I've seen in a PC golf game.  A wide range of stimp settings are available for the green speeds, several firmness settings for the fairways, and several settings for pin positions.    Currently there are about 33 courses in the game, as well as a large driving range and a short game practice area.  The game is still in Early Access so things are still being worked on.  Things not yet included in the game but are planned for the future:-Career mode-Assortments of clothing/animations/clubheads/balls/shafts etc... -Course building software-More courses-Improved AI for the CPU players-Country clubs and tournamentsThere currently is a REALLY good third party tournament site that hosts weekly tournaments for various skill levels as well as fun ancillary events.  They have an automatic scoring system set up that will keep track of your scores and stats after each round and maintains them on their site.  They also maintain different tours, world rankings, money leaders, ongoing season stats, etc.. and it's free to join.  A very well run tour. http://onlinegolftour.net/index.htmlI'm sure I'm forgetting some things but again, this is a great game.			"

								The key to deciding whether you should buy this game is whether you like golf.  Real life golf is frustrating, but very rewarding if you can achieve success, and to do that, it takes some work.  This game is the same way, you have to put some time in to get some success - but it can be fun on the way due to the high quality courses available upon which to play.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the quailty of the courses, both the ones supplied by default in the game, and the user designed courses which so far have proven to be of as high a quality as the default courses.My favorite method of play (swing type) is the newly implemented Real Time Swing - Motion Swing which is proving to be very immersive giving you the feeling that you are really on a golf course and not sitting in front of a computer.Some of the new courses and swing type changes is stirring more interest in this game and there is quite a community of active players who hang out in the lobby for online multiplayer games.  There is also a site which offers weekly tournaments seemlessly integrated into the game with nearly 100 players signed up at the tour pro level (the one I play).  I do not know how many play in the other level tournaments, I suspect that it is 100s more.  There are currently no additional costs to fully participate in the game, courses, lobby or tournaments (although the tournament host does solicit donations on the website through a button).  Eventually there will be premium content for purchase (licensed courses, and accesories which will only be cosmetic and not give you an advantage in the game), but that content will not be necessary to enjoy the game.There will be a program called course forge which will allow anyone who purchases this game to design beautiful course the same way that the original ones were developed.  The current crop of user developed courses were designed by beta testers of course forge.  Course forge will come out when the game exits Early Access, probably sometime this year (but don't quote me).Pluses - gameplay is rich, not repetitive, due to realistic physics and variability              interest in the game is growing, lots of partners/opponents available              developer is active, listens to gamers suggestions and incorporates improvements              game works on multiple platforms including golf simulatorsMinuses - game requires modern computer graphics power to enjoy smooth gameplay                 players who want instant gratification may be disappointed with learning curveMy advice is to purchase this game while it is still in Early Access as it will surely be more than $20 when it is fully released.

I was a diehard fan of Links 2003 for many years, but now I am playing PG exclusively.

Early Access Review
								I have been waiting for a golf sim, and the early access of Perfect Golf seems to be headed in the right direction. Obviously, with an early access, there are things that are needed and things that are fine as is. So far, I can say confidently that the heart is beating in this game. Visually it's appealing and the game-play engine itself is a good start. Some of the issues at this point, I hesitate to mention, again because I suspect every feature and tweak I would like to see has been accounted for by the developers and they are working on it. That being said: The menus need work and making changes to the settings on the fly is clunky. The types of shots are limited at the moment and needs attention, as does the power meter and putting helpers. Right now, they don't really make much sense and seem arbitrary. There's no way to punch shots through or accurately alter spin the way the real game allows. The power meters and putting grids also are somewhat of a mystery and don't seem to be designed to let the player really know exact measurements. This may be on purpose, but still this is a sim and not real life, so we need some way to benchmark our swings and fades, etc... It needs a player history system so I can go back and review my previous rounds, and of course, it needs more courses.

I'm wondering if the makers of this game couldn't care less about the gamers in Steam and are more interested in the Golf Simulators out there than can use this software. Because right now, us gamers are getting no love from the game. A few points for the developers, which I hope read this: ...The putting mechinism is simply awful. Damn near unplayable. It's swing mechanics are inconsistent and clunky. There is no context to the power of the swing and they give little to no credible way to read the greens. It needs serious re-tooling before this game can be considered top notch. ...there is no way to craft shots and the chipping and pitching is abysmal and inconsitent. You'll never hit the same shot twice in the same conditions. ...the swing meter, which is the only way most gamers are going to play this game, is baffling and inconsistent. it gives no power context either but even if it did, you can never re-create shots no matter how hard you try. I'm holding out hope this will improve, but if this is now considered a released game, I'm not holding my breath that major changes to the engine are coming.updated: June 17...a few of the patches and fixes are helping on some of the issues I pointed out in May. Putting seems to have normalized somewhat. It's getting better about giving enough clues to read a green. Still, I think the grid needs to be smaller squares and the BLI is a little clunky, but better. ...still though, chipping and pitching are so frustrating. Practice is one thing, but inconsistency in the UI and the game engine is something else. Pitching and chipping still is a nightmare of randomness. Random in that you never ever know how your chip or pitch is going to react in any situation. it's impossible to recreate a shot that has the same variables and the engine will flatout fail you by over shooting or undershooting even though the power, lie and variables might be the same. NEEDS ATTENTION NOW....crafting shots is still a major problem. the shot maker function just doesn't work for lowering or raising your trajectory. It works left and right, but not up and down. ...still worth it, as this is a simulation and not an arcade, ,and as long as they don't morph into a pay to win model, I will continue to recommend it.

People have commented on how good value for money this game is but it is so much more than that. This is the best, most immersive game of golf on any platform anywhere. I have played PS4 games of golf, other PC games and none of them compare to the qualities that this game has. I am pleased that i was on board from day one and have supported this game from the beginning as it has turned out to be a truly wonderful game. We are still in the very early stages of this game with so much more to come but the highest recommendation i can give this game is, if it was left where it is today i would still play on it each and every day. It is that good. If you love playing golf, whether alone or with a group of friends or a bigger community, then look no further. If you enjoyed the old style links then this is its bigger beautiful sister..with all the bells and whistles on it that we could have only dreamed about back in the day.I cannot recommend this game highly enough. With the soon to be released 'Course Forge' (course creator) and a multitude of courses being released by skillful, talented designers...the future is bright for Perfect Golf.....Don't miss out.			"

								I have been waiting for a golf sim, and the early access of Perfect Golf seems to be headed in the right direction. Obviously, with an early access, there are things that are needed and things that are fine as is. So far, I can say confidently that the heart is beating in this game. Visually it's appealing and the game-play engine itself is a good start. Some of the issues at this point, I hesitate to mention, again because I suspect every feature and tweak I would like to see has been accounted for by the developers and they are working on it.

								The game is still in early access, it is not yet in its final state. However, I have played PC Golf games from LEaderBoard to Jack Nick, to Links. I played Links until last year. I am now playing Perfect Golf almost everyday.I do not play golf IRL so I can not speak with any authority on how closely the game matches real world play. I can say I enjoy playing the game and it feels like realistic physics. I play 3 Click  swings, but mouse and controller support is available. ONline multi-player is supported, but I only play solo.  User created courses are becoming available and 3rd party sites are beginning to offer tournaments and ladders.  Computer players are available (some work left for tuning).Again Early access, but VERY playable and enjoyable as it is. IMHO most of the major features are in place even if not yet perfect. My biggest wishlist woudl be accumulated stats (they are available for each round played) and a career/season feature.			"

When this game offically releases, this game will shoot up to anywhere from $49.99-$59.99this game is worth everything from money and your time. A very honest review! ps you will not regret buying this game.			"

												This is my review of the finished game and not the early access versionI have to change my initial review as the core content on the game remains unchanged.Esssentially this a lifeless game without any atmosphere or real point to it.It reminds me of golf games from long ago on PC. Games like links and then the Arnold Palmer games were lifeless slogs around beautifully rendered(for their time) courses.This game has no career mode, virtually no tournaments and liitle point to playing itThe few tournaments that exist are run via an external forum and you only play if you fullfil their unreasonably strict criteria. As is the norm with forums, the adminstrators control everything. I have given up even bothering to enter them as its such a conveluted process.Its rather sad that this is another game left to wallow in such a poor state.If you want a good game of golf via PC then look elsewhereIf suffer from insomnia and need a good nights sleep, then I recommend playing this game just before going to bed.I never fails to put me to sleep. In fact, i never get to finish a round, its so futile and soporific.			"

I thougth I recognized the continuation adapted to moderm times in the series Links...finally!!For me Perfect Golf is the best golf game ever made...for their graphics, courses,chances of cameras and configurations,for its dynamism and gameplay, for its constant evolution.We still expect Course Forge,Career Mode, Statistics...ability to record shots, games, etc, but I think it will come and we know its potential for improvement.If you´ve enjoyed  Links Golf, it will get to love Perfect Golf			"

								I have had this game since it came out in early access. The progression is amazing. With this latest update they fixed a ton of things. When it first came out I didn't care for the textures but since the update they are so much more realistic looking now. Any way you can think of swinging, this game has it from RTS with mouse or controller to Motion swing and 3-click. It's more than that.  It has a simulator interface that you can play ""real golf"" on these courses. Many options and more coming. This game continues to get better all the time. The new user created courses are also great. It doesn't get any more ""perfect"" than hitting your own clubs. If you have not gotten this game yet don't wait any longer, go get it.			"

								Perfect Golf came as a surprise. Surprise that it was not more expensive and surprise as to the emotions it generated. I have been a golf player for over fifty years, not a good one, probably a bad one, but I enjoyed the challenge of the course and the chat with my playing partner. This is the first simulation that I have ever played that generates all those same emotions. The satisfaction at a great shot, the disbelief when the very next shot takes you into the rough, the failure to understand where it went wrong! It is an amzing simulation. I know the golf angle are sometimes peculiar, especially when stand up hill on a steep incline, I know that recovery from that situation is a lot easier than in real life, but wow! I love it.Do not wait for the retail version, get in there on early access and start enjoying the experience. It also helps the development as this is just a small indie operation. Even if it was never developed further I would love it.The pros:-Brilliant simulationFabulous GraphicsAmazing detailThe cons:-No statsLag when you are not the host in multi playerNo course builder (Oh I would love that!)Well done Perfect Parallel, can wait for the next version			"

												When I first started playing Perfect Golf I played rounds by myself.  I did this to get the feel of the controls, make any adjustment that the game allows,  to check out the graphic and overall play of the game.  I thought I was ready to challenge the in-game ""AI"" to a match.  No matter how I adjusted the abilities of my ""AI"" opponent, he wasted me every game.  I played the Southampton and Shadowlands courses. The ""AI""  scored -15 and -14, and averaged 25 putts. The ""AI"" made every putts inside of 16 feet. Ridiculous!! "

												Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf is what you play if you're looking for a realistic and challenging golf sim. This is the real deal.The game can be as hard as you want it to be. Want to go easy on a flat green course using 3 point click on Beginner? Go for it. After a while, you'll birdie too often and want more of a challenge. No problem. There's Hacker, Amateur, Tour, and Tour Pro that'll challenge you further. These higher difficulties make swing timings more precise, resulting in shots more prone to shank if you're off just a bit. At the highest levels, you won't even be told the wind speed or direction and will have to rely on visual cues like the flag's movement. This says nothing of additional round settings like wind speeds (which can be set to weather forecasts), pin placements, green firmness, etc. You'll botch plenty of shots at first until you practice to get your swing down while you learn to master both courses and conditions. Just like in real golf.Beyond that, there are different swing styles that change ball striking experience. Want to feel like you're actually swinging something on your PC without a gamepad? Motion Swing allows you to use your mouse as a club to swing. You'll have to literally swing back and forward both straight and within a backswing-to-forwardswing time frame ratio in order to hit your shot straight. If you have a controller, you can use joysticks. This is a game with a great deal of depth and multiplayer replayability with a learning curve as steep as you make it. Still, the game launched a bit prematurely. The multiplayer lobby is quirky, at best; dysfunctional, at worst. Computer opponents are wildly inconsistent, too, so to play a decent opponent, you'll have to put up with the lobby's quirkiness or practice on your own.In spite of all of this, if you're pleased enough with the gameplay, you'll be patient in waiting for patches to remedy the game's weaknesses.There are negative reviews about season passes that are misinformed. These passes are for additional equipment you can buy to actually hit golf balls into a net and track their flight in-game, which seems like a pretty dang cool add-on if you ask me. The developers are in no way forcing customers to pay for the base game and a season pass to play for a year.The store also offers additional courses to purchase—currently Bethesda for $4.99. There is unwarranted outcry about this as well because the game comes bundled with plenty of courses to keep the gameplay varied enough for a good while—14 full courses if my count is right, and 2 practice ranges. Offering additional DLC content to the core game is exactly what a lot of developers do these days. It's not in the base game, so therefore, you pay more for it. Sounds fair enough.All in all, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I do hope the developers continue to flesh out the kinks, but they've managed to produce a very solid game with gameplay that'll keep you coming back for more if the sort of golf sim you're looking for is both realistic and increasingly challenging. These two strengths make the game that much more rewarding and fun when you do get a handle on things and are able to be competitive against others in multiplayer matches.			"

												Definately the most promising golf game in years... the physics of the game are almost there.  One thing that doesn't make sense are the sand lies... in fairway bunkers, you are always buried to a certain degree, but in the greenside bunkers you are never buried?  It should be the other way around, although you would sometimes bury in a fairway bunker, but not as often as in greenside bunkers (think loft).  Otherwise very playable, and should be the best of the best when all is said and done.			"

								do not buy this game it is immpossible to play!  the swing meter is crap.  if you use the 3 click it does not follow your click imputs and hit it when ever it wants to and the motion swingg is awful, no matter how you try it will hit the ball to the left or right.....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY......I WANT A FULL REFUND.Takes ages to load and im using a solid state drive mac pro, full spec and its still way too slow.  they need to sort out the awfull swing system.  you have no control at all...great idea♥♥♥♥♥♥poor exicution.......0 out of 10.

								Edit: I left the game and just came back.  Man, what improvements!  Real-time swing with the controller is great. Onlinegolftour.net web site provides loads of choices for tours and tournaments. I play The Golf Club on my ProTee simulator and can say that PerfectGolf is much better as far as graphics and the realism of golf. Even with a controller or mouse, it gives you a great feel for real golf.Original review: Quite good for EA. The multiplayer lobby system is a lot of fun, allowing you to text and play with anyone in the lobby. Can't wait to see more courses and improvements.			"

								So far in Early Access I am enjoying this golf game that reminds me of old-school Links 2003. The graphics are not the flashest out there but I am enjoying the game play immensely, and although there are issues there is plenty of time for this to be fixed. This game has the potential to be engrossing I just hope the develops can capitalise on their work so far and continue to improve the game.I am eagerly looking forward to CourseForge to enable people to start designing their own courses.

								Before buying this game please make sure that you understand that this game is still pretty much in early access, and there will be bugs etc., so it’s far from perfect in its current state. However if you want to help in its development then this is the perfect time to buy it. This game as a golf sim has so much potential and can be very challenging if you turn all the aids off. There are patches been applied, but because it’s a small development team they are few and far between. The graphics leave much to be desired, considering its 2015, the graphics are reminiscent of a game released in the late 90’s, I am sure that will also be improved in time.There are currently only a few limited courses, unlike TGC (The Golf Club, by HB Studios) there is no course creator, so there are no community submitted courses to play on, which is a real shame as it’s something that would attract more players to this game.  This game has been developed for PC and I think it’s due for release on the consoles too.It's now been several months on since this game was released. Its had many patchs which has improved this game even more. The graphics are still retro, but there is talk of improving this soon. As far as golf sim's go, then there is nothing out there that gets close to it. The game play is really solid and improves with each patch released.The introduction of AI and the horizontal swing meter has in my opinion improved this game even better. The AI still needs some tweaking, but it's great to play against the computer, and you can also adjust the AI's skill level.As I've mentioned before this is the only true golf sim out there, so a lot of practice is required if you want to play this game well.Is it worth the price?..Hell yes, if you love golf, then make sure you have this in your bag. The introduction of an editor will soon make this a better game to play....			"

												I have had this game since it first came out, initially did not give it a second glance as the game controls were not to my liking. However a couple or so weeks ago, due to circumstances beyond my control I found my self looking for something different. Gave this game another look, and found a whole slew of game controls. Pretty sure there is something for everyone.I settled in on real time mouse swing as that works well for me in other games. This game gives that swing with a twist in that tempo is also needed for a good swing.Ooodles of game play levels. Plenty of options and feedback with the practice areas to hone your game control type. Game has a significant learning curve at higher and harder levels which is right up my alley as i like practicing as much as playing. At higher and harder levels the game will tax your cranium to score well and hit good solid shots.Game is constantly improving and developers are trying to make a hard golf game. Golf is supposed to be hard, so I give extra kuddo's to the vision. However there are levels in the game that also make game play easy, so something for everyone in here.Competitions and career come from outside fan sites, I have not had the opportunity to fully explore these yet, however they look OK. Fan sites can tend to rid themselves of good players looking to elevate their clique using various BS excuses, so time will tell if this also plaques this game or not.  However in any event the developers have been working on and are improving on computer generated opponets for players looking to compete against like skilled players. The game also has a lobby, something I have also not fully explored however it looks easy enough to find friends and fellow golfers to play with.Current crop of courses are visually pleasing, and the game play at the higher levels of difficulty make replaying the same courses not at all boring. Additional courses can also be downloaded. You can read reviews and look at videos and photos of courses before deciding to add them to your stable of courses.Developer also has a future plan to give course design to everyone. I'm looking forward to furthing my course design here.Bottom line, I highly recommend this game.			"

												What ever changes and tweeks you have done to the game are not aligned with the way the true game is played. There are many flaws and inconsistancies in which the ball reacts vs the way it should. First, let's talk the short game. If I want to have the ball check up, I should be able to control it. This can not happen in the game. There is no stopping the ball once it lands on the green. It is all roll out so lets hope you have alot of green to work with. Sand shots should be able to get spin on them if the lie is clean and the landing area on the green is flat or up hill. This does not happen. again its all role out. Hit it thin or fat? Ok I get that. but missing the snap by a 10th of a fraction and you are penalized!!. c'mom folks get real. Putting: Not really an issue, except. too many lip outs when the ball speed is at a rate and location that would allow it to drop. If the intention is to have all puts drop in the centre cup, then make the hole smaller! otherewise, lighten up on the speed to gravity ratio. AND Why does the ball get spit out of the cup once it drops? Yep. happened twice. slow putt. in the heart, drops in the cup and a half second later it is spit out like old chewing gum. One more thing: I dont mind the forgiveness adjustment on missing the meter whith most tee shots and fairwar approaches, but lets make it equal or relative to all clubs, wedges and Putter. I have up until now really enjoyed playing the game. I am not an ""exceptional"" player, below par sometines, above par sometimes, but now, i find that the game is no longer an enjoyable exercise. Play well and have fun.			"

								Whole-heartedly endorse and recommend this game.  There is so much to like as is, and the future is indeed promising.  It is a joy to play a golf game where the ball interacts with the golf club and course environment in a realistic way.  Even though I have enjoyed all of the many other PC golf games in the last 20 years, this one is the best in terms of replicating real-life ball flight and roll.			"

												When you have played PGA Tour on PC then everything else is going to struggle. This game is a good generally, there are still glitches in graphics, (the way the players right hand is and sometimes how they are standing) and a few of the usual rules of golf are missing. Having said this the physics are good and the environment looks great and it is the only current golf game I have found for the PC that you can actually play online with friends.It’s not a PERFECT golf game but it’s an ok one. If you are like us and just looking for a golf game where you  can have a quick round  every so often then this is fine, however if you are wanting a good single player game as well like PGA tour used to be then you would be disappointed.So I am going to say I recommend this game but only as an online occasional round game with friends.

								A very realistic golf sim. My Father was having issues reading greens when playing golf, so I bought this sim to see if it would help him at all. On average he puts one less time now than he used to. The user created courses are good and more often than not, very good.  Watching divots and sand fly as well as having ballmarks when landing on the greens is just wonderful.  I really enjoy the real time swings. Really worth the entry for early access if you like playing golf.			"

You can have great looking results after going through the tutorials by Mike Jones. Actual game is reminiscent of Links 2003. Ball physics are pretty good but could still do with some tweaking. Ball seems to stick to the putter a split second before starting its travel. If the game is supported it can only get better. The release of course forge should also enhance the games longevity.			"

The graphics are as you would expect in a golf simulation. Installation and game play was a breeze and I have encountered no bugs what so ever.

												I have never played Golf in real live, only 2-3 times mini-golf in my life.I have played Golf Games since 1990 starting with Leaderboard Golf on the Commodore C-64.But I was never an 'enthusiast'. I only play Golf Games 'than and now'.' I see them as a kind of relaxed time-waster. More relaxing as Break-Out/Arkanoid (if this makes sence).For me, as a single player video game player, I see them as a kind of relexation-reflex game.I have a descent gaming rig (i-4790K OC + GTX980 16 GB ram blabla).I own both. The Golf Club and Perfect Golf. I don't care about this Nicklaus. (Nicklaus has to stock my footware on 6th of december with sweets but don't interfere with my video games ;)TGC: 42 hours play timeJNPG: 167 hours play timeBoth are nice games. I play JNPG more often.Why?First. JNPG has 3-click. I dont like game-pads. (let the filthy console peasants or perverse masochistic 'real-life' mouse-swingers be happy with their raison d'etre, But least at last maintain our aristocratic way of computer golf game control  since time immemorial!). JNPG delivers!Second.Graphics. TGC has some nice features like shores on water, but all courses look 'the same' in a kind, where in JNPG the courses looks more different and real. (links, parkland, desert even sci-fi space course as download).Third.But as now, TGC is still the more finished game.JNPG still has only one avatar, no über-detailed stats for every hole, no  seasons, crowds etc.But.I defenitely like JNPG more, because there is more 'depth'. But it needs more polish. Till now only the core is superb. Needs more gewgaw to be supreme.I think this will come sooner or later.Reviews babbling about exorbitant season-pass are wrong.Only 250$+ when you want to let it run on a screen-simulator with real clubs (fwhich you could charge, if you DON'T just install it in your living room, - which is the norm. But no extra cost, when you want it only play on your own on this steam account. But even otherwise it would be convenient.Last.This game is REALLY loved by all these Ami-Grandpas.So I think it is doing something REALLY right, as far at is concerning GOLF-Simulation.(Who would argue about Golf with ... Amis?  - Maybe Scots...) What ever.This is the best PC Golf game now.			"

								I'm physically handicapped, so I need simply controlled games.  No fps's, fast rts's or sports games, just click and click some more.  This is perfect in that regard.  Unfortunately though, whie easy to play, the graphics are painfully dull and the ambiance needs work.  If you're going to stare at the screen at least make the textures detailed or the models more defined.  The default character golfer is pretty low poly, now whether that's a design decision because they're using Unity, I don't know, but I've seen higher poly assets in other games on the same platform.  There's not much in terms of default animation with the golfer either, not that he should scratch himself with the putter, but like other games, whn you're lining up a shot you move or adjust your positions from looking at the hole, crouching to line things up and then finally taking the shot.  The scenery as I said, the ambiance needs work.  Skies, clouds, birds, water, grass and shrubbery, all just sits with a simple state to move a bit.  Just small amounts of movement.  I'm not asking for somebody to throw a pie, but if it's going to be a pc game, put some graphical power behind it.  I maxed the graphics, but still, nohing cool besides maybe a lens flare, but lens flares aren't cool...so here we are.  Gameplay, yeah there's multiplayer and you can set up games with friends, but that's standard these days.  No silly side games or practice shooting in a range.  Just dive in and it's pretty shallow.I bought this for a twenty but that's a bit much, had I known what to expect I'd say it's maybe worth a fiver.  I wouldn't mind a refund but I won't lie, it's easy to play and it'll be great when I'm drunk trying to kill time.  My standards tendt to lower.  I'd say save your money for a bigger studio release.  Maybe get this if you love golf but if you can play whatever you like, unlike myself with a physical disability, dear lord buy something where you can kill stuff and destroy monsters.  Do it...do it for those who can't...do it for me.			"

												After many years away from any type of gaming, JNPG caught my eye. I've always liked gof games and was a fan of Links for many years.Although JNPG does lack one or two graphics details, there's no doubt that the actual gameplay is excellent. The ball dynamics are pretty close to what you'd expect on a real golf course, and the quality of the graphics that are in the game is excellent. What makes it even better is the community side of the game, primarily that which is driven by onlinegolftour.net. Although not officially part of Perfect Parallel, it's as close as you'll come to an official support site with tours and tournaments, even a world ranking system. OGT also provides downloads for User Created courses, enhancing the longevity of the game significantly.All in all, I'm delighted with Perfect Golf and consider it a worthwhile investment of a very modest amount of money.

												As a veteran of the old ""Links Golf"" series, I am very happy to see that this game is here now. It has been developed by members of the Links community who were among the best course designers for the classic Links golf game. You can see that this is a work of passion - the familiar feeling of the classic game is still there, but in a much advanced form with true 3d graphics and lots of new possibilities such as new additional swing modes. The old Links feelimg is definitely still there. If you are looking for a great virtual golf game, look no further. Highly recommended.			"

								The game is still in progress, I will wait to see the final product to recommend it or not. There is simply to much things to do for the moment for the developpers. I hope to see a great final product on release with all the things that must be there for a 2016 golf game, 3d grass, crowds, course atmosphere, course objects, complete customization of the game.. etc etc			"

Early Access Review
								ok, well ive had the game for about tow weeks now and its the only game i play.  and what i like?  the five difficulty options, adjustable options within the 5 general options including various assist toggles, all of the really well made courses available for download,  about 35 in all with a new one released just today. (wingedfoot). and graphically ive read positive and negative about this game, but i play on high settings, (not ultrahigh) and the graphics are down right beautiful,  better than rory on ps4 and much much better than thegolfclub.    as for the gameplay?  thats the best part,  using a mouse you get the tempo swing of 4:1 mimicing a real golf swing tempo.  and you get a practice range to sort this out with feedback to tell you how far off base you were with the tempo, if you struck the ball on the heal or toe of the club ,  (which meant you swing path wasnt totally true). all effecting the result.  it is SO NICE to have a golf game made for the true golfer. this game really feels like your faced with a challege on every shot , just like in real golf.  of course if you dont want that you can choose beginner setting and have an easier go at it.  there are online tours and tournaments , and from what ive read the devs are working on inplementing a true career mode that they say they want to be really good before releasing.  unlike some other games career mode which was obviously just thrown together.  new course coming, plenty to play now, excellent challenge,  what else could a golfer want in a golf game?   thanks for this great game.

Early Access Review
								Perfect golf This early access offering from PP has funtionality,and the gameplay has been stable on my mid range Aurora R4. I have been impressed with the physics and ease of use. The options in this early release are also noteworthy and pretty much intuative. I have followed the devolpment of this game and was apprehensive as I loaded it up for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised as I played it more. Even at this stage, the options to set it to ones liking are plentiful and much more than the basic, bare bones state that other early access titles offer. Once you have started to become familiar with how your ball reacts to your input, the possibilities to try new shots or varying techniques is already engaging. I like a game that challenges me, and I feel PP has created something that can and will be honed and refined to what its customer base will suggest/request for future updates. The multiplayer functions well at this stage, with Steam friends/voice chat integration.    This early access includes only the base game but the Course Forge course designer will be included with the retail release. (There are many aspiring designers waiting to get their hands on that).  The PP website has tons more information regarding everything that is Perfect Parallel. The developers are very active in the forums and have shown they embrace community suggestions. I am a satisfied customer and see alot of potential with this sim-I am having a blast thusfar ""feeling"" this game, and look forward to its refinement. A definite ""buy this"" from me.EDIT 3 March 2016-Hundreds of hours spent growing with this sim and it has gotten better with age. The realism factor is amazing and the additions of wildlife, new swing methods and new options will satisfy anyone looking for a realistic golf simulation. Highly recommended.			"

								I'm pretty impressed with this game.  I was looking for a current AAA golf title and was coming up empty.  This delivers at least as much as any golf game I've played, and much more than most.  I'd like to see a more customizeable avatar, some equipment choices, and maybe day length options that go under 12 hours (imagine getting to watch the sun rise as you tee off and watch it set as you pull the pin on 18, but as it stands it's a love-letter to golfers and PC gamers.

Early Access Review
								EDIT 3/30/16I write this about 5 months after my initial review. The game is playing much better these days. Find myself trying to get a round in almost every day. Maybe the time away and the updates when I booted up after some time off did the trick. I run on a pretty quality system so I don't know if system quality (or lack thereof) explained the earlier issues. All that aside, it is running pretty smooth now. I'm starting to really enjoy it again. I have a few gripes but they're pretty minor. Would like to control spin more, especially on wedge shots. Can't seem to get legitimate back spin ever. That said, I love the challenge this game takes to shoot a solid score. At this point, I'd really like to see the accessibility to the other features of the game get easier. I don't have any steam ""friends"" who play the game so I can never get in on any multiplayer matches. Would be really nice if the companion site became a great resource for players of the game. I would love to enter more tournaments, access a ""career mode"" (I don't think that game mode is available yet), etc. Also, I have no idea how to download all these courses that I'm seeing people play on. Games like ""Banished"" have a simple subscription model for mods and additions to the game. I can't figure out how to add those for this game. This could very well be a case of my own ignorance. All in all, I'm changing my review to favorable from initially negative. Could be an awesome game in due time. Hopefully sooner than later!(Original Review Below)I can't seem to get this game to work. I bought it a long time ago from the early access and as far as I can tell the game has just gotten worse and it has been awhile since the release. I now can't even find a resolution acceptable enough in the graphics option for the game to work. Set the resolution too high, and the game is insanely laggy. Completely unplayable. Set the resolution to low and it's accompanied with a bunch of bugs. As I click the meter, the screen switches from wide screen zoom to regular, and then after I finish the swing, it goes completely black for a few seconds. Disappointed in the evolution of the game from the beginning. Best to focus only on smooth gameplay, and build from that. It seems the dev team has tried to add random features that really have never come to fruition and somehow they've compromised the quality of play along the way... Valiant effort. Still can be recovered I guess but we'll see.			"

												The most interesting golf game I have ever played and my experience goes back to the beginning of Apple, then PC games.The graphics are stunning. The ability to play the game at a beginner level and then add complexity as personal skill and mastery of the game increases should keep interest up for a very long time. The fact that many courses are available now (some bundled with the game, one to purchase at this time, many on line by independent designers) is a further benefit for this game. I await the arrival of the Course Forge so I design some of my own courses. Some of the earlier reviews mention minor glitches in the basic game and in some of the add on courses. It seems that community comments about the problems bring about speedy updates. IMHO some of the glitches make the game more interesting if one keeps one's sense of humor. As an example, one course manifests a problem with the water hazzard which requires either learning how to play the bounce off the frozen surface or how safe is it to stand on the frozen surface while chipping back to the fairway. I  kind of hope they don't fix that one!This game is a definite thumbs up.			"

Early Access Review
								Even while being mindful of this being an Early Access release, this is still disappointing. And I wasn't even expecting a lot to begin with. When it works, the overall gameplay may be decribed as passable or rudimentary at best. When it doesn't, you will be struggling with all manner of bugs, glitches, and inconsistencies. From frequent crashes, to graphical glitches, to loss of chat features/interface. Admittedly, I am running the game on a near minimum requirements spec PC, so others may have a technically superiour experience, but I am, for example, literally unable to play two rounds in a row as the game crashes to desktop every single time I try to load a second round.Motion swing controls are either broken or the developers simply don't understand what the whole point of being able to play by using your mouse as a club is. (It is to give the player the feel of actually swinging a club, in real time, and therefore requires 1:1 motion controls and respective visual representation. Another game achieved this perfectly, in 2001.)Underwhelming at best. Every chance it will improve down the road, but impossible to recommend at this stage, particularly to those with lower specced PCs.			"

												EDIT:  The subscription plan that I complained about has been scrapped.  The Devs listened, and the game is coming along well.  Changing my review to positive!+++++++++++++++++++++Original:This review is less about the quality of the game than the business practices of the developer.  In all reality they want you to buy a game labled ""Early Access"", then sign up for a monthly subscription plan, so you can buy additional courses at a ""discount""!  Really?  The game itself is OK, albeit I feel neither physics or game play are up the standard set by The Golf Club.  The world feels very sterile, and one advantage, true multiplayer, is really not worth much either as the number of concurent players that I have seen is only around 30.Overall, a disappointment in how customers are treated and the software itself.

												As a very long term user of the Links Golf Game I and many others have had to wait an age for a worthy replacement to appear.  There are many Golf sims and I have tried them all but following Microsofts decicion to no longer support Links after 2003 left many Golf players frustrated.  Links did however have an excellent course designer and they are lots of great designers out there who continued to support the game and gave the community loads of great courses to play.Two of the finest designers then started Perfect Parallel with the eventual aim of releasing this game.  I joined the kickstarter campaign and was thrilled when the game got the Green Light from Steam.  When the game finally arrived I was very dissapointed because the game looked great but didn't play very well.The engine lagged badly so I went back to Links I even made sure that I updated my graphics card to be compatible with Links when I upgraded my computer.  A year os so further on I have returned to this game and I can safetly say that this is a worthy successor to Links.The graphics are beautiful the game supports lots of swing types and you can impliment real time weather for most locations all over the world but these are just small details what's important is how the game plays.  A year on the game now plays flawlessly so even if you only like the occasional casual game of golf this is as goods as it gets.  Those serious about their armchair golf will already have it. One of the coolest  things about these games is the course designer.  The designer that came with Links was fit for purpose but course design was involved and time consuming to say the least.The designer for this game called Course Forge is simpler and more intuitive to use but is not yet available but is due imminently.There are already plenty of cources to download other than those that come with the game from the link on the introduction page from designers that have been given early access and the standards are awesome.  These are now being released at a rate of about 5 a month and this will accelerate once the Course Forge is availanle for all. It would be amazing to see further cources particularly some of the best designs from the Links series.  Mike Jones one of Links premier designers really needs to make the rest of his cources available for Perfect Golf time permitting.How about it Mike?  Who knows once the CF is ready I might just add 1 or 2 designs of my own. In the meantime I'm off to play the remaining cources that I've downloaded in rainy old Blighty.  Highly recommended.			"

												First look... 30+ hours.. The game has flaws... but they dont appear insurmountable... I play on pro difficulty, 3 click. There is one tier higher ""Tour pro"" that adds to the penalty of not hitting it pure... I find it very challenging... It reminds me of the Jack Nicklaus series 5 or 6. Putting requires some work to read the greens as it should. Mis-hits pull/push are about right to make you pay for bad shots. I would randomize the number they show for power loss to make bad lies less predictable like have it say ""power loss 5%-15% so you cant exact math the shot.  Customer service on the website is bad. I have had a support request in for over a week to get validated on the forum, no reply... But I'm rating the game with my ""reccomended"". If you have been looking a golf sim, not a golf arcade. This will fit the bill.Game at this stage 7 of 10... They need to release the course forge without having to pay $249 for a season pass. Not sure if that is thier intent. But it will be a loser if they do.			"

												I would recommend this game to all golfers.  It is challenging, frustrating, it rewards you and punishes you.  Just like the real game does!  There are some bugsyet to re resolved but not all that many.   I can count (on the fingers of one hand and have fingers left over) the times I have struck what seemed to be the perfect shot and the game stalled at that moment.  That's some of the frustration but far from all of it. It hurts to see a 20 foot putt die an inch or two short of the hole.  The same applies to a three footer.   Bottom line, it's a great game! Especially when one drains a 30 or 40 foot putt or sinks a long approach shot.  I love it!!!			"

												This game has been more roller coaster than golf sometimes; the devs have made a lot of changes over the development of this game and they listened a lot to the players, and opening up course design was interesting, and it remians a golf simulator to follow. It does keep changing, sometimes in little ways sometimes in surprising ways. After the last update, so much changed that I've stopped playing pretty much. It used to be fun. Tweak tweaks - now it's not fun; it's work and it has changes that I just cannot figure out how to adjust, why they made it, and how can I get back an older version? Putting is a real problem at the time I write this review, and it never was this much of an issue before. So I'm pretty tired of trying to re-learn this game every release. However, those releases also made some great improvements both visual and functional, and their active involvement has brought the game along nicely. (One reviewer seem to think there was no ""dev'elopment; I disagree: this game has one of the most devoted dev teams around.It has a lot of courses, many really good free ones; the basics are all there, it has several levels of play, all of which are too tough for this old guy, and enough free presonalization to make your game look good. They have big plans in the golf world and while some of the bells and whistles aren't there (never missed the crowd noise anyways, no fancy locker rooms to acess data, etc.) there's a lot there, almost everything can be controlled with sliders, it supports really nice graphics, There's an active lobby, several tournaments both 'official' and open, but all use levels of play above the starter level, so your controls may look different, and you may want to learn the higher levels of controls; me I have trouble enough on hacker, or whatever the lowest is. The game is very good at recovery, if you lose connections, or in multi-player, you have a good chance of picking up right where you left off. There's an active community base and an active forum, and an at-times chatty lobby.Overall it is a very well-designed (and still being designed) game with great emersion, simple to learn, hard to master; lots of features and options and seems to have a robust future. Now let's all just get through 2017!			"

												Quite simply the very best golf sim available.Beautiful graphics with excellent ball physics.Many swing types available, including actual golf simulators where you swing a real club and hit a ball off a mat) though I'm old-school with the old 3-click method.  The company that designed this game (and now has the help from Jack Nicklaus' group) is a highly-dedicated groupof computer golfers, real-life golfers (at least one that I know of is a PGA pro), real-life golf-course designers, etc.The graphics in this game are also used by some of the TV networks in their golf telecasts.Also, unlike the big game companies, such as EA Sports for example, these guys don't have any plans to gouge players for a full new version every year.  Yes, some of the licensed courses cost extra, but only 7 bucks for truly tremendous golf courses.  However, most of the new courses designed are offered for free, and nearly all of them are excellent.Also, there eventually will  be a golf-course designer program offered for free (still in beta testing at the moment).  That appears it will be quite complicated, but for those used to using Unity to make games or games scenes already (not me, unfortunately), the course designer (known as Course Forge) will be capable of the fantastic.Unfortunately, the online aspect of the game (in other words, playing matches against others online) has slipped...  It's often hard to find a match in the game lobby.But as a golf sim, this is the best, hands down.			"

												Visually nice, using Real Motion Swing with the mouse works fairly well, although putting is way off. It seems the longer the putt the shorter you have to move the mouse, completely opposite of what it should be. Then when you get the ball close to the hole, you have to move the mouse way too much to get it to register a shot. If it weren't for that this would be perfect.			"

												I played already e few hours during early access, and its a very good game. possibly the best golf sim on PC right now. Its nice to play a few holes in order to relax. It ist possible to adjust the difficulty, so even casual players can enjoy this game. The only drawback: there is no career mode. So, right now, there is no long term motivation, but the basics are very solid. I hope they will publish a career mode later.....			"

												How this game has been getting such negative rewiews I have no idea. You have the option of NOT buying the Season Pass, that is meant for folks w/ Simulators anyway, so that isn't even a legitimate complaint. This by far blows away The Golf Glub if multiplayer is what you're looking for.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a good casual golf game that they are wanting to enjoy with friends.			"

												So man negative responses, I wonder if those people ever played real golf.  It's bloody hard!  Beginner mode should be enough for anyone to learn, but ""learn"" is the key word.  Play 10 rounds of the same course, then see if your score improved.  Some people play real golf for years and are still terrible.  As a sim, this one isn't bad although there are a few little things they could do to greatly improve it.  But golf is a very frustrating game even on a good course and a clear day.			"

												If I could give it a MIXED score that is what I would do. I resisted the urge to cane it with a negative earlier, instead waiting to see how the games evolved first. Sorry to say that I will also do some comparisons between other golf games as well.THE GOOD- The graphics are nowhere as bad as some reviewers describe. On course they are finer than say The Golf Club, I have grown to like the courses.- Hard on the fairway as well as the green. In The Golf Club I hit almost 99% of the fairways; with Perfect Golf I am lucky to hit 70%.- Greens are ""fairly"" realistic. Perfect Golf has much better green dynamics than The golf Club's ice puck surfaces (which is entirely where games are won or lost in that game).- Has come a long way since Early Release.THE BAD- Not sure what the season pass people are going to get for their money?  But if they get value it will mean the rest of us will be stranded with a 75% complete game.- On line play still has a long way to go before it reaches Tiger Woods 2007, which is where PC On line golf achieved its pinnacle. Sad to say we had a better on-line game almost 10 years ago.- It feels isolated, there are no active seasons, or competitions (one token tournament)  or any attempt to group players by skill level. I know these next comment are outside the control / influence of the game developers - but in The Golf Club there is TGC Tours which is well run and builds that sense of community. The same is trying to  happen with Perfect Golf with GolfOnlineTourNet, but is a long way from polished and even the hacker league is won by people scoring -40 under.- Dubious wind physics, while head and tail winds make a difference, I rarely bother adjusting for side winds.

								Used to be a big fan of the TW series, a long time ago. In my search for a decent golf sim I came across this title which is still Early Access. Normally I have developed a reluctance towards EA games, but Perfect Golf truly delivers the experience I was looking for.> The graphics are simply beautyful. Lots of in-game tweaks possible to match the performance with your GPU setup;> The physics in the game are almost as true as you expect them to be and truly unforgiving if your not careful;> different swing types: 3-click, RTS, interface with various swing simulators;> Perfect Golf has about 12 courses that are included in the download. Via internet you can easily download other courses;> Multiplayer is fun. There are lots of possibilities to create your own or join a player/official tournament;> The dev team is actively involved in reacting upon community feedback and improving the base game;> Excellent price/quality ratio in my opinion.The game has various difficulty settings. I consider myself pretty good in reading the course and circumstances, but on serious difficulties my gameplay certainly needs a lot of practise. Which is ultimately rewarding in my opinion, because the realism is so high some practice really pays off. Having delivered a devastating start in the Q-school (onlinegolftour .net) I actually feel quite happy with myself after playing 6 increasingly better rounds.There are still things to improve (player career being one of them). But after four weeks of practicing, tournaments and playing against members of the ever growing community I am convinced this will be the best golf I ever came across.			"

								This isnt a bad game at all. It's a far cry from what I remember PGA to be on xbox(which is what I was hoping this would match up to), but for the most part a good game of golf.It's tricky to get used to and there are a few basic features which I really feel need to be added. The UI/UX desperatly needs to be improved. For example, the 'select' button could toggle an overlay of controls for a joypad as for me that button was unused and I found myself getting lost in controls.A strength indicator should be added - % backswing versus % follow through to give a measurement of power as you take the shot, coupled with a visual aid of how straight your follow through was would be great as sometimes you draw/fade when you feel confident your follow through was perfect.Putting seems to be very random. I found it very hard to get a consistent putt.Draw/Fade/forward/backspin seem to have very little effect for me, and the roll of a green seems to be a bit un responsive... but this could be because I've only played a couple of hours. Not a game I'll play on my own, but very enjoyable in its current state to play with a couple of people you know with voice coms on. I'm really looking forward to this game being further developed - loads of potential! Worth a buy			"

												I bought this game 5 minutes after release on Steam. I own Perfect Golf and The Golf Club. ""The Golf Club"" is a arcade style game and has a small army of partisan negative trolls that were testers. I have not plaed ""The Golf Club"" in a year due to negativity issues by developers and testers. Perfect Golf is a well developed golf simulator that does a good job in multiplay and allows user made course to be downloaded and played in the game lobby which increases its customer value. The graphics are superb unless your on a tablet and the dynamics are well developed. No game is absolutely perfect, but Perfect Golf is the best simulator available and has a loyal and polite group of player that will help anyone with issues. I bought the game in Beta for $14.99 and it was and is well worth the price.			"

								I have been looking for a realistic golf game to play with multiplayer that wasn't chalked full of gimmicky items or horrible game mechanics. While this game is in early development and lacks a lot of polish and shine it does have a very solid core design that can project it to be a powerhouse as sport sim game. I will give a direct pro/cons list for easy navigating.Pros:-Realistic ball physics-Nuances of real golf-Innovative swing design and a familiar classic -Great community-Active Devs-Actively works with the PGACons:-Multiplayer needs to be sped up-UI is clean and tidy but parts feel clunky not well explained (keep in mind early access/development)-Player customization is coming but not yet hereSome of the cons are being addressed by the devs but since they aren't in game yet they will remain in cons. Been burned by too many other game developers to be positive about upcoming changes until they are already in game.Overall very promising game, Already have a few friends and family that picked it up. I will be spending a good chunk of my gaming time playing Perfect Golf. Def would recommend to people looking for a realistic golf sim.			"

												Loving this game so far.  Have been wanting to get back into computer golf again for years since do to back problems I can't play in real life any more. Was a real hard choice between this and TGC Golf but in the end I chose this one and really glad I did.  The information released about future development, DLC etc. does not bother me at all.  I would much rather pay for future development through DLC then have a game where the devs move on to a whole new game first chance they get.  They got to pay the bills ya know?  Not sure what people think, they can just continue to add to this game for years to come and never charge for anything?Just my opinion of course but I look forward to see what they do with this great golf game.

												Great Game! I really enjoy the feeling of being on an actual course instead of a static image of a course. The play is more realistic than what I was used to in my previous golf game and the physics are much more believable in ball flight, roll out, bounces, etc...Yes, I think the game still needs some polishing. There are not any gamebreaking bugs that I have run into with the game. Mainly just the lack of content like different avatars and clubs, career mode, and some camera work. The amount of well made courses by both PP and the community is great. Being able to play 8 player ALT shot as well as a lot of different modes is also nice.Overall, very pleased with my purchase.

												Just wanted to write down a few words about this game now when I´ve been playing a number of rounds.I´ve been playing golfgames since the Commodore 64 time before the first Links-game came out and I also play golf in real life. Not saying that makes my review more credible, but it may give a hint on what I look for and am annoyed with...There´s lots of graphical adjustments to suit most people which is good. You have your sound options and of course your golfer customization. You can pick your clubs and equipment and buy more if thas not enough for you. At the moment you don´t have that much to buy so perhaps thats something that will be added along the way. A bunch of golf courses are included and more are available to buy for a few bucks. I´m fine with that. The courses included are fine and varying in style.You have your practice mode which I think could be better if you had more putting and pitching options and such. Tourmaments are not used much as far as I can see which is a shame. Multiplayer will be your only option if you want to play with other players but my feeling is that this is not very active. You have to work a bit to get a game started. If you just want to play a few holes you´ll probably end up chosing solo-play anyway.I feel I can go on and on about this so I´ll just end with what I think works well and what doesn´t.Graphics are fine even though animations could be alot better.Sound effects are good but the game is really missing commentary. It feel lonely out there too often.Motionswing is frustration and annying - in other words perfect! That´s golf! :) No seriously I feel they´ve done a great job with that one. You need to practice and you won´t get it perfect all the time.Putting is hard which is also fine but I don´t like the fact that you almost all the time have to aim 5 meters to your left/right because the greens have such big slopes. That´s just not very realistic I´m afraid. There´s some work to be done here.As I´m a ""leftie"" I of course miss the left handed player...Would I recommend the game? Well...there aren´t too many good golf games out there today so I guess we can´t be too selective here. If you like to play a quick round now and then and aren´t that interested in career modes and the stuff EA:s Tiger Woods golf had to offer, this game should be enough for you. I wouldn´t pick it up for retail price though as I don´t think the game is finished yet. To me it´s still in ""early access"".			"

												A really immersive, realistic experience with regular ongoing developer support and communication. The devs genuinely take feedback on board and where applicable, use it to continually improve the game. An ever increasing library of user made courses (some of them excellent) helps to grow the community involved and the game itself.A multitude of available swing types and difficulty levels and customisations provide a great golf game to suit anyone from a casual 'fun' level experience right thru to as challenging as you want it.Im loving where this game is going and cant help but be excited about where it will go in the future.

												I've played with this game for a little bit. Having played most every golf game out there it didn't take me long to come to the conclusion that this is a mediocre game at best. Graphics are fine. Scenery and Courses are...well, fine too. But game controls and ball physics are ancient. Way below par. Lacking info on club length, aiming is hard, to coarse. So you are gambling most of the time. Not sure if there are better golf games for mac, but this one I would steer away from if you are familiar with, say, the EA tiger woods franchise which is, even arcadish in nature, much better and smoother executed than this.

												To counter most negative reviews I'd argue that back in the day you had software houses that employed lots of people. Games Like Links (386 etc) and Microprose Golf were awesome because of it. Big software houses today don't care much for the thinking (hu)man but we do have here a playable golf game, and that is more than enough for a thumbs up.The game lacks decent commentary, those funny quips you'd get in Links LS were great, and the multiplayer setup could be done better, jump-in preset rounds for example, that might encourage players to play, but all in all this is a good golf game.

												Despite the naysayers, I find this to be a truly great golf sim.  There are free courses of every description available and very many of them are fine renditions of courses both real and imagined, though the game arrives with a worthy selection to begin with.  You can set the time of day and the weather.  The graphics are great -- early morning sunlight is wonderful shining through the trees and creating realistic shadows.  You can set up computer players to challenge you or just play alone if you wish (I like a player to join me).  It seems to me that the swing accuracy is good, although I must admit that when your computer partner sinks putts and chips from all over the place it's a bit discouraging.I don;t know what you might demand of a golf sim, but for my money this is as good as they get, and then some!  So without reservation, I highly recommend this game to any and all who enjoy computer golf.  Get it.			"

												If you liked links, you will more than likely like this game a lot.  I have an xbox 360 and played tiger woods over the years, this game is way better and more realistic than Tiger Woods and not as annoying since it doesn't have Tiger woods in it!  Only issue is that I think my kids and wife are starting to get annoyed with how much I play the game...it is very addicting.  You can play this game in beginner mode or play in more difficult swing modes.  My 9 and 11 year old can shoot close to par in beginner so I can even play against them when I am playing as an amateur.			"

												Have been playing PG during much of its development and well before Jack attached name and endorsement to it. It has been quite the ride but well worth it. I am so impressed at how game play has morphed to where it is today. The fine tuning of the UI and all of the features that reflect the touch elements of golf have been so well tweaked. The variety of options for altering game conditions including time of day, weather, green speed, etc., should be enough to satisfy most challenge levels.I have 150 hours on this game, played over a long period of time. I enjoy it regularly and recommend it to other golf fans.			"

Product received for free
												Overall i love the game, but i would like to see some tweaks , the putting is tight meaning the ball lip outs quite a bit, a better swing meter i believe would allow more fun instead of me busting my mouse from anger, u barly miss the straight line by a hair and the ball is GONE in the woods looking for animals and i would rather play golf then hunt lol.  But at this time i will give the game a 8 out of 10.. "

												I was a big fan of Links back in the early 2000's, and Perfect Golf feels alot like Links from an overall play performance perspective. Once the ability to select/create custom avatars is available (if ever), then I would tend to think that PG would attract even more fans. The player-created courses allow the game's features to be expanded upon, but again in my opinion it will be the customizations with characters, clubs, etc. that will truly allow the experience to be much more enjoyable to that of The Golf Club or many PGA titles. 8/10 rating and purchased directly on Steam in October, 2016			"

												Seems kind of strange. Its called Jack Nicklaus golf,yet it comes with Zero of his courses! It in fact has no real courses at all. unless you purchase them separately at $6.95 each. Very rich pricing I would say. Game is not all that bad to play. But still a work in progress (beta) with only 1 golfer ani and most courses user created.			"

												This game is great! If you love golf or even just like golf this is a must buy. Can't wait for the course design tools to be publically available and that will take this game up several notches more.Graphics are great, smooth game play, full controller support or use mouse/keyboard combo. Many great real life courses to play and they look spectacular. I would and do recommend this game to anyone I can.			"

												ok, so here's an honest review from someone who has played golf and was fairly crap at it, but enjoyed it immensely.Perfect golf is imo a simulator that makes reward from effort awesome.  A friend of mine bought me this game so he had someone to play this with and immediately set me up with the mouse swing settings.  There are many settings to mess about with with respect to DPI and in settings the speed of swing in relation to mouse movement, however, GET PAST THAT ! and you will find yourself playing a golf game that simulates your own play.   I highly recommend this method of play however there are the other standard 3 click mouse swing options.I usually find that my first 9 semi sober is not bad, then deteriorating into downswings to fast or pull backs too slow, equating in hooks and fades.  However, when you pull it off ..  the feeling is AWESOME !Great graphics, smooth gameplay and finally a golf game that Multiplayer is seemless unlike others I have played.User generated courses which are getting better daily make for some great fun and the option do design your own should you wish.Play competitively ot casually and drunk as I usually do....  either way ..  dont expect an EASY golf game !Competitions online are grades from am to pro and by various swing styles.DLC is available but also MANY user generated free courses that are awesome.If you enjoy effort for reward games then this is for you.If you expect to hit a straight shot and par every time ..   then choose another .. this takes effort and practice.Good Luck.  Hope this helps.			"

												Great Golf Game.  If you like golf IRL you can't miss out.  The physics, graphics, are amazing.  Everything from cars driving on the road beside the tee to deer scampering through the woods this game has it all.  If you played the Links LS series you or even Tiger Woods, you will not get better than this. I bought the Golf Club and immediatly switched to this golf classic.  The Amount of quality user created courses is growing really fast as well.  the $$$ dished out for this game is definitely worth it.			"

												Given I've played Golf Club on PlayStation and found that to be a satisfying experience, I can't say the same for PC since I use Macintosh.  However, Perfect Golf offers a comparatively satisfying experience with a suite of control options that open the simulation experience up for both casual and enthusiasts alike.  On my MacBook Pro, Perfect Golf runs pretty smoothly and looks pretty good too.			"

												If you like golf then this is the game to play.I am impressed with the progress so far and already a hopeless addict.I'll give it a 5 star rating.  EDITWell I'm afraid  I must now  retract my positive review . The game has changed for the worse in my opinion. If want to 3-click your shots with the meter beside you, you might like it.  If on the other hand you want to play with a controller,Xbox,steam or other and then choose not to use the meter, you will have a fine time until you want to putt.  Now it all goes♥♥♥♥♥♥ up.The UI is over complicated and the graphics are sub standard for this day and age. It's a no no.			"
