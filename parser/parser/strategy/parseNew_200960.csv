												Geneforge presents an original setting, masterfully blending sci-fi with fantasy. Here “Shapers” are humans able to create and shape life through magic, raise armies of creatures to work and fight for them, and even genetically alter plants to serve as tools and weapons. Everything about the world seems exotic and well-thought, and it’s very interesting to learn about its lore and workings. The story starts with your character being washed in the shores of a mysterious island, where rogue creations run wild over abandoned Shaper ruins. As you explore the massive island in search for a way back home, you’ll find the truth behind the abandoned ruins, and will decide the fate of the various factions that inhabit it. The writing is solid, and the game asks you to make some seriously complex decisions, without any banal morality judging you. I’ll add that Geneforge is the only game I ever played where the NPCs managed to change my mind with solid arguments (instead of bribes) after I had decided on a set course of action.Combat is turn-based with action points, and although it has some annoying limitations (like only one attack per turn), it’s solid. There are three classes to choose from, and they give you freedom to fight any way you want, being able to create hordes of weak monster to fight for you, focus on a large and powerful creatures, cast spells like firebolt and fear, or simply hack and slash your enemies. Non-combat skills like Leadership and Mechanics are also important, as they provide unique ways to avoid conflicts and solve quests. And although it may not seem obvious at first, there’s a great deal of reactivity here as well.When this was release, back in 2001, cRPGs fans had their mouths full, being spoiled with the release of classic such as Arcanum, BG2: Throne of Bhaal, Morrowind, Wizardry 8 and Gothic. So it is understandable that Geneforge, with its unattractive graphics and puke-green UI, went by undetected by most. But it’s a damn shame, and you should fix that now.			"

 “… she stares up at you with awe, as if her god has stepped down to earth to face her. Maybe it has.” Geneforge is a great turn-based role-playing game experience with a deep and meaningful story in combination with a unique take on magic. What it lacks in graphics it gains twofold in detailed descriptions of events throughout the game. Your decisions have major impact on the game’s conclusion and gameplay is vastly different depending on which of the three classes you choose. The almost total lack of music and no voice acting should be mentioned as the disadvantages of this classic RPG. Trivia: The attempt of futuristic weapons with devastating effects that simultaneously felt sensible and maintained balance were one of the most difficult gameplay issues the developers had to resolve. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												An amazing addition to the RPG genre it takes a turn away from party character development focusing on the world, your actions in it and the repercussions of said actions. This gem from Spiderweb allows for a multitude of choices in your actions and playstyle in and out of combat. Do you think that creatures made for the sole purpose of manual labor should stick to manual labor? Do you think that prefrabricated beings can change and evolve acquiring ideas and motivations of their own? Do you like planning out each combat turn by turn or maybe you like to fly by the seat of your pants trusting in the intelligence of your handmade monsters? All of these and many more are choices you can and will make if you choose to step into this colorful world, and I certainly hope you do. As ever the first game is the roughest but as the series continues the story and gameplay improves adding in new monsters, classes and spells which you will use alter the path of the world.ProsA fantastic story with moral questions relating to the inhabitants of the world as well as to yourselfA solid number of monsters to summon allowing you to customize your party for the situation at hand(For fans of turn based) Solid turn based gameplay factoring in speed attributes and action points causing a more cautious approach to your actionsCons*Graphics are a bit dated which for some can be a sticklerThe game's difficulty does not scale per se so if you push on too fast you will feel the pain but if you take your time you can breeze through areas unless you alter the difficultyThe Shaper/Rebel faction dynamic can be a pain at times barring you from acquiring the last rank of a spell or summon key to your personal strategy Overall it is an extremely enjoyable series that I've spent many hours on before it came to Steam and I would suggest you pick it up if you are a fan of Turn Based RPGs in general.*And worries for some gamers			"

												This is an interesting one, although not really a great one.The world and lore it establishes are well-done and interesting. You get to encounter different sects, and you can ally yourself with them, betray them later, and then change your mind and do what they probably would have wanted if you hadn't already massacred their town. All of these actions have consequences within the world and how that world reacts to you. Those consequences follow through all the way to the ending of the game, which has a pretty impressive variety of outcomes. This is probably the strongest part of the game and what makes it worth playing through.The growth and progression of your character is also well done. You can choose to play Geneforge as three quite different ""classes"". Every level up you get a set of skill points that you can apportion as you wish. The class you choose doesn't dictate what you can do, but it does make it easier/harder to level up certain skills. Skills range from physical combat, magic spells, the ability to ""shape"" creatures to fight for you. General skills, such as Leadership and Mechanics, are also available. Pleasantly, these are actually very useful to find non-combat methods to progress through the game.Again all of these things are well done, and are what make the game worth playing. Where it falls apart a bit, is in the interface and to a certain degree, the combat.Combat is turn-based, and on the surface, can be quite tactical. Timing, and awareness of the positions of both your allies and your enemies are all quite important. Particularly, when you do have allies (such as the creatures you can ""shape""), you do have to take into account whether or not you or your creatures are blocking a path forward. You can use this both to your benefit and your detriment, by funneling enemies down a corridor into one of your stronger creatures.In theory anyway.The problem is that, at least in my experience, the game is rather easy. So, tactics more or less go out the window, when you can just click-click-click your way to victory. Positioning at that point becomes more of an annoyance, as you try to coax the pathing algorithms to make sure that you don't waste a turn because you clicked slightly to the left of something, so it paths all the way around and your turn is wasted. And it's even worse that the punishment for this is not death, but a test of your patience, more often than not.Towards the end of the game, the challenge is upped, but by presenting annoyances, like poisoned areas that do damage to you and your creatures for just being in them. There is an optional area towards the end that serves as a pretty robust challenge, but again, the tactics aren't really that interesting at the end of it. It's more a battle of attrition that you just need to push through.Overall, the combat side of this game seems like it would be great on paper, but it ends up being boring most of the time, and annoying some of the time. Very rarely is it actually much fun.I should mention that the presentation of the game is quite old-school, and to top it off, there is no music aside from the title screen of the game. You just get some ambient noise in towns, and sound effects for all the actions. That's it. Honestly, some music would have made some of the more annoying slog parts of the game much more palatable. I mean, it helped a lot when I was just listening to a podcast or some music when I was doing it.That being said, despite all the gripes, I would still totally recommend the game. Normally, I'm a gameplay over story/presentation guy, but in this case I can overlook it. What it does right, it does very well. From what I've heard, the series just continues to build on itself as it goes on. Based on what I played, I'm very much looking forward to eventually going through the following games in the series.			"

												what to say about Geneforge? To put it simply: It's an oddly fantastic game. Having never heard of the series, I purchased a bundle with all 5 Geneforge games. I really enjoyed my playthough of Geneforge 1, despite the difficulty and dated feel of its isometric graphics. Many of the sound effects are terrible and yet somehow memorable and enjoyable. The entire gameworld is immersive, and the creators succeed at inviting the player into a curious world unlike anything I've found elsewhere. The turn-based combat is unique and seamless with world exploration; no cutscenes to a battlefield. Feel free to disagree, but this games combat feels a lot like what Dragon Age would have been (without the dragons) in 2001. You set your party into a formation (some strategy), you scout bad guys, you draw them into battle and then the turn-based system engages right where the characters are standing, based on the players/enemies speed as determined by stats. The balancing is steeped against the player and pots/items/spells saved my creations several times. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention? You're a Shaper, a god-like race of techno-religious beings who fashioned slaves through genetic engineering, albeit 150 years ago before much of the technology was abandoned, ship wrecked on an island populated with the decendants of those slaves. If you want to know more, or about what the Geneforge is, buy the game!Aside from combat, content-wise it's pretty dense. I was able to get up to 50hrs in a single playthrough, although I explored just about every square inch of map and tried multiple different endings. The story is pushed by text-narration as opposed to characters rendered in 3D, animated w/ voice acting. This makes it impenetrable to many spoilt by games such as Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and Bioshock, but nevertheless it has it all. Political intrigue, factions, tons of choices that shape the world and your standing within it, hundreds of items and creatures, and dungeon after dungeon to crawl through.I can't speak to the whole series, although I may play them through in the future, but IMO Geneforge 1 is worth your time for anything under $3. I think I got it for a buck in the bundle and was pleasantly surprised. Ultimately, I give ""Geneforge 1"" 7/10, would genetically modify self again.			"

												All of Spiderweb Software's titles are low on graphics and, as the oldest title available on Steam, Geneforge 1 is no exception; however, it was never built for that. Regardless of what year you play this game, the amount of raw depth and story is outstanding. It has been ten years since I first played this game, the Geneforge series remains one of my favorite games of all time, and I can't recommend it without advising players to start at the beginning.Although the events in this game are clearly felt in the sequel, it also has the least connection with the outside world. Leaving your discovery of who you are, who you work for, and what Sucia Island is all about up to intensive study, exploration, and imagination. It's because of that feature that this might be the best introduction to Geneforge, even though it has the most clunky interface.I won't pretend to give an in-depth analysis of this game, I just wouldn't know where to start. If Steam was able to record how much I played this game when it first came out, it would be over 350 hours. Despite that, all I can do is recommend that you try it for yourself. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd be interested, visit spidweb.com and download the demo. If you enjoy it, come back.			"

												Classic, old-school, isometric, turn-based RPG in a unique fantasy setting.  Open-ended, plenty of feeling of agency - choices have consequences and rewards.  Loved every bit of it.  Of course I used the Geneforge, then handed everyone's carcass to them in a sizzling, melted pile.  I'll be plowing through the rest of the saga post-haste, and in order.  What fun we'll have regrowing ourselves into gods.10/10 Will try to unring a bell again.			"

												This is an amazing game, even for its age.  I really love the story, but what was even better is the closure you receive at the end in the form of hand-drawn story panels (this particular aspect really appealed to me).  There are many different endings to find, which helps increase playtime/replayability and overall, I have put more than 50 hours into this game.  If you are a fan of RPG's and you don't mind dated graphics, you should definitely give this or the later entries in the series a try.8/10			"

												Its fun, graphics are deifinitely dated, the interface a little clunky, but its a retro type game so that is to be expected, but the gameplay gets you hooked, I am finding it great fun and challenging.  Be prepared to die a lot, this might change if u actually good at the game, but as noob to Geneforge, I finding the combat can be very brutal, best pray to the RND gods and save frequently!I got this as part of the spiderweb bundle, have been tossing up wether to get another spiderweb game called avernium escape from the pit, thought I would take a gamble and support an indie publisher, as the whole bundle is about $45 USD at full price and has 10+ titles in it.  I am starting to think it might be the best $45 I spent on games for many yearsHighly recomended, unless you absolutely must have modern graphics or only like first person shooters!9/10 only coz I been spoilt with prettier games  with more modern interfaces, for gameplay its definitey a 10/10 for me!Glad I stopped procastinating and spent the dollars :) "

												I could go into all sorts of details about what this game is about, but I legitimately feel like the following statement is all you need to know:You literally use magic to create your own party members.WHY IS THIS NOT A THING IN MORE MODERN GAMES?On a slightly more serious note...This game's story has within it an interesting moral question. You've arrived -- by accident -- on an island filled with shaper creations called serviles. They're more or less the same in physical capability and appearance as humans, but they were created by shapers to do the bidding of said shapers. The island has since been deserted of all shapers for hundreds of years, leaving the serviles with no masters. They've split into three sects based on their views of shapers. There are the Obeyers, who believe that, despite their absence, shapers are still, for all practical purposes, their gods, and should be worshipped as such. Next are the Awakened, who believe that their self-sustinance has severed their ties with shapers, but are also humble enough not to ignore them entirely. Thus, the Awakened view themselves as equal to shapers. Lastly, there are the Takers, who believe that, because they were abandoned, their survival has granted them superiority over shapers. In short, Obeyers < shapers, Awakened = shapers, and Takers > shapers. As a shaper yourself...who will you join?			"

												The Geneforge games are some of the best RPGs ever (with the first and the fifth games in the series being highlights, although all of them are good).  Massive worlds, lots of old-school stats, tons of different ways to play (the character build system has much more variety than most RPGs, and the ability to create companions to fight for you is a nice touch), many different factions to join, ignore, or fight, and lots of freedom to act in a world where your choices actually affect the way the game plays.  Plus, the setting is a refreshing mix of sci-fi and fantasy and, at times, is genuinely strange, as opposed to just the same old boring Tolkeinisms found in most RPGs.  If you can get past the admittedly rough graphics and less than beautiful aesthetics these games are awesome.			"

												When I looked at the screenshots of this title I immediatly closed this page and moved on to search for some other game. Sometime later I encountered this game again on a sale. So I read a few short reviews and decided to give it a shot.And it was worth it. I am just an hour into the game but I can see already that this is a kind of RPG game that is not made anymore today. I'm a veteran player with strong sentiment towards classic RPG titles. Geneforge repulsed me with its primitive graphics but bought me with strong narrative, gameplay and this oldschool feel. You should definitely give it a try if you're fond of oldschool 2D RPG's.I shouldn't write a game review without actually finishing it. So I'll share my thoughts after I complete chaptere one. For now, I'm hooked.Update: I've played about 8 hours and the game even gets better. Truly surprised by that.Already finished. It loses it's momentum during the second half of the game but all in all I really enjoyed it.			"

												I have been playing this a lot lately. At first i thought i would hate it but as i got furthur in the game (very slowly) I started to enjoy it. FIrst of all i have not completed it yet  but i have played enough to probebly write something. Story If you do not like a lot of reading then you mind as well pass on the game. There is a ton of reading and the game is very heavily story based which is a good thing because so far it has been pretty well written. I won't give anything away so i can't say much just know that it is well worth reading through. Also talk to every npc  that is a must. You also might want something to write down notes. Gameplaygees where do i start  ... Well i guess the battle gameplay. It is a stradegy turn based rpg. Every turn you have a certain amout of ability ponts. moving, using items, attacking will use ability points. This makes you think a lot about your move during the combat phase which again is a good thing.  As you level up you will gain point in which you can distribute to certain stats. Eventually you will be able to summon creatures to fight by your side. But if you do not keep them happy the will turn on you and start attacking you. Which could turn a battle thats going good in to a nightmare. Which brings another level of stradegy. Also creating creatures effects your essance points base stat. So say you summon one that uses 7 essance points. Your base stat will be ... 21-7 =14  you can gain back that stat by absorbing the creature when you do not need it. Music There is not much music here aside from the title screen but enough  form towns with the kids playing and running around to outside where there will be animal sounds. that is more then enough to be enjoyable. score 9/10			"

Posted: September 16, 2014
												  For me, Geneforge is one of the series that represents a hybrid of old school and new for RPG, a transition that came around at a time when developers not only relied on certain conventions (such as the heavy use of textual description in games) but embraced these over the flash and thunder of visual & audio spectacle that would inevitably supplant them in mainstream gaming.  This review is for Geneforge 1 through 5, the complete series.  Mr. Jeff Vogel and his Spiderweb Software are involved not just in the Geneforge IP but also the Avernum series which is enjoyable.  Geneforge was developed in five installments from 2001 to 2008.  Graphics were never a priority with this IP, and in my opinion like most games developed by this company, its greatest strength is story.Some things that must be talked about when discussing Geneforge: Heavy use of text Merciless combat & careful character progression No hand holding or linearity in a huge world  Understand that these games feel old by any standard.  People who didn't grow up playing MUDs or other types of games in high school will likely be frustrated by the high amount of text here: it's how you get the dialogue, interact with people and objects, and absorb specific information about every new area you come across in addition to most of the situations that dynamically arise in the game world.  The pace of the game is necessarily slowed down by this feature and many players either don't have the patience or simply aren't inclined to sit through so much content when presented in this format.  Yeah, you have to stop and read.  I urge you to take that time and effort, since the reading provides great detail and insight into the lore, characters and story --not to mention you'll be completely lost on what to do next if you skip through it!  Combat can be very fun and is especially rewarding after you've repeated an encounter that initially punished you but discovered a viable path to victory.  ""Shaping,"" the act of creating life via magic, is the central theme of Geneforge and translates into an ""essence"" mechanic, a second mana pool the player character spends to summon a host of little minions (or a handful of stronger ones, or a single powerful one; it varies based on the demands of each encounter).  There are a few types of shaping that each come with their own creations (magical, melee, ranged, control, etcetera).  Even on the casual difficulty you need to be smart about how you invest skill points upon leveling up.  Support skills like Leadership and Mechanics are great; they can supposedly be used to beat the game without a combat-viable character.  Melee and ranged specializations are available too, of course, if you aren't into the magic system.  I found the most success with a bit of everything, emphasizing survivability + stats over armor in my gear choices.  Be prepared for some trial and error (or look up some cheats online...but really, don't do that).  There are a couple of succinct and helpful guides out there, though.  The third item on that list just further drives home the importance of realizing it's a long game with lots of text.  You have very little indication of where to go or what to do even when given a quest.  You'll forge out into the world and earn every inch of progress with meticulous interrogation of NPCs in towns and navigation of treacherous, trap-filled monster infested wildlands in equal measure.  If you skip that text, eventually you'll be having to consult a guide or just roam randomly until you get lucky.  I did not explore every area, complete every quest, hunt down every rare item or talk to everyone I met.  In fact, at times I followed the main questline as closely as is possible in my eagerness to see the main plot play out.    Technically the game is very simple but runs without any issue.  It started as demoware on the Mac.  Everything runs fine but looks extremely dated and perhaps feels clunky.    The themes dealt with in this story are ones I liked and would enjoy seeing more of in future games.  I found it very pleasing that the story unfolded in episodic manner from one game to the next, especially regarding the recurring characters who I'd grown attached to.  The only criticism I'd level against the story is that it is delivered almost too arbitrarily; I felt at times I would have been better served experiencing the story through my actions rather than being told what to think with a text box.  Overall however, it was an excellent delivery.  Of the cRPGs I've played, this series isn't my favorite but it's up there, although...  I can only recommend Geneforge to players who have considerable patience and time on their hands for the experience I've described above, and who are craving an ""old school"" game.  It's challenging but good fun.  Defeating your enemies to reach the ending and see how everything wraps up based on your choices is so rewarding.TIP: Be thorough in exploring, talking, and reading the text for each area.  It'll help in various ways, not just the extra experience points.TIP: Guides exist online if you find yourself in an unbeatable fight or unsure of where to go next.			"

												Basically Geneforge 1 is a seemingly run-of-the-mill fantasy RPG where, admittedly, the art and music isn't even all that great. But you'll be hooked after 30 minutes of exploring Sucia Island, which has been barred from Shaper travel for two centuries. There are the typical ruins and monsters, treasures and trash you get with every game like this, but the game's storytelling will suprise you and keep you playing. Combat and map-extensiveness will keep you on your toes and provide a lengthy experience. This is a great game and I highly recommend it if you're looking for something easy to get into and fun to play.You can see an extended review I've written here: http://chillfacedanger.wordpress.com/2014/07/12/year-of-gaming-3-geneforge-1/ "

While the graphics are fairly ancient, even for when this game was released, the writing's combination of dark humor, fascinating worldbuilding, and complex choices makes this first installment likely the best. Use stealth and diplomacy or might and magic to explore Sucia Island, and possibly unlock the secrets of why this place was abandoned- or even exploit them to give yourself godlike powers.There are many ways to win, and many many more ways to lose, but your objective is simple: Escape. Everything else is just icing on the genetically engineered cake.			"

												The Geneforge Saga is a very incredible series, as it give the player an astounding amount of choice and freedom in what they are able to do.Basically, you start off stranded on a mysterious island that had previously been effectively blacklisted and abandoned, with the initial aim to find a means of escape. Naturally, there are three (at the point that I'm up to, anyway) rival factions that you can either choose one to side with, attempt to play them all against each other, or even just ignore completely!Want to be the good guy, who tries to save everyone? Sure! Want to be a marauding psychopath who just wants to kill all in his path? Why not! Want to be a reclusive hermit who just wants to keep to himself, and leave the island quickly and quietly? Alright! Want to just curl up in a ball somewhere, and die? Go for it!Every choice is yours to make! Buy Geneforge today! (<- Except that one; that’s mandatory)			"

												Geneforge 1Graphics: Simple and functional, no showstopper here.Control: Nice and clear tutorial, fixed key binding.Replayability: HighGeneforge 1 setting is a typical one for fantasy games, you are alone in a strange land and you are not supposed to be there. The narrative is good,  drives the character smoothly and, most importantly, coherently with the decisions the player had made. Want to be in Team Servile? You can. Want to slaughter traitorous Serviles? You can. You don't care at all about Serviles? Yes, you can ignore all of them.The Shaper is a clean slate. She can be an Avatar of Justice. A Scion of Destruction. A factionless hobo. Or the three of them.Through the game the Shaper will stumble over shinny canisters (that should have bio hazard labels all over them), these canisters are the almost only way to learn skills (if you join a faction, the Shaper can get a couple of extra skills).The fights are turn based, some are tough as nails some barely cut it. (Or maybe is just me going north when expresely warned to not go there in the early stages of the game, who knows?)	I personally loved the way the story lefts you with more questions than answers, and there are plenty of answers mind you.Things I learned:-The world is a better place thanks to the Shapers.-Serviles should never be left behind for whatever reason. Is better for all to destroy them first then leave in panic.-Never trade with the Sholai.	Best advice I'll give you: Speak with everybody before wasting Living Tools.continued in Geneforge 2 review			"

												I wanted to like this game. I'm sure that the game had many interesting choices to make that led to different stories. I didn't mind the poor graphics one bit, and I'm normally a fan of games like Baldur's Gate.In the end, though, I just couldn't get used to the terrible combat. It's infuriating. Make and ugprade a few meat shield creatures coupled with a few ranged ones and you're good to go. Just charge forward and hope that you don't die. And I say hope because it all really does hinge on luck. In games like X-COM, you might need to rely on a few lucky hits, but for the most part, some dumb mistake you made is responsible for your deaths. Your choices matter in games like X-COM. Too bad Geneforge isn't like that.In Geneforge, there are a-holes that can instakill your main character everywhere. Seriously, there are areas where more than 75% of the monsters can bring your main character from 100% HP to 0% HP. Even the second hostile monster in the game, the Thahd, can one-shot your main character. All any of those instakilling a-holes have to do is attack your main character, get a decent damage value from the RNG, and land the hit to trigger the game over screen. All you can do about it is pray that their AI picks on your creations rather than your main character or get bad RNG numbers if they do attack your main character. Too bad the AI doesn't always pick on your creatures. Sometimes, they just arbitrarily walk past your meat shield and give your main character a lethal smack, and that's it. And all of that happens on normal difficulty. On harder difficulties like torment, the monsters get better hit chance and damage, which means more one-shots on your main character. That's half the combat: just hoping that some monster doesn't one-shot your main character.If you can get over that hurdle, you'll have a good time. I personally couldn't ignore this problem though.			"

												Despite the first impression, the game is quite good. The world you can explore is pretty big and the game has more than one ending, depeding on your doings and the relationship between you and the various factions that dwell the island. The game relies a lot in textual descriptions of the environments you explore and the people you meet to make up for the plain graphics and limited art assets. Recommended if you don't mind a slow-paced game with an ""old school"" feel. Grab it when on sale with the rest of the saga.			"

tl;dr:  If this review is too long for you, you probably aren't going to enjoy this text-heavy game.  But you can skip to the summary at the end.REVIEWGo back to the very early stages of this millenium (when this game was released), and you might remember two things:  (1) fascination with emerging medical technologies surrounding genetic modification and (2) the Infinity Engine at its zenith.  Both of these influences can be found in Geneforge, which takes genetic modification as its theme, and uses a Baldur's Gate-like mechanic for its gameplay (although shorn of D&D rules and a conventional fantasy setting).Like the Infinity Engine games, Geneforge is an isometric, story-driven RPG which actually respects the *R*.  It takes place in several discrete zones spread out over a world map.  It is text-heavy.  The basic mechanics are much simpler here, however--simpler, but complicated enough to admit of sophisticated strategy.  It is also quite robust, giving many hours of gameplay to anyone interested in exploring everything.As an indie game, however, it is graphically ugly.  Much of the text exists to describe what more graphically advanced games would show without words.  The interface is sometimes incovenient, and you'll naturally find yourself irritated with some of the aspects of inventory management--although my own irritation might have a lot to do with my neurotic hoarding/organizing addiction.  (For a reference, check out some of the screenshots posted in the Steam community to get a sense of how loot can get away with you.)The open-endedness of the world can also be a curse as much as a blessing:  about halfway through the game, it's easy to lose focus on where you ought to be going.  (There's a nice FAQ out there, however, which can help out.[www.gamefaqs.com] If nothing else, check out the Matt P's numeric rating of the difficulty of each zone--this can give you a sense of what areas are best to tackle next.)To my mind, there are two main selling points to this game: (1) the novelty of creating and modifying creatures to aid you as you go about, and more importantly (2) the story.  But the attractiveness of the story needs some unpacking.The story is open-ended, and it involves you responding to some events on an island surrounding competing factions with conflicting motivations vying for power.  That's nice and all--although you can get that kind of fare elsewhere.  That's not where the real juice of this game lies.  The best part of the story isn't the plot proper, which concerns your character.  It's what has already happened in the *past*, and which you discover incrementally as you proceed.Think of yourself as a kind of archeologist, doing a dig.  You dig at a site, and discover what a certain society was like.  But if you dig a bit deeper, you might see the remains of a civilization that existed at an even earlier time.  Dig even deeper and...you get the idea.  The way I counted, there were *four* layers of history contained in this game, from the truly ancient to the recent past, and you fill in the pieces of this rich puzzle of what has happened on Sucia Island as you proceed.  (Incidentally, I have no idea if this pattern continues for other games in this saga, although I suspect not.)If the idea of playing the role of archeologist sounds like your cup of tea, pick up this game.  (You might also want to pick up Steven Erikson's fantasy novels, but I digress.)One final note:  This is the first of a long saga of 5 Geneforge games.  I haven't played those other games, but GF1 is quite satisfactory all on its own as a standalone title.  So, don't feel that you *need* to get drawn into the larger saga to enjoy GF.SUMMARY+ Open-ended, with interesting moral themes+ Simple but sophisticated gameplay+ Great story+ The novelty of shaping/creating your allies- Ugly- Lacks direction at times- Interface can be clunkyI'd recommend this game to anyone who can appreciate its intellectual flavor and doesn't mind primitive graphics.

												I played all of Geneforge 1 in 2005 or 2006, right around there.  More recently, I bought the game on Steam about 4 years ago and played some of the beginning.  What do I think of it?  It's a good game--I can't deny this.But in many ways it doesn't even come close when compared with some of the titles I feel to be truly great.  When I played it I compared it specifically to Final Fantasy 6 and Chrono Trigger, and the first Dungeon Siege, which were basically the only RPG's I'd played.  Like most typical RPG's your character increases in strength and abilities by killing enemies and completing quests.  But the classes differ vastly.Your character can be one of three classes: a Shaper, who specializes in creating living creatures directly from magic; an Agent, who is far more focused on using magic spells to inflict the actual damage; and a Guardian, whose specialty is dealing direct physical damage, mostly with swords.  I tested Shaper and Agent, but in the end enjoyed Guardian much more--the other classes seemed playable, but I think Guardian is easiest from my recollection, and didn't require as much micromanagement.  The gameplay is good, and in combat your character gets action points you can spend to move, fight, and use items and abilities.Combat makes up a lot of Geneforge, though you'll probably also spend lot of time talking to characters in the game, picking up items and selling them and trying to amass enough money to purchase the best items.But the best part of the game is the story.  You will learn more about magic, and the Geneforge in particular, a powerful piece of magical machinery that can greatly enhance those who use it properly.  You'll learn about the different magical creations in the game, learn about the different factions in the game (four of them IIRC), and learn about the history of the land you've been stranded in.  And much of the heart of Geneforge is freedom to choose--your character build, your faction, your ending.  If you sufficiently improve your character, you will be able to roll over most enemies.  Anyway . . . if this review sounds a little bland, perhaps it's because the game itself is kind of bland as well.  There are people who absolutely adore the whole idea of turn-based strategy, the idea of tactically micromanaging the actions of each of your party members, and carefully choosing their equipments and stats.  I used to be one of those people, when I first started playing RPG's, but less so today.  And if you are one of those people--I suspect that you will LOVE Geneforge.But these days, I suppose I feel I need more from a game.  I think all the micromanagement has gotten to me over the years.  But also, Geneforge has very little atmosphere or enjoyable character.  It has virtually no music, though it does have atmospheric sounds.  I can't remember the name of a single character from Geneforge--whereas I can remember the names of all the main characters from Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, even though it's been even longer since I played them.  Geneforge's environments are mostly brown--deserts and dirt, though there is some variety thrown in.  And--while the ability to create life in Geneforge is quite awesome--I didn't even feel that this aspect of gameplay was very fleshed-out.  The story in Geneforge is definitely interesting, and there is a huge volume of writing in the game, so if you're a big fan of reading in your games, I can see it appealing to you.  But frankly, I still feel that both FF6 and CT have significantly more interesting stories, characters, environments, and of course excellent music.Geneforge is a good game.  Some people love it.  You may.  Someday, I may go through and play the others in the series.  But . . . I didn't find a whole lot be excited by in this title, and I feel its impact is far less than it would have been than if, for example, the creator had even expended minimal effort to create a few characters that are really memorable.7/10			"

Pros:-Immersive storytelling-Solid plotline and setting-Nonlinear gameplay-Choices affect the ending and the game itself-Three very different classes-Small learning curve-Fun gameplay-Create your own servant creaturesCons:-Potato graphics-Outdated everything-Needs more autosave-Entirely text reliantOverall: Geneforge is one of those gems that sat in my games library forever that I swore I'd get around to eventually.  I'm glad I finally did.  When I first tried to play it, the graphics and sound and simplistic gameplay turned me off, and I put off playing the game.  However, having picked it back up, I can happily say that the game makes up for the lack of graphics and sound with excellent gamplay and a cool new world to explore.  I was surprised that such a simple design could give so much freedom to the player in how they interact with the world.The fact that it's so simple actually works in the game's favor.  Gameplay is straightforward and challenging, but not because the controls are clunky, but because every situation requires careful planning.  The plot is good enough to keep you invested, and at least for me, the gameplay was entertaining enough that I kept playing long after I could have ended the main plotline just because I wanted to explore the world more.If you have trouble with games that rely on text to tell the story, this might not be for you.  If you have trouble with older looking games, I'd encourage you to give it a shot.  I'm glad I managed to look past the graphics long enough to let the game grow on me.  And this game has sold me on playing the other four as well.Just remember to save.Bottom Line: Definitely worth the money.  You can usually get the whole saga on a heavy sale, too.			"

												Spiderweb have been developing intricate old school titles for quite some time.Ever since the Exile series in my infancy I have been content to order crude sprites around, mostly to kill other crude sprites. The Exile series achieved a number of impressive feats: Mechanically competent gameplay that offered a variety of approaches, the coveted feel of open world exploration rife with secrets and side quests, a well-executed story, culture and competent descriptive prose, and a scope that contributed to a sense of journey, progress and achievement - even some elements of long-term choice and effect. All this put together in the early to mid 90’s and your customizable party (of all Sliths specializing in polearms) was in for a great time.Most of these features - including turn based action-point combat - seem to have been translated more or less to the Geneforge series. Rather than races, a party and free point allocation, Geneforge sees 1 character (and possibly an army of pets)...			"

												I've played quite a bit of Jeff's games, newer ones (Avadon 1 & 2 for example) don't appeal to me nearly as much as the first of the Geneforge games. Why is that? Geneforge 1, 2 & 3 pose moral questions, give you difficult choices to make and present some rather enjoyable gameplay. I seriously wish Spiderweb would make their newer games less linear, I miss the choice element, I miss the freedom and constant worrying about what would change if I tell this guy I think Serviles should be free. I'm currently playing Geneforge 3, after finishing 1 and nearly finishing 2. If you're just starting out with Spiderweb's games, Geneforge 1 is definitely the way to go.			"

												Concidering this game is from 2001, and made by a single developer, this game really gives you value for the money. The area is huge, and the ammount of time needed to explore everything easily surpasses 60 hours. So if you wish to play an rpg that also implements the ""role playing""-part this game will hit right home.The biggest downside of the game is the graphics. Even in 2001 these graphics were slightly outdated. However, if you don't need the sharpest graphics, this game will give you one hell of a ride.			"

												I give the game +1, but I don't recommend it for purchase. Too much of the game isn't explained to the player, so you learn everything through trial and error. You will be dying a lot. You will be reloading a lot, and saving a lot. And I'm just not a massive fan of that mechanism of playing games.There were a lot of cool things in the game - like NPCs that take your exp to give you items, and there are small factions you can become allies with. You can do pretty much anything, but this game is over 10 years old and it shows.If it's on sale buy it and try it. I like playing older games because I like to see how they were designed and how they function. Upon purchasing this game I had no intention of actually finishing the series, and after my first few hours I think I've found a vast majority of what the game has to offer.A good game as a case study, but not something I would recommend actually playing to have fun.

												I have never written a review on here, but considering this is one of the best games and one of the most underated games ive ever played, ive decided to try my hand at it. Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay. Pro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.          Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike.            LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri  have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.          Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.          Can easily engulf you in for weeks.          Lots and Lots of TextCon's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination            Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.           Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.Overall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing. Heres to you, Spiderweb Software.			"

												Finally something pretty unique in the RPG genre. A game that's not just about seeing how many goblins you can bop on the head or how much gold you've shamelessly stolen by the end of the adventure. The Geneforge series is all about story, strategy and whether or not, you're willing to sacrifice Binky (your sadly under-leveled Fyora) for a brand spanking new, just off the line, Terror Vlish (you might name him Keith). Now in any other RPG this is an easy choice - Binky doesn't even have time to say goodbye to his best friend Crispin (a dependable Clawbug), before you've reabsorbed him and used his essence to create Keith. But this is the bit that makes Geneforge different - Keith might be better in every possible way, but you two haven't taken a journey together from the Bandit Woods, through the Thorny Fen, and down into the (horrific) Mines. You and Binky have a partnership and you're not about to give him up, not even for Keith (with his awesome name). Eventually you'll either decide to give up Binky (Crispin still gets a far off look in his eyes whenever he smells roasted Ornk) or you'll keep Binky and find another way to survive the Labs. It'll take more healing, planning, tools and a fair bit of luck, but Crispin won't be crying himself to sleep every night. And that's what Geneforge is about. At its core, it's game where you create creatures to fight for you, that you actually weirdly start caring about (sorry Jiggly Puff). It's a journey, both plot and game mechanic wise of hard decisions. At the end you'll never feel completely happy with the choices you've made and that's the sign of a good game. There's no right or wrong in Geneforge, only things you did because you followed your gut.			"

												Played this game for each of the multiple endings before it came to steam, so I've played 100+ hours. The geneforge series is a niche CRPG that allows you to play different playstyles. Graphics are outdated and the sound is pretty bad, but the writing is still good and the mechanics work well. This one was my favourite one personally because of the island setting, but Geneforge 4 were where the grapics updated.			"

												Old school western RPG.If you have played anything like Fallout 1-2, or maybe Baldur's Gate, you should feel right at home here. Although it's an early 2000 game, the interface feels like it's from the mid 90s - makes sense, Jeff Vogel is essentially a one man development team.But why do I recommend this game? Because Jeff Vogel creates wide open worlds with large amounts of content, alternate paths, and meaningful quests. Throughout my ~35 hours of play, the only parts that felt like a grind/chore were a few specific areas (<1 hour, because I chose to ignore them) that had large swarms of mobs roaming the map, or environmental damaging effects that were too annoying to deal with. The only quests that felt like the reason of being given as ""because ♥♥♥♥ you, that's why"" were few, played for good effect, and completely optional. Speaking of optional quests and really open worlds, it is technically possible to beat it by performing the only quest that you get at the very beginning - Get Off Sucia Island. Of course, you miss out on a fair amount of treats Geneforge will offer you. Combat is alright, but hardly optimal. Pathfinding is trash - you gotta manually path out a lot of movement or face the consequences of letting the pathfinding handle it. RNG can be somewhat harsh - 50 max hp, take 8 damage, take 6 damage, take 41 damage, dead. Frequent saving and/or high risk aversity can negate this. Despite all of that, there is a variety of playstyles, builds, and spells that make combat entertaining enough.In summary, if you are willing to overlook the flaws associated with an aged genre, you will find world building and open-ended questing/exploration strong enough to rival the best of titles in that category.NOTE: There is a slowness issue in this game that is not patched by default. Follow this guide if necessary. http://steamcommunity.com/app/200960/discussions/0/864973123623076155/ "

												Everything by Spiderweb software is guaranteed (By me) to be a wonderful RPG experience.  The graphics are terrible (The first Geneforge game came out in 2002), but looking past them you will find an engrossing story, awesome turn-based strategic gameplay, and a ton of endings and optional locations along the way.  My favorite series by Spiderweb is Geneforge, but all of their games are worth checking out. Sidenote: There is a HUGE deal on steam, which allows you to get all 5 Geneforge games in a bundle for only $20.  Seriously, you are doing yourself a favor by purchasing these.			"

												It's $19.99 per game, but still $19.99 for the entire saga, and steam has a -75% off sale from time to time, allowing you to purchase all 5 games for like $3.99, which is a GREAT deal. I've spent like 40-60 hours per game, and over 100 hours on the fifth one, totalling to over 300 hours of just playing Geneforge; and I still plan on replaying the entire saga one last time when I have the time to!I'll be frank with you; Geneforge isn't renowned for excellent graphics and pictures (except for perhaps the cool cartoonish drawings you get at the beginning; those are pretty cool), but the storyline is GREAT. The music was awfully disturbing, but that's just my opinion, because I'm a scaredy cat and I don't like having ominous music playing in the background while I'm walking through a dark and creepy forest. And then a monster comes at me from outside my sightlines causing me to throw my mouse at my laptop.I decided to get the saga near the middle of my summer vacation, so I ended up spending about 8 hours per day just glued to my laptop playing geneforge. Sometimes I forgot to eat. Still no regrets.			"

												Geneforge from Spiderweb Software is a old school indie RPG Game. It is dated, sure, but it still has a lot of charm.The first part of the game introduces the player into the world of Geneforge, the Island Sucia was abandoned 200 years ago and you are stranded on the Island. You have to make a choice which of three selectable classes you will take, later in the game you'll also be member of one of the factions (sects) each with benefits and codex.The selection you make during the game will change the outcome of the game, and this long before the genre of visual novels was envisioned. The area of this game isn't exceptionaly large but it has good stories to tell, and a lot of hard obstacles to overcome. The difficulty of the game can at times be misleading, but that isn't a drawback, it is in fact a virtue of the game. The game is not a high end graphical game which might come to some as a bad thing, but graphics often don't play such a great role in RPG games, at least not in the elder games. Of course the game still had potential to be even better than what was achieved, but you can play this game and still have a lot of fun, or get utterly frustrated by a random encounter with too many foes that were too strong for you and your creations. I can recomend this game based alone on the RPG virtues of the time when it was created.			"

												Geneforge (part 1) places you on a mysterious island dwelling in a fantasy world that is run by Shapers, the masters of creation. You, yourself a Shaper (or one of the two other classes), don't know anything about the island except it's declared barren, i.e. forbidden to go to. An accident of sorts forces you to try and discover the mystery that is the Sukia Island.For those of you who love a good roleplaying game, here's one. The graphics and sounds are simple but the mechanics works and Fogel's script feels magical and creates a  thrilling atmosphere that keeps in touch throughout the game. Why, the game even has replayability value with 3 different professions and 3 different distinct factions to ally with. This is rather lot for such a simple-looking yet deep game.			"

												I have nothing bad to say. I haven't finished the game, although the storyline and interest lever are constant- I don't get bored. Not recommended for those who enjoy fast pace, action pacted gaming. The graphics are clean, and that's my reason to play. Nothing is blurry, and all of the items are clear and easy to understand if they were not explained. The game content itself is creative and keeps me interested.You won't have to worry about repetition or ignored detailing to the story that is important. I can't wait to finish and get going on the rest of the series- 10/10			"

												This may not look much but it is an amazing RPG.  Spiderweb know how to build these games at their purest level and while it may not have the narrative complexity or mechanical depth of Arcanum or Planescape but the essence is distilled to perfection.  Just enough progress and just enough action to keep you playing way beyond the time you were supposed to sleep.  Even when you quit it has that draw that has you loading the game up again an hour later.Top notch!			"

												Admittedly, I'm not 100% through this game yet, but I'm just absolutely BLOWN AWAY by how awesome this game is. Its gameplay, storytelling and style is reminiscent of the old Baldur's Gate series, and other games of that era. Overall, it's an excellent sci-fi/fantasy epic, and I am thoroughly reassured by the fact that after I finish battling through this game, I have four more games in the series to take a run at.The only downside is that much like other games in this style, there is a tendency to say ""Oh, I'll just do *one more quest*"", and then to end up playing the game for 6 more hours.Anyway, great game. Highly recommended.			"

												The grafics are abysmal, sounds are unremarcable, and at first glance there are very few ways to build your character. So people that care only for those features in games - stay away.Those who love old classics like first two fallouts, planescape or arcanum - you will like this game. Amazingly made world. Very good story. Lots of well written text. Unforgiving punisments for stupidity - if some action may kill you, the game will NOT tell that to your face, you will have to guess that yourself. So, don't trust inviting pools in the middle of nowhere :)Absolute freedom of movement. There will be no such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when some NPC blocks your path and says ""You must do some stupid quest to pass"" and even if there were you can always just kill him.Anyway, I love this game, going to explore it fully and then move to the next part. Those guys developers truly understood what was so amazing in fallout series.			"

												I remember finding the demo for this gem on some digital distribution platform pre-bundled with my computer (e.g., bloatware) probably around eight years ago or so and just loving it. I was never fond of isometric RPGs until I played this game. I ended up buying the full game and its sequel and played the crap out of them.By some freak chance, I noticed the entire series on sale on Steam yesterday and bought it right away. Since my main computer's busted, I can't play any graphics-intensive stuff, so this is just perfect. Absolutely recommend this, 100%, especially to RPG fans. Not sure if the demo's on Steam, but I'm sure it's around if you want to try it out first.			"

												I actually played this game ages ago around the time a demo was released for Geneforge 2 I think?Anyway I do recommend this game, but only to people who are into turn based strategy style rpg combat. The game does have some things to be 'desired', one of them being companions/creations who can genuinely level and a better reason to keep around old ones.This game has a sort of 'old style' charm to it with simple RPG leveling, stats to put points into and different classes to play. Graphics aren't amazing, but if you really want (like I did) you can go edit them a bit (not sure if you can do this with the steam version ) (I turned my shaper into a hot elf chick cuz I can).The gameplay is solid, though it takes a bit to get used to the 'looting' system where you open the grab menu and you look at all the items around you or click containers to view what's inside. Stats and stat paths can determine if you are skilled enough to go certain ways and it's entierly possible to get through the game without REALLY fighting. I played a mixed route and tried my best to see it all and found it difficult because I wasn't specialized, but it was ok in the end since I reached a point where I felt I was 'thinking' about the combat, but also doing quite well by using some items correctly and also by positioned right, etc.One of the best reasons to play the game though is the rich story, lore and plot. The game has 'canisters' that can enhance you throughout the game and although I don't want to ruin anything, I will just say that using them can affect the ending. So can a LOT of the actions performed. I think there is anywhere from 3 to 20ish different endings, only around 4 of which I really saw, 1 being death cuz duh it happens.Summed up, solid game, old world charm, slow paced, good story. Definitely recommended.			"

												Geneforge 1. Feel the retro! The game is relatively good, if you can take the old school. The graphics feel old, the play control definitetly feels old, and the dungeons and difficulty will kick your butt if you don't play carefully, even on Normal difficulty. Which can be good and bad. Further, the strategy elements are actually fairly well done. I started out with a pair of fire spitters, and using the whole ""move and cover"" thing actually works out just about right. As a note - if you go for minions, do not let the AI control them. The AI isn't bad at it, but it will drop the ball occassionally with pathfinding and enemy choices, and it tends to go looking for trouble if there isn't an immediate threat.If your in the mood for it, few Steam games can scratch that old school rpg/strategy itch better than Geneforge. If that isn't what your after, try Geneforge 3 or 4 for an upgraded version instead.			"

												Don't get me wrong; I adore Jeff Vogel and I grew up with hundreds of hours on Exile III. I *really really wanted* to play and love Geneforge. I would *love* to play through the story...but the engine is just impossible to play with.The screen is tiny and can't be modified, it forces fullscreen, and for some reason the simplistic sprites introduce *massively* slowed responsiveness as you clear out a map. At times it takes half a second or more between clicking and taking a step, and it makes no sense why this is the case.There's another Jeff Vogel game... Avernum: Escape from the Pit. It's fantastic. The issues with the engine are fixed and it runs much smoother. Get *that* one, not Geneforge.			"

												Despite being released in 2001 this game lacks the graphical sophistication of titles of that era. Do not let that fool you though. Geneforge's graphical style is a throwback to those glory days of early pre-console gaming; a visual feast of animated pixels. What we have here is an incredibly immersive RPG reminiscent of the days when games kept you playing not because the last achievement is to kill a bajillion goblins but because it's genuinely interesting. The plot is original and offers multiple endings based upon the many decisions you'll have to make while playing and the turn based, AP driven combat system allows you to play in a variety of styles as suiting your character choice, be it a warrior, rogue or summoner. Throw in a well thought out stat system and this feels less like a video game and more like a DnD adventure with bonus graphical interface. With all 5 titles in the saga available for £16.99 (yes, it's a bundle) how can you not be playing this?			"

This is all largely done by one guy doing what he knows, but people who don't love RPGs will feel like they've been eating Tolkien-fantasy flavored Caloriemate. However, what makes these games is the story and the sheerminded adherence to old school RPG gaming. I'm not even scratching the surface with Geneforge, but I know I like creating a caveman and using him to kill dinosaurs and cobras with one punch, so take that as a recommendation if you must.

												The sequel to every Spiderweb game usually improves on the previous entry in every way. This game is no exception to that rule, lacking the polish and balance of the latter games Geneforge 1 still holds up to the rest of the series as an all around solid entry.			"

												I'm just going to copy/paste the same blurb for all the Spiderweb CRPGs I've played.I recommend this game for its fun and detailed writing and lore. Also for its oldschool (and low budget but in a good way) feel.Gets my ""Reading Fun Time"" stamp of approval.			"

												The Geneforge series is one of those classic RPG's that defined RPG gaming back in the late 90's and early 2000's. I'm honestly surprised that the development team is still around and still making games. This pleases me greatly.			"

												Awesome game, lots of hard choices that make the game meaningful. Both in character development and a roleplaying aspect. You end up constantly searching for more cannisters, wanting more power, but secretly wondering if you are making the 'best choices' for your character (which 'forces' you to explore more of the landscape).If you dont care for Steam's DRM protection it is also available on both Desura and (I do believe) GOG, which I would recommend because it is a pain in the neck to get 'work offline' to work consistently, especially if you don't have internet access. Steam is my last choice these days simply due to its abhorrent methods of enforcing DRM.			"

The iso is disorienting, the graphics are somehow worse, the controls are almost entirely mouse-based, and bringing up the menu or saving takes FOREVER. There's also no character editor, which it needs because of all the opportunities to ruin your savegames with bugs and bad combat rolls.The story is ok.			"

												Nice idea for a game, but poor execution. It is an early version of an indie company game so it's not bad. It has potential, but this game just isn't polished enough for the big leagues. The graphics are just good enough to tell friend from foe. Music is non-existent. The sound is either a 10 second loop of kids making noise, or birds chirping. I just muted the game and ran my music in the background. Gameplay is okay for a while, but then it's just boring clearing out the extra areas. For the price it's okay, but I'd recommend avoiding this game. This company has slight improvements in it's other games which are almost the same.			"

												If you like old Ulima Style RPGs, pick up the Geneforge Saga (it's 5 games, 1-5) next time it goes on sale for cheap) The graphics have classic pixel era charm (because its a dated series), but the ui allows mouse use and is all around much more predictive of the where game would go after. Spiderweb games other more recent games are also for sale here and elsewhere- Averium 4-6 and the remake of 1, and Avadon: The black fortress. This is some of reto rpg/tbs at its finest.			"

												This series is a good example of classic-style open world RPGs like Fallout. The story does moral ambiguity very well, particularly as the series goes on. Compare that to a lot of modern games where your only options are ""Barf rainbows and friendship"" or ""Be a complete psychopath."" And as the type of person who can't seem to choose anything other than rainbows and friendship, this series made me feel really uncomfortable. (Which is good; stories should make you feel things.)While the gameplay is good, it can sometimes fall victim to the ""Dominant Strategy"" trope. Dungeon too dangerous for your squishy wizard? Just have your creations scout ahead while you hide in a pantry! Character building isn't completely open, but it's done in a way that makes sense. Playing as someone specializing in the magical arts? They aren't exactly going be become Conan overnight. And you may think that getting all the stat-increasing canisters you can would be a no-brainer... Think again.All in all, I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys classic PC RPGs, or anyone who enjoys a good (soul-crushing) story.			"

												Before I clarify my thoughts on Geneforge, I must ask a question. What, to you, makes a good game? There are many potential answers to that question, all of them valid. If, however, you rely on graphics for the sake of immersion you will not enjoy Geneforge. Its graphics are rather primitive, even considering their age. If you cannot bring yourself to overlook the game's presentation, that's understandable. But if you can see past the rough edges, you will find an RPG with a lot to offer.If graphics are the lowest point of Geneforge, story is the highest. The game takes place in a creative and well-realized world where science and magic combine into an entire discipline based on creating life. Those who wield this power, called shapers,  hold immense social and political influence over the setting. Entire species owe their existence to these mad scientists of the magic world, and the shapers are quick to bring that up and exploit it. On the island where the plot is set, long-abandoned creations get these quaint ideas like ""free will"" and ""fair compensation"". It's up to the player to decide to what extent they support the rights of the created beings, if at all. Choices like that are common in Geneforge, and railroading the player's decisions is refreshingly rare. None of the story paths is presented as the absolute most ethical--each faction has flaws and benefits, both to the NPCs and to the player. Not allying yourself to any of them is possible but more difficult.The game play itself is adequate, but personally I only saw it as a vehicle to access more of the plot. Make of that what you will.In summary: Geneforge is a game that must be viewed with certain expectations in mind. There are a number of obvious budget and technical constraints at work, which may turn away those with little tolerance fo such things. Those who can endure despite its flaws will find a game with immense personality, well worth the effort required to uncover its riches. Give it a shot. "

												It's one of the older games on Steam; but it holds up like it's Atlas. Built primairly around atmosphere, the first of the Geneforge games is adicting to anyone who likes questing and exploration.It should be noted that you may start to burn out after a long time if you don't know where you're going. I got stuck wandering for several hours, simply because I didn't go to a bridge to cross. But by that point, I'd pushed myself to near max level and was able to clean through whatever was left.With multiple endings, several factions you can join, and a healthy challenge curve between the different classes, there's days of replayability to be found.Pro tips though for anyone playing a shaper class: Intelligence is your friend. I know you only get 6 skill points to spend with each level, and one point in a main stat costs 5 to level up. But it's worth it in the long run. I also spent a lot on fire/magic shaping and leadership and mechanics. Investing in shaping skills will raise the base level and starting stats of any creature you create. Most people will tell you to specialize. I kind of prefered having a mix. I had them both up to around 9 or higher. Anyone that says mechanics is good at 10 is a freakin liar! There were obstacles that required me to have as high as 15 mechanics in the late game! Leadership should be good at 12. Though I've seen some encounters that suggest higher is needed.You'll come across 3 factions in the game: The Awakened, Obeyers, and Takers. You'll learn about them as you go. A fair warning: joining the Awakened seems like a good idea because you encounter them first... But they have the least to offer for the majority of the game. It seems as if the game was built more for the Obeyers and Takers.Difficulty may ramp up at times. Just come back when your a few levels higher and you should be good. But there are 2 levels where you'll get screwed the first 8 times, guaranteed. The power core, and a freezer level. As you walk around, you'll take damage. And if you're out of combat, this will kill you very... VERY quickly at random. Your only means of survival is to bring lots of healing spores and stay in combat mode as often as necessary. The freezer level can at least allow you to shut the cold off at a bit of a risk, should your mechanics skill be high enough.Enchanted items will also be your friend. So stock up on the best equipment you can find. And don't make your character a work horse. It's not worth it. The game does a really good job at saving things, so you can keep a pile of junk wherever you want in the world (you can fast travel btw).I'd certainly recommend getting this game, preferably with the collection at a discount. It's well worth the cost of admission.			"

												The first of five isometric turnbased squad combat RPG's, basically open world, wherein a society of medieval fantasy wizards can create life and abuse the privelege about as much as one would expect.  Memorable zones include the biological hazardous waste dump, a few areas where someone screwed up so bad the water is orange, and a variety of local villages and ancient cultures to disrespect.  Quite a few factions to work with or against, one of which literally worships you.Solid game from the makers of Exile and Avernum.Gameplay comments: I hate mines.  Combat automatically starts whenever you see an enemy (or sometimes when one is /just/ offscreen), and in some zones they're placed close enough together that you can't actually leave combat, and must move your entire squad unit by unit through the whole level until everything is dead.  I love watching my flock of dragons rampage over everything.  I have seriously considered summoning a herd of pig-cows and trying to use those as my minions, but they walk slightly too slow for my taste.  The dialogue and area design are excellent, though I'm sad I don't have more options.  I really liked unravelling the twisty history of the island, and highly reccomend cheating just enough to have maxed out leadership (talky skill) and mechanics (unlocky skill).  They open a lot of doors, literally and otherwise.			"

This game really is fun, strategy, mystery, the turn base combat is nice. I recommend this game to anyone who likes to read, it has a lot of text. Make sure you increase your leadership skill so you can unlock interesting things to say to the people of the game. Unlocking a new creation is really exciting, too.			"

												as fun as it is underated; Geneforge is an isometrical turn based strategy rpg, the style of the game mechanics is like the original fallout games. You move your character, then you attack or don't. I like the ally mechanic of this game alot; you learn abilities to create allies throughout the game (if you play as a shaper) these allies then get re absorbed into your mana whenever you choose to do so. an interesting feature is that when you are choosing an ally to summon you can enhance certain stats of that ally, but doing so uses your mana (I believe it's mana, I haven't played in some time), or you can choose to do the bare minimum when making the creature and summon multiple allies. I highly recommend this game espescialy for it's cheap sale price right now.			"

The turn based combat was a nice change of pace for me and took me back to the good old days of gaming. There is no voice acting so you have to read the dialog. (Shocking, I know.) There is no need to monitor your FPS. This game will be gentle with your graphics card. (and sound card). If these things bother you then this isn't your game.If you like a well thought out story with more than one path to the end game, give this a try.A fun game from a great little game company.			"

												Geneforge 1My hours of game play dose not reflect my actual game time as I play mostly offline. I have over 52 hours in this game.This game is utterly amazing: a different take on CRPG where you are the Shaper and you create your party members through your own abilities.  It is a Fatasy setting with a twist of science fiction blended into a story that is both moving and fantastic. It will lead you into various adventure quests as the story is non-linear.  It has a ton of maps to explore especially when you find that lone canister hidden in a locked away room and you click on it to alter your shapers genetic code--what surprises will the canister yield upon your Shaper--you never know.  The game is old, the graphics may not appeal to some, especially to those younger gamers who are accustomed to high fidelity graphics and game play.  This is a turn base combat style game and should not be mistaken as a Diablo clone just because it has an isometric perspective, it is far from a Diablo style game.  If you're new to CRPG and you have purchased this game or had gotten it for free I would suggest playing it on easy mode it can still be quite challenging at times.  The other modes are much too difficult for someone new this format of gaming, once you get the feel of the mechanics, feel free to set your challenges higher: Normal, Tricky , and Torment-- frustration and delight awaits you in those modes.Overall, this is one of my favorite games next to Planescape: Torment, Ultima 7, and System Shock 2, in fact, I bought the entire saga and am looking forward to playing all five games.

												The Geneforge series is an incredibly unique  top down rpg. Choose to be a beefy melee, or a tricky summoner, or go all out glass cannon with a high damage caster fighter. Worth every penny for the whole series, interesting and engaging story line is worth the time. BONUS!!! its oldschool enough to have cheatcodes so u are good to go for f***-around games.			"

												This series is a good example of classic-style open world RPGs like Fallout. The story does moral ambiguity very well, particularly as the series goes on. Compare that to a lot of modern games where your only options are ""Barf rainbows and friendship"" or ""Be a complete psychopath."" And as the type of person who can't seem to choose anything other than rainbows and friendship, this series made me feel really uncomfortable. (Which is good; stories should make you feel things.)While the gameplay is good, it can sometimes fall victim to the ""Dominant Strategy"" trope. Dungeon too dangerous for your squishy wizard? Just have your creations scout ahead while you hide in a pantry! Character building isn't completely open, but it's done in a way that makes sense. Playing as someone specializing in the magical arts? They aren't exactly going be become Conan overnight. And you may think that getting all the stat-increasing canisters you can would be a no-brainer... Think again.All in all, I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys classic PC RPGs, or anyone who enjoys a good (soul-crushing) story.			"

												A great game if you can see past the (all too often moronic) player party AI and clunky interface.A large open world in the vein of Baldur's Gate, with quite a lot of decision making.However, I lost count of how many times I got wiped out in melee due to clicking the character (end turn) instead of the enemy (attack) which is a matter of pixels. Also frequent was the pathfinding deciding that instead of using the 3 action points walking to the enemy and 5 attacking them, it'd be more fun to spend all 8 running backwards and forwards around invisible obstacles. When most battles can end in 2 or 3 turns, each missed opportunity can lead to you being straight back at that damn 'you are dead' screen.Possibly not for the easily frustrated.			"

												This game does not have any flashy eye candy but it has a well developed story with an interesting take on magic and few technical bugs.I had a lot of fun with this. The turn based combat was a nice change of pace for me and took me back to the good old days of gaming. There is no voice acting so you have to read the dialog. (Shocking, I know.) There is no need to monitor your FPS. This game will be gentle with your graphics card. (and sound card). If these things bother you then this isn't your game.If you like a well thought out story with more than one path to the end game, give this a try.A fun game from a great little game company.			"

The only thing I would add to other reviews is that the $22 price shows up on every search result for Geneforge separately, and my love is not $110 strong. I came to add the set of games to my wishlist, but realized the pack of 5 was $22. Certainly worth it, but not everyone might come as far as I. Y'all should find a way to split the collection to reflect individual prices that can be collected together.			"

												This game was shareware title for Mac computers in 2001. In other words: It's old. It really shows thatGraphics are primitive. Sound quality is atrocius. Interface leaves lot to to be desired. Combat is rather simple and performance is rather choppy, especially on Win7.But...everything I just wrote doesn't really count if you're die hard RPG fan as I do.I'm having so much fun with this title like with none other RPG title l played lately.What really shines here is that it has intriguing story and you can really ""role play"" your character around it.Very good writing makes up for it's low quality making the game world very lively and immersive.So few games now focus around such basic concepts that it really stands out.This game deserves to be played.

												One of my favortie games of all time.World, Setting, and Story: You're a shaper (magical sorcerer people who can create life from humaniods to drakes to raptors) about to be some apprentice when ship gets attacked and dies with you on a quarintined island. You find huminoid creations that your ancestors left behind have built 3 separte sects with different philosophies, and that there are human invaders (not your people) on this forbidden island. Learn the secrets on why the island was barred and fight to survive (or use diplomacy). This game has more possible endings than a top rate visual novel.Gameplay and mechanics: excellent leveling system. boost stats with points earned from level up. level from completing quests, killing things, and unlocking things. use magic, use physical combat, use your creations, it's up to you. combat involves an action point system. It's turn based, but you have action points to limit what you can do. Move, use an item, or attack. Your creations that follow you also get their own turn (and really, who doesn't want a pet raptor).Buy it. It was good enough for several sequels.			"

												A unique game, that's for sure. A healthy mix of fantasy and sci-fi where you play as one of three classes; shaper(mage),guardian(warrior), and agent(rogue). They can all use magic, however the shaper is the strongest when it comes to casting spells and shaping. Shaping is a type of magic that is the main bread and butter of the game because you get to create your own minions,pets,followers,soldiers,etc. to fight for you. Eventually you can level up your creations' stats, for example you can increase their strength to make them more effective in a fight. However be prepared to read, cuz this game is like a friggan book. What this games lacks in cutscenes and or intricate animations, makes up for in highly detailed descriptions.			"

If not, then does the shaper have absolute rule over their creatures regardless of their concent?

												Geneforge 1My hours of game play dose not reflect my actual game time as I play mostly offline. I have over 52 hours in this game.This game is utterly amazing: a different take on CRPG where you are the Shaper and you create your party members through your own abilities.  It is a Fatasy setting with a twist of science fiction blended into a story that is both moving and fantastic. It will lead you into various adventure quests as the story is non-linear.  It has a ton of maps to explore especially when you find that lone canister hidden in a locked away room and you click on it to alter your shapers genetic code--what surprises will the canister yield upon your Shaper--you never know.  The game is old, the graphics may not appeal to some, especially to those younger gamers who are accustomed to high fidelity graphics and game play.  This is a turn base combat style game and should not be mistaken as a Diablo clone just because it has an isometric perspective, it is far from a Diablo style game.  If you're new to CRPG and you have purchased this game or had gotten it for free I would suggest playing it on easy mode it can still be quite challenging at times.  The other modes are much too difficult for someone new this format of gaming, once you get the feel of the mechanics, feel free to set your challenges higher: Normal, Tricky , and Torment-- frustration and delight awaits you in those modes.Overall, this is one of my favorite games next to Planescape: Torment, Ultima 7, and System Shock 2, in fact, I bought the entire saga and am looking forward to playing all five games.

												To anyone on the fence about buying this game i have one simple message: Do it!This game, no series, is probably one of the first games i ever played and to this very day i still find myself enjoying these. its definately worth the money. i would pay even more than what its offered at for all of these games because they are so good.This review is more for the entire series as a whole not just this game in particular. Pros:Campaign is wonderful(story of a ""powerful"" summoner stranded on a strange island by some unseen force)Combat is relatively simple(walk so many paces then smack the thing till it dies, or select your chosen battle spell and click desired enemy)Decisions made fairly early on will affect you in later gameplay(learn what each faction has to offer from that faction first before immediately siding with one)Simplified Stats(I could easily predict what every stat would affect and even if i didnt the game gives you a detailed analysis of it and even gives examples of how it would be useful)Plenty of choices(you can choose just about everything about your character and creations such as: battle formation, armor, preferred fighting style, prefered creations, etc.)No unkillable enemies(i dont think ive found a single npc that cant be killed with enough damage. whether or not you can deal that much damage is entirely up to level and skills)Graphics(in my opinion the graphics for this game are perfect and i wouldnt change them even if it were made today)Cons:Mods(sadly there are no mods for this game, at least not on steam that is)Resolution(this game is very old so you have to play the game in a very low resolution. if you have multiple moniters this might affect any windows configuration you have setup or even your desktop icons)Thats almost everything i can think of without spoiling what isnt told to you in the first screen of the game.So i hope this was helpful and someone gets to experience these amazing games because of me.

												First off, this is my first review I have ever done, being a person that tends to hide and not let the world know my opinions, that should show how much I appreciate these games. I have been a long time fan of Spiderweb's games for the last 6 or 7 years, I grew up playing these games, given that they were the demos from the Spiderweb website, but I never got bored of the limited length of them. having seen the 45$ 13 game bundle, I jumped on it. I have already beaten most of these games, and am thrilled to have them all now.As far as having an opinion of this game, first and foremost you should remember that this is one of their earlier games, and that it is an indie game. Now for the highlights of the games, though the artstyle might have that dated feel to it, it is a charming and unique style the developers have not strayed too far from, each of their different series have slightly different but similar art stlye, that, while simple, are quite intricate.The combat is, as others have said, turn based and based on speed stats which can be altered based on skills, items, or gear. The wide variety of companions you can summon makes for a large part of the tactical aspect of the game. You can choose between an average strength army, or a couple strong warrior creatures to assist you. I noticed some people didn't like the game based on all these different areas that have 'monsters so strong you can't beat them' or 'monsters killing me in one hit' but that is the fun of this game, the idea of it is, if you can't win, look for a different path, or try later, or use a different tactic. As long as you don't stick to running in with the same strategy 30 times in a row, dying each time, it shouldn't be too rough.Now, I might be placing this a little far down the list, but from the get go, you can pick several different characters based on your overall desires of game play, they are all rather diverse and skilled in their own special ways, but as such their skills might cost more or less skill points to learn.The depth of the story is all narrated in text, which in my opinion, I found to be more in depth then a cutscene, depending on how fast you read, it can be agonizing or delightful, the choices are almost always going to influence people and potentially anger them, or make them approve of you more. Dispite all my praise I am willing to give the game, no true review would be complete without admitting some flaws with the game (Personal opinion I feel) and so I will list several of the downsides to the game. First and foremost is, that if you ever learn of the little hidden cheat console you can access, it will remove all the fun of the game if you overuse it, I used it once and managed to clear most of the game in about an hour.Some of the area's do get rather tough, I will admit, I have managed to get a bit stuck in several areas. But there are generally about 4 or 5 areas you can go to at that time, or quests you can finish. With that said, all you need is a little side trip to finish some and you will manage to gear or level up to reach your needs for that challenging area. It is very easily a frustrating game with it's scaling, but worth every moment. The noises and sounds, while short and sweet, memorable and appealing, do tend to grate on the nerves after listening to them through the hours of play.In conclusion, if you have made it this far, you are either an avid reader of reviews, or you are truly interested in this game, and if you haven't purchased it, I would strongly reccommend it, that is, if you enjoy a nice text based turn based rpg with hundreds of choices and many outcomes. This game has a beautiful art style for it's time, and a long well thought out story that I can only imagine took many months to think out and many more to fine tune and decide upon. A truly unique gem to have among your collection.			"

												Being a fan of isometric RPG's this game is very table-top'y. Its not a poor game and its in an art style that is able to wistand the test of time due to the nature of the genre. Its a slow game to start, half an hour in and i havent made it past the set of tutorial areas but its good that it is babying me seeing as though the walls of text can feel overwhelming to someone new to the genre. Going through the interface wasnt bad either it is fairly neat and tidy. The only gripe i have is that the automatic camera wasnt working and I am forced to alternate mouse and arrow keys (no wasd support that i could find). i got this in the pack of all five and i was expecting to skip over this one because of how dated it seemed but i think ill give it a more flushed out chance.

												The demo of this and the rest of the series alone made up a majority of my childhood as it throws you into the game cutting off the rest of the world after you've poured a dozen hours or so into it. The story is long and interesting and it's a wonder to see how far south things end up in this series. If your a fan of turn based combat (be it you like to bust heads, throw magic or create massive hulking beasts of fire breathing Velociraptors to do your dirty work) This is the game for you. throw a large expansive world, game altering choices and the option to simply destroy everything and leave the island in flames and you've got the perfect game to sink your time into, just keep the Steam App or another computer screen open as this game doesn't have an overlay.

												I never heard about this game I just tried to buy and play it a few years ago (~2014).I was absolutely drown into story and game mechanics soon. In first hour I was like ""ok, that is interesting, but it would be not that good, look at graphics, they do not make enough and deep contenct"". And I was absolutely WRONG!Amazing game, can recommend.			"

												Geneforge is tough. Geneforge 1 especially. Didn't spec your character right? You'll just die in one area because you're not a tank. Figured out a good build? You'll probably run through the enemy like they're not even there. Want to play a Guardian? No you don't, don't be stupid. Play a Shaper, you idiot.Geneforge 1 almost feels like a prequel to the rest of the series. Plot-wise, it feels a lot more like 2 than any of the other games. Much more open-world and with more options. It's also the only Geneforge game you won't be able to discuss the philosophy of your sect with other Shapers, so morally it feels a lot more open. I recommend it, but only if you like these sorts of tactical-RPG-with-no-graphics-and-constant-moral-choices games. It's a really specific genre, but Geneforge 1 does quite well at it.			"
