												Edit: Protip #1 - Bunny hop. Protip #2 - RAVE GUNThis just kicked my nostalgia into overdrive. The teams at Big Boat and Rebellion have done a grand job bringing the shine back to this gem from the late 90s. The new lighting and particle effects, as well as high-poly models and hi-res retextures bring the magic back to the current generation.After the first samples of a mysterious material known as 'bio-metal' fell to Earth in 1952, the two major superpowers facing off in the cold war - the USA and the USSR - utilised it to construct amazing new prototype vehicles and weaponry. Ever seeking greater sources of power, this whole new world of technology spawned from the stars spurred on humanity's thirst for the untapped resources of deep space...One of the early [and sorely missed] action-strategy hybrid titles, Battlezone's first campaign casts you into a conspiratorial wing of the United States military - the National Space Defence Force (NSDF) - which is expanding out into the solar system during the cold war. The USA has used the smokescreen of the highly publicised Space Race to deploy a division of their military forces on the moon. What is this strange, otherworldly bio-metal scrap? Can such a malleable and strong substance really form naturally? All that truly matters at the outset is keeping it out of Russki hands at all costs...In the second campaign, you play from the perspective of a Russian cosmonaut on the other side of the conflict. The differing design philosophies of the two factions is striking. The Soviet Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA) favours brutal head-on attacks and overwhelming numbers. Beginning with much the same immediate goals in mind as the USA (though initially more intrepid and bold in their conquest), the USSR expand rapidly to the Red Planet. Of course, not all is as it seems, and the cosmonauts quickly find themselves wishing they were safely home in the Motherland's bosom, for the cold of space is not inviting, and grander things lurk just out of sight...--A great piece of alternate history fiction with excellent gameplay values. You can jump in and out of any given hover-vehicle to wander around on the surface of many planets and moons around Sol. With your trusty sniper rifle, you can whack hostile pilots from a distance and jack their ride, if you so choose. The combat is frenetic and satisfying, driven by the desire for ultimate control over these new resources. Perhaps the most gratifying element of this game is the fluidity of its movement. The jet-thruster-powered movement of most of the vehicles allows for some spectacular handling of rough terrain, cruising along at high speed and ramping off outcroppings of rock, lending the game abundant z-play opportunities. Moving effectively and working as a team is absolutely as crucial as landing hits on target.In many missions (as well as the instant-action and multiplayer[!!!]), designing, constructing and managing your base falls to you. The bio-metal is extremely versatile and can be used in conjunction with a Recycler vehicle to construct all manner of buildings, vehicles and bizzare, devastating weaponry, ranging from tanks and mobile turrets to howitzers, rocket platforms and walkers. You will need to protect your scavengers, deploy your battle lines and make offensive strikes on enemy positions, all the while keeping track of the number of pilots you have at your disposal, and that ever-crucial supply of bio-metal scrap. You can manage every unit in your force, every building and utility vehicle under your command, from anywhere on the very sizeable maps using the fairly intuitive command interface.Strategy and tactics evolve organically lending the gameplay as much or as little head-on action as you please, requiring you to source scrap fields and expand your production line and deny those same resources to your enemy. Your co-pilots are as effective in combat as you are, and you'll need all the help you can get throughout the challenging campaign.Pick this up, it's probably quite unlike anything else you'll play this year, and you won't regret it.

												Battlezone has always had a special place in my heart since I first piloted a Grizzly tank, on Mars, with an army at my back, facing an enemy just as powerful as I was. The concept is flawless- a masterful FPS and an intuitive RTS cleanly blended together in a hovertank space shooter. Remastering this timeless classic is one of the greatest revitalizations I've come across.The game offers a unique environment where standardized FPS elements are challenged and redefined. I am a huge fan of ammo shared between all of your weapons. Combined with the mobile, dynamic RTS that forces you to make decisions based on the type of terrain you're in and what the enemy is building, just like any RTS. However, the only thing I find lacking in the entire game is the RTS itself as I personally find it quite simplified, but in exchange for the complexity of strategy there is a first-person combat experience to steal the focus from.As a modder for the original game from 1998, I am enthusiastic about the capabilities the Redux has, especially Steam Workshop support. The unified and proven system Workshop offers will give my creations more exposure than ever before, something I look forward to and intend to make the best of.The game has survived eighteen years of existence. Some said Battlezone was ""the best game you've never played"". With the Redux, that will change. Battlezone is better than ever before, and it is destined to bring both old and new players back to the front lines.- blue banana			"

												An old gem from my childhood, Battlezone manages to perfectly merge RTS and FPS elements creating a kind of field commander experience that has yet to be effectively reproduced in the 18 years since its inception. Coupled with one of the best stories ever to be written for a video game, this is a game you absolutely can NOT miss out on.As for this specific re-release, it's as well done as anyone could ask for a game that's nearly 20 years old. Rebellion has seamlessly integrated the game into Steam's workshop and brought the graphics engine up to speed (or close enough for my liking, anyway) for modern systems, and brought everything into high resolution since we no longer run 640x480 on our systems any more.I cannot thank Rebellion enough for this!However, I must venture a warning. If you see this game and automatically think ""Activision? CALL OF DUTY!"" you're in the wrong market. When this game first came out, Activision made GOOD games. Do NOT buy this game if you're looking for a call of duty-esque game.See everyone on the Moon, or Mars, or wherever you dare face me.			"

												Have been playing this since the beginning and finally put away my 1.5 version about two months ago in anticipation of this Redux. Have just played the first couple of missions and am just blown away. It feels like the old BZ we know and love BUT it looks amazing. It's the little things that create a much more emersive experience like: better physics when you hit an enemy (when I saw that fighter dip and struggle - epic), explosions, enhanced lighting, particle effects, headlights, terrain and sky, and on and on.It may just be me, but it 'feels' like the enemy AI is smarter. They react to my strafing better and seem much more accurate (smart) - OR I could just be imagining that :-) I haven't tried any mulitplayer options yet, but that is coming soon.There was a lot of love put into this version and it shows. If you were a fan of the original - this will not let you down. If you've never played before... just do it. Now.			"

												I played this game back in the day (1998).  It was way ahead of its' time and in some ways is still ahead of the day.  The game is a 1st person style that combines resource gathering, building & RTS.  I've been really eager for modern game companies to create more games like this and I really hope someone does soon!  Definately buy this game!  :)			"

												This is the best game you've never played. It's the hidden gem of hidden gems.Set in an alternate 1960s where the space race is just a cover for a cold war turned hot, the United States and Soviet Union secretly deploy massive armies into space in pursuit of an extra-terrestrial substance, bio-metal, that can be used to craft amazing and powerful weapons of war. The National Space Defense Force (NSDF) and Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA) do battle over control of the bio-metal throughout the solar system using hover tanks crafted from the precious material. Battlezone has some of the best sci-fi lore of any game- don't skip over the briefings and debriefings! Battlezone has always had interesting gameplay because of the way it blends RTS and FPS elements. You primarily play the game from the view of the cockpit of your hover tank: you can hunt down enemy craft yourself and blow them away, OR, you can deploy your recycler (main production unit) at a nearby geyser power source and being collecting bio-metal using scavengers in order to build a base, defensive structures, and wingmen to take into battle with you. If you build a Comm Tower, you can take a satellite view of the battlefieldzone and command your wingmen in traditional RTS style, but you don't need to have a Comm Tower to effectively command all of your units (in fact, most often it is better to NOT take this approach).Battlezone 98 Redux (BZR) has received many improvements over the original game. These include highly improved terrain textures, models, lighting, menus, and more, and these alone make the game worth a purchase and play through. However, because BZR is built on the code of the 1998 release, some of the baggage from years ago has made its way into this game. The net code, though improved, still struggles from time to time, and having a good connection can be important to having an enjoyable online experience. (Overall this is has never been a problem for me, though.) The sound system also struggles mightily when there are many units in play or in a battle- it will eventually just choke and cut out completely until there are fewer units. The sound cutting out is a scenario that you're for the most part unlikely to encounter during regular gameplay, however.Keeping these small qualms in mind, the game is absolutely a steal at its current price, and will buy you hours and hours of fun in space. I SAID FUN IN SPACE!If any 90's game deserved a Redux, this was it. Especially if you never played the original (but even if you have!), this is a must buy.10 Grizzlies out of 10.			"

Product received for free
												Battlezone II was the game that got me into modding, narrative for games and composing for games. I played Battlezone a year later and it too blew me away. Being part of the team that beta tested its remastered version was an honour, and this is now one of my favourite games on Steam - and not just because it's my favourite game, now on Steam. It's overtaken the Bioshock series, the Half-Life series and Dishonored to get here, and if you get the chance you should give it a try. I've been recommending the Battlezone games to people for years and I'm not going to stop now.			"

												A very well-done remaster. One might argue that the graphics could've been even further improved and whatnot, but that's neither here nor there. As single-player the game plays the same as the original, and the original being one of my favorite games of all time, that's not exactly a bad thing! I haven't touched the multiplayer side yet, but will definitely check it out as well as the available tools for content creation.So far probably my biggest annoyance has been friendly unit AI, mainly scavengers which seem to have horrid pathing and constantly get stuck, for example in the second Mars mission. But I can't honestly remember if they were this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the original too.All in all if you liked the original, this makes it run and look that much nicer on modern computers and is definitely worth it, and for those who haven't tried the original it's still worth checking out in my opinion. I really hope they'll do a redux of Red Odyssey as well as Battlezone II too!			"

												Let's think about this for a moment here.The story involves The Cold War cover up where the actual battles took place all over space. Space tank space race. The gameplay is an incredibly well thought out combination of a squad based fps shooter with command and conquer-esque rts elements which has only been done just a few times, none of which has come close to Battlezone in execution.Because let's face it, there is no reason to attempt it again. It was done perfectly the first time and all future attempts will fall short of greatness.The base building is satisfying as you go from a small recycler to a full-on citadel of gun turrets and mines as you balance a need to finish off the mission as well as keeping your scrap intake moderated so you do not inadvertantly starve yourself of resources. That's where the first-person squad based gameplay comes in. There are a wide variety of different tanks to choose from with a varying degree of playstyles between them, starting from a nimble and weak Scout/Fighter to a slow, powerful Walker/Golem. Bread and butter Tanks to niche fillers such as Rocket Tanks and Bombers to tackle specific situations that may arise as you fight over a planet. No one tank feels completely useless and all feel as if they can be useful in a one-on-one fight if used/maneuvered correctly. If you choose that the fps gameplay isn't exactly your sort of thing, there exists more traditional RTS elements through satellites that give an overhead view of a map where you can micromanage your tanks effectively rather than blow things up yourself.It is legitimately my favorite game, and now it has an HD remake and runs perfectly on a modern PC.This game and all it offers deserves a playthrough, because it never got a fair shake when it initially came out. Think about it for a moment, Atari released boatloads of reboots of their old franchises and most of them were terrible because it did not do anything remotely interesting. Along comes another old arcade reboot which served as the antithesis of everything Atari was churning out. It not only features the badass story that hooks you on its sheer craziness, the gameplay has also aged incredibly well.Infinite recommends, you should play this and experience one of the most unique games to come out of the 90s. As jaded as I've become over video games along comes this one title I fawned over as a child which shows me that yeah, video games are still pretty great, and Battlezone is just as unique and entertaining as the day it came out. Battlezone revealed to me that I love video games, and it deserves to be your favorite game, too.			"

												Back when I was a little elementary school kid about 16 years ago, I got this game as a complimentary thing that came with a new computer, and probably put 1000+ hours into it beacuse it was so ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. To this day it's still probably one of the best and most memorable games I've ever played. It made my day when I saw the redux on the Steam Store, bought it in a heartbeat. Serious nostalgia overload. In 2016 I still think it's definitely worth checking out, especially since they've made it prettier and added mod support and hopefully there will be a decently sized multiplayer. Great soundtrack, and very interesting, challenging story. I miss the days where they made games like this. Try it. It's dank.			"

												There is no game that I would recommend more, and that is coming from someone who was raised on games like Half-Life and Deus Ex.Two fantastic campaigns ( The Red Odyssey Expansion coming soon.) , a menagerie of different units to utilitze and a ton of awesome locations to wage the Cold War on. Top all that off with great gameplay - combining FPS tank combat with real time strategy - and you have the perfect game. Great multiplayer too, if you can find a server.Granted, it is not for everyone. The movement is strange in comparison to games today, and the combination of FPS and RTS is very jarring. But, I implore anyone on the fence about buying this game to just do it.10 out of 10.May re-write this review after The Red Odyssey is released. Having never played TRO, it may change my thoughts.

												So as someone who has never played Battlezone but is a huge fan of action-strategy games, you'd think this would've absolutely blown my mind. After about 2-3 hours, I'm not so sure. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad, as far as a remaster goes, this is how it should be done... mod support, working multiplayer, ability to download new maps for instant action, graphical enhancements etc... this is a damn good remaster. I think my problem is truly just expectations. As someone who has heard about how amazing this game is and how it's pretty much the best action-strategy game to be released, all I can do is compare it to Uprising: Join or Die and how different philosophies they both are. Battlezone is slower, controls are floaty (because low gravity and hover tanks), units can be controlled directly and vehicles are all interchangeable with the player. You've also got 2 resources, scrap (metals) and pilots (nonrenewable). Scrap is gathered by scavengers from deposits all over the map and blowing up enemy units (or your own) creates scrap that can be scavenged and reused. Pilots are a nonrenewable resource, you need one for every unit you build. If the unit blows up, the pilot is ejected but he can also be killed thus losing him for good. If he makes it back to base, then your limit is not affected. It should also be noted that units have multiple weapon types and it doesn't seem like anyone is overly good against anyone else. Seems like numbers win the day in battles (from what I've played so far). This game also punishes you for your stupid teammates and makes you feel like you're just another soldier except you call in units.Uprising: Join or Die on the other hand is more arcadey. It's fast-paced and operates more on a paper rock scissors format. Infantry beats building, Tank beats Infantry, Aircraft beats Bomber and Tanks, Bomber beats building, Building good against everything etc etc. It's more simplistic. Units cannot be directly controlled, they are called in and proceed to battle against any enemy within the area but after the battle can be recalled to gain back resources. Your tank is also your ultimate weapon, it can be upgraded with better weaponry and by the end of the game you'll be blasting away foes with about 12 different weapon types.  Your tank can also divert power to 3 areas, shields, weaponry or speed... making you take more damage, deal more damage or zip around the battlefield at ridiculous speeds. Buildings are called in on pads rather than you essentially placing them whether you want (except for turrets). It should also be mentioned that Uprising is brutally hard, but not because your allies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... rather you made a mistake and they capitalized on it. I could go on but I believe my point is clear.Here we have two different action-strategy games that took the genre and walked opposite ways with it yet still remained true to a couple of different concepts (like having a command tank). In summation, Battlezone 98 Redux is good for those who are looking for more of a slower paced, punishing game... Battlezone is your game. If you're looking for a twitch shooter that plays more like The Outfit, then Uprising: Join or Die is your game. I still believe this should be played by anyone who is a fan of action-strategy games!			"

												I remember when this game out orignally, to say I was addicted is an understatement. Nearly 20 years later and I still remember the twinge of anxiety I felt whilst my mother would shout at me to get off the computer - but alas I was stuck. She didn't understand the draw of flying hover tanks in space, she didn't understand the strategy I could employ to crush my enemies with vast armies, or the satisfaction I got from finding the perfect defensible crater and turretting the hell out of the mountain tops.WELL IT LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE AGREE IT WAS A GOOD GAME MOTHER...........Rejoice with me and play this game to your heart's content once again - but this time without the nagging voice of the elderly drowning out the sound of you sniping that last pilot out of his tank.The game holds up great and looks shinier than ever in this re-release, you can still clearly see it was made generations ago - but the mechanics of a FPS/STRATEGY have long been dead in the games coming out recently. This separates it from just a pure nostalgia trip. Even if you never caught it the first time round, or weren't even alive when it was released - give it a go, you will be pleasantly surprised, I guarantee it.Space Cold WarFlying TanksWalkersBase BuildingExplosionsNuff Said.

												I've only had time to play through the first two missions on the American side, but this game is a dream come true!  It's the same OUTSTANDING gameplay that I remember from back in the day but it feels like it has been given a new lease on life.  While the update to the graphics may seem minor to some, it actually looks wonderful with higher polygon models, the new lighting system, higher resolution textures, and the new HUD.I hope to see BZ-2 given the same treatment, these two games were so far ahead of their time.  I'm confident even young gamers who missed them years ago will find BZ and BZ-2 to be a breath of fresh air in a time when most new games seem to be nothing more than a carbon-copy of things they've already played.TLDR:  Buy now, REJOICE later!

												This is one of the greatest games of all time.  There is no disputing that statement.  I have never played a game that blended the brainpower of complex strategy with the fast-paced nature of an FPS so well. The cold-war sci-fi theme is unique and certainly not seen as often today.  The mutliplayer always took my breathe away. Shout-out to the community that worked so hard to keep this game alive until we get this HD remake.  Everything works as well as we could have hoped.  For those who have played the game before; gameplay and missions appear untouched; everything just looks so much better.			"

												- 100% original, if you wanted to 'rebuy' this out of nostalgic feelings, the version is practically the same (with improved graphics)- No additional content (red odyssey etc.)- Steam workshop / user driven content (new instant action maps, endless battles etc.)If you missed this game or never had the chance to buy it; here it is.I don't play multiplayer; as far as i heard it's still wonky (p2p, no region selections; so expect desync, delay and lags)For the newer generations; if you like hovering tanks, old scool warfare (blue vs red) or vehicle based shooters, you might want to check.If you looking for Battlezone 2: this isn't it.

												At last, the FPS-RTS hybrid from 1998 has made it to Steam, and with a fresh coat of paint! Play as the National Space Defense Force (Americans) or the Cosmo Communist Army (Russians) and wage war across many different worlds, including Luna (Earth's Moon), Mars, Venus, and many more!Take command of your forces from a first-person perspective. You will need to be able to issue orders and fight in your own tank at the same time. This gameplay style is the adrenaline rush that is Battlezone. Destroy your enemy's forces, then gather their biometal remains to produce more of your own. Gathering scrap is important.The gameplay has been left completely untouched, so those who have played Battlezone 1.5 will fit right in. However, with respect to the last official patch, which was 1.4, expect a completely new experience. For one, the Tank AI no longer retreats when shot, it actually fights properly. The infamous bugs from back in the day are no more! The MDM is now safe to use in multiplayer, The East-West bug is fixed, and having a framerate over 60 FPS no longer makes the game run faster. Battlezone is finally up to modern standards as of v1.5 and Battlezone 98 Redux! At the time of this review, there may still be a few kinks to iron out, but I'm sure the dev team is more than willing to issue patches as issues are found. At $20, this game is a steal.			"

Product received for free
												As someone who has been with this game since childhood, I cannot recommend it enough. This remaster remains incredibly faithful to the original vision, keeping what worked and only improving what needed to be improved. With dozens of new features for modders and map makers to play with, support for all the original community content, and visuals enhanced by none other than the game's original lead artist Carey Chico. There isn't much else one can say, having been with the game so long, than that this remaster should be a gold standard for all other companies looking to revitalize older games.Call me biased, but I love this game, and as other community veterans will shun this remaster as being ""too different"" from the game they remember, I can honestly find very little bad to say about it, certainly nothing that would fit in a short review.I give this remaster a 9/10, and hope to give it a perfect 10 as future patches and both official and community content smooth over the few remaining rough edges.

												So I'm going to start with the criticisms first.The ""Joystick"" controls are not very good.  You have a bunch of default settings for some Joystick types, XBox Controller and Steam Controller but none of them are re-bindable and a prime example is the self-destruct button is bound to X.  There seems to be little support for modern HOTAS joysticks like the X55 (and I enjoyed playing this game back in 1998 with my Throttle joystick, I would love to be able to do it again). I would note though that keyboard bindings are fully configurable.I also forgot how annoying the *beep* *beep* noise is when an enemy approaches, and firing this up near midnight the misses wasn't too happy with the annoying noises.  Would be nice to have more options to turn that stuff off.HOWEVER other than this, really it's the same great game that is was 18 years ago but looking a bit sharper. The only thing that hasn't transfered well is the FMV sequences but that is to be expected for a retro title like this.			"

												I've played this game and been a part of the 1.5 patch/Online forum community since 2011. I modded heavily, made dozens of maps, participated in strat tournaments, and was a very loyal BZ player for years (alias: Ian S.) Unfortunately, I got away from BZ in school when life happened, but now over the summer I've come to try the Redux.This is a bit of an emotional game for me. My brother and I played it when I was 4, on an old Windows 95 machine. I found the game again when I was 14 and lonely, and absolutley immersed myself in modding and making maps, learning about every trick in the book to script missions. When LUA coding came out, my entire modding world was opened.As far as the game goes, as advertised it's an awesome blend of the FPS/RTS genre. I've always appreciated how you can control and mobilize an entire army of vehicles but still zoom around in a tank blowing up crap. The campaigns are epic in this game, especially the NSDF one. There are some elements from BZ 1.5 (before the Redux came out) that I like better, but overall the Redux is much higher quality and transitions the game into the 21st century. Online multiplayer is also very fun, there is nothing quite like winning a strategy match after an adrenaline-pumping half an hour of back and forth combat.I can't put as much effort into this game as I wish I could anymore, but I do highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it before. It's classic but now new, with a small but very solid community supporting it, so you can't go wrong!			"

												I used to play the demo of this game as a kid incessantly way back in the 90's and got my hands on the full game from the Place With Things in later years. Hell, even then the graphics hadn't aged well but the gameplay was still fun and as an astronomy geek it was great travelling throughout the solar system...and blowing it up! Sure, it's living on past glory but I still think it's a good game. A nice base building, squad managing shooty-shooty time sink. I've died a lot more than I used to so the challenge is definitely still there.Definitely worth the 10 quid.			"

												Battlezone blends RTS and FPS elements into a unique type of game that is difficult to pull off, but done correctly creates an experience found in few other games since its first release back in 1998. The remaster feels just like the original version in gameplay, but also improves on many areas including smarter AI units, updated graphics, and even adds cooperative multiplayer against an AI.It should be noted that I have experienced some FPS drops and there is a problem with the game closing if trying to Alt+Tab while in a multiplayer match. However, these issues have not overshadowed my experience playing the game to a great degree. $20 is an incredibly fair price for this game, and I can't recommend it enough.			"

IntroductionBattlezone 98 Redux is set in a alternative version of 1960s whereby the USA and Soviet Union have secretly deployed armies into space for an extra-terrestrial substance that can be forged to craft weapons and armour that is powerful. Obviously other Nations are going to fight over this substance, so the National Space Dfence Force and  Cosmos Colonist Army battle over control of this substance.GameplayThis game is a blend of RTS and FPS elements that really seem to fit together and join together as one rather well. With the game primarily taking place in space with a sort of futuristic style it really takes upon the genre rather well. You can play as a hover tank that you can view from the cockpit, hunting down enemys with the hovertank destorying enemy crafts is rather satifying and brings back memories of when I used to play Starwars battlefront II.Although the game looks rather nice and seems like a pretty strong build from the earlier version of the game, sometimes the AI on the game seems a bit unresponsive and just sits there. Sometimes their pathfinding of where they are actually suppose to be moving can be a bit weird and obserdly different than what you would expect them to do.Anyways, the game is a really good source of what a RTS game should be all about. Being able to deploy your recycler at a power source to collect bio-metal that are used in the base in order to build defensive structers and wingmen into the battle. You are able to build towers to help you in the battle, with things such as Comm Tower which can take control of a satellite and you are able to view the battlezone. This gives you the added advantage of being able to command your wingmen in the traditional wya that you would normally in other RTS games.With the graphics remasterd from the 1998 version of the game, it looks very nice and sharp which is what you would expect a game to look like in todays standards. With the hovercrafts and towers looking very futuristic and nicely detailed, I feel like the game was refinely detailed in every way when this game was being developed. The textures look very smooth and the explosions on are very nice.Pros+ Detailed graphics+ Fun gameplay+ Shows what a RTS should rally be like+ FPS in a RTS game is very unique and hard to come by on steamCons- Weird AI at timesResult / Final ThoughtsMy final thoughts on this game are pretty high. They really took the original game and made it into a modern version, with the graphics of everything and the amount of towers you can build to help you win the battle it really shows what you can do with a RTS game. If you can get past the weird AI at times, then I would definatly recommened this game.Rating: 8.2/10For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow KgX Gaming curator group here. "

Since i have Steam it is like my biggest wish that ONE DAY i will see a Battlezone 2 Commbat Commander ON STEAM maybe in redux version aswell  PLEASE PLASEASE PLEASE  ABOUT THAT GAME :This game mixes few game genres wich are FPP Space Sim like maybe Freespace or Elite Dangerous(just combat part) a typical RTS strategy and typical FPP but with entering and leaving viehicles. YES it has few bugs But it is one of my favourite game ever wrote/developed. Sequel is EVEN BETTER esspecially in terms of climat and plot   SO PLEASE DEVELOPERS !!!

												I'd never played BZ '98 before I bought this game, but I -had- played a TON of BZII back when I still ran WinXP, so when this popped up in my Discovery Queue, I almost fainted, and bought it near instantly. Do not regret.It's quite a change from BZII in some ways, but it's enough the same that adapting to these differences was easy enough, and boy was it worth it. The gameplay is so nostalgic it almost hurts (I shamelessly admit I did cry a little when I first started playing), and it helped patch holes in the story for me, having only played BZII prior.It's a fun challenge, and, as far as I'm aware, a rather unique style of gameplay that I've never really seen replicated outside of BZII (the combination of the RTS base-building, unit-commanding with the FPS player-controlled unit is an element I just love to bits, yet I can't think of any other games that utilize it).Would I recommend the game? Most definitely, even if just to try it out! Sure, nothing is for everyone, but as they say, ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained""!			"

												Absolutely perfect for the person who has waited for an update to Battlezone for the longest time (ME!)  Battlezone 98 Redux is great, just great, and I urge anyone seeing this to get it, for starters, it has everything you loved about the original Battlezone with an addition of updated graphics, almost nothing else has been changed, except for the addition of Mods, some of which I don't have but can highly reccommend you get as well.  One mod is the replacement of the music with the music from the N64 port of Battlezone; Battlezone:  Rise of the Black Dogs.  I loved the music from the port and now that someone has remade the music with better sound quality, it will surely fit in with your experience.  The only thing that I have any problem with (This includes the original game as well) is the extreme gameplay difficulty spike when you hit medium.  Maybe it's just me, but I've never experienced a spike like this, it must just be that 90's difficulty.  Anyway, still get the game, even if it's a bit difficult for me doesn't mean it will be difficult for you.			"

												Battlezone 1998 is perhaps my favourite 'underrated' game and, by extension, genre. The mixture of FTS and FPS gameplay in a compelling and amusing cold-war era crypto space war made this game stand out. It's still as challenging and entertaining now as it was 20 years ago. The  only down side to this game is that the genre it should have spawned was stillborn - Strategy games almost all take place from a god's eye view and first person games rarely attempt any strategic gameplay in this manner. It's great to see this game on steam and great to play though one of my old favourites again.			"

												Meine ersten Minuten in der neuen ""alten"" Version.Oh mein Gott, hatte gar nicht in Erinnerung, wie hektisch es  da werden kann (ab Level 2). Muss auch zugeben, das ich drei Anläufe benötigte um Level 1 zuschaffen. Im zweiten Level werde ich gerade von den Russen komplett überrannt ... Aktuell bin ich mit der US Seite gestartet um wieder in den Razor zuspringen. Das Game selbst spiegelt den typischen US vs RUS Konfikt wieder bei denen es um Ressourcen auf dem Mond und Mars geht. Basenbau kann man sich wie bei C&C vorstellen. Man muss verschiedene Produktionstätten aufbauen und Ressourcen erschliessen, wobei Gysire eine Art Energiequelle darstellen, welche man ab dem zweiten Level kennenlernt.Geschütztürme , je nach Ressourcenmenge sind auch baubar, genauso wie im späteren Verlauf die schweren Panzereinheiten, wie den Grizzly zb. und und.Die Recycler sind das A&O wie bei C&C. Ohne Ressourcen wird man gnadenlos überrannt. Man kann auch als Inf da rumrennen und die Piloten rausschiessen aus den Fahrzeugen oder aus Geschütztürmen und diese dann entern. Es empfiehlt sich aber immer ein Fahrzeug in der Nähe zuhaben, falls man als Inf da rum rennt. Schießt man einmal daneben ... wird man i.d.R. sofort gejagt und erschossen bzw. überfahren ... die Knappheit von 2 weiteren Kugeln in dem Gewehr lassen da auch nicht soviel Spielraum, wenn man es vergeigt ;)  Alle Fahrzeuge, welche man bauen kann, kann man auch besetzen.Im späteren Verlauf der Kampagne oder auch im MP hat man vollen Zugriff auf alle Einheiten, die da noch kommen. Auch eine Art Mechwarrior ist dabei und kostet entsprechend Ressourcen usw. Da ich das Spiel auch aus 1998 kenne, es hat sich nix geändert. Es ist ein klasse Remake und bringt mir ...fast 20 Jahre später gleich von Anfang an sehr viel Spaß. Mein Ziel ist es zunächst beide Kampagnen zu absolvieren (US u. Russkie) bevor ich wieder ins MP Gaming da einsteige....etwas eingerostet ist man da dann doch schon ^^			"

												Since its release in 1998, Battlezone has probably been one of the most underrated games ever.  Despite its unique combination of FPS and RTS and its brilliant interface it seemed to have missed commercial success.  Great to see a remake of the original.			"

												1st of all, I have not yet tried out the multiplayer version of Battlezone yet. I hope it will work as well as the single player, and the old glitches has been dropped off.What could i say about the game - one of the best scifi FPS strategy games for ever. In childhood I made 9 cable and we played with my best friend via IPX/SPX protocol. Lots of beer and vodka went during that time -  unforgivable moments :D:like:			"

Other games may have base building and/or FPS fighting and Squad commmanding but nothing has the gameplay that i feel when playing this. Can't wait for Battlezone 2 Redux!!			"

												Absolutely wonderful! Buy this game right now! I never thought this day would come and I cannot be more happy. This is the best possible version of a true masterpiece of a game. The redux textures and models look wonderful, without losing any of the nostalgia. And there are so many subtle enhancements like headlights on the vehicles, fantastic looking HUD, and the detial on the vehicles is so good it just makes everything come to life. If you are a Battlezone fan you will be very pleased with this redux, and if you aren't buy this game right now, and enjoy one of the finest games every made. That features unique style of combat that has you leading sci fi warmachines into combat, an irie soundtrack that sets the tone for a sci fi struggle of the superpowers, an engrossing alternate history stroy told through the eyes of a solider, whose voice captures the tone of man that has seen the horrors of a war that could snuff out all life. In short your life needs this game!			"

												I have vague recollections of playingthe demo of Battlezone back in the day when it was new, so I came to it only loosely familiar with it. I usually wait for the games to be on sale but with BZ98 I bought it at full price and haven't regretted it!In short it's a very good combination of action and real-time strategy. The command and control system is easy to master and I find it satisfying when commanding units remotely around the battlefield. Medium difficulty provides a decent amount of challenge and I can see that there will be a lot of replayability in cracking the higher difficulty settings and also using the Steam Workshop content.

												My experience so far: >Played first NSDF mission, failed 4 times.>Said ♥♥♥♥ this, almost quit.>Decided to do tutorial to see if maybe I was just an idiot and missing something.>Discovered high mouse sensitivity+jumping=lol>Instant boost in patriotism.>COME GET SOME YA DIRTY COMMIE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!>Annihilated Red Scum.>10/10.Seriously though, as someone who never played the ""golden age"" of games back in the late 90s/early 2000s, this was a pleasant surprise for me. FPSRTS games are a rare breed, and most of them are utter trash. This one is interesting though. The vehicles control quite well, and the command interface is pretty clear and easy to use, and the hud makes me need new pants. Seriously, not enough games understand that giving players a proper cockpit view of their vehicles make us immediately like the game like at least 30% more. My only complaint is that a lot of keybindings are locked permanently, so if you want to say, bind jump to spacebar, you're SoL because that's permanently bound to commanding your units. However, thankfully most of the controls that are locked are locked to logical keys. Targetting a unit, for example, is T. Can't be changed, but doesn't really need to. Also, for some reason the game doesn't recognize left alt as a valid key to bind things to for some reason.  I would love to put ""issue command"" to left alt and ""jump"" to space.Easily 9/10, just off of campaign alone.			"

												How can i put this Masterpiece, This Treasure,Into words?When someone asks me what my favorite game is. or what the best game i ever played was, It is this game and only this game I talk about, I was first introduced to battlezone at the age of 7 In 1999, My dad had found this gem in a clearance bin at Big Lots, and had bought it with the intention of playing online over our dial up connection with his Installer Buddies from work.At the time Joysticks as they were called were the best way to experience any simulator and fortune would have it dad had a Thrustmaster Fox 2 Pro at the time one of the best joysticks available(Having 3 Axis Or a Throttle at all Was a feat to be recoginized for controllers at this time).This Controller and Battlezone would come to be my church as I took my first steps as a gamer, And what a leap it was.The strategy,The vehicles,The ACTION! To this day I can remember it all.Some of my best memories are of playing this with my dad and his friends and the journey it took me on as i developed my skills and mindset towards becoming Better and better,  Every match utilized a different  strategy there were so many different vehicles and weapons loadouts you could use that it provided endless challenge and excitement Even though I lost almost every match,Just as the year ended I donned a New mantle that would come to be my gamertag(ReaperX2000). Moments before the new millennium I defeated My father and his friends in a brutal day wrecker victory I built and ammased an army of scouts and an armory quickly hunting down my opponents by carefully placing my troops i ejected so i could overlook the enemy base, launching 2 day wreckers onto seperate targets so the blasts would overlap and cause the most  widespread havoc, I waited with my sniper prone trained on whatever red dot i could find as the bombs reached the peak of thier arc i waited anxiously counting down the moments before they would be in range, as they approached just above his base i took the shot sniping one of his scavengers to draw his attention.Perfect, Just as he had time to turn around the bombs dropped destroy his entire offensive wing most of his scavengers and almost all of the buildings lay in critical condition.""Time to send in the dogs."" I ordered my wing of scouts to attack his recycler, it was a crushing blow, as the scouts many miniguns quickly lay waste to what was left of Dads installer buddy.  I quickly ordered my scavengers and a couple defense turrets into the area to collect the salvage, It was time to take on the real threat, Dad himself.My attack had been successful but in order to accomplish this task i had left myself open to attack at my original base, Fortunately i had already tucked my recyler away in a different geyser, calling it and the constructor it had built i quickly began raiseng defences for my new base, i built several powerplants and guntowers surrounding and plugging the perrimiter turrets, I had recyled most of my scouts and sent a few to scout for the enemy repurposing all the metal i could find into tanks and walkers, and of course switching to my own walker with my favorite choice of weapons,(Flash & Mag <3) Dad had already utilized the time to construct his own army of tanks but he lacked defensive structures, With my earlier attack run i had gained advantage by collectiong far more scrap far quicker, He put up a good fight, Our tanks clashed in a battle of explosions for what seemed like an hour. But in the end my resources allowed me the victory, Sending in wave after wave of tanks as i established defenses on his doorstep to reclaim my lost scrap, Eventually he lost out and I claimed Sweet Sweet Victory.This victory would be the driving force to push me to succeed in any and every video game,Memories of the different odds i have overcome would give me the confidence to take on any new challenge,And the theme of this game would place space simulators action and strategy games in a special place in my heart.My 7 Year old Mind would grow to use battlezone as the basis to judge every game upon, And to this day, No game i have ever played,(And I have played ALOT) compares to matches in this game, This to me, is simply the best game that was ever made, and seeing it here in steam(WITH MODS!!), remastered beautifully, Leaving the real joy to this game completely untouched, Because it was just so masterfully done the first time. is a dream come true,I would reccomend this as a 10 Out of 10 But this game is so wonderful it would simply take its score Divide by zero and multiply by infinity, Not only do I reccoment this game, this is THE game I reccomend For gamers at any point in thier livesThank you for reading.TL;DR: Buy this game, It could change your life.P.S.

												Battlezone 98 has always remained one of my all time favorite games.  It was before it's time, coming on to the scene during a period when Mechwarrior 2 was still fresh in the minds of PC gaming.  It combined RTS and first person (both vehicle and on foot) in a really fascinating package of the secret war between the US and USSR over the mysterious bio-metal that was spread throughout the solar system.  The RTS aspect was solid and setting up bases worked well in that you never left the action, the game was seamless.  Thanks to Rebellion, we now have Redux, which updates the game and brings it out of the shadows again (there has been an active community around this game for years!), and the various enhancements along with release on Steam will give this gem another shot in the modern gaming world.  Absolutely recommended!			"

												Where do we begin...Battlezone 98 was a game far ahead of its time.  When first person shooters and strategy games were still in larval stages while platformers and other genres dominated the market, this game brilliantly blended the two bold new genres together in a format unlike any other.  Not only did you build buildings and commanded armies, you went on the frontlines with them with powerful tanks, and if you were feeling lucky, you can disembark one for REAL sniper skill challenges as a humble trooper.  They have a wonderful mix of both units, and arsenals that can shake the game up faster than a bartender on crack mixing a martini.The primary drawbacks i site on this is the lack of open ended skirmish both offline and online, if they did this like other strategy games did back in the day this game would be perfect, and resources are very finite making gameplay restrictive.  The game is very challenging but can be a real controller/mouse to the screen difficult, and not in the challenging way that uber gamers desire, more like, ""WHY THE ♥♥♥♥!? HOW!?"" where you can only have a margin in the lower single digits of error to proceed.The game had immense potential, and it still does, but as long as the gameplay remains this restrictive it won't go further than it is.  Despite the flaws, i still recommend this hidden gem to anyone seeking a witches brew of intense first person shooting combat and calculating real time strategy gameplay molded into one.  Cold War in space yo! Fight with alien tech mang!			"

												One of the first games that I played! Very well done HD version that runs smooth and multiplayer via steam is a big plus. I assume that player base is just old school fans of BattleZone, but if you are into RTS/FPS scifi-combat give it a go! :)10/10			"

												I'll remove my rose tinted glasses for a moment and admit this remaster has some pretty glaring issues; atrocious friendly AI and pathfinding, some missions with random insta fail triggers, meh voice work and repetitive combat. Having said that Battlezone offers one of the most unique gaming experiences I've ever had. This game meshes FPS and RTS very well from a gameplay perspective, and barring some unresolved issues it holds up decently well. The campaign is fun to play and the plot has an interesting twist and turn to it as it goes on. This game has a solid atmosphere, and I've really enjoyed exploring the game's universe once again. If it drops down on sale I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you're a nostalgiac fan like me			"

												Back in 98 I remember Battlezone came bundled with our first computer, and I think it was an IBM computer. I tried playing it back then with a Top Gun Thrustmaster joystick, but that was really difficult... I also remember playing BZ1 a lot on LAN in the early 2000s...Discovered BZ on steam yesterday and I bought it. Battlezone is still a unique game and I enjoy playing it again. Totally thumbs up for this game and I'm looking forward to playing with new mods. New FPS/RTS players should try this game.			"

												I have never written a review before, but this game and its new team deserve this amazing compliment:Every since I found this game when I was young, it has been my favorite game to play in my spare time, the sheer thrilling experience that is Battlezone has never had me bored, or feeling like there could much more added to the experience. If you're looking for some great action, a good story, told from two perspectives, along with the ability to command your allies while in combat, this is definitely for you. The graphics have only improved upon its wonderful mechanics and atmosphere. "

												Finally! Almost the only strategy, in which I was able to play (don't like this genre at all) and passed it 3 times with great pleasure at the time. There were Machines and Emperor: Battle for Dune also, but those were ""normal"" strategies. Here, with proper skill, it was possible to take enemy base (I mean AI) one mug in the first person from the sniper. Long, but fun. Can't really call something like that. The 2nd part was kind of stoned already, there were problems with the functions of the buttons, and it's important to me, so I don't remember whether I passed the second part. Hope now launched for the revival of this interesting mixture of genres! 111 in advance from 10!!!!!Наконец-то! Чуть ли не единственная стратегия, в которую я смог играть (не люблю этот жанр совсем) и прошёл её раза 3 с огромным удовольствием в своё время. Ещё были Machines и Emperor: Battle for Dune, но те были ""обычными"" стратегиями. Здесь же, при должной сноровке, можно было вынести вражескую базу (речь про ИИ) в одну харю от первого лица из снайперки. Долго, но прикольно. Действительно не могу назвать что-то похожее. 2-я часть была какой-то упоротой уже, ещё там были проблемы с назначением кнопок управления, а для меня это важно, так что уже даже не помню прошёл ли я вторую часть. Надеюсь теперь дан старт на возрождение этого интересного смешения жанров! Заранее 111 из 10!!!!! "

												Mostly nostalgia for me.Few little bugs here and there but the Dev team are fully aware of them and are working hard to rectify them. Expect a patch soon. If you have read the negative reviews, many refer to language selection issues, fear not, the next patch which is expected in the next few days will allow you to select language before launching.In all honesty, the game may not be worth $20 but it is pretty close. It will definately be worth the money if they bring out The Red Od / Rise of Blackdogs expansions in an update but I don't expect anybody to work for free so I hope the modders get permission to bring it forward :D			"

												This is my favorite PC game of all time. So I'm delighted to be able to play it on Windows 10 instead of having to fire up my windows 98 retro gaming machine.However, fans of battlezone should note that the rise of the black dogs campaign isn't include (not surprising considering it was N64 exclusive) and the Red Odyssy Campaign (probably going to be sold as DLC unfortunately). Still you can emulate the N64 verison of battlezone and the red odyssy campaign can be acquired for the 1.5 verison of battlezone from battlezone1.com as of this writing although it will not be as pretty as this game it does work on the newer windows machines.All in all, it's a gussied up version of a classic game and well worth the $20 but sinc eit's missing a good deal of content from the expansion, you should expect to have to shell out more money in the future when they decided to release the red odyssey campaigns.

												Where it says ""# hours on record"", that should really be measured in years. I grew up playing this game, and have always come back to it.Engaging gameplay hybridizing real time strategy and 1st/3rd person hovertank combat! This game is nothing like anything else we have today, it's still extremely unique and I hope we get another sequel soon.The story is a unique historical Cold War timeline spin-off involving the discovery of biometal (a sentient material) as well as alien relics in the solar system,  by the Americans and the Soviets, all in the midst of a Cold War back on Earth. Nobody else from Earth knows this is going on.The space environments are super immersive. Visuals, sound, control scheme, everything is a masterpiece of an experience.Fly massive hovertanks on the moon, hop out as a small, vulnerable pilot and fly high with a jetpack, crouch on the edge of cliffs and snipe enemy ships to hijack them. Defend outposts on the lunar surface, soar through canyons on Mars and climb Olympus Mons, strafe under enemy fire, order artillery and turrets to defend points, command fleets of scout and tank crafts to patrol, hunt, and attack enemy positions. Scavenge for scrap and biometal geysers with which to construct your fully-mobile base structures and units, deploy awesome weapons and powerup your ships with advanced equipment... send earthquakes across the terrain and blast hostile ships caught spinning into the air!I'm so happy this old gem has been repolished. It's my favorite game of all time; it inspired me to make my game One Giant Leap. Now we just need Battlezone in VR!			"

												My favorite game apart from maybe Interstate '76, and it's based upon that game's engine anyway. One of the defining games of my childhood and well deserving of this re-release.Originally released in 1998, this take on Battlezone was itself a re-imagining of the 1980 arcade game. It blended first-person vehicular combat with real-time strategy elements to create a revolutionary hybrid game experience that has only been briefly revisited since, in games such as Sacrifice and Brutal Legend.In 1952, as the story goes, a meteor shower in the arctic circle brought a previously unknown organic material to Earth. Simultaneously discovered by scientists of both the US and the Soviet Union, this ""Bio-Metal"" was soon discovered to have the unique ability to remember shapes it had previously assumed. From this material, the superpowers created hovering tanks and weapons centuries ahead of anything they could have otherwise made at the time. They quickly ran out of it, and turned their eyes towards the stars in search of more. In secret, the two nations sent thousand-man armies into space. Thus began a new, hidden chapter of the Cold War- the one too brutal to televise. You will journey to the moon, Mars, Venus and beyond in search of the bio-metal, and the truth of its origins.You take the role of a soldier of either the Americans' National Space Defense Force, or NSDF, or the Russians' Cosmo Colonist Army, or CCA. You begin most campaign missions, as well as multiplayer strategy matches, with your own tank and a Recycler- at once your core base structure, your resource depository, and a factory that produces all other essential units. It exists in a mobile or deployed state, able to travel (slowly) about until you find a geyser over which to deploy it, whereupon it becomes able to build. You have two resources: scrap, and pilots. The former are gathered by scavengers, autonomous resource-harvesting vehicles built from the Recycler that will wander the map gathering bio-metal scrap, found lying around in fields on most maps, or generated from destroyed vehicles and structures. Controlling these scrap fields and assigning escorts to your scavengers is crucial in more difficult missions, and in multiplayer.Combat vehicles include nimble scout craft, light and medium tanks, rocket tanks, bombers, and walkers. Defensive units include mobile turrets and artillery that must deploy to fire, as well as minelayers. Offensive vehicles for the most part are fast, turn quickly and can strafe, allowing you to maintain fire on a target while avoiding return fire, though the bombers do not turn quickly and are more adept at long-range strikes on static structures. Combat is fast and chaotic- focused fire can destroy most vehicles in seconds, and battles can involve upwards of twenty tanks at once- more in the campaign. You should quickly master the ability to group your units using Control plus the Function keys, and commanding them to focus-fire individual enemy targets, lest they haphazardly engage multiple enemies at once and lose the advantage of their numbers. The scouts and turrets are built from your Recycler, while the rest are built from your Unit Factory, a more specialized builder vehicle that is also built from the Recycler. If a vehicle is destroyed, including yours, fear not- the pilot will eject, and have the opportunity to return to their base and be put in a new vehicle. While on foot, you are extremely vulnerable, but not defenseless- you have a low-damage plasma gun, as well as a sniper rifle you can use to snipe out the pilot of an enemy vehicle and steal it for yourself. Be wary of enemy pilots in multiplayer!You may also build a Constructor vehicle from your Recycler that can build fixed structures, such as powerful gun towers, repair and resupply structures, and a communications tower that grants you access to an overhead satellite view in the vein of a traditional RTS. It can also build a barracks- the only way to increase your pilot count. Protect your Constructor well- it's often a priority target for AI enemies, and getting a network of gun towers up is crucial for fending off regular enemy raids in the later campaign missions. You will also want to build an Armory, a third mobile base vehicle that builds and launches repair, ammo and weapon pickups, as it is your only means of repairing structures and allows you to resupply in the field, as well as launch bombs on enemy bases.You can command your units either by looking directly at them and pressing the space bar or by selecting them using the number keys from a list. Units are organized into offensive, defensive, utility, with an extra section for available navigation beacons, which also function as cameras when selected, to give you remote viewing of that location. Offensive units have the most diverse range of orders- they can be commanded to move to a specific location, attack or defend your current target, follow you, defend a key friendly, or to move to a selected nav beacon, as well as to get repairs or ammunition, or to recycle- refunding a portion of scrap used in their construction, as well as returning their pilots to your global pilot count- this is good, because you have a finite cap of 30 pilots per level and they cannot be replaced. This works both ways- target enemy pilots to deny the AI access to replacement units- I think. The computer probably cheats on both scrap and pilots, and they most certainly can spawn near-infinite waves of harassing attacks on your base. It works in multiplayer though.Aside from the two story campaigns, there are a variety of multiplayer modes, including deathmatch, strategy, and ""MPI"", a form of co-op strategy versus AI. This Redux includes extensive Steam Workshop support- you can download maps on the fly even in-game. It also includes updated models and visual effects, trading cards, achievements, and other niceties- aside from running very smoothly on modern systems, more so then it ever did in the old days. However, it is a essentially a straight re-release, and does not attempt to address any of the game's existing shortcomings- save the netcode, of course.You are limited, for example, to only ten units of each type, since that's as far as the number keys go, as well as the hard pilot cap of 30. The AI is single-minded at best and suicidal at worst, with frequent issues with pathfinding, often getting stuck trying to scale inclines the player would have no trouble at all with. Scavengers are completely incapable of not only defending themselves but even of reacting to being attacked, and will continue on their merry way scavenging in the face of certain destruction. Artillery units will fire at will regardless of the risk of hitting your own forces and cannot be set to hold their fire. Your offensive units also require careful management ot get the most out of their attacks. The walkers are also so painfully slow that their use in most campaign missions is extremely limited- its entirely possible to finish CCA Mission 6, for example, without the use of the three Golems you are given. Most campaign missions also have only one or two safe methods of completion, with very little room for experimental tactics.However, most of these flaws are attributable to the limitations of the original game engine, and and while they are even more glaringly obvious all these years later, there is something to be said for bringing the game to Steam and a new audience as is, the way we enjoyed it 18 years ago, and it is certainly easier to forgive then a brand new game with these same flaws. Battlezone was something completely new and any problems it had were excusable in the face of how much fun I had with it, and it was a great pleasure to revisit this landmark title in both my young life and the history of PC gaming. I urge newcomers and old hands, shooter and strategy fans alike to pick this one up. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Damn fine update to the game though I could have sworn you could pilot the moon lander in the previous version. Oh well, at least the rave gun survived. One true complaint at this point is the walk cycles of the pilots spazz out in first and third person view. They complete the walk cycle halfway then snap to the original pose before trying again and again and again. Small visual annoyance, nothing more.  P.S. I am not sure if this is a problem with the game or with my computer (thus why I am not listing it as a complaint at this point) but there is a corrupted looking green border a few pixels wide, on a couple of sides of the screen when playing the game. It only happens in this game and is practically unnoticeable while playing but is completely visible if you look for it.			"

												What an amazing game.  I played the original version for 300+ hours. If you've played this before, then you already know how incredible it is and have bought it.If you haven't, this version of Battlezone is a hybrid FPS/RTS sci-fi tank/battle Cold War simulator... in space. It's every bit as awesome as it sounds. Basically, imagine a really excellent, top-notch RTS with a fantastic interface in which you get to play as one of your own units while directing the battle. It sounds complex, but the UI is so excellent that neither part of the game, the tank simulator or the RTS, loses anything in the translation; it's two first-rate games in one. You play as a pilot who can switch ships and even snipe enemy pilots and take over their vehicles.I still remember the amazing adventures I had playing this game. The heart-pounding race to escape  a planet about to explode in seconds, being chased by alien superweapons all the way. Escorting my Soviet scientists across a bridge above the fiery lava of Jupiter's moon Io, getting blown out of my tank as it's destroyed by superior American forces, sniping the pilot of an American rocket tank who attacked me, stealing his vehicle and using it to fire upon my unsuspcecting foes, saving my forces. Sneaking into a heavily defended Soviet base on Europa to see where they've hdiden the stolen plans. Being ambushed by Soviet forces on the plains of Venus. They simply don't get any better than this.The emergent gameplay situations, the enormous tactical flexibility afforded by the strategic layer of the game, the first-rate physics and satisfying gunplay, the huge variety of weapons and vehicles- even nearly 20 years later, this game remains unmatched I truly wish more people would try to rip it off! To try to compare it to some more modern titles if you haven't played this, imagine melding the seamless tactical interface and large-scale battle control of Sins of a Solar Empire with the visceral action and FPS excitement of Call of Duty, plus the open-ended battlefield and branching combat options afforded by Crysis or Far Cry. All with a cool sci-fi story in space. I am not exaggerating. It truly is that good.And all this before I even get to the beautiful, loving restoration this game has been given!All of the above refers to the 1998 ""vanilla"" edition. But in this 98 Redux edition, the game has been given a complete makeover and beautifully brought up to date with care and devotion. The developers really layered on an extra level of polish along with all-new graphics and options for modern PCs. New, Steam-based online multiplayer? Check. Brand new HD graphics and textures? Check? New mod support? Check. In my brief time to date with the new version, AI also feels like it's been improved and bugs have been fixed. It really feels like a whole new game with the excellent graphics update. This is NOT the shovelware, throw-anything-on-Steam junk that most developers throw up onto the Internet when they get an old license- this is the remastered, restored edition, presented with the care and attention that all developers should lavish on a game rerelease. It truly is worth a buy even if you've played this as many hours as I have.Until then... I'll see you on the Martian battlefields... or the Moon.... or Venus....			"

Every scrap and scavenger, tank and turret, so much nostalgia.  The base building and combat in this game is so good.  It really leaves me hoping for a new incarnation on the UT4 engine.This game is legendary, with good reason.  It’s held up incredibly well over time, and is still as much fun as I remember.  You’re doing yourself a favor in giving it a try.			"

I was a massive fan of the original so this video might show bias.Game Details:One of the greatest sci-fi strategy games of all time returns Spring 2016 with remastered visuals, online multiplayer, and near unlimited mod content from Steam Workshop. Enter an alternate vision of the 1960s where the “space race” is nothing more than a cover for an interplanetary war between the US and Soviet Russia over mysterious alien bio-metal.Take command of an army of sleek heavy assault tanks, strike cruisers, APCs and more, and wreak havoc with super-heated projectiles in your mission to blast your enemy from the face of the Moon, Mars, Venus, Titan, Io and Europa. Scavenge the battlefields for crucial bio-metal, deploy powerful defenses, construct advanced facilities and escalate each battle to an epic confrontation. Revolutionary, revitalised and remastered, Battlezone 98 Redux’s blend of thrilling first person action and tense RTS gameplay is as essential now as it ever was.Recommended?Yes!			"

												Some time ago I was thinking of this game. I didn't remembered it's name, I just remembered how fun it was and I was thinking that there is no game like it nowdays.But on Steam summer sale, I found this... Battlezone 98 Redux with positive feedback, I had to try.And oh, so much memories. This feels just like I remembered it. I quickly tested it and I must say I do like play this more, it has harvesting and building management, also commander elements. And it is kind of fps too. Now I just need to talk my friends to buy this too :D ... Even it has been over 15 years since I have played this, somehow I did know what to do. It felt so familiar.If I myst say something bad, mouse lag (smothing?) was quite terrible when I tried sniping, Somehow I remember that sniping was quite easy, I need to check my settings again. "

												Thank you Rebellion and Big Boat Interactive for this marvelous remaster of the first game in my favorite game series.The graphics are amazing, every time I saw a new unit or vehicle, I was amazed, the level and degree at which the quality out shines the original is stunning.the quality of the terrain also looks amazing along with specular highlights, bump textures, and the detail in all the units, and the glowing lights.They tried not to stray too far from the original game as far as gameplay goes, and they have done an excellent job, that being said, some of the game mechanics are quite outdated and could be considered obsolete, so you do have to remember sometimes that this is a graphics makeover to a game that was made over 15 years ago.THIS GAME IS AMAZING, if you have never played it I would highly reccomend it to anyone, you will never see another game that plays quite like Battlezone.I am really enjoying playing this game, but right now I'm hoping more than anything that they make a Battlezone II: Combat Commander Redux, but most of my dreams have come true already, and I feel it only gets better from here.What are you waiting for?

												OK sooo. here we go. I played this long before it was on steam. pros:  1. looks nice  2. musics ok 3. reminds me of n64 version.Now CONS: 1. It doesn't work well with inputs. (you have to manually change your controls from the files in steam.) 2. Having to manually outside of game change my inputs to the controls. 3. Very limited support. I only recommend it to those familar with previous versions. If you have played 64 version I strongly suggest getting a correction of the default controls. (unless the sudden self detonation of your tank followed by rabid ejection pleases you :P)I was going to down vote this and spend quite some time bad mouthing it; however someone actually decided to answer my questions and google then provided the ability to make this game playable. I would strongly recommend working on the inputs guys and gals. Its a common feature these days and can make/break games.			"

												This game is as challenging and rewarding as the first time I played it back in the day. I think it is worth people's time, and that players will find it to be something quite unique in gameplay, combining FPS and RTS. It has a decent difficulty curve, and a good balance between resource gathering and intensity of enemy resistance.I enjoy the base building, driving around, the atmosphere and ambience, as well as the campaign as a whole. It does manage to give you an impression of being quite alone and vulnerable, which I think is fairly appropriate given that it's set on other planets/moons of our solar system.			"

												I remember playing this game back in 98, it was the first ever PC game I remember playing. So having said that I preface with nostalgia having a factor here. The game looks pretty good for it's age, and unlike other games I have, playing on my 65"" tv isn't haveing any effect on the games frames.Pros: A very interesting storyInteresting units and tactics to play themTwo sepereate campaigns with provide their own challengesGood blend of FPS tank fights, with a healthy blend of RTS you can't forget aboutSimple and direct inputs mean you can just a few buttons quickly and get tasks doneLooks great (for being originally from 98), and still plays pretty wellBack in the day, the multiplayer was pretty fun, but it's been awhile since I played thatCons:Sometimes the AI is dumb as a sack of potatoes......When they aren't being dumb, they kick your♥♥♥♥♥In game doesn't really tell you nearly ANYTHING you need to know about how to play other than move and shoot, so expect to go to outside sources to learn how to do more complex manuevers, commands, and tactics.Unit limits - you can have 10 units from three categories (offense, defense, utility) so it's not quite a massive strat game as some others. Expect your units to have no self preservation skills, and they don't always like being called back to retreat either.So if the cons seemed a bit heavy, its because I want to be honest in this review. If you like RTS games, and like what you see it is worth it. The way the game feels even today is smooth and just like I recall from nearly two decades ago, whereas normally nostalgia games don't live up to their memory this one most certainly does indeed. Coming back to it as an adult I wonder how I ever played this as a kid, and where it's been all my adult life.			"

Weapon hud text ""sniper rifle"" in russian is out of boundaries.Music stutters sometimes.I really hope that developers will make the game fine with further updates, sorry guys, but i can't recommend this game as it is now.

												This is a good update to the francise, but this compared to the latest version of Battlezone 2, doesn't really compare. Multiplayer in this game is lacks a lot, not a high enough player cap for servers, and as a result of this, the servers are dead. A good story is a plus, but afte the main game, there isn't anything to do besides the broken multiplayer. Not really worth full price, but I would recommend buying this if on sale. Hopefully the devs can work on smothing out multiplayer. "

												I tried to like it - but with each mission in - gets worse.  The AI is horrible (your team mates) - tugs and scavengers that just bump into each other. Your allies will shoot your own things to try and shoot enemy objects on the other side of your vehicles.Some missions you have to send your vehicles to defend objectives - LOL - it's like sending the 3 stooges to do it.Enemy seems to have unlimited resources (pilots) - and each mission is sooo scripted - you have to do some missions a certain way  (which translates into - load , fail, load, fail, load, fail).And in the midst of all of this fun (where an enemy sends turrets, vehicles and long range artillery shots toward you)  you are always running out of ammo so you have to run back to your base or have an armory shoot supplies to you (takes about 3 minutes for them to land).   Full ammo you can probably kill 3 maybe 4 vehicles before you are out.Just didn't find it fun after mission 8 or so.  Tons of micromagement on top of trying to control idiot AI allies.			"

Battlezone 98 Redux is a rehash of an old classic from 1998, brought to STEAM by Rebellion, a company behind such titles as Sniper Elite or Aliens versus Predator [1999, 2010].Battlezone is a hybrid style game, a crossover between first person view vehicle combat shooter [FPS for short] and a real time strategy [RTS]. Does that mix do the job? Yes and no. What is certainly lacking is a pause-and-command button, minding the FPS element is often intense, leaving very little time to make grand strategic decisions. But whether playing Command and Conquer you have ever thought if it was you in one of those tanks, you'd show'em, here you go, Battlezone is all about that and it is tough as nails.The game is a true classic, reminding me of UFO Enemy Unknown [1993] in many aspects. Battlezone and UFO are both innovative, experimenting and focused on multilayer management. Both also represent core science-fiction. While UFO is yet turn-based and more general, Battlezone is real-time and down to the gunbattle.Battlezone is definitely a gem of its time, probably even beyond its time, probably even beyond any time before or after its release, so to say. It is just a unique product. How does it stand nowadays? How playable it ultimately is at the present?That is when things come down to the rating, which unfortunately is negative. STEAM review must be either recommending or dissuading. With greatest difficulty I see this game appealing to modern [2016] players. The problem is more than just nature of visuals or lacking of certain ease elements, such as the mentioned pause-and-command function. It is the oftentimes chaotic picture of action, difficulty of FPS combat and movement controls, overall difficulty level, complex real-time base and force management with flaws characteristic to the early productions standing for RTS genre.The score is 5/10 wHATs grade. I should best repeat what has already been put in one of the other customers reviews: if you are prone to like this game, you probably already know it, thus have little need for any reviews to help you make up your mind about the purchase. Otherwise, if you hesitate, skip it.What is needed with Battlezone, is a complete remake [reboot], reintroducing the game to the modern public, instead of only a visual facelift [redux]. Currently it is a niche release, addressed towards the original versions veterans.			"

												It is amazing, I had this  game when it first came out in 1998.  I had problems with the cursor on my mouse working.  The cursor just didn't show on the screen.  I did get it working after a large time investment and enjoyed the game.  Now it is 2016 and I was excited to enjoy an old game. When I started the game I see that old familier problem no visible mouse cursor.  My system is way different from the one that I had in 1998, but somehow when you wrote the Battlezone 98 redux you managed to preserve those old cursor problems. Good job people, a game with its shortcomings preserved.			"

												feels really laggy for me.doesn't run well.game kind of chokes up when enemies come into veiw.end result is you die, over and over..but I have no problems with Skyrim with this machine.the original was much better in it's day.and the new graphics.. it looks like Ronald McDonald vandalised Battlezone 98 and they are calling it a Redux.https://www.gog.com/forum/battlezone_98_redux/what_about_the_old_classic_versionFrom the gog thread>>alright man, lets talk in circles. this post contains HUMOR, if you don't have a sense of humor stop reading NOW! though it is funny it is serious too, you figure out whats what if you continue reading this post, you do so at your own risk. no offense intended but if it happens.. oh well.. one part that looks like humor is actually very serious.. i'll let you try to figure out which part, but if you have to ask I WILL tell, gleefully. welcome to the cold war 1998. look, i wrote a review there at steam, same thing i said here basically. if you wanna know what version. you can see who bought and reviewed easy enough. 0 out of 3 found it helpful, but 2 found it funny. thats ok, was written in honesty. You should call the NSDF commander and inform him that the vandalism Culprit is obviously Ronald McDonald, you'll know him by the big red shoes and the red nose and his long girlish curly red hair, he will have makeup on his face, commie ♥♥♥♥♥♥.. He will be carrying a ton of orange (it was free, he didn't have enough rupees to buy red) and yellow spray paint, might be huffing it as well. Probably thinks he is some kind of Space Cowboy, but he is just another corporate clown. Where were you at the time of the fore-mentioned NSDF Lunar Property vandalism Mr. Hadley? Do you currently or have you ever owned a pair of big red shoes? Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist party? JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION! we have ways of making you talk Mr. Hadley. Where is the Yellow jumpsuit Mr. Hadley? but seriously.. this is the kind of stuff that happens when Russia calls the U.S. and says ""We're hungry over here"" and we give them a McDonalds.. we really did that btw.. Ronald ""McDonald"" Reagan himself, what a Muppet. NSDF campaign is what hiccups, didn't try the others, first map, training mission did the same with the first drone as well. I only spent an hour in the game, got tired of getting lagged out. I really wanted to like it but i can't say the redux has done it justice. the idea i gave you was alot better than what we were given. couldn't have rated it without buying it. the rating will tell you i played 1 hour as well, just as i said.. lying isn't one of my faults, honesty is though. IF your people tried freespace 2 open, they would know how to fix this, or have an idea how to. back to work.. Chop Chop. (coding hint)?!?! I would really love to see this work fluidly, really would. original art was better though, i liked the gunship grey, personally. maybe a unredux mod for the redux?wish it didn't hiccup, used to be one of the best, reduced to zilch.

												I loved teh N64 version of this game, but it's just not the same. I found it practically impossible to kill anything using an xbox 360 controller. I'm a n00b so I'm blaming the game instead of myself.I spent 30 minutes trying to remap the controls to something sensible. Who makes 'X' the self-destruct button?Then I spent 30 minutes dying repeatedly to the first enemy in the game. It didn't matter what tank I used, it killed me in ~30 seconds. I feel like the game balance is wrong because the bomber and tank units died faster than the scout. I was also very frustrated when bombs and rockets seemed to do less DPS than my scout's mini gun. The rockets were especially frustrating because they fly very slowly, forcing you to lead the target a considerable amount.I could have dealt with all that if the joystick aiming was more intuitive. Most games use joystick as acceleration/force for looking and aiming, this game it's an absolute value. If you aim the stick 10% up, the guy looks exactly 10% up. Where-as in most shooters aiming the stick 10% up makes the guy slowly lean his head up until looking at the sky.			"

												I desperately wanted to love this game as I played over 1000 hours on the sister game of the original, BZFlag. The problem is the learning curve on controls and shooting at targets was just too difficult. It took me several tries just to get through the driving tutorial.  The tank is essentially a hover craft.  Trying to line up targets is next to impossible as the momentum on even the slightest turn is ridiculous.  It is next to impossible to line up a target without swinging past it.Now, I am using a joystick, my controller of choice.  Maybe the game is designed for a game controller. "

												Really wanted to like this game as a nostalgic lover of Battlezone 2, and if they make a Battlezone 2 redux I will buy it in a heartbeat, but I REALLY don't see the appeal to this one.I'm about the second Mars mission in and the game is way too micro-managy to understand what I should and shouldn't be doing. The game gave me a Recycler, an Armory, and ONE Geiser to make use of, so I placed a recycler down, then it told me to go check something out and then when I got there the comms told me ""Ok, cool, lock it down"".HOW!?Was I supposed to build an army before going there?Was I supposed to setup a defense so that in the minute I was gone 5 russkies didn't blow up my recycler?!This is my problem with this game over Battlezone 2 negating the fact it lacks a further in-depth base-building mechanic; it doesn't help you whatsoever and often failing can result in waiting ~5 minutes for a specific wave of enemies to arrive just to trigger something over and over again.I feel like i'm missing specific important controls that are vital to me controlling things, like a command view, but the game doesn't even have a full list of keybinds!The redux devs completely left out all of the important controls (though i'm not sure if even the original had it).Not to mention this game feels repetitive.Every mission so far has been: -Escort-Defend from enemy waves, escort.-Setup base, defenses, defend base, escort.Personally I just hate escort missions in games overall, especially when the vehicle you are escorting seems to be made of paper mache.The story seems decent from the first two hours i've played but it really does feel like basic 1960's sci-fi stuff, which is awesome for some people, and dreadfully boring for others.It's really slow and lacks life.Battlezone II jumped into the more ""character-based"" story-telling at just the right time, when it was starting to become a popular thing to do, and is better for it with memorable characters like Braddock, John, Sharbayev, and Cooke.There's a set-up, an investigation, defense, build-up, and full on attacks with a farily detailed environment.I realise BZR's setting is based on the fact that it's the 1960's and they've JUST basically landed, so there's not going to be much in the way of detail, but christ the landscapes are boring to look at.I don't know, I came in expecting an enhanced BZ1 that is also leagues ahead of BZII, but honestly it isn't.It's certainly enhanced in ways, but the game is too blurry for me to notice unless I downscale 4k to 1080p which completely destroys my performance somehow on my R9 380.If I had another hour to play before my refund, I would have tried the Russian campaign to see if that makes up for it, but honestly I just want to go play something else.If Red Oddyssey expansion comes out (they are ""discussing it"") I may choose to rebuy it and judge the game on that, because that's appearantly the best BZ out there.But not if I have to shell out extra cash for it, it should have came with the game or had compatibility for it in the first place.

												I have now sat and put some more time into this game, practicing, sitting through the tutorial etc.So my initial thoughts are:- Some solid gameplay elements I do love the RTS/Shooter feel it has- Brings back memories of when I played this back in 1998- I would highly recommend you sit through the tutorial its not the best but does help with a few of the basics.- Don't play with the joypad, I agree with some of the comments below its made for mouse and keyboard.- Its very difficult it took a large number of attempts to even do the first mission, but that might just be me!- Graphics still don't look that great but it is a game from 1998I'm going to keep plugging away and try and get better at this one however I'm not sure I can recommend for a casual gamer, if you like a challenge or you used to like the original then I am sure you will love it.

												Challenging and addictive gameplay not properly reproduced by any game to date.If you don't need flashy and overly detailed CoD dubstep graphics - then the fact that it's older should be irrelevant to you, the gameplay is all that matters.Workshop inclusion is incredible, some of the map packs actually add multiplayer options somehow. I love it I love it — no cons besides the lack of multiplayer gameplay customization options; this can be alleviated by downloading the two most popular map packs available on the workshop currently.If you've never played an RTS + FPS hybrid, this is the ONLY released game in the genre that will leave you with a good taste in your mouth.10/10 for its genre9/10 in generalIn short; this gameplay is too good for the release date to matter and it plays like a modern title the best in its genre.

												The classic returns. Possibly the best multi-player game of all time, but with 1920x1080 remastered visuals.Oh, it looks so beautiful. Like the crescent moon on a silky smooth night.Seriously, if you haven't played this game before, or if you played it in the 90s and can remember how utterly addicitive it is, with it's RTS first person perspective, then get this game. The gameplay remains unchanged from the original, but the graphics have been tweaked to modern day standards... and admit it, we all remember graphics from the 90s to be amazing.... so having the game fit with my (rose tinted) memories, makes it even more enjoyable.I mean sure, you can get the original from abandonware sites and even play multiplayer through community servers, but it's worth £10 of anyone's money to get this updated gem.

												oh my.. oh my... !!!Ehem, sorry, played this non-stop when I was tiny, too many hours and 2 lost summers: This was my 'fix' for strategy and fit-person shooter mix.. to put it plainly: Quake and Total Annihilation.You are the commander for you forces on the ground, you go everywhere in Sol System for these alien artifacts in the story arc. You have all the tools you need to achieve your goals; Satellite view so you see the map from above, 1st-person (or 3rd) tank view and finally as a pilot. Each aspect is fully immersive, being as a pilot in a jump-suit you are armed with a sniper rifle, yes YOU CAN SNIPE TANKS! then claim the ship for your own.The scale of battle can be as dynamic Total Annihilation, but with the added choice of being in amungst the skirmish or back at base directing from Satellite view. However, whilst that's all happening a 3rd party maybe scouting your base, just when you're not expecting it... *Sniped*.Enjoy!			"

												A great game but only because it always was, not because of this re-release. This is a minimum effort cash-in. You can run the game at modern resolutions, and expect it to run on a modern system without extra work. There's some fresh life injected into the multiplayer scene, however long that lasts again. Not sure how far 'workshop support' extends but I would say likely not that far. The game plays as it did back in the day, including all the out-dated bits and pieces we've moved on from, e.g. a mess of keyboard binds which you'll need to google, you'll be iterating one-way through weapons with right-click and not mousewheeling it, the voice-over audio quality is still the same original♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc. This is just plain Battlezone, no fancy 'redux' or anything else. You're probably paying too much for something we already had.			"

												I have fond memmories of this game, played it for countless hours back in school...long time ago :) It is a perfect, genre connecting mix of RTS, base building, simulation and tactical gameplay. The game was years ahead of its time. Unfortunately they don't make games like this nowadays. It's a pity since with todays technology and graphics, this would be an instant hit. The campaign(s) are well written and fully voiced. You play a commander of either the US or Soviet forces in a war for resources in our solar system, mostly on the various moons of our planets. But it is not just your standard conflict of US vs Soviet, there will be a surprise in the campaign...nuff said. :) The UI is innovative and context sensitive, which is also absolutely a must for a tactical and strategic game like this, given the orders you have to provide on the fly. Even after so many years developers still can't get UI right and given the complexity of BattleZone, it is a refreshing surprise that a 18 year old game nails it spot on.   If you think that the price is too high for such an old game, let me tell you it is totally worth it. This overhaul comes with completly new models of vehicles, buidlings, surfaces and sky-boxes. It is not just a fake ""HD overhaul"". It ain't 2016 graphics but it is surprisingly pretty for a game from 1998.Two thumbs up!			"

												The negative reviews make me laugh so far it's1. Game is to hard (Guess what this is how they where back in the day you were not spoon fed the game you had to read the damn manual.)2. For a redux the graphics are bad... (Really.... This game was made back in 98 all they can really do is polish them up look at games like AoE2 HD FF7 all of em still look in some way shape or form dated but polished and games that get HD remaster always will look dated but with a polish on the old graphics if you don't get that....Jesus....)3. Game is buggy (This I will give you there are a few hiccups all and all however this game is very solid for a new release game and a updated one at that most HD remakes of games are buggy messes this one isn't so bad I have yet to run into a single bug.... So yeah..)Bottom line there is no legit negatives about this game save for reason number 3 what I would say is one of the greatest games to mix a FPS and RTS together the buck stops here the community in multiplayer alone is enough to stand on that pedestal and yeah it may seem kinda dead but it was just released today give it some time for the word to get out it will only get better.

Great storyline about an altternative space program that happened during the cold war between the US and the Russians and later with the chinese.  This game is US and RUssian campaigns, 2 seperate and totally different campaigns.  Deep storyline about the history of biometal, orgins of man.If you just want a deathmatch, look no further, great great fun.   Strategy can be difficult against veterans, just create ""noobie"" game and community will respect that.   Best longtime community I know of in terms of modding.

												Disclamier: This review is in progress and is not done. I am going to try and keep it fair. I am Letting you know that I am fanboy of the game. This is was my second game I played when I was a child. Also my most favorite of all time. I would recomend this at the momment to fans and hardcorefans. To the new person looking at it I would recommend putting it on your wishlist for a while until some good mods come down the pipe. I have no idea if Rebellion is going to further update the game. I would love them to do it. I wish they expanded MP a lot more. That remains to be seen though. Can change further down the line.Now on to the report:- The game has been running stable without anymods enabled on Windows 10 so far, however, when enabling mods issues occur.- There has been some audio issues with the music but its really minor. You can just downloaded a better version of the soundtrack in workshop anyways. Just make sure you enable it in mods. - Sometimes the AI has some issues on pathing.			"

												The nostalgia is strong with this one! If you liked/loved the original this will bring it all back. If you never played the original you owe it to yourself to check it out now. Battlezone did so much right 18 years ago and it's apparent when you play this, almost 20 year old, game and experience it.A seamless blend of FPS and RTS the likes of which has not yet been outdone, even today.

												I had earlier not recommended the game because the game's resolution was unchangeble. Turns out, the game was running on the integrated GPU rather than my external GPU. I had to force it use the external GPU. Now I'm getting very good framerates in 1080p with everything set to high.Coming to the game itself, it certainly brings a wave of nostalgia. I was a huge fan of the battlezone game in my younger days. Awesome game!! I just hope they launch the revamped version of Battlezone 2 now.			"

												It's the Bzone I remember from my childhood except it works on modern day systems.I will admit the controls take a bit of getting used to, but thats all part of the challenge. Really refreshing to play through the missions again and realize that they still kick my♥♥♥♥♥on medium difficulty.Updated graphics are nice but don't expect anything special (the game is from 98, you can only do so much to it).Haven't found any significant bugs yet, but I expect there are some since it's still new.Haven't tried multiplayer yet but from what I've seen just looking through the lobby there aren't that many people doing multiplayer.All around fun game. Would definitely recommend.			"

												So, here's the thing. There are far too few genre mix games like this. Uprising and Battlezone are among the first, and also the finest out there. Here's a game where you not only fly hovertanks, but you can hop out and snipe enemy pilots from their vehicles to steal them! The campaign is quite long and does a good job at providing an interesting story, especially for a game this early.There were some crippling bugs at launch but even a day later many, if not most issues have been fixed.This re-release is definitely worth the price of admission: The devs not only made the game work on new PCs, but they actually added new features like a completely new rendering engine based on Ogre, multiplayer lobby support via Steam, and even Steam Workshop for mods. You can even play community-made multiplayer coop missions together.Should you get this? Yes. Yes you should.			"

												I did not know this was happening, but it happened and that made me very happy.I have played the first few levels, the game feels just like the original only cleaned up, The AI seems a bit more responsive than I recall, as it seems when i order my guys to fire on my target it happens in pretty good time, where as in the original that was a bit of a crap shoot. I have yet to use bombers and find if they fixed their tendency to shoot the ground in front of them as the decelerate.Also they chose to Drop the ""High Detailed"" Grizzly cockpit view in favor for the blocky one, a good move me thinks.All in all game is as good as it ever was, the remaster adds nice high res textures but feels the same otherwise.

												Battlezone is not a casual RTS game. Don't make that mistake coming into this game.  The game's difficulty is pretty steep on some places forcing you to think about what you need and plan out a good defense and offence. Unlike most RTS ideals where rushing into battle before the AI get's its camp set, you're rewarded for planning out your base and making the right choices for your army. The storyline for the game is also really interesting. Each mission opens the storyline up a bit more, not giving you worthless side quests that have no effect on the story.Now, there are some issues, but you'll have that when dealing with older titles. The Devs have so far been pretty good about hearing everyone out and fixing what they can.I'd highly recommend this game not just cause the game itself is fun and challenging, but the odds of getting BattleZone 2 being remade the same way is better if you do. To me, BZ2 is the better of the two but this game still has its place on top. Hopefully this game gets popular again so that other Devs try their hand at FPS\RTS games, because it's a genre that doesn't get enough love.			"

												Such a great game. I'm so glad to see it revitalized. I know I'll be playing it with my kids. I hope more people of this newer generation get to appreciate it.The biggest critisism over the genre as to why it didn't take off in 98 can be summed up in this quote:""FPS players don't like to think. RTS players don't like to die.""This puts Battlezone into a niche for refined gamers.			"

												I have fond memmories of this game, played it for countless hours back in school...long time ago :) It is a perfect, genre connecting mix of RTS, base building, simulation and tactical gameplay. The game was years ahead of its time. Unfortunately they don't make games like this nowadays. It's a pity since with todays technology and graphics, this would be an instant hit. The campaign(s) are well written and fully voiced. You play a commander of either the US or Soviet forces in a war for resources in our solar system, mostly on the various moons of our planets. But it is not just your standard conflict of US vs Soviet, there will be a surprise in the campaign...nuff said. :) The UI is innovative and context sensitive, which is also absolutely a must for a tactical and strategic game like this, given the orders you have to provide on the fly. Even after so many years developers still can't get UI right and given the complexity of BattleZone, it is a refreshing surprise that a 18 year old game nails it spot on.   If you think that the price is too high for such an old game, let me tell you it is totally worth it. This overhaul comes with completly new models of vehicles, buidlings, surfaces and sky-boxes. It is not just a fake ""HD overhaul"". It ain't 2016 graphics but it is surprisingly pretty for a game from 1998.Two thumbs up!			"

												The classic returns. Possibly the best multi-player game of all time, but with 1920x1080 remastered visuals.Oh, it looks so beautiful. Like the crescent moon on a silky smooth night.Seriously, if you haven't played this game before, or if you played it in the 90s and can remember how utterly addicitive it is, with it's RTS first person perspective, then get this game. The gameplay remains unchanged from the original, but the graphics have been tweaked to modern day standards... and admit it, we all remember graphics from the 90s to be amazing.... so having the game fit with my (rose tinted) memories, makes it even more enjoyable.I mean sure, you can get the original from abandonware sites and even play multiplayer through community servers, but it's worth £10 of anyone's money to get this updated gem.

												OMG.. I played the crap out of this game when I was a wee lad in middle school. I continued playing until some how I lost the disc and it fell back into the ""good ol' days"" area of my mind. Now, finally, it has been resurrected from the annals of history for all to enjoy once more. Space is back! And its been a long time coming. Get this game if you are so tired of the sword and stone RPG dark age we have been forced to live with for the past decade. Seriously, D/L this game. They don't make them like this any more. Big publishers have ruined our once proud PC gaming culture. This was a time when we had just recieved Half life, Homeworld, and Battlezone. These are the games that shaped the future and were way ahead of their time.			"

Also if you want some extras, the Community its working ASAP to port the old Instant Action maps and Mods for Redux, IA's are great to test your skills in combat and MP, some missions are pretty damn hard but impressive.If you love RTS and Action FPS games, Battlezone its for You, The old MW, interstate and DR had managed to crat this masterpice of series, Both BZ 1 and 2 are GREAT, once you play it, ther's no turning back, until you finish up the game with a Bobcat!

												Battlezone was released back in 1998 and was one of the first action-RTS hybrids - it has all the usual elements of an RTS, but you command from the ground in a vehicle, fighting alongside your troops. The genre never really took off, but because Battlezone was bundled with a lot of graphics cards it reached a wide audience and gained a cult following.If you are someone who's considering buying this having played it way back when, do it. It's a reworking, not a remake, so the real BZ atmosphere is still there. The ships and buildings are all heavily redone, with much more detailed models and much larger textures. They look excellent. The terrain looks very much like it did back in the original, so it's still behind Battlezone 2, nevermind more modern titles. But all things considered, the graphics do a good job today with the update. The gameplay is as rich as ever. Multiplayer is now handled through Steam within the game, which keeps things nice and simple, with all the old options. A bomber DM is still a thrill after all these years.If you are someone who's never played the original and are wondering whether you should buy this, well don't expect it to look fresh. The developers of this update have done an incredible job hauling parts of the game into the 2010s, but there are engine limitations. Firefights are limited to a few hundred meters in distance, and don't expect detailed ballistics or other physics.The real joy of Battlezone, however, was always its gameplay, and its blend of FPS and RTS that has never really been replicated since. In each mission you will be dogfighting and base building, often at the same time. A selection of ships can be built, each of which offer different benefits, and you can kit them out with a variety of weapons. Your resources (""biometal"") are gathered by Scavengers which have an annoying habit of wandering off into dangerous areas and so need to be constantly protected. Two single-player campaigns are included, so there's a hefty chunk of content for someone who has no plans to dabble in multiplayer.At the price, this game still delivers eighteen years after its original release, whether you're looking for something new or a satisfying hit of nostalgia. Buy it.			"

												An excellent balance struck between updating the graphics, screen resolution and operating system compatibility whilst staying true and recognisable from the '98 game: it plays just as well as the original.  I'm really looking forwards to the community workshop creations and some good multi-player action.			"

												One of the best PC Titles of all time, Been trying to get my original copy to work on modern systems for much too long with not much success.  Kudos to the devs for rereleasing it; they did an amazing job! Hopefully they will redux The Red Odyssey Expansion =)			"

												It's the Bzone I remember from my childhood except it works on modern day systems.I will admit the controls take a bit of getting used to, but thats all part of the challenge. Really refreshing to play through the missions again and realize that they still kick my♥♥♥♥♥on medium difficulty.Updated graphics are nice but don't expect anything special (the game is from 98, you can only do so much to it).Haven't found any significant bugs yet, but I expect there are some since it's still new.Haven't tried multiplayer yet but from what I've seen just looking through the lobby there aren't that many people doing multiplayer.All around fun game. Would definitely recommend.			"

												So, here's the thing. There are far too few genre mix games like this. Uprising and Battlezone are among the first, and also the finest out there. Here's a game where you not only fly hovertanks, but you can hop out and snipe enemy pilots from their vehicles to steal them! The campaign is quite long and does a good job at providing an interesting story, especially for a game this early.There were some crippling bugs at launch but even a day later many, if not most issues have been fixed.This re-release is definitely worth the price of admission: The devs not only made the game work on new PCs, but they actually added new features like a completely new rendering engine based on Ogre, multiplayer lobby support via Steam, and even Steam Workshop for mods. You can even play community-made multiplayer coop missions together.Should you get this? Yes. Yes you should.			"

												One of very few games that can successfully meld RTS and first person controls. If you think a blizzard style RTS would be improved if you could get stuck-in yourself, then this is the game for you.			"

												Terrific example of what a remaster should be, a good facelift that leaves all of the original gameplay intact. 98 Redux is a must have for any fan of the original, or anybody else looking for something different.			"

												I never thought I would see this game ever again. I used to play it with a friend all the time when I was a kid. Now I will admit it doesn't feel the same as what I remember but that was 11 years ago. This game is absolutely fantastic. The controls are nice and loose and easy to figure out. Unfortunately I couldn't find any form of tutorial but I quickly learned how to play by the end of the first mission. But that would be my only complaint. Fantastic game! Fantastic memories! Thank you Rebellion!--- UPDATE ---Found the tutorial			"

												Classic game. Classic gameplay. Nothing really like it. Strategy FPS. I always hoped other developers would catch on to this genre, but alas there hasn't really been much of anything. Just played two games with my dad. Very fun.			"

												The graphics arent great, but seriously, this is a 98' game. Get this for the gameplay; the gameplay is rock solid. I've yet found a game that blends the fps & rts genres as finely as this one. It's a classic.			"

												Amazing game, the best real time strategy game I've evr played. It really put you in the seat of the commander you're sort of playing as. Not like other games, it really cuases you to think and be ready, becuase you can die, but your AI friendlies aren't always the smartest, so you have to put your own life at risk. Its a really cool game, recommend for any good gamer looking for a challenge, 10/10			"

												I used to play this game religiously when it orginally came out in 98 and I love it just as much now. Slightly updated graphics  but the same old playibility is still there. Some of the campaign missions are surprisngly difficult but this is a lot of fun and great value.			"

												Do I regret buying this game? Not at all. It's hard as all hell, and I'm only slightly ashamed to admit that I've been playing it on very easy. How my eight year old self ever beat it, much less got good at multiplayer, is an answer lost to the ages. Would I pay 30 bucks for this again? I don't know. While I don't regret buying this at full price, if you're even a little hesitant, hold off on the purchase and wait for a sale. If I didn't have such a massive nostalgia attachment, I probably wouldn't forgive this game so easily. There are control issues. It's a helluva lot harder than I remember. There are likely bugs I haven't encountered yet.  If you're like me and your biggest misgiving is the lack of the ""ACTIVISION SMASH"" intro, then give it a few minutes, get through those first levels, and (for me at least) it has been an absolute joy to jump back into the Cold War.....IN SPACE!10/10 astronauts would be stricken from history again.

												Bit hard to objectively review this game. I own this game since about 1999 and loved it since I had it.For that reason I love seeing a version on Steam so I can comfotably download it from Steam and not have to worry about the state of the original disks, plus it allows for the community to receive some new blood.However, the game is very poorly optimized and seems to run poorer on my modern system than it did back in 1999. Apparently it is purelly a graphical update since all the bugs and problems the game had it still has.For €20,- I did not get it, but with a Steam sale and a 50% discount it is worth the money in my book, but I'm a bit biased there since I still have 2 original disks so I'm effectivly paying money the 3rd time for the same game.

												Pretty cool game I had no existed until this came out.These kinda games always makes me a bit nostalgic. If only developers still made this kind of stuff and don't treat you like a comlete moron.Anyway, it's pretty much a mix of Mechwarrior and Herzog Zwei. (I do realize Battlezone is a long running series)The mission structure is very similar to RTS games of the time, so it does end up feeling like more of a strategy game.This game is pretty god damn difficult. Like... Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥First I tried the game with a Xbox 360 controller which worked pretty good except that aiming is such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥that it's not even worth it. So I switched to M+KB and completed the first couple of mission after some failed attempts, but I have still not gotten very far.The enemy gets really freaking relentless and sends a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of reinforcments while you're barely scraping by.It may just be me not getting it or not being very used to this game yet. But I bet this will grow some hair on your gaming chest.But yeah, it's a solid RTS vehicular combat hybrid, something you'll never get nowadays.			"

												One of my all time favorites! If you have never played this before, it is worth every penny! I have been playing this since 1998 on the first version that came out. It soon followed by the many different graphic card versions at the time. It is a classic and the new Redux version had done a fantastic job at remastering the original 1998 version. So a special treat, turn on Special items under Play options.  Special thanks go out to Ken Miller who has kept this game going since the original. Bravo!!!!!			"

												Battlezone was the first PC game I ever played, and it introduced me to PC gaming.  Even after the nostalgia, this game is amazing with its fast-paced levels and strategy.  This reiteration seems more balanced than the original (flash cannon was rediculous), so it provides more of a challenge even to the experienced player.  I would recommend this to anyone.			"
