												This game, as I see it, is THE MOST boiled-down RTS ever. You have a color. Planets generate ships depending on size. Ships attack and defend 1:1. Deplete a planet of enemy ships and it's yours. This sounds simple, but it plays out in frantically-paced battles where you have to micromanage planet-by-planet, while overarching resource-management also affects outcomes and turns of fate.A round takes about ten minutes to play, so it's easy to get in a casual round. Unfortunately the server browser leaves a lot to be desired so sometimes you spend another 5 minutes looking for a game that hasn't started and isn't empty. There are still a number of regular players although there tend to be few populated servers to choose from.Still, when this goes on sale, it is worth picking up just to witness the simple, elegant strategies that unfold when you remove all the crazy additional variables that most RTS games introduce. Galcon Fusion doesn't reinvent the genre, but it streamlines it better than anything else I've played. It's also available on a bunch of different platforms, so yay Galcon.Buy it! And one protip: don't immediately attack someone with all your ships when a round starts! You might survive long enough to enjoy it!			"

												Space triangle warfare in a neat and entertaining package.If things like plot, build orders and unit counters are your favourite things in RTS games, you might want to check out a different game.There is one unit in Galcon Fusion: the space triangle. It defeats its enemies by crashing headfirst into them. For as long as you control a planet, it makes more space triangles. You can then use these to get more planets. Which, in turn, allows you to have more space triangles.Sometimes, there are other players pitting their space triangles against yours. Standard protocol in those situations is to engage in space triangle warfare. Some other times, there are also allies who help you crush the enemy space triangles with their own.So, just like bullets, you keep throwing space triangles at the enemy until it is no longer able to throw his own back at you.Space Triangle Warfare.

												Game is interesting, but no sense of matchmaking and fair maps takes away the chance to get good at it, especially if you are new to it, as every single game you play will be a loss. There are only 30-40 people playing it and they have been playing it for a while, so it's impossible to find any matches for your level.And game is mostly defined by having a good start on the map, especially 1v1 is determined by a random dice roll while generating the map.So If you like luck based games, try it. Otherwise you will just keep on quitting matches five seconds after looking into the map. I've found it similar to playing chess where a dice roll determines who gets which pieces. Even if you win, you won't know if it was skill, or luck. "

												Galcon Fusion is a micro-RTS, where you take over planets with ships and eventually conquer your opponents' forces.I'll start off with the good. This is a simple game that's very easy to learn, and the simplicity of the graphics really helps. The battles are won or lost purely by numbers: troops will kill eachother one-for-one. As a result, battles come down to who can produce troops the quickest, and that will be the player with the most planets. It can lead to some interesting strategies... I had a three-way game where I held the most planets while being bombarded by the full might of the other players. Keeping my planets was a back-and-forth struggle, because I had to retake my planets within seconds or die a quick death, eventualy getting the smallest advantage that I could use to take one more planet.Now, for the bad. The levels are randomly generated, which adds some diversity, but is often unfair. While there are many game modes, they still boil down to the same basic gameplay, and it gets repetitve (with added frustration from bad maps). And the controls are terrible on a PC. I played this on a tablet, and it was a little better, but I yelled at my computer a few times when I couldn't do what I wanted. This game requires quick thinking and rapid movement. It requires what StarCraft players would call ""good micro strategy"". Moving from one planet to another with clicking is fine, but dragging was unreliable (required to move troops to an allied planet). Multi-selecting planets is really useful, but double-clicking and box-dragging were both unreliable as well. It really sucks when you know what you want the game to do, but the game refuses to do it.Also, the sound is slightly annoying.Overall, This game is a fun diversion for a few hours, and not much more. I probably wouldn't pay over a dollar for this. There are plenty of games of similar quality on Kongregate (though I don't think those have multiplayer).			"

												One of my 1st games on steam, 150 achievements were something amazing back in the day :O.+Visuals: Pretty nice, colorful, fully changeable and easy to understand interface.+Soundwork: okay.+Gameplay: A lot of various play modes, some of them too hard for me and simply unplayable. Half of the gameplay is the achievements grind, and half of the achievements are only possible to unlock in multiplayer. Nowadays you can see a maximum of 2-3 people online at best, so it's pretty hard to get all achievements.-No steam cardsOver this is an enjoyable strategy, and for nerds, it would be even better!

												Galcon is apparently a venerable series/genre of games, but this is one of the worse entries in it despite being by the original publisher. It lacks both any sort of singleplayer other than random skirmishes, and simple multiplayer features that are normally considered de rigueur, like private matches.There's better, if somewhat less pretty, free Flash versions of it, basically. Or the cheap DSiWare knockoff Castle Conqueror series. And that's sad.			"

												Galcon Fusion is a very simple, very fun, slightly overpriced game. In the style of ""liquid wars"", it's a real-time strategy game where you send out your ships to capture planets, which generate more ships, so you can capture more planets. Doing this while your opponent tries the same is what makes it fun. TONS of different game modes and even a cute ""retro mode"" option make this an EXCELLENT buy for sub-five dollars. Don't get it at full price though.			"

												Despite adding some fancy graphical upgrades and some new game modes, Galcon Fusion actually feels like a step back to me. I think Fusion focuses on single player being more of a test bed while multiplayer is the real point of the game. Legends had a much better focus and sense of direction because there was actually a story and universe to progress through and conquer.As a person who is anything but a fan of competitive multiplayer, Fusion is superficially an improvement but as an experience feels entirely inferior to Legends.

												One of the originators of RTS2X...These games go away back to the 1970's, and were amazing. This game is really a reboot of those old games. In fact the F-10 retro mode in it harkens back to the first DEC and DECWAR games. Modern games like Auralux, Eufloria, and Gratitus Space Battles all owe their lineage to THIS GAME and it's ancestors.One of the best, most satisfying games ever made, right here..			"

I think spaceships is the most fun, but unless there's some sort of upgrade system (and in this case there is not), it's really just the same old game. Not that it's bad: I play this game all the time, especially on my laptop. It just has very little depth.			"

Had a great time playing it. The games can last from a few seconds to a various stressful minutes. Once it starts its a fight to the finish. Specially when playing the computer on the highest level, it can be pretty tough to beat. Admiral level and higher AI is worth the challenge. Part of your success depends on the map.

												Here's a thing I'm going to do: I'm going to quit out of the game, right click some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, do something, and then get an account on some non-steam forum so I can play multiplayer. Pause. Not. Just gonna right click and delete local content, thanks anyway.			"

												Просто сумашедшая игра про треугольники и то как ими можно захватывать планеты :) Скачайте демо-версию и гляньте, если мозг закипит, то можете себе представить что будет творится в мульииплеере с живыми людьми. Интересная штука, но не для всех, честно говоря.			"

												This is real-time strategy boiled down to its bare essence and served with an unhealthy addiction.  Individual game sessions are quick yet satisfying.  Look at the clock when you start and when you finish; hours will have flowed by yet felt like mere minutes.  Just one more game...  :)			"

												Nice title for a quick bit of galactic conquest.  Not a great deal of depth here, but a good mind cleaner nonetheless.			"

												Great, classic feeling strategy game. Breaks the strategy game genre's strategic elements down into its main components: booming, turtling, risk, reward. Easy to learn, impossible to completely master.			"

												I like this game because It has simple rules and controls for a pure RTS. No perks, no bonuses, 1 ship = 1 defense or 1 attack, planets generate ships over time. It all comes down to how you use your ships. There are also a lot of fun unique ways of playing the classic game.			"

												[7/10]Another fun installment of the Galcon series. This game has single player AND multiplayer. The single player has lots of different game types and a variety of difficulties. The multiplayer, in my opinion, is less fun. The maps often favor one player or another, and games can drag on for hours. All in all, a entertaining game.			"

												This game is RISK on space. I hope you have played RISK at least once, really fun board game.Not only is it based on space and you conquer planets with ships instead of countries with your army. It is also real time, as such instead of taking turns to attack adjacent planets, you send your ships anywhere you like and se them travel the distance on screen and the enemies reacting to this.The game has a single player mode with several difficulty levels... the hardest is really unforgiving mind you, you have to cut its supplies off quickly before it overwhelms you.But it also has multiplayer, with lobbies, multiple players, teams, and whatnot. These battles can get pretty hectic since it usually becomes everyone versus the guy that is winning at the moment, yet veteran players can  be left with just a single planet and then end up conquering the board.

												Though it may look retro and simplistic the gameplay can get pretty complex in this space RTS. In Galcon Fusion you control a fleet that you most use to conquer all of the planets while your opponent does the same. Its a great game for the money, and with its many different game modes to choose from Ii will keep you coming back for more.			"

												It's that game where you send ships to planets to colonize planets and to absorb the goons on other planets! I frankly wasn't very fascinated by this one, so this is as much review as you're going to get.			"

												Potentially one of the most unique 'RTS' games that I have ever played. This is as simple as it can get while retaining the fun factor that is key to any game. With a large amount of single player mods and a fun and often tense multiplayer mode. This is one for any 'RTS' fan who just wants to fling ships into planets on the road to domination.			"

												A thing that I like about Galcon is that it begins on very low difficulty level and slowly ascends through a lot of achievements to very challenging. Probably most in multiplayer mode. So it can be very, very relaxing up to speedy challenging and tactical.I also looked a bit around and found out some interesting informations about Galcon on the Kickstarter page of its maker Phil Hassey. He claims to have invented the RTS genre of swarm games… And in Galcon Fusion you can actually try different rule sets of the base game. – You would also find his ""community manager of Galcon"" washing goats in a shower – and talking about further plans… Or you find Phil fiddling amongst his goats… well! Also amusing was for me to find a Steam group only to share videos of Galcon gameplays… ;D Some are even enjoyable to watch ;) – Galcon is a small game that I recommend for various small and some challenging reasons.

												For a game that is a bunch of circles and triangles, it is pretty addictive and well designed. The game modes make sure that you are never bored and always adequately challenged. I haven't played the PvP on the game but I doubt that really hinders this games unique design. This game proves that, even with mediocre graphics and less than complex game design, it will always be fun.			"
