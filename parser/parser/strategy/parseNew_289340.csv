												Echoing and further summarizing what reviews before me have said, this is a pretty cool game with some major, perhaps deal-breaking flaws.The premise of the game is simple, straightforward, and works the way you expect it to. You start with a lump sum of cash and are expected to buy your first vehicle. Could be a car (meaning self-contained transport, like a flatbed or an armored car) or a truck, requiring a trailer. Afterwards, hire a driver that has the required licenses. In both cases, you have a lot of options. Vehicles can be selected on the grounds of:•	Price•	Storage/transport capacity•	Speed•	Reliability•	Ease or difficulty of repair•	Predicted lifespan and depreciation rate.Employees can be selected based on their starting wage, experience, and skills. Drivers have certain licenses which you can train them in and get faster as they gain experience. Managers have additional skills that make your business more efficient, however do not have much effe-....well, actually no. They do just as much as managers do in real lifeBuy things, hire drivers, get contracts, make money. Fun, right?Bugs:This game is horrible, like, unfathomably horribly coded. Minor bug: The personnel market *completely* changing every couple of hours (which is about a second at the slowest game speed), so you have to pause every time you want to hire someone, because their portraits move, but the buttons stay the same, so you click the button that was for person A and you hire person J because in the last microsecond, his face moved up the queue. This is the same for contracts as well, so again, unless the game is paused, you might accept a contract that is far too big for your vehicle or must be completed faster than you can drive.The game has no concept of retaining sound settings and must be configured via launcher. Actually, no settings can be changed inside the game or on the fly. Major Bug:All contracts must be completed within a certain amount of time, notwithstanding it takes about 45 in-game days to drive what appears to be no more than ten miles, you are given an average speed your vehicle must travel at in order to satisfy the contract. However, up to a certain point it is impossible because traffic affects whether you complete or fail a contract. If there is a car in the passing lane, your trucks will rarely make an attempt to pass in the slow lane. Furthermore, if you fail a contract, your truck may simply stop. That's it, road closed. It will never move and cars will back up behind it indefinitely. You cannot resolve this bug because your vehicle and driver must be in the garage in order to be sold and fired, respectively.Deal-breaker:Despite the fact that most factories have large, large, loading zones (that only get bigger as you make them more profitable), the maximum amount of vehicles that can exist within the loading dock is two. However, the maximum number of vehicles *that are moving* within the loading zone is one, meaning that if you ever have three trucks doing business with the same factory or, god forbid, you have a competitor doing business with a factory, you will have a line of trucks five cars long waiting for the one guy who is moving his truck in the loading zone. This will invariably cause you to fail all contracts that includes that factory. And since any good competitor AI does business with a multitude of clients, all factories will see competitor trucks and cause you to fail, this makes over half of the game maps unplayable.And since the previous bug makes any map not playable for long, the amount of time you can play this game instead of restarting it is pretty small.Cool concept, poorly executed, I do not recommend this game, however consider trying it sometime if a friend already bought it, or if it is ever on sale more than 50% off.

												Freight Tycoon Inc is a management game where you are entrusted to develop and maintain a Freight company that delivers goods for various manufacturing plants around the map. The game is set on a number of levels that provide you a certain challenge, each in its own way. While to some the levels system may seem out of place, in actuality, its a good thing. Once you have completed the level, you are given the option to continue playing on the level permanently. Just click yes, save your game for that level once it reloads and off you go, continuous play.In Freight Tycoon you have to manage a number of things. The purchase of vehicles and trailers, the hiring of staff from managers, technicians, drivers, repair trucks, etc etc. Its also been done in a very nice style. You cannot just pick any truck or driver or job. Each truck in the game has a top speed it can travel at so you want to ensure jobs you get for that truck don't require more speed than your truck can go at, otherwise you will fail your contract. The truck also has a type, which means the type of carriage it has and what it can carry, this is also important as it determines what contracts you can acquire which need to be of the same carriage. The driver you hire has to have a license to drive the truck type you have bought.This may seem daunting but the way the interface is laid out makes doing this so very easy, it is a genius UI here. The graphics are also surprisingly good in this game and the map comes to life the more you deliver contracts with houses and building slowly being built, upgraded by the game mechanics filling the map with life, it is quite an extraordinary mechanic that I have not seen done before automatically by the game.The only con I find in this game is the options menu. For one, you cannot play in window mode, there is no option to do that in the options menu, so your stuck in full screen mode. This may not be an issue for a lot of you, but for me because I work too, I like to have my game running in window mode in the background, that's not possible here unless there is some ini file I haven't found that can do that.The other con is Sounds. You cannot turn them off from the options menu when you go to it from the main menu. I'm not sure if there is an ingame menu to do it from, I have not found one.Overall Freight Tycoon is well worth the money to purchase. I was very sceptical about it when I got it but I was pleasantly surprised. Give this game a chance if you like Tycoon games, its well worth it.			"

												It's nearly a good game. It has so much potential, but it suffers the same fate of many a tycoon game. There is always a best decision that can be made by a crude guess and the worst decision leaves you no worse off than the best.Now, I don't mean that there isn't always a best decision in other tycoon games, but usually the campaigns change that and you end up with a reasonable choice between say fuel efficiency, reliability or something else and the campaign helps dictate that. But unfortunately here the best cargo carriers are in the form of either the really small vans that you can use to spam contracts, or the much more expensive lorries. Most of the inbetween vehicles are too slow to get most contracts.So once you've got your obviously best array of vehicles I assume you're ready for a tough decision over which contract you should make? Okay, well it doesn't really matter, just pick any that your vehicle is both big enough for and fast enough for. Will it make a profit? Of course! Does it matter which cargo you choose to haul? No, of course not! They're all roughly the same cost to carry and the same profit. What about your staff members? Don't you worry, when you're hiring there'll be a best candidate by far and little to no extra cost!So now you've made those tough decisions, what will you do? Just watch the money roll in of course and make them again whenever you have to.Zen Tycoon.The UI is friendly. It's simple and for the most part it get the job done. Though it is occasionally a little clunky.The problem is without the depth (no training for staff members, upgrades for lorries, fuel consumption to be considered, different benefits to different cargo, or interaction with competitors/clients, what about routes? Nah.) or bredth (no involvement in other industries like Railroad Tycoon, no trains or ships for cargo, no direct involvement in road development) the game is left feeling very samey very quickly.It's the sort of game you'll probably play once or twice and leave by the wayside.

												""7/10"" According to My Own Ratings.WARNING: Ignore the trailer. It has nothing to do with the game. Check the screenshots instead. It should be obvious but still worth reminding.The game could be more challenging. By could I mean should. But it's pretty cheap so... might be worth checking out  if you like this kind of tycoon/company simulators game.You buy vehicles, hire people, upgrade company, buy and upgrade garages, sign contracts and assign vehicles to work on them.As you complete contracts, your rating with each enterprise will go up allowing ""special"" contracts and the enterprise will be improved. The game is cool but not challenging at all. You can ""cheat"" by placing multiple vehicles to work on the same contract. That way you can complete contracts that require a higher load or speed than a single truck could do. The load might in some cases be possible to divide irl, but no matter how many trucks drving at 54km/h you use, you would never be able to complete a contract that requires you to go at 70km/h as this game accepts. Even when you actually fail a stage because your truck was much slower than the minimum requirement, multiple trucks allow you to ensure you don't fail the remaining stages and get the money and ratings for something you didn't do.also... get ready to spend a lot of time in this game if you want to see the ""over 100 car models"".

												I have played several transport-related tycoons and I have to say I really like this one, for one simple reason: it is EXTREMELY simple to play, and quick to do ANYTHING. 2 or 3 clicks and you buy trucks, you assign several to routes(contracts), or you remove them.The graphics are suitable for such a game in my opinion (helps to keep the loadings really fast), with the construction that happens occasionally being very detailed in my opinion.The animation is fine. The sound can't really say, because I play with the sound off :)So all in all, I find it a really fun game (and isn't that the purpose of a game?), that just motivates you to play more and more and advance. It is not too difficult nor to easy. It is just great :)			"

												   I'm not understanding all of the anger about this game, unless they bought it for more than I did ($2.50). If this game is guilty of anything it's a tutorial that makes the easy parts of the game sound complicated and then just doesn't explain anything else. This game could do more like giving you the ability to buy the industries you're servicing or give you more options like planes or trains to serve them better but i do enjoy how the areas of the city grow when you are successful. Yes it has older graphics, and by the way the trailer looks better than the game, but a game like this is about the management. DEAL BREAKER!!, Wow, you should just buy it for under $5.00 and enjoy.			"

												Definitely worth the price,i've been playing it every day since i purchased it.On some contracts you need to think how to complete them and rake in the big prize money and that's either by putting your largest trailers on the job or hiring more staff and buying more trucks. Although the graphics isn't the best you can't expect the best graphics for the price that has been asked.I'd rate this game 9/10.			"

												I beta tested this game several years ago. I really enjoyed this game a lot. Moreso because while working as a graphic designer, my principal client was a freight & shipping management company. I can tell you that this game really captures the complexity of running and managing a trucking distribution company. If you're into micromanagement, this will keep your neurons busy and give you a 'control phreak high' :) I recommend this game which somehow passed unnoticed when it was first published.			"

												I enjoy this game well enogh, though it has flaws to be sure.The graphics are functional, though the lack of resolution options is annoying as it can make some text difficult to read.  Also when mousing over office options, no tooltip is given for what effect the stats have, you must remember what all the little icons look like, then reference the main office page.  Otherwise, it is all about figuring out what are the appropriate truks to invest in given the companies nearby. Some condsideration must also be given for having too many of your trucks taking orders at the same business, as they can get crowded during loading/unloading.I cannot compare to other Tycoon games as the only other one I have played is SimThemepark some years back.Good if you enjoy micromanaging a company and it's assets, including personnel hiring and setting tasks.

												This game has an element that openTTD does not have that I think makes the game a winner; load specific dispatching and time management. The fact you need to have the right truck to haul said cargo along a a predetermined route plus make sure everything is on time appeals to me as I love logistics. The one thing that really bugs me that everyone seems to complain about is ""why only trucks?"" Because that's what makes the game! OpenTTD let's you build a striaght shot across a map so you can start with the highest profit route out there. Freight tycoon you need to plan and understand your choices. You need to actively engage in every truck you own; not just set it and forget it. One thing I would like to see added is a greater use of cause and effect with city growth and development. But that's just my feelings.			"

												Well for starters, the game's text is so small I cant see a damn thing. Second, the mouse cant even get close to the edge of the screen that it makes the map move all the time, I try to click on ok as it says but the map keep moving down. Then its not at the right place, meaning, the mouse is over the left side one and half inche on the left of the ok icon for me to click it. And the graphics could use some polishing or two. Beside that it would be promising, but since the text is so small, I got to get close to my screen to see something. It need a lot of fixing, a LOT.			"

												I really liked this game, I only downvoted because I want a mixed review and at the time I wrote the review, 62% voted for up.Pity pity pity, this is actually a great game, I like it very much, and it is of great value, got from steam sale for less then 2USD.Gameplay is extrememly straight forward, you take contract from firms and construct enough vehicle to take the order and make profit, and grow. Breakdown may happen, depending on your luck and how well your maintanence is, you get some trivial company management variables, hire some manager and boost X% of your blablabla.You may be hooked if you are really into micromanagement, because more than 60% of the time you will be doing it. And it is simple, straight forward, though the lack of hotkey may frustrate you after some time.Pros:1. This is a tycoon game, you manage, if you like, this is a pro for you.2. The difficulty really gives you a challenge, increasing difficulty really eats into your profit, but not that you cannot survive, but you really have to optimize.3. Different types of contract when planned carefully, really gives you great reward and sense of achievement when completed.Cons:1. Sound a bit wonky, you must start with configuring the game, or you get no sound in game (I am using windows 7 x64)2. This is the killer, the game save crashes, apparently sometimes for no reason, I have waited long enough after the game is saved before I quit the game normally, but the save still fails to load next time I open the game. Had been losing 4 hours of game play time out of my 16, my most productive and achieving 4 hours, kinda makes you stop playing.3. There really is a bottle neck in gameplay, mechanics of vehicle entering stations really sucks, you foresee that somehow you cross a thereshold vehicle density and everything start to stuck at station entrance and your operation will fall of the cliff, no matter how successful you were before. OpenTTD did much better job handling this.This game is sort of one of a kind. Its nice for tycoon fans to get a taste, for other type of games, this may not be your cup of tea.			"

												This game is enjoyable if you like sims like this. Relax set up lines of transport, pick up contracts make cash etc.There are some game breakers in this though and the developer really has not tried to fix them even though its been out for years. For example the campaign has a bad map in the middle of the series. You cant go past it, I have not been able to win it due to some horrid map planning and the way your trucks behave at load and deliver points. Basically on map 12 of the campaign you lose due to almost all freight you have to deal with goes to one place and the AI competitor on that map basically clogs this point up so bad that no matter what you do most of your contracts will fail and make you go bankrupt after a while. The map would do fine as a sand box map but since its a campaign map and you need this delivery point you will simply not be able to play the campaign maps past this point which is still about half the maps in the campaign.The second bad thing is that after every play session you need to start the game through your steam library and not from the desktop short cut because it wont have sound. When started through the library you have the option to bring up a settings menu which you will need to bring up every time, then start it through that or you simply will not have sound. This game has been out for years but the only thing ever patched was something to do with it not launching on Vista.In short if you like these sim type games its not a bad game, but it feels like the developer just tossed it on steam years ago and never looked back let alone fix or improve it other than that vista fix (edited twice because i cant type lol).

												Recently I have been trying to broaden my horizons when it comes to the games I play, Tycoon games for example are something I am not entirely enthusiastic about other than the odd one or two here and there so I thought I'd try playing a few more. Freight Tycoon sounded and looked somewhat promising as I enjoy truck-based games too, but unfortunately, I did not enjoy this game.The mechanics of Freight Tycoon are relatively solid and it is a very easy game to learn, it doesn't take a long time before you're all clued up on how to play, so that's a good start. Once you get into the main game however, it ultimately feels pretty shallow, like there is no sense of satisfaction from doing well at the game. Perhaps I haven't given this game enough of a trial to have experienced it properly, but I found myself getting bored relatively quickly after a couple of the default scenarios, I dislike the art style used for the user interface too, it's not very easy on the eyes but hey, it could be a lot worse (see anything published by UIE, ugh!). Tycoon games are typically grindy and require a lot of micromanagement, but Freight Tycoon feels too easy in that department, at least that's how I found it to be.So for now, I'm afraid I can't recommend this game. It has potential but it feels like it's missing something, maybe it is just a game that hasn't aged well and would have felt better around it's original release date. If you're willing to have a gamble for a new Tycoon game this may be one to look at even though it seems to be very hit and miss based on other user reviews. I wouldn't say this is one to be avoided, but I think Freight Tycoon is very much down to personal taste. I am planning to give it another run some time as I don't like games I have purchased to just sit and gather dust, if my thoughts change I will rethink this review, but for now I'm not really interested in trying it again.

												Hello. This game has bugs that needs to be fixed: ¤ The sound doesn't work unless i launch the game configuration.¤ I tried to change a driver owner from one truck to another on mission 5- Marvelous fall. Only one driver who has the name 'Abraham Smith' whom I leveled up to level 5-6 if I remember correctly and he is a van class certified. The minute I sell his car to place him on the new car I purchased, the game crashes to the desktop. Only this character and his truck. Everything else works just fine except for this guy which I don't know why?			"

												I want to like this game. Dammit, I want to PLAY this game. I love the gameplay. The graphics are bad, but I don't care - they present the information clearly. The user interface is bad, as can be expected from a game made 7 years ago, but it mostly gets the job done.I don't know if it is UI or game design issue, but I cannot separate a driver from the vehicle without firing the driver. Irritating, but I can live with that. You can't name save files. The sound dissappears at every game start, and has to be configured via steam options - annoying but not game breaking.But then the game randomly crashes. It throws errors like ""Пътъ не найден!"" (path not found), and all your progress goes to hell. So I can't really play the game, flaws or no.			"

												If you can get this game for a very cheap price, then it's worth a couple of hours of fun. It doesn't seem to have too much depth, you are just picking the appropriate contracts to match the trucks you have available, buying new vehicles when you can, and occasionally hiring staff members to give your company some perks. It doesn't seem to have a huge amount of longevity as once you've played a couple of maps, you realise that they're all pretty similar. I certainly wouldn't pay more than £3/€4/$5 for it.			"

												I know this game has generally favorable reviews. I also understand that the price tag is pretty cheap. But the game actually is quite repetitive. There isn't much to do. Just buy trucks, hire drivers, drag cotracts onto trucks and watch the money roll in. Even at the hardest settings its hard to miss contracts and too easy to break even. If you want to waste an hour or so, sure go ahead and try it out. But don't expect more than 2-3 hours of entertainment from this game.			"

												For a game released in 2007, its a fun game. For a game released in 2007 and it being 2014, its decent. It has its ups and its downs.Pros:-If you like Logistics, this is a game for you!-A wide amount of types of merchdise to transports-Graphics are pretty solid for a DX9 game-See as the villages turns into towns and towns turns into cities.Cons:-a metic EF TON of micromanaging, once a truck is done with a contract, you have to manually assign it to another one. Sounds simple but once you get about 15 to 20 to 30+ trucks, you become overwelmed quickly with unused trucks.-Very little amount of upgrading options-Very poor UI design, its just a mess.-Notifications are just bunched up in a small section near your minimap-Minimap is practically garbage-You can't simply upgrade trucks, if you wish to purchase newer trucks you have to unhook the trailers, sell the truck, buy the new truck, reattach the trailer, and then rehire the driver you apparentally fired because you sold the truck.-Very LIMITED amount of trucks to pick from.-The tutorial is just nothing but a textbox simulator, it's useless and utterly boring. I learned by trial and error.-Once you get to a later point in the game (Lets say about 3-5 hours in one playthrough), there is almost nothing left to do. I got bored once I practically dominated the region and upgraded all of my garages and HQ.-------------------------------Final Verdict: MicroManagement Simulator 2007While the algorism does work, it only works for the beginning of the game. This game gets real boring really quickly after 10 hours. The idea is great, but the excution is poor. The UI is the biggest mess at this point. If the UI was improved TREMENDOUSLY then I would say, give it a shot. But I simply can't. I shouldn't need to switch screens constantly just to buy a new truck from 1980 to replace my old one from 1950, when the game first started.			"

Sometime later I was saddened to learn that it had died of a very rare form of anti-scurvy - it had eaten so much fruit that it turned into a peach, and rolled into the sea near Felixstowe.I remember the game being sort of fun, though, so don't let my experience deter you from getting it.

My only complain is that maps are quite small compared to TTD, but i'd still recommend this one to every TTD fan out there.			"

												Definitely a pleasant surprise.In this game you play as the owner of a freight transportation company. Your duty, naturally, is to transport goods from one enterprise to another. You start with only a little office and one garage, then, contracts after contracts, you'll have the biggest offices in the area and a lot of garages and so on. The world is dynamic: not only roads, higways and cities expand themselves, but even the enterprises you work for.You can play in free mode, starting from 1950 to 2020, or the campaign (21 scenarios).Gameplay it's a little bit repetitive, but it's due to the freight activity itself. You must like managerial games to appreciate this too.The game presents a good graphic for today standards, and it's pretty stable (only one crash in several hours).Worthy.			"

Your trucks could be broken, your employees retire, new companies come, and you have to react all these problems.

For a game that I bought on a summer sale for such a little ammount that I forgot about it until 3 months later. It is really great.

												If you enjoyed Transport Tycoon, or simply like management and logistics type games where the goal is to make money and expand, this is certainly a game to consider. Assess your markets, see who wants what shipped, buy your trucks, hire your drivers, make sure your garages have mechanics (and tow trucks), choose your office managers, and make sure you have what you need to choose the profitable loads on time--and expand to meet the expanding world around you.Graphics are passible (decent, but not great), music is pleasing enough not to get annoying, scenario levels and goals are challenging enough to keep you engaged, as can be the aim of making the next million. A few bugs with save games.Though there is no free-play, you can continue on after you pass a scenario indefinately.7/10 on game play6/10 on fit and finish (graphics, bugs, etc)			"

												Game came out in 2007, played it before I found it on steam.  I enjoyed it, playing it for a month or 2, then letting it sit, before reinstalling.Mentioned issues: the hiring, and contract changes.  its meant to be updating,  it does get a bit frustrating, until you figure out how to use the pause button...  use it everytime and it works out great.You can lose.  Tho it seems thats rather hard to do. The one moving thru the Factory yard sucks, but have you seen Truck drivers?  best to stay out of their way.   upgrade the factory, and you can have more than one truck loading (or unloading) at the same time.  it helps.if you see alot of activity at a certain factory, do not accept jobs to or from that location.  You will be better off with slighly less money from another location, that isnt as busy.You can take the jobs that are losers, and add more trucks to make the time.   Just make sure ahead of time, that you can.$2.50 or less is a great price for this title. "

												This game has been alot of fun. Watching the city grow as you build your fleet keeps things very entertaining. I think the strength of this game is its very user friendly interface, it is very informative and is eay to navigate and understand.			"
