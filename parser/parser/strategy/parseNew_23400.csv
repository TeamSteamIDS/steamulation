												Imperium Romanum is a city-builder set in the ancient Roman Empire. If you're thinking, ""Hey that sounds just like the old Caesar series"" then you're not far off. Much like the old Sierra series, Imperium Romanum places you in a series of towns and settlements and asks you to build housing, establish farming and resource production, and set up industries. You'll also build defenses and armies to protect yourself from barbarian hordes and conquer nearby villages.I think Imperium Romanum takes a slightly more casual and less complex approach to the genre. First, at least in the missions I played, each level seemed to be completely contained and it didn't seem as though your city carried over throughout multiple stages of the campaign. Rather, each mission starts in a different settlement and gives you goals to accomplish there and then you move on to the next. There is a sandbox gameplay option so if you want to build a super-city, you can do that, but the campaign missions don't seem to be cumulative.Combat is rather simplistic and basically your troops are limited to a couple of formations, neither of which can actually be changed on the fly once battle has begun.One thing I did notice here is that unlike a lot of the ""historical"" city management titles, the game doesn't skirt around the issue that slavery was a common practice. Slaves will do all the building and hauling here, and they get separate ""housing"" and will not be able to fill the ""free"" jobs that your settlers will take. If you overwork your slaves (i.e. don't build enough slave shelters) then they are likely to revolt until you get their workload under control. The graphics are pretty detailed and there is a nice variety of industries and buildings you can introduce in your town.Overall, it's a nice little city builder for the history buffs, and it offers a more forgiving approach to planning than some of the other similar games I've played. (read this as: I never had to break out a spreadsheet to lay out perfect housing and industrial blocks in Imperium Romanum in order to beat a level. Then again, I might have been an overly compulsive Caesar player. ymmv) "

												Tedious game. Mediocre at best. Old games like Zeus and Pharoah still surpass this game by miles. I'd say skip this one and get Caesar instead.You can't build too far from your Forum and will require Marketplaces to expand to other portions of the map. The problem is that each building will require a house nearby to employ it. You won't be able to design a city that has different zones (residential, industrial, agriculture and so on) everything becomes mashed up. This in turn creates a snowball effect. For example: You want to build a mining camp for a marble deposit that is on the outskirts of your city. So you create a marketplace, the mine, then houses. Here's the fun part: The houses will require supporting structures e.g. bakery, altar, butcher. Now each building will require a certain material upkeep which leeches into your economy as well.  So your little expansion becomes a city of it's own. I tried ignoring their need for clothes and sausages but then that little town became rebellious. So for one little mine on the outskirts, I had to create a new town and the supporting structures to it. The people in the houses seem to randomly choose their jobs. So you might have some unemployment in one sector and a lack of employees in the other. This game just becomes very grating after a while.Why do they want so many sausages anyways? Every game it's always about sausages.Look, I enjoyed the game but I dreaded having to start a new sandbox or campaigns. This is coming from someone who enjoys punishing City games like Banished.

												It's hard to look at a Roman city-building game and not think of the venerable Caesar series, but I encourage you to put it out of your mind. There are no wandering agents and maze-like roadways to be found here, but there is some solid construction and management. Having more in common with titles like Children of the Nile or Tropico, Imperium Romanum takes a simple system and spreads it across a bewildering array of scenarios and challenges.Each scenario sets you as the praetor of a city somewhere in the empire, anywhere from Alexandria to Pompeii to Rome itself. Most of the time you'll be starting from just a forum and stockpile, but some scenarios give you a whole city right from the get-go. From there you have to build houses, mines, farms, woodcutters, and other basics to get the town running. Once your settlement is established you can start looking into trade routes, fortifications, temples, schools, and other advanced constructions. There's a fair number of buildings to build, and you'll be building most of them in each scenario.What keeps things fresh as you bounce from province to province are the scenario conditions. Many will limit you in some way, like not having any wood or stone on the map. Instead you'll get supplied by Rome while you get established, and then have to fulfill some goal or start trading to make up the difference. These goals and events are conveyed through the tablet system, which you can trigger whenever you want. You can accept up to three tablets at once, and they can give new objectives, bonuses, or serious curveballs. It's an interesting system to direct the scenarios but some of the tablets can be unexpectedly brutal. One map tasks you with establishing a port, and one of the tablets about halfway through is a tidal wave that wipes out anything you've built up to that point.I know that sounds absolutely terrible, but Imperium Romanum is so relaxed and simple that it's hard to get mad at it. Buildings are usually constructed swiftly and your resource production is very generous in its quantities. There is warfare as well, but it's as simple as building barracks and sending your regiments out to conquer barbarians. About the only real frustration I've found is that our citizens have needs that must be fulfilled to keep them happy and out of trouble, and after six hours and as many scenarios I still can't keep them from turning irate and rebellious. Even if you build them everything you can think of, some of them always seem to get mad about something.Part of the problem is a lack of information available. You have almost no charts or graphs for your citizens or your resources, and clicking on buildings only gives general information about their contents. This means there's a rough learning curve while you figure out how many wheat farms and bakeries it takes to supply your citizens with bread, but like I mentioned, the game is too relaxed to ever really punish you for it. There's no fail state that I can see, and citizens never move out, instead opting to complain endlessly and maybe riot.The presentation does a lot to endear Imperium Romanum in spite of its shortcomings as well. The clean, detailed graphics make for picturesque settlements and countryside in every scenario. You can follow your citizens around and watch them gesticulate wildly as they chat or pray. Construction is a bit unpolished, going from a pile of materials to a whole building in the blink of an eye, but the buildings themselves are magnificent. The sound design is fine with its understated bustle and alerts, and it includes some oddly jazzy tunes as well.While not one of the best city builders I've played, Imperium Romanum still manages to be one of the most enjoyable. The charming look and feel of the game, coupled with the simple building and tablet guidance, make this a great title to relax with. You're bound to run into some small faults and frustrations, but odds are it will win you back across its wealth of scenarios. It might be a bit barebones, but there's a good heart in there that makes it worth a look.			"

												Really quite fun. Probably the best city-building game I've played. I like it better than CivCity: Rome. This is a lot like Sim City Societies, but with some actual goals. Societies suffered from the problem of ""well, now my city has enough X to make more Y. And now I have enough Y to build Z. Great. So?"" There was no reason to do anything.Imperium Romanum is a city builder with very definite goals. ""Grow your town to X population. But in this scenario you can only farm wheat."" So to keep you upper crust happy, you'll need to export a lot of grain and import things like meat and cloth. There's also a military aspect, but it's somewhat downplayed. This isn't an RTS; it's a city builder. You definitely need a militia, but you don't need to be a tactical genius to make them effective.You need to keep your economy going by producing... something, keep production running by growing your population, keep your population happy by importing luxuries.

												This game is quite fun, and very 'comfy'. Building a city and expanding into nearby areas is relaxing and atmospheric. With that being said, there isn't much depth in the city building and management (when compared to similar games like Banished), and the combat is EXTREMELY simple (when compared to similar games like Total War: Rome). Bottom line: if you want a full-featured and fun city management game look elsewhere, if you want a full-featured and fun combat strategy game look elsewhere. If you want to do a little of both with some fun interplay and a nice atmosphere this is worth picking up on sale.			"

												One of my favorite Building/strategy games. You could look at it as an better version of 'Glory of the roman empire'. I like the roman setting, the overal gameplay and economic mechanics work great. Altought it has a basic combat system and sometimes you have to capture a barbarian village, it is still more foccused on the building part. If you want some more action and fighting this might not be the game for you, it's more of a builder, not a destroyer ;)			"

												Though the graphics aren't top notch, but well done for its age. The gameplay is great. The detail is fantastic. When you give the people jobs you can actually see them doing their jobs (Example.. Butcher cuts meat, wine maker stomps grapes, and this is with every job. You will see them visit the tavern, and the barmaids wipe the tables. You will see them pray).Trees grow back even those you plant which is free. The roads are free. It can be crazy if you follow the campaign and it takes some stragery ... It is an old game, with that old game gameplay. I wish there was some modern games as good as this game.  I can not recommend it enough. Cheap fantastic gameplay... 100/100 ...			"

												It shouldn't be much of a surprise that the developer of the last three Tropico games was involved here. This is a solid city builder in the spirit of classics like the Caesar series. Playing through all of the various scenarios could take you hundreds of hours, yet so far they don't feel like simple crapware bloat. While there is a system for military forces, it's not strongly emphasized and feels more like a police force against foreign invaders. But then again, you're playing a city builder. If you want to go on conquests, go get Rome Total War.			"

												This game is quite similar to another title from the same developer called Glory of the Roman Empire. Still this has its own perks, but its not a simple city builder. You have to work out your economy as best as possible as you make a metropolis out of a collection of smaller cities. When your flow of goods is fluid enough then you just have to worry about keeping people content as you glorify the city with wonders like grand temples and the colloseum.Its a fine game, but not the best as other games are.

												While not living up to the standard set by the Caesar series, it is a very relaxed city-building/management game. Even as old as it is now, the graphics are quite lovely as the building designs and environment are well crafted. The in-game mechanics are simple enough, and the large number of sandbox scenarios, standard campaign and the Rome campaign will give you hours of enjoyment.I received a copy of the game free as part of Kalypso's 10th anniversary event. Not sure I would have paid for it otherwise, but having received it I'm quite happy to have it. It's in that foggy middle-ground for an older game.Overall, I'd give it a 68/100 rating, as there are some annoyances (the people's behavior might be a little too realistic: getting irate and/or turning criminal even if you give them the moon), building effect radii being a little small so you have to really plan out your neighborhoods so you have room to rinse and repeat as you grow your population. Otherwise it's still a fun casual city builder.			"

												I have played this game for about four hours now and my opinon is that it is very mediocre. It has some good aesthetics, it seems that whoever made this actually wanted to make a good game about Roman cities, but there is simply no climax to building a city. Nor is there really any challenge beyond basic city building, except for the tacked on difficulty accomplished by extremely whiny citizens who don't always quite realize that they do in fact have access to the resources which they are complaining about.YOU LIVE RIGHT NEXT TO THE TEMPLE! Be quiet! Oh, heck with it, I didn't really even care in the first place.I orginally bought this game thinking it was that really old game about Roman city building I used to play (EDIT: Caesar III apparently), with legions and whatnot, and since I would love to go back and play it as a decent gamer I was happy to snatch this up. Well, not only is it not the game, but the lack of depth is such that after three hours of playing I felt I had seen all there was to see so after another hour and with no amount of pride I bid my perfect city adieu.Now, I assume somewhere this is a scenario where you are under constant attack to up the ante but frankly I don't see this as potentially engaging, mostly due to overly simple combat system; combined with an overly simple set of building mechanics I honestly don't care enough to probe any further.

												This is not a bad game, but it certainly is underwhelming for people, who played Caesar or similar games with quite annoying game mechanics. Little to no depth.The most annoying thing for me was the evolvement of houses. In Caesar you had full control over where evolvement takes place, since you were the one chosing which goods and services are provided to the neighbourhood. For example, I had whole quarters dedicated to making wine, pottery, oil and so on. Those quarters were provided with everything they needed to evolve to some moderate levels and they were happy with it. It would be ridiculous to provide them with all the luxury goods and services needed to evolve to high class patricians with mansions.And that is where this game is different: You have basically zero control over evolvement of the houses. They just WILL evolve. That would not be a problem, if they were not demanding new stuff and if you don't provide them with that riots will start and they will burn the city down. That is a major flaw for me, since it forces you to basically build a new subcity around EVERY area you want to expand to and there is no way around it.There is no way to stop this, let alone build dedicated quarters for certain industries. If you expand it is just building the whole city again next to the city with some minor exceptions and it gets old very, very soon. If you have no experience with these games this might be for you. I rather play Caesar again.			"

												English : This is a great game. The ""Grand ages of Rome"" is the sequel of it and has somewhat better graphics, comes with a plague of fires all the time. In Imperium Romanum that doesnât happen. You have a lot of time to put up the fires and enjoy your city view & achievements. In this game you can relax but not so in Grand Ages of Rome. Tips: Plant trees near the wood cutter's cabins, this way youâll have a continuous flowing supply of wood. Extend your aqueducts to the maximum they can reach and build wells where fires occur more often. If you have enough money anything can be built in a flash. Donât harass the barbarian tribes until you are really ready to face them. Build wooden walls around your town center to avoid attacks. I give 10/10 for this game and I am very pleased to have bought it!PortuguÃªs: Este Ã© um grande jogo. ""Grand Ages of Rome"" Ã© a continuaÃ§Ã£o deste jogo e tem grÃ¡ficos um pouco melhores, mas tem uma praga de incÃªndios o tempo todo. Em ""Imperium Romanum"" isso nÃ£o acontece.

YouTubeâ¢ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Imperium Romanum - A City builder for the Latin in youÂ 

			Views: 224		

			It's good to be the [strike]king[/strike] [strike]Emperor[/strike] Governor. Join Atratzu as he feeds sausages to his peasants.. That came out wrong. Stay Tuned for another Atratzu Review!		

If you want a written version of the review, I am providing a ""normal"" written review which will contain more of a standard review review, they will not be exact copies, I'll move more of my humor into my video review, so please do check it out if you have the time! If not, read on!-Quick Review-Imperium Romanum: Gold Edition is a Romen City Builder Simulation game developed by Haemimont Games and released Oct 30, 2008. Haemimont Games published another similar game people are probably more familiar with: ""Tropico 4"".-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The setting for the whole game is that you're the governor of a Roman city/Provence. It's up to you to provide/grow food, distribute that food, manage housing and logistics of laborer's (That's my fancy way of saying ""slaves""... It's ancient Rome, calm down), and generally provide for your people's needs. Have you ever played the sim's? Imagine having a bunch of them, but they all collectively want close to the same thing at the same time... That being sausages or bread.Gameplay: The controls of the game are almost identical to Tropico 4, so when I started playing the game I was able to get the hang of the wonky camera controls relatively quickly. middle mouse wheel to scroll in and out, arrow keys to speed your camera around. I'll warn you right now, generally learning the basic game camera movement functions is a learning curve, which will be a thorn in many people's sides.You also can adjust the direction your buildings are being placed with the scroll wheel, I believe you can adjust the game camera rotation by holding down your middle mouse button. (always a favorite control for 3d graphic designers) There are alternative controls so you can use your keyboard and mouse differently then me, but I'm just letting you know what worked for me.Tropico has three types of game modes plus a set of tutorials, the types of game modes are: Tutorials, Campaigns, Scenarios, and the Rome Scenario. I would say ""Each game mode is different"", but the whole thing feels about the game regardless of game mode, the differences are settings, goals, and challenges. In one you might need to trade goods to get your objective, in another you might need to kick the barbarians out of your neck of the woods.Regardless, I highly suggest starting with the tutorial so you can learn the basics of city management and how to build stuff. The tutorial is very detailed and should help most people get into the game.But the fun doesn't stop there, once I was finished with the tutorial I jumped in to play the campaign, there are several different campaigns. You can play;  History of the roman Empire, Conquest of Britannia, Wilds of Germania, Colonation of Africa, Caesar's Civil War. Each campaign has about 4 levels, except for the history of the roman empire which has about 18 levels.There isn't much else to say about the game, Imperium Romanum: Gold Edition will satisfy a very specific type of gamer, and will provide a lot of levels for that type of gamer. If you like this type of game, I highly suggest checking out the Tropico Franchise when you're finished.


At least SOMEONE appreciates me.  I'm looking at you Tropico 4.... Freaking Presidente was never good enough for you.Â 
A Screenshot of Imperium Romanum: Gold Edition
By: Atratzu




Conclusion: I feel like I haven't said much about a very VERY big game, but unless you want me to reinvent the wheel and give you the tutorial all over again, that's about all there is to be said about Imperium Romanum: Gold Edition. The camera controls take some time getting used too, your people are always demanding something from you, so from the spacing between buildings, building roads, food, to production... it's all city management simulator based in ancient Rome.There's actually a downloadable demo on the steam store front, so you can check it out for yourself before you purchase the game! *mumbles* I haven't played the demo for myself so it might be crap, or have like half a level, but you can at least formulate your own opinion on the game prior to purchase.------Edits and updates------Hey there, Thanks for reading my review!

												Perhaps better than its sequel due to ease of play, Imperium is as much a fun simulation of building and economy as it is a strategy war game.  It plays a lot like Tropico with a Roman flair.  The circular building system is practical.  The grand scale of the civ planning is quite enjoyable.			"

												A comfy, but shallow city builder game. Pleasing to look at and very atmospheric.  The interface is not the best but certainly serviceable. The warehouse mechanics allows for a more organic growth of your cities. The game features a military and barbarian aspect which adds some variety. Not very heavy on the micro side but good for those seeking a relaxing city builder experience.			"

												Although it is not that well-known of a game, it certainly is well-made. The voice narrator does not always follow the text, but there are otherwise no glitches or flaws I have found thus far. There are no Steam achievements for this game, though there are in-game achievements that you can earn. To describe it simply, Imperium Romanum: Gold Edition is essentially a simulator where you, the Praetor, build a city in various scenarios and periods of Roman history. Unfortunately, there are no freestyle, sandbox options that allows the player to build a city from scratch and maintain it as their own entirely customizable civilization, like you would find in other simulators of this type. In other words, this game essentially focuses strictly on scenarios and times during the history of the Roman Empire. If any of what I just typed interested you, I recommend you consider buying this game.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Imperium Romanum is a game developed by Haemimont Games, the same people behind the Tropico revival series, and published by Kalypso Media DigitalIt is a mixture of city building and defense, like a mixture of Tropico and the Total War series. You build all the places in Italy and abroad according to the Roman empires reign and defend against Barbarians and other threats such as fires and plagueThe game is entertaining and fun to play and I really appreciate it that the game gives you historical events that happened during the actual Roman reign. You can tell if you have played the Tropico revival series that this game inspired the developers to make the Tropico seriesOnly one complaint I have is the clipping of buildings, roads, aqeducts and walls. They all clip to a certain area and if you move them slightly they clip to another area which is mildly annoying when you want to build a nice Roman cityHowever, Imperium Romanum is a very interesting strategy game to play in short bursts and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves Roman history or strategy city building games RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Even for free, it's not really worth it. It is pretty tedious to play. Instead of ONE city, you really have to make multple cities beside each other. The reason is simple, limited range of all buildings.  Want to build a mine a bit of a distance away? have to build a warehouse first, have to build houses too, then have to make temple, have to make taylor, food, etc etc, it snowballs everytime. Make too many houses in one area, automatically have unemployed that can never get jobs. The tropico series is a much better city building game.			"

												It seemed like a nice little city-building game at first, especially since it was made by Kalypso, who brought us the excellent Tropico series, which I enjoyed. Boy, was I wrong. the game itself is fine but it has one fatal flaw that entirely ruined it for me: Snowball effect. Let me explain.Just about every building relies on other buildings, mostly houses. That means for every building you build to accomodate some citizen's complaint, you need to build a house or two nearby and sometimes, the building you need relies on another production building. And the problem stems from the evolution of houses, they upgrade automatically and so does the inhabitants' needs, which leads to YOUR need of constructing specific buildings that leech on your already bad economy. The best example are sausages. People will complain that there are no sausages so, naturally, you build a pig farm to produce meat that the butcher shop you're gonna build will make into sausages. And you basically need one house for each of these buildings, growing your upkeep needs, it's all a huge buildup of needs that only pile up until you're overwhelmed.And you have to take into account the disasters that might hit your little community: riots, fires, plagues, barbarian attacks and so on. It takes barely 5 minutes of gameplay before that little thumb up on the left side of the screen becomes a thumb down and your citizen start rioting. It's unbelievable how impossible this game is. I saw reviews saying that this game is more casual and more forgiving than say Banished ... well for all the trouble I had with banished, I had my town last a whole lot longer than in Imperium Romanum, in which I can barely make enough production building to sustain my town, let alone build a growing economy.Well, just like this game gives me a thumb down early because of sausage shortage, I'm giving it a thumb down too, there are much more memorable and playable city builders out there, Cities: Skylines, Tropico and Banished being three fine examples of good city builders that don't rely on overwhelming you with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t to make it challenging.

It's better in that it's a bit more realistic as to what we ""know"" of ancient roman society.  Allthough not politically correct, the inclusion of slaves really does help as slavery was BIG trade in ancient Rome and Rome wouldn't have been what it was without them.  And yes water water everywhere!!  Rome's big thing was the aquaduct/public water system, people cannot live without it so, build LOTS of wells.  Each business needs houses and water nearby, and those houses need their provisions nearby, so you will have several outposts in one city.  Haven't done any battling other than the tutorial, but will update my review once I do more of that.  In short: RECOMMENDED			"

												Kalypso Media gave this game away to newsletter subscribers; that said, it's alright. Imperium Romanum is one of the company's earlier games and it serves as an example to learn and improve upon. The graphics are relatively smooth, and the interface is simple to learn. Everything is very proto-Tropico, which is not an insult for a game almost a decade old. My biggest complaint is the difficulty curve. At the earliest part of the scenario, you will face wave after wave of problems that stem from citizens wanting everything. I like that feeling, it's what makes a city builder so satisfactory. Imperium Romanum's difficulty is loaded in the first hour or so of playtime. A moderately efficient economy with segmented industry zones tends to solve almost every problem in the game. After that, the game becomes a ""watch and see"" style simulator with some novel monument building and internal accomplishments. The best analogy I can think of for this game is a really comfortable set of pajamas. It may be older and kind of worn, but there's always a bit of satisfaction when you know you've got nothing better to do than waste time and lay around all day. For the more intense city builder/manager, look into Sierra's oft-heralded ""Caesar"" or ""Pharoah"" lines. For the casual player, pick it up on a steam sale and get 10-15 hours from a good-enough title.			"

												Ever played any game of Tropico series? It's like one of them but with exclusive features, an amazing city builder mixed with micro and macro management, but in roman ages.			"

												All in all, the game is nice; you can find it often enough at such a ridiculous price that it is worth giving it a try. It is also quite long - tons of missions. The graphics is still nice and pleasantly colourful. Just keep in mind that it can turn quite challenging quite fast.			"
