												Gnomoria is a detailed base-building game in which one pits a tribe of gnomes against evils from the depths of their mines and evils from other, invisible, villages.  Gnomes are able to mine a variety of resources, process them, and manufacture everything from furniture to armor.  They have to sleep, eat, and drink, and they can even become powerful zombies after death, returning later to slaughter any former friends that are caught unaware.It's a fun game with plenty of opportunity for strategy and mayhem.But, here's the thing: this game has been in Early Access forever, updates are slow, bug fixes are slow, and the game is using outdated technology (XNA, which was discontinued by Microsoft in early 2013) that doesn't even support some relatively common desktop features like 1440p resolution.A year ago, I would have said Gnomoria is a hugely promising game and worth buying for double the price, but that's about when the developer slowed down.  A lot.  The game I was playing a year ago is very nearly the same game I could play today, were I to click the Play button again.My advice: hit that ""Follow"" button on the store page, and if Gnomoria ever releases, give it another look.  I certainly will.			"

												I wanted to love this game. I DID love this game. I have series of it on YouTube, I had a lot of viewers on Twitch. This was an amazing game.The game wanted to be Dwarf Fortress with a graphical interface. A great goal, and it very nearly succeeded.Then it became abandonware. The developer released it, saying the game was completed. It was not. At all. It is buggy as hell, and there is absolutely no way to fix it. Combat is horrible, the Gnomes are brain damaged, and endgame is nonexistant. The modding community adds a little bit of flavor to the game, but it is still buggy abandonware. If you're going to abandon your much loved game, at the very least give the community that loves it the ability to fix it for you, okay?Graphics: 4/10. Cute, but 8-bit and jumpy.Music: 8/10. Probably the best part of this game, and highly addictive to listen to.Gameplay: 4/10. Would have been great if it were not for the constant game-breaking bugs.Replayability: 5/10. If you enjoy re-building the same castle over and over again because of game-breaking bugs anyway.Community: 10/10 (single-player only). Highly supportive and helpful community, since the Developer sure doesn't help at all, or even answer anyone.Developer: 0/10. If you're going to 'officially release' a broken game, at the very least give the community that loves it the chance to fix your broken product.			"

								This game is a legendarily crafted sapphire in the rough melded to a platinum ring.  This is the Dwarf Fortress with graphics you have been waiting for.  While it is not as complex, not as unforgiving, it is far easier to get into and get immersed in thanks to a UI that works well.  This game is so fun that I've ditched most of my other games to play it instead, and after several abyssmal failures I finally have a stable kingdom.  The game is still in development, but the developer seems determined to see this through and make it the best game possible.  He typically updates every two weeks, adding things, fixing bugs, balancing values.  He listens and posts on the game's forums, and has implemented a bunch of changes suggested by the community.  The man has earned my faith in him.I cannot overstate how happy I am with this game.  I bought it on sale, but felt so guilty that I got it for cheap that I made my girlfriend buy it as well.  I told her that if she didn't like it, I'd pay her back, and consider it a donation for the development of the game.  Please do yourself a favor and try this if you enjoy management sims, building games, minecraft, or ant farms.  At the price it's sold at, it's a steal if you love it, and small loss if you don't.

I FINALLY UNDERSTAND THIS GAME!Took me 3 tries to understand the whole thing, it should take just one for people that doesnt distracts so easily.it will take you 3 times too, dont lie to yourselfcheck steam guides with more images than textIts awesome, you get a group of mentally challenged gnomes and you have to guide them to victory and keep them away from dangers (those dangers include themselves in most of the cases).You can mine, build, fight, farm, yell at your idle gnomes(this will become your usual activity), laugh at occasional catastrophes involving your own stupid gnomes getting trapped in walls or floor and trade one alpaca for 500 strawberry seeds with near kingdoms!Theres some weird mechanics thing that havent tried yet but looks awesome some kind of electric stuff with power and traps. And you can customize almost everything. Dont like that the woodchoppers go around picking dirt from the floor and stocking it elsewhere? Well then just uncheck hauling from their job list. Need someone to go around picking the stuff all your stupid gnomes left on the floor? Create a Janitor job!I stopped playing Dota 2 for 2 whole days for this, my friends hate me and this game nowRecommended 10/10			"

YouTube™ Video: Gnomoria, A Simple Review 

			Views: 4		

			Join the group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/capbeardlings My social media plugins: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/billy.sant Email: billy.sant@outlook.com Twitter:...		

The first hundred hours of gameplay was spent mostly trying to determine if I really loved this game or not.The second hundred hours was spent mostly trying to figure out the most extream form of combat goblins were capable of (my personal favorite was watching them pick up fallen limbs/heads and using them as weapons... although that goblin who brained three of my gnomes after picking up a door was also quite amusing... and somewhat sad).At 600+ hours I still find those 'whoa' moments.  That alone should say something.This game, like many others have said, is a dwarf fortress clone.  But unlike that game you don't need to feel like you are looking at the matrix to be able to play it.  The developer has taken the time to create simple yet fairly good graphics (considering the fact he's basically doing this by himself) that quickly gives you an idea of the state of the world as it exsists.  No two games are really alike due to random happenstance, layout of the world, invasions by annoying goblins and mants, etc.  Difficulty can be changed at the start, so toying with the options will quickly create either amazingly simple worlds you can craft to your hearts content... to war torn worlds where your gnomes will likely be missing body parts in a matter of days.There are some physics in this game, mostly dealing with water.  There are alot of worries in this game, mostly dealing with food and safety.Standard pros and cons:Pros:You get to build a gnome city/village/fortress/slave labor campSaid gnomes are independant but will take ques from youCombat is entertaining to read, especially when limbs start flyingSwords and guns.  Steampunk at it's bestYou can build epic wonderlike structuresYour gnomes can starve if you are overzealous with expansionYou have to actually care about placement of structuresYou can make pet rocksDiplomacy was added recently to add some options to irritate your neighborsIs somewhat modable, mostly just graphically at the time beingConsNot as advanced as dwarf fortressNo sickness/diseases to combatNo magic systemNo cannibalismNo annoying elves to get to chop upNo vehiclesNo animations (once again, one man show here so give him a break)No moral system as of yetBasically if you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress but can't stand looking at ascii all day, gnomoria is definitely the way to go.  It's easy on the eyes, easy to figure out (if nothing else go on the web page and look up a basic tutorial, lots of them exsist and all you really need to know is the standard build order to get you going, the rest is there just for you to learn on your own and die alot.  Alot.)This is the kind of game I wish exsisted back in the 80s-90s when I was in school.  Me and my friends used to imagine building forts/castles with various creatures and defending them from hordes of annoying goblins and the like.  In this case, it's not on paper, it's a living breathing world where you hope that your gnomes armor isn't going to break when that ogre swings at him, seeing as he's your best builder.It's worth your time.

Early Access Review
								Of all of the Dwarf Fortress inspired games, Gnomoria is without question the farthest along. It manages to bring much of what I loved from DF to a sensible, usable, but still powerful user interface, along with having a unique flavor of its own. in particular, this game has the best crafting system of any builder that I've ever seen, combining flexibility and ease-of-use.The developer is extremely professional; every bug I have reported has been fixed within a week or two, and he frequently implements awesome suggestions from the forums when they agree with his vision of the game.If you are not coming from a DF/city builder roguelike background, expect a steep learning curve. Well worth it in my opinion, that is not to say that the game is extremely challenging, in default difficulty the world is forgiving enough that you can probably get by.The early and mid-game are extremely interesting and fun, but unfortunately late game variety is limited to training yet more powerful soldiers to curb stomp goblins, mining ore to train your blacksmiths and then smelting it down for better quality weapons, and building giant temples or awesome structures. While this is enjoyable, I do feel like a late game should be fleshed out. Given the developer's track record however, I have every confidence this will occur. I don't know how he will do it, but I do know it will be awesome.Easily worth $20 in current form, $7.99 is a steal.			"

								As a DF veteran and long-term fan I really liked this game. Especially UI that is a lot better and easier to navigate than DF one. Graphics is also nicer (if only DF had this it could be a lot more enjoyable for casuals and newbies ).Gnomoria lacks content  and you get bored pretty fast, it gets update's very often but still DF is years ahead of Gnomoria's content.  So that means at this rate Gnomoria will never catch up to Dwarf Fortress.Also this 	 game is very easy , sieges are boring and monsters level up as you progress and get more wealth.  I don't feel any threat, its only hard in the beginning later when you get your gnomes a decent gear and experience nothing will stop you.Meanwhile in DF ; you get werebeats, undeads, necromancers, vampires, megabeasts and you get also a threat from the inside like tantrums or a lot more surprises.Also you can't tame or capture monsters in this game. Really Gnomoria? Why I can't capture the mantis, train him and use him against neverending goblin waves? Or capture goblins and use them as a live targets for my beginning marksgnomes?Don't forget its an early access game  but it stable and enjoyable so far. It just needs something more to keep you playing Maybe mods and workshop feature will fix it in the future.Definitely	 worth a try	 . But remember its a Dwarf Fortress without a balls.			"

								It's our second winter. Mel was torn apart by a goblin horde before we could arrive to help, Garth lost an eye and poor Karragan is now a cripple. Mants are raiding our farms and our last Yak had to be butchered for food to make it through the winter. To make matters worse the new gnomad I set to smiths hall has been making ingots for 4 days and has produced only 1. Perhaps I should return Mel to the smith's post... o wait, his face was chewed off and his corpse is starting to bloat...On a good note we have nearly 80 kegs of beer and the Ambassador loved the statue I placed in his guest room, so I guess things are looking up. Nope, spoke to soon, a skeleton just slaughtered all three of my miners. 10/10 really fun game.			"

								Been playing this before it even got on steam, if you like a village building survival(sort-of) sandbox game then this is for you. Now it is a early access and has been updating every now and then thus there will be bugs or kinks in the game, but from all the times I have played I haven't ran into any yet. The game has a fully destructible environment where you can break down anything and build it somewhere else if you wanted and there a ton of crafting items as well as all kinds of building material. But depending on your difficulty level you will run into dangers, from honey badgers to goblins. If you are still interested then get it and start telling your Gnomes how you want your kingdom built.			"

								A really simple yet fantastic micro-management game. Despite being in Early Access the game still has an abundance of features, fantastic gameplay and i've encountered no bugs (which may or may not be just my luck).The game focuses on micromanagement in its purest form, just like older games such as Dwarf Fortress and Theme Hospital and manages to keep you entertained continuously rather than it becoming tiresome quickly like some sim/micro management games can.The game is regularly updated (once a month) and brings new things to the game to keep it fresh.At this price it's worth every single penny, and even if you don't want to pay full price, make sure you grab it on sale. You won't regret it.I look forward to seeing the final product.			"

								UPDATE 11 - 13-2015As a resource-management / society building game, Gnomoria covers all the basics.  Basic tools, basic foods, basic livestock, basic weapons, basic combat.  It does basic very well.  What innovations it has that sets it apart and above some of the other games of its genre is how it presents itself.As a small collective of 6 Gnomes settling the hilly (or flat) wilds of Gnomoria, you are allowed to destroy and build as you please.  The ground can be dug up and used to build homes or sifted to find rare metals to make weapons or gems to make jewelry.  Cotten can be grown in farm plots to make bandages, bags or armour or the fields can be used to grow food.  How your Gnomes live and work is up to you.Initially, you are left to yourself, but eventually you will have to deal with Goblins, skeletons and other beasts bent on your destruction.  Build up your defensives and research new tools, like guns and steam-engines, to protect your Gnomes.Though well-balanced and well-coded, there are some things missing.  For example:1.) If your livestock gets hurt, you cannot heal them and if all your livestock die, you must establish a trade route with a neighboring kingdom to buy new livestock2.)  Livestock is also the only reliable way to get meat and leather, as there is no hunting of wildlife in the game.3.)  The only way your population can grow is through Gnomads, who will only come to your city if material worth of your city is high enough to merit a migration.4.)  Determining what job your new Gnome is best suited to perform requires you to scroll through their entire talent list.5.)  Distant kingdoms only exist as text on a menu screen and visiting diplomats don't do anything but wander around (and in my case, get killed by bears)6.)  Trying to do anything more complicated than ""All units kill this thing"" makes the game look at you funny.But, these are minor considering the price and the over-all feel of the game.  For $8, it is a decent but basic game.  The creator hopes to have the game released as ""complete"" by the end of the year and raise the price to $14.99 and in that case I would ask for, at the barest minimum, the option to bred your Gnomes to increase the population and a way to heal my livestock after a goblin raider has tried to carve its buttocks off.--------------------------------------------------Originl PostFAIR WARNING!!!!As of October 6th, 2015, the creator has removed the game's development plan from the website.  He is only focusing on optimizing the game as it is right now, fixing bugs, and on improving mod-support.  He is NOT going to add any new features or content.  New content MAY be added after the game is released, which he is hoping to do by the end of the year, at which time the price will go up to $14.99, but he has said the best place to find new content is from the community.The game is fun, I will not deny it, it is both challenging and creative, but it is not complete.  It is missing content and the creator seems content letting the community finish his game for him.  Now, maybe he has a job and this is just his hobby or he realized his original plan was just too ambitious for him to do alone; maybe he has a good reason to turn the reigns over to the community.  But as someone who cannot create mods and whose computer automatically deletes them because of some security setting I don't know how to disable, being told I finish the game myself using mods is like being told to write the ending of the book I am reading.Again, this is all the game you are going to get.  So, if you have been wanting it, get it for the reduced price.  As it is, this game is NOT worth $14.99			"

												Once upon a time, there was a game called Dwarf Fortress. It was a magical game that spawned infinite stories for those willing to read its tea leaves of finely-detailed content, from the most epic slaughter by rampaging elephants down to the tiniest thoughts and details of its dwarven citizenry.And the masses looked upon Dwarf Fortress and said, wow, these stories are fantastic but are you really going to make me learn hotkey controls to use this mess of a UI? And you can't see a hill except as a series of layers of dirt?And so many, emboldened by the newly-released Steam Greenlight and Steam Early Access, took it upon themselves to remake Dwarf Fortress in their image. Some of these early attempts died on the vine, like Towns and Spacebase DF-9. Gnomoria is the most long-lived of these early re-imaginings, releasing to 1.0 status after three years of early access. Instead of dwarves, it's gnomes, and instead of ASCII and tiles, it's 3D isometric graphics, and instead of a hotkey-driven UI, it's a graphical mouse-driven UI.And Gnomoria, in many ways, delivered on its promise of being ""Dwarf Fortress, but properly 3D."" Players create a colony, dig underground (but not too deep or too greedily), create an economy piece-by-piece, and defend themselves from unruly neighbors.However, time has moved on, but Gnomoria hasn't. Gnomoria's feature list at its 1.0 release in 2016 is still nearly identical to Dwarf Fortress circa 2013, without nearly so much of the flavor that attracts so many to Dwarf Fortress. And more games have come along that evoke the magic of Dwarf Fortress without resorting to mimicry - Rimworld for small-colony storytelling, Factorio for intense production optimization. And even Dwarf Fortress itself continues to evolve and outpace Gnomoria, not only through the development of its core gameplay, but also the development of mods like Stonesense (isometric 3D, like Gnomoria) and Armok Vision (fully 3D visualization).As a game releasing to early access in 2013, Gnomoria made sense. As a game up for purchase in 2017, Gnomoria no longer makes sense except for those interested in the history and design of Dwarf Fortress and the games surrounding it.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a simplified version of Dwarf Fortress. As a DF fan, I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. It's far more streamlined than DF, such as having fewer animals to herd, fewer types of soil, fewer types of stone, etc, yet there is beauty in this simplification, as it significantly decreases the learning curve. Gnomes are also much easier to manage, and can be done without a third party application (i.e. Dwarf Therapist). Some skills have been combined into one skill (such as masonry and stone crafting), which helps to make the game easier to play. No longer does every aspect of a job need be managed (such as which particular type of material does the dwarf haul), but with Gnomoria gnomes can simply be told to haul. You are also given several professions to start with, which work well. The game also relies far less on the keyboard, and more on a mouse, which is a great feature. It's also easier to decide which material is used to create an item. The simplification, however, does go a bit too far sometimes. Many skills are simply taken out, such as fishing and hunting. This makes it so that meat must be acquired through ranching, by killing the occasional animal that appears with military troops, or by butchering goblins. Also pets have been taken out of the game. Apart from animals, trading has also been too simplified. Gnomes may now only trade with other gnomes, and the player is initially only able to trade with one other settlement. Others may be unlocked, but it takes years to do so. The other gnome settlements are given types, such as agricultural, which makes some variety, but it still feels lackluster in comparison to the difference between dwarves, humans, and elves in DF. Also, biomes are gone. Instead of being able to choose which type of area you settle in (which can lead to big differences in DF playthroughs), gnomoria has the player settle in the same type of area every time, which has the exact same plant and animal life. Water also needs serious overhaul, and the developers need to decide to make its physics easier to manipulate and give it more purpose, or be simply used as a potential hazard. Lastly, there is still a learning curve in this game, as the developers give no form of tutorial. Players must instead watch Let's Play videos to learn how to play the game.While the game does have drawbacks (most notably DF is free to play while this isn't) it is still a great game. The game is still not in it's final version, and some problems may be addressed before it's released. The difficulty is still here, a player should expect to fail totally several times before they begin to understand what they're doing, but it's a much, much easier game to learn to play than DF, while still offering the enjoyment. Anybody who likes city builders, particularly the Dwarf Fortress-like sub-genre, should add this game to their library.			"

The Game has been AbandonedGame breaking bugsNo instructionsBad controlsBasic features missing after ""release""I really wanted this game to work, I put a lot of hours into it hoping it would turn out great, now it's been released with none of the major bugs fixed.  Wheelbarrows don't work, gnomes will pass an unused wheelbarrow hundreds of times that I carefully placed between the Item they're picking up and the stockpile they're taking it to.  Goblins can't find the door to my settlement so they bring tunnelers, this would be more of a problem, but they can't seem to find the tunnels they dig either.  When goblins can get in you're screwed, soldiers won't pick up or wear armor even though I told them to retreat to get armor, gnomes like to attack one at a time and fan out instead of all attacking the same target like I selected.  Production will stop waiting for applewood logs, despite specifically telling the workshop to build it with pine boards instead of applewood boards, my sawmills are set to only make pine boards because I don't have apple logs; but the game has decided it wants applewood so I have to delete and re-enter my instructions and hope.  Workshop build queues are a suggestion instead of a rule, it doesn't matter that I have sticks and coal and have torches on the top of the queue, the workshop decided now was the time to make a barrel out of applewood because the last thing in my queue was pint barrels.There are zero instructions within the game.  You have to go to a wiki that's security certificate has been expired for three months.  Then the info there is often out of date.  The guides on the internet by other players are all old from non-relevant versions of the game.You can navigate three menus deep or use a shortcut to the exact thing you want.  If you're in the build menu you can't go to the mining menu, you have to go all the way out and then all the way back in.  You can setup hotkeys for things like ""mine wall"" or ""dig ramp down"", but if you want to ""dig hole"" or ""dig ramp up"" or ""dig stairs down"" you would have to have a separate hotkey for each of those commands.  You can't go to the dig up commands or the dig down commands you have to go through the hole menu again.  There are three dig up commands and three dig down commands, but these are on different menu bars despite there being enough space on one bar.  You can't mine more than one level at a time, if you want to make a mine shaft 10 layers down, you have to manually dig on each layer and hope they line up, otherwise a section of your shaft is now one square off.  You should be able to click and drag on more than one layer.You can't copy professions or their task priority, if I want to make a mason that's exactly like a miner except he does workshop tasks before mining you have to re-make the entire profession from scratch and hope you get it right.  You can make a new profession in the character menu, but then you can't give that new named profession to anyone else, you would have to re-created it in the correct profession menu.The game is out, but we still need immigrant gnomes, no new gnomes can be made in your kingdom you just have to hope you get enough new gnomes to cover from your last goblin attack.  No baby gnomes.  No copy and paste, Gnomes still ignore dirt piles while putting seeds in my stockpiles to just let dirt golems spawn.  The problem isn't just that you don't have any control, but that the game gives you options to imply the illusion on some kind of control.  I know you can't control the Gnomes directly but I said to pick up dirt piles and ignore those seeds!!!			"

												This is your FAIR WARNINGI LOVE(D) this game. It had great promise, a solid plan, and was the fortress builder of my dreams. Now, it goes in the same bin as Towns, another building game that will never be finished.Upon full release,  content promised upon EA purchase, and content the game still sorely needs,  was cut out because the developer simply didn't want to work on it anymore. As a result, new features and support are expected to be added by the community. In short, this game is now MODware, and even the origianl Modders didn't stick around for long because there isn't much about the game that's modable aside from the appearence of items, resource requirements, and growth timers.Let me be perfectly clear about this, as many continue to attack me over the issue. You WILL NOT realize how incomplete the game is until you have played for several hours, at least. Much of the incomplete content and game balancing issues rear thier ugly head only after you have played for around 4-8 game years. Those years generally take around 2+ hrs each depending on how meticulous you are with building and how grand your designs. I cannot be more honest in telling you that the game becomes an absolute bore as a result, even to the point it effects your later playthroughs, because you realize there is just so little to look foward to.People have asked for a list of Pros and Cons so I made one.PROS:- Closest thing to Dwarf Fortress on the market- A solid early game balance that's fresh every time.- Excellent building customizeability that's sadly rare in many DF clones- A solid (if simple) in game economy that requires all of your gnomes working together in order to progress.- A cusomizeable military- A gadget research path that allows the use of advanced player made mechanisms, ranged weapons, simple and complex traps systems, and automoton population replacements.CONS:- Closest thing to Dwarf Fortress, still far from it in terms of depth and gameplay- Late game is incredibaly boring due to balance issues and stale enemies.- Enemies are easy to manipulate. Even on harder difficulties it is easy to control how many and how much they attack you.- Enemies have no ranged attacks, making gnome ranged weapons OP, especially from behind walls or on cliffs- Enemy and gnome AI is very basic. Enemies will never try to avoid trapped entrances or find another way into your fort.-The military customization becomes pointless in late game. Many perks and traits are just not worth taking, or are for a game with considerably more advanced enemies (heres a missing content hint). Eventually evey melee gnome will simply have plate armor. There's just no reason to do otherwise.- Combat gnome training becomes rediculous to the point your soldiers become combat gods. Goblins, mants, and skeletons become limbed in seconds and the only way the enemies remain a threat is if you intentionally overwhelm yourself or your army decides to sleep through the attack.  - Farming options are INCREDIBLY limited. You have 3 types of livestock. 2 types of fruit trees. 2 ground fruits, Cotton, Wheat, and underground mushrooms. If you want to build underground, your stuck with just mushrooms.- Music becomes very repetitive for this type of game. You'll eventually mute it and play something else. Unfortuneatly, goblin warnings are tied to the music, so preventing yourself from going crazy gimps you. Not that it matters after a few playthroughs.- Building is virtually limitless but the blocks used to decorate it are incredibally limited. Again, this is more of a veteran issue and some may have no issues with it at all. Also solvable with mods.- The gadget research is also limited. You learn everything there is to know in about 2 to 3 yrs of in game time, with just one researcher.- Heres one many don't know about, but as a deep dweller I'll tell you. The bottom 2/3 of the map is ALWAYS the same. Every playthrough I've had has had the same layout of rock formations at level 50, the place I started building kingdoms after getting bored with how easy the surface is. THIS GAME IS NOT TRULY ROUGELIKETLDR: The game is missing content such as diplomacy, enemies, and building/farming options, that are required to keep one's interest beyond the first two or three playthroughs. Even after release, I just couldn't get back into the game given how dull I knew it would become. Some of the game breaking bugs have been ironed out, but I just can't play it long enough to test all of them, so I'll assume the game is considerably less buggy than it used to be. Again, the developer abandoned his project before release. This is now MODware. Whether its worth the $15 or not is up to you, but I can't in all honesty reccomend a game I know is incomplete.			"

								By far the game I've played the most the last decade! And it's great!Other than appearance of a gnome without armor, you can customize everything about a gnome, even its name. Want a Miner to tend to the Farm when no stone-working is needed? Sure thing! Want the warriors to do menial Hauling after training for half a day? You bet. Want a guy who does nothing but slouch around all day? That too!Crafting stations can also be assigned to a specific gnome, so no other gnomes will take jobs from him. Great if you want to train a single gnome in a job. Gnomes need water and food though, else they die. Make sure those jobs are a priority.Gnomes can also be given default uniforms, which means any armor and weapon you want. You can design a military formation with ranged and melee gnomes, which has their own custom uniform as well, even the quality grade can be set, keeping the best armors and weapon for your best gnomes.There are Position Perks which give you bonuses to almost whatever you want, and there is synergy between perks. You can set one position to Knock Em Down, which will result in more knockdowns, and another position can have Finish Him, which does more damage to knocked down enemies. Ranged units can be set to aim for the eyes, making it easier for your melee units. Having at least some diversity is important, and that counts for weapons as well! Enemies are stronger and weaker against certain weapon types.Lastly, putting gnomes in a squad will allow much, much greater control over them, and a squad can be given a Perk as well, which becomes more powerful the more gnomes are in the squad.Lastly, a gnome have skills in every weapon and every profession, but they need to be trained. Your starting gnomes start off with good skills in their profession, making the beginning a bit easier, but nomadic gnomes who want to join you have random skills. If you want someone to be really god at a specific thing, you need to train her by setting her to train or work as often as possible. Don't allow your gnomes to idle! Personally I take it slow, and just build stuff. I really like the building aspect of the game. Gnomes just chop down, mine ore or stone, and you can use these to build block walls, effectively allowing you to create your ideal fortress or any other building you want. There is a huge variety of trees, farmables, stone types and ores as well. And everythinghas value of different kinds. A Gold sword will be worse than a Steel sword for instance, but will sell for more. That's right! There are merchants who can visit from time to time!There are so many, many, many more layers to Gnomoria, so I recommend going to the steam community and read some while you play. The controls become very easy after a while, so study them a little to avoid annoyances. There is also a gnomoria wiki online with valuable information. Also, watch some videos on youtube; some of the castles and creations are really good.9/10 would read bloody combat log again!			"

												You know, it really sucks this game turned out to be abandonware, because honestly for me it was the most promising dwarf fortress clone out there, with even more potential than really solid games in the genre like Rim World and Stonehearth.  This game was the closest to dwarf fortress out of all them, it was like playing a dwarf fortress-lite with a proper visual representation.Unfortunately the game is just bugged to all hell which makes any playthrough just get to point of weirdness where there's really no point to continue playing.  That's pretty much the story here.  Yet another early access title that took the money and ran.  Tons of potential wasted.I sincerely wish they would ban early access from steam.  It has NOT improved the gaming industry, 95% of all these early access titles are ending up this way.  Meanwhile games like Stardew Valley never go through early access and get released in absolutely stellar shape - AND EVEN GET more content added afterward than any of these early access titles add to their games.  Early access is just an enabler for shitiness, plain and simple.  You can probably count on one hadn the actual success stories from a gamer's perspective that early access has brought about.  The main thing EA has done for the gaming industry is ensured an easy road for developers to take instead of pushing them to actually release proper games.			"

Early Access Review
								You can literally play for 2000 hours (yes 2000) hours of this game, over a year and a half, and not get bored of it.  It's that good.  You can create limitless amounts of new kingdoms with each new game, set difficulties, peaceful or not, metal/gem/coal resource abundance etc.  There is much more than meets the eye of simple gfx and sound.  After a while you figure out that if you want to build a stone temple, you have to dig a hole down and get stone, turn it into stone blocks (with workshops for each type of thing) and craft the blocks and tell the gnomes where to build.  It's total freedom but with that comes the complexity of running your own little kingdom.  Are you up to the challenge?  It's like simcity or warcraft meets minecraft.  For those that don't like FPS games or need a break from them, this is a great break.  Actually... it is more like a black hole from which you won't want to escape.  It is that fun.  Oh, and development is constant.  No fears as with some in-development games... the dev is at the ready and giving many new features on a consistent basis.  Don't starve, die of thirst, or get killed by bears, or anything that spawns below level -7 (that is where monsters can spawn, at level -8 and below).  Monsters also spawn on the surface but they are usually wild animals only.  Occasionally, depending on difficulty you get goblin raids (not too rough at first, again depends on your settings), but after a while they can get pretty tough.  You will have to grow your own food, or forage from the naturally occuring fruit trees, or clip and plant some more of your own to make sure you always have plenty of spare food.  Performance, for most this won't be an issue, though this game is entirely cpu-dependant ghz-wise.  SINGLE COREAny relatively recent CPU will run this game on anything up to including a medium sized map, but for those that want to build on large or huge maps with many gnomes (40-50+) and mine deep, a pentium-anniversary edition OC'ed,  i5k or i7k cpu is recommended.   At 4.2ghz on an AMD FX will run a small or a medium kingdom up to 60 gnomes.  On a 4.6ghz i7 4790k cpu a large and huge sized map will run well with the same amount of gnomes at a better frame rate.  Older cpu's such as Athlon II's will incur stutter a bit when mining deeply (past -50 or -60 deep) when you have.  A newer i5/i7 overclocked past 4.4ghz will pretty much let you build anything without too much framerate lagging associated with mature kingdoms.  Don't let all my talk about performance scare you away, but this game is so awesome, you might just want to upgrade your computer if it's a few years old just to build more :)  A fancy video card won't do you much justice with this game so if you video card isn't too recent don't worry a bit.  Just give this game a shot.  In it's current state, it rarely to almost never crashes, and with autosaves, you wouldn't lose much progress even if it did.  It is feature-complete enough to surpass most other early-access (and some fully released) games.  This game, at it's price, is an absolute steal.  The community on steam discussion forums here is very helpful if you have a question to ask or some hurdle you cannot overcome (expect to lose once or twice, or three times even when you first play, this is how you learn!).  For those wanting to build more above ground instead of living in a hole in the ground I personally have made a simple gfx mod that adds windows to some of the game textures, you can look it up in the steam discussion forums under 'mods' for this game.  Visit http://www.gnomoriawiki.com/ for help with various ambiguous parts of the game, and see youtube.com for some (RECENT!) let's play videos.  RECENT being the key.  You want something from spring 2014 or newer since this pre-release game is still-a-changing.  A demo of this game is available.THIS GAME HAS NO BUILT IN TUTORIAL.  EXPECT TO DO SOME READING ON THE WIKI (or on steam discussion forums) FOR HELP.  I have been playing this game for almost 18 months, it's a vortex that sucks you in like no other, and if you need a game that you can just quick walk away from (to tend to the pets, or your kids, or do the wash) then this is the kind of game for you, things will still be (usually) where you left them.New features added just this past month include AUTOMATONS!  Yes!  Gnome-cyborg-robot things that do the work for you!  Prosthetic Limbs can now mend limpy gnomes back into action again.  Did the goblins attack your kingdom and now you're angry and want to throw a stone back at them?  Do one better, have one of your gnomes hand-deliver 1000 Goblin-meat Sandwiches to the Goblin kingdom and watch the mayhem ensue!Build a mud temple that Adam Ant would long to live in, a Stone temple or pyramid reminiscent of civilizations of yesteryear.   ... or just a bunch of red brick townhomes that look like a gov't housing project!  It's all up to YOU!Combat is handled in the beginning with sticks, stones, logs, soon onto swords of various materials (yes, material each has different strenth), bronze, iron, and steel being the best options.  Research can be done via Tinkering at a specific workshop to research various new technologies.  Just a few are ranged weapons (bow and arrow, blunderbuss, pistol), prosthetic limbs, traps of various types, power-plant type devices to power mechanical walls, and now automatons.You can (after researching) even build pumps to move water, make water, or move LAVA and make a volcanic eruption!Water+Lava=Obsidian, a very very tough stone.Basically, the skinny on all of this is, no matter what you want to build, if you like a game where the goal is only to survive and the rest is up to you, this is totally it.  You are limited only by your brain, and ability to cope with situations that arise.  A little bit of simcity, a little bit of warcraft (1 and 2), a whole lot of inspiration (admittedly so) from Dwarf Fortress... and new features all the time.  After you spend a few dozen hours figuring things out and getting yourself adjusted to this game, to peruse the discussion forums for cool kingdom seeds and figure out how to use the custom-map-generator in the game,  With the right digits and a bit of trial and error you can have a map that's 40-50% water and easily surround your kingdom with a moat... or dig enough small holes on any map and eventually they'll fill with rain water and you can make it that way.  This is what makes Gnomoria so fun...there is just so much to it.  So deceptively simple, yet so deep.  The combinations are endless.  Smart Kings can also make their kingdoms self-sufficient to a point, or just wall in for total safety and stand atop the kingdom walls to watch the wild animals beat each other up.  Either way, give it a shot, it's only a few bucks and what's a few bucks for what may very well be thousands of hours of fun.			"

												This game's AI is some of the worst I've ever seen. Constantly building walls closest to them, and then blocking themselves in with that wall until they starve to death. Carrying 63/64 blocks of stone in a wheelbarrow and would rather walk past the stockpile to get 1 apple the other side of the map to fill it up first. THEN he decides ""I'm tired"" drops his stuff all over the floor and then comes back... WHILST HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK ANYWAY. My gnomes then go out to clean up his mess, and no-one uses his wheelbarrow. They pick it up one at a time...BLEEDING GNOMES who are dying would rather bandage a sprained ankle than stop the bleeding. 3 bandages used and my gnome sill died...Digging, a major part in this game, is something you have to manage constantly! You can't leave the gnomes to do it themselves because they can't do it right. Telling them to dig a square out of the ground, they end up going for the closest line, which cuts off access to the rest. Or worse, they trap themselves in the middle, stuck on a single block.Bandages are insanely important in this game where gnomes hurt themselves daily just trying to eat and drink or sleep. Don't even bother having one try to fight a wild animals for food, because you'll lose 4 gnomes trying. Except, you HAVE to kill wild animals to get bones, which you need to make needles, to make bandages...This game is like babysitting 9 children that live in a knife factory. It's not fun. Basic tasks are like trials. Everything has to be micro managed. In a game where you have no control over your gnomes, it needs you to control them, constantly. This game needs to either have it's play style overhauled totally, or they need to hire a programmer who's not lazy to fix the AI.I wanted this to be the Dwarf Fortress with a decent UI that it claimed to be. It failed horribly. The UI is staggeringly basic and makes me think back to the days of Windows 98. Menus and submenus in awkward places with unhelpful icons. The one thing this game is meant to be better at than Dwarf Fortress, and it's awful. Seriously, for a game I PAID for, I was expecting more. DF is 100 times better. Gnomoria is nothing more than a cashgrab aabusing the pupularity of DF.If you want a decent DF style game with graphics, I suggest RimWorld. It went for a scifi theme probably to avoid copy-pasting from DF, but keeps that gameplay. Focused more on a small colony and survival, it's different, but is fun for the same reasons. It's still in Alpha, but has a thriving mod community and hard working programmers.----Another playthrough later:5 months ago this game left early access, implying it was finished. This game as it is, is how they think it should be. I'd be more understanding if it was still a beta.I gave the game another go today and found a gnome sitting at the bakery, I guess trying to pick up some bread? Only they couldnt, their wheelbarrow was full, so they just got stuck. Until finally getting too tired and dropping all 30 items on the floor. Which disables a workshop...I've also noticed in combat that no-one has any health. The only way to kill an enemy is to make it bleed out. Even after injuring every single limb on an enemy, my gnomes will keep whacking away at it pointlessly. Sometimes even bleeding to death themselves before the enemy does. This lack of HP is why I just had my 15 dwarves killed by 4 beetles. Goblins are easy, but beetles which give no loot are as unkillable as any wild animal. The combat is simply broken.I just still can't get over the fact this is called a finished game. I played it again just now because I thought I was being too harsh. And I'll probably do the same thing a month or two from now. Only to keep proving I wasn't being harsh enough.			"

								A fantastic sandbox village management. It might not be as good/complex as Dwarf Fortress, but it's cleaner, it's beautiful, it's simple, it's a very loyal ""copy"" overall, except with a friendly UI. As for artwork, it depends on you, how much you like retro-styled art, it certainly pleases me ... I fell in love with that game, and it's only early alpha.Basically you ""kinda"" take control of very loyal dwarves and you have to do everything in order to keep your dwarves alive, since getting food and drink to defend them from goblin attacks.It's not that sort of game that you drag a selection area and command the selected units to build something: no! Your dwarves act for their own, you may change their job, but they do the rest by themselves.Oh it does feel and look good building shelters inside the mountains, with levels fulfilled of goods... there are no possible words to describe it, that is so beautiful and so pure.Pros:- Excellent mechanics- Friendly ui- Simple and Clean- Few games of its genre (besides Dwarf Fortress, we have Towns, Castle Story and dungeonkeeper right?)- Pretty colorful- Stunning artworkCons- Lacks tutorial, you've to spend some time watching/reading tutorials/guides- Alpha (?) is that a con?- It's not Dwarf FortressPersonal rate: 9.7/10			"

								If you like dwarf fortress, and always said to yourself ""gee, this sure is fun, but I'd rather suffer a tantrum spiral than deal with this interface,"" buy this. Also, if you have a weird fascination with decorating things EXACTLY how you like and ""no I want the chairs blue and wooden and the table stone and red in my room shaped like a cactus,"" buy this game. Unfortunately, it's just not as deep or ambitious as dwarf fortress, so there is potential for dissapointment there.If only we could get the developer of gnomoria and the developer of dwarf fortress trapped in an elavator, or force them to work together at gunpoint, they could make the perfect DF-thingy.

												Extremely buggy. Worse than it's ever been. Gnomes regularly fail to path right and starve to death. Gnomes regularly fail to path right and get stuck doing nothing. Pathing in general is atrocious. Gnome AI for stocking items is horrible, they will travel 200 tiles distance to grab a single item, take it 200 tiles to stock it, and repeat, when theres dozens of wheelburrows, buckets, and sacks laying around. The game is playable... up until you get some bug seriously ♥♥♥♥ing you over. And it can ♥♥♥♥ you over massively. Akin to wasting real life days worth of played time. The only way to manage avoiding this is manually going into the save files to make backups because the game wont let you do it from the menu's. There are a ton of other flaws, but I can't really complain about those. Their cosmetic. I could accept the cosmetic / UI issues if the base game itself would at least ♥♥♥♥ing play right, but alas, it doesn't. TL;DR A potentially great game ruined by cripplingly damaging bugs.

												I've been playing this game for over two years. It is a settlement sim, where you create a settlement, design the layout, dig it out or build it up as you prefer, and try not to starve or get slaughtered.Heavily reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress, but far more accessible, you don't actually control any of your gnomes. Instead, you give them jobs (which you can customize), and put orders on the map for gnomes with the appropriate jobs to do. The ability to define the jobs, combat roles, and priorities gives you a lot of control over the behavior and efficiency of your gnomes.Like many similar games it is a balance between expanding your economy and taking care of your defenses. Gnomes that are learning to swing a sword better are not helping you shear sheep, harvest fruit, or brew wine... and if you don't have enough food and drink for you and your livestock to make it through the winter then starting over is pretty likely.The game recently (~8 months ago) added modding support, and already several interesting additions to the game (like Glassworks) have been added. Now that the game is public, more are likely to come.Some downsides:Combat is unsatisfying to watch, and unless you look through the text logs it's hard to tell what happened.Building large structures can be tedious, as you can't order all the steps at once and trust the gnomes to do them in the right order. Having gnomes trap themselves is not uncommon, though relatively recent changes have made it not happen constantly.I bought the game for $9, three and a half years ago, it's gotten vastly better since then. I'd happily pay $15 now, as the game is far more than twice as good as what I originally purchased.			"

												Promising in alpha-beta, sadly ""abandoned"" by the Devs after release with lacking content, bugs and a horrendous and non-intuitive UI. Isn't really worth the full price, pick it up on a sale if you got the money to spare and maybe have some hours of fun.If you like hardcore RPG micromanagement and world building games with a touch of old (REALLY OLD) graphics and menus/interfaces, you'll like this one if you manage to crawl through the bugs. Needs a lot of time to learn to play properly, so I'd recommend using a guide.Not my cup of tea, but maybe yours.			"

								If you've ever heard of or played Dwarf Fortress, this game VERY faithfully recreates it in most aspects. At the time of this review it's not quite as deep as Dwarf Fortress is, but considering DF is 6-10 years old and this is still relatively new, and with how often the Developers seem to update & actually pay attention to this game to make it work unlike alot of other Early Access/Greenlight abusers, your money is well spent if you enjoy this type of game. I'm very eager to see if it can rival DF but with these much nicer(read: any) graphics and a MUCH more User-Friendly interface with full mouse support.			"

								It's like Babby's First Dwarf Fortress, which isn't really saying much considering it's still will-crushing, sprit-murderingly difficult.  Those screenshots there?  Good luck ever attaining a fortress of that size without being murdered by goblins, mants, or golems.However, the Game is fun, in the same way that Dwarf Fortress is, just in a far more accessible package.  Gnomoria is a nicely gift-wrapped box full of fun, as opposed to dwarf fortress's duck-tape tied with ribbon impossible to open gift-box full of fun.Do yourself a favor and buy it while it's on sale!

												I am a fan of Dwarf Fortress so I purchased this game for $10 a few years back when I first heard about it. And although initially I enjoyed playing Gnomoria it got boring quickly during my second playthrough. There just isn't enough content to keep me interested in playing anymore after 18 hours(a chunk of which being spent AFK), which I felt was disappointing. Even with the excellent mods people are producing for this game, the developer abandoned the project leaving it lacking and unfinished.			"

												ABANDONED!!!!I gave this game a positive, deleted it, negative, deleted it, positive, deleted it, and here we are. I'd really like to give this game a neutral. It's not the greatest, but it's not the worstIt's fun when it works right. Currently it's an unoptimized bug ridden mess that came too soon out of Early Access. The further you go along, that laggier it gets, to the point where you're hitting the keyboard in frustration trying to get it to pause.This is another game that suffers from the 32-bit curse, the bigger the kindom, the more the lag. the more the frustration.The game does have mod support, well, that is when the mods actually load. I've not had much luck in this, only have gotten the mods to load twice in 10 games. I typically end up abandoning games due to 20+ minute loading times or the lag that piles up after about the 8th year. Oh and it only supports one mod per game.There are a lot of behind the scenes that aren't explained anywhere or shown. For instance armor affects your gnomes ability to make items. Depending on the armor is how fast they make items. Or what exactly do automations need? Do they need their own personal quarters? How are they powered? How do the different cores afftect them? And the list goes on and on.If you're wondering, updates comes about every 6 months. In the August 2015 patch, ores was made very scare to the point of not being able to find any. I managed to wait 4 months before I ended up hex editing the terrain file to make more ore. I don't know if this was fixed or not. But at this point I just don't care anymore until the rest of it gets fixed.I currently really can't recommend this game.  I have over 300 hrs play time, but this game gets to a point where it just frustrates the hell out of me and I have to quit it for a few weeks or months. Then I start a new game and it's the same BS again, lag, lag, lag.....			"

												Gnomoria is a God complex waiting to happen.  Want to build a little quaint village with windmills and wells? Make the gnomes do it.  Want to build a castle with death traps and stately halls? Make the gnomes do it. Want to build a huge pyramid?  Make the gnomes do it.  Want to mine out entire veins of ore and gems?  Make the gnomes do it.  Train your gnomes in a myiad of jobs by creating professions, or have them train to fight in training grounds.  Create military units even to the level of assigning equipement types and combat strategies. to defeat the aggressive goblins and food stealing mants. Protect your little community from the dangers that lurk in the untamed lands and below them.  Forge legendary sausages and serpentine chisels.  Make every gnome a hero in their own eyes.I have enjoyed this game so much that I spent 888 hours through the steam version during the early access of this game.  I even bought a seperate version to run on my bench machine for validating bugs.  I saw it's guts and grime get washed out by a sole programmer and turn into this polished game of minion management.  If you like minion management games, get this one.  It has a great community around it as a bonus.			"

Early Access Review
								First review ever here - Gnomoria is just a game that has inspired me to add my two cents for the first time.Gnomoria is an excellent game.  I'm made several tries at Dwarf Fortress (DF) in the past, and each time I'm just bounced off.  Though Gnomoria lacks some of the intricacy DF is always credited with, its user interface is really quite friendly once you've spent a little time with it, and it puts solid tools at your fingertips for competent Gnoministration.  If you enjoy more personalized, hands-on management games, particularly those with a fantasy setting, I can't Gnomoria strongly enough.  Also, in terms of return on your purchase investment, there are few games out there that can rival its bang-for-the-buck.  I'd also like to tack on a shout-out to the music track for this game - it's extremely pleasant to the ears, and I find it very soothing for those late night Gnoministration sessions.			"

												Normally I don't do reviews but I felt that w/ all the negative reviews since release I should do so. I have 528.5 hours in this game, so I can safely say that I've been through a few releases up to version 1.0. I can't speak for the bugs folks mention, as I have never run into any that were game-breaking myself, but I can say for the folks complaining about lack of tutorial is that it's difficult to write a tutorial for a sandbox game that leaves the details completely up to you. I can recommend you watch youtube videos, there are some excellent let's plays that will teach you the basics. You're also able to turn off enemies if you want to go through the learning steps a few times.Some cons though: Now let's be fair, this doesn't have the complexity of Dwarf Fortress, I don't know if that's possible for any game right just because of what I know about DF. But it doesn't say that it's trying to be a DF clone so that's OK. One other thing is I hope the developer continues to develop the game and add new features, such as more workshops, more armors, more weapons, more traps, etc...right now the game has JUST enough material to justify $15, but I can only say that because I've played it. If I did not play it maybe I could not be convinced to pay that amount, I don't know.All in all I DO recommend this game, if for nothing else but a step towards Dwarf Fortress.			"

												I have been playing this game off and on for the past two years, and have been loving it, but I'm going to have to delete my positive review and replace it with a negative one.I dont know what *exactly* happened, but this game has become unplayable. It worked fine back when it was in Early Access but, with every patch, a few more crashes were introduced and never resolved, and now, well after the game has been finished, I can scarecely finish the first in-game month without it developing some fatal error that prevents me from continuing, and ruins my save file.Basically, the game will run just fine for at least fifteen minutes, but never more than a couple of hours, before it crashes on me, and when I try to load my save file, it will proceed to crash again a few minutes afterwards *EVERY* time. There is no getting past it... once that first crash happens, too bad, that game is over.The forums and customer support pages are riddled with various fixes and solutions so numerous that trying to go through them all one by one to figure out which one is causing the problem *this* time would be like browsing IMDB completely at random in the hopes of running into that one actor that you kind of remember from when you were a kid, but can never remember his name. It is a joke that this game runs more poorly now than it did when it was still in developement, and since the developers are no longer supporting it, you can safely bet that this is just going to be the state of things from now on.What a shame... this game used to rock, but now it's just a frustrating mess. How can I recommend it, based on how good it *used* to be, when all it does anymore is make me mad?			"

								Excellent game. Outside of DF itself, this is the closest anyones come to capturing the essence of Dwarf Fortress.I've had a great time getting my little gnomies to build grandiose structures for my amusement. Its like commanding your own ant colony. Even when you dont have any mega-projects going, its still fun to watch them run around in their daily chores.It also runs very smooth and stable for an Early Access game. The ""meat & potatoes"" of the game itself is all there, & it all works, the game doesnt crash all that much, in fact im not sure if its -ever- crashed on me. The devs are still tossing in new things from time to time and seem very dedicated to their vision for the game. But theres already enough there to have loads of fun with.Highly recommended.			"

								You start with couple of gnomes that do different tasks — some of them are wooductters and miners, while others are builders, farmers and ranchers. You gather resources and start digging, making your own underground base. As I'm huge fan of Terraria, I bought Gnomoria on Steam Sale. And you know what? I don't regret it! It can be unfinished, it may need to be polished, but I like it! Without in-game tutorial it was quite hard to understand how things work and yet I enjoyed thinking what I can do and how. Now, I am able to defend myself from randomly spawning enemies, make huge caves and nice looking houses. If you're looking for something similar to Terraria but with managing people — get Gnomoria ASAP. You won't be disappointed!			"

												First review I've written, but I must point out that this game is broken as is. I put a lot of time in to this game during early access and was excited to see it go full release. I understand why the mechanic of goblins tunneling was introduced and it is a good idea, however every time goblins tunnel in to my base the game crashes. I've had to quit playing altogether because this is just too frustrating to deal with constantly. Twice per season the game crashes and if I forget to save I can lose a couple hours of progress. If this gets fixed, I'll pick the game back up and change my recommendation, but until then, I'm done.			"

												Got it for $7 years ago It could have been worth it but as others have said many gamebreaking bugs still exist and have for a long time and are most likely never going to be fixed. Don't click on what I assume is a tunnel made by the goblins it will crash your game.... You'd think it wouldnt be that hard to make a couple of lines of code that either displays a box that says goblin tunnel or something instead of crashing your game. Also I don't know if it was ever fixed and dont feel like playing for 20 more hours to see if it happens again but as of .97 there was still a bug where your world would randomly flood the entire map all the way up to the tallest mountain and never go down ending your game. DO NOT PAY $15 FOR THIS.... maybe 5 or less if your ok with a bad UI poorly designed AI and a buggy crashy game.			"

												This game was fun and exciting for a while, until I grew frustrated with the countless amount of bugs. As a colorful and user friendly clone of Dwarf Fortress, this was very promising. However, I would like to stress out that I would never be playing this game again. Incidentally, my plan was to wait until the game gets updated with the latest bug fixes from the one and only dev before playing it back. That will never happen anymore because the dev disappeared into the aether.Yes, the dev literally disappeared. No updates whatsoever after the last hotfixes for v1.0 was done. Last time I noticed activity from him, it was when he deleted his reddit account this June (or July, I forgot). That was the time I lost hope for the game.Yet still, this game gave me loads of fun, for the time being. So this is what I think of the game:Likes:A simpler, less complex isometric clone of Dwarf Fortress.User friendly UIAmusing combat logFantastic pixel graphicsDislikes:Buggy AI pathing, especially in buildingSeasons look the same (4 seasons mod no longer works)Lack of updatesCountless other bugs that I won't enumerate hereThis game is far from finished. Don't be fooled by the version. That was the dev's technique of Houdini-ing his way off the stage without getting that much negative impact. It was a clever ploy to not break his promise of not leaving the game until it's release. The modding feature does not help with the bugs either.Conclusion is that I don't recommend buying it. If you want to see what the game is like, you're better off watching some YouTube videos. This game belongs to the same pile as Towns and Spacebase DF-9. I have learned my lesson of not trusting devs who make building crafting management games until they absolutely finish the game. I'm glad I bought this game on sale.			"

The game is addictive and fun, relatively easy to learn, although there is no 'tutorial' to speak of, you soon pick up on what it is you need to do. Weather system makes it realistic and you can adjust the level of the 'enemies' when you're first learning to play. Would i recomend the game? Yes, yes i would.

								Gnomoria is an interesting game with a dedicated developer. Starting out with a small crew of gnomes and a few necessary sundries your goal is to survive and grow into a thriving community. In a sandbox environment you can build to survive and grow however you want.I feel it has a fairly steep learning curve however not as challenging as many other sandbox style games that are available and the settings allow for a simpler or more challenging playthrough.One of the best features in my oppinion is the seed sharing feature. If you find a map you like or that a friend likes you can keep or share the seed and play that map again and again.Gnomoria is already a good game and is growing better with every update.			"

Early Access Review
								What's not to love about Gnomoria? Even in it's early access stage, this game feels very complete. Harvest resources, build your empire and vanquish your enemies. The foundation for a great game. A little imagination and you're there. You'll find yourself becoming attached to your Gnomes, caring genuinely for the welfare of those under your command. You'll start naming things, creating the story yourself, in your head. That's the beauty of sandbox games; the beauty of Gnomoria. One game, infinite possibilities, countless stories. It does take some getting used to. Newcomers may find themselves slightly overwhelmed in the beginning, and the first winter you experience may be less than pleasant. You learn as you play, just like with any other game. This is a game that can bring out the best in a persons imagination. Whether that means you're a brilliant general, creating new strategies to ensure the safety of your people, or a master builder drafting the blueprints to a castle. Gnomoria is the game for you.			"

Early Access Review
								So the developper's solution for the unfinished state of the game was to implement mod support and let others finish their game for free (they wont). I'll always remember gnomoria as the game that convinced me that early access is a terrible idea.			"

												NOTE: IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED DWARF FORTRESS, THIS REVIEW WILL BE MOSTLY MEANINGLESS.Most of the reviews do not understand this game at all.This game is an almost exact copy of Dwarf Fortress, except with many of the extremely horrible aspects of the UI improved. Any negative review written by someone who doesn't mention Dwarf Fortress in any way should... well, not exactly be ignored, because they really do have a point. It is insanely difficult and frustrating to get into this game. But just know, there is a game called Dwarf Fortress, which has all of Gnomoria's downsides to a much greater extent, and yet is generally agreed to be one of the deepest and most satisfying games ever released for the PC by a surprisingly large dedicated playerbase. If Dwarf Fortress is a good game, then Gnomoria certainly must also be a good game.But if you're a fan of Dwarf Fortress, then you already know what all of the bad reviews are saying. You can bet that if DF got put on steam, it would garner exactly the same hugely negative criticism: impossibly buggy, horrible UI, horrible graphics, brings your computer to its knees in the late-game, etc. Make no mistake: Dwarf Fortress's UI is atrocious. And yet, the game has such incredible depth that it is beloved anyway. Once you become competent at it, though, once you actually understand what you're doing and develop the muscle memory required to drive the UI, the game is magnificent.Well, Gnomoria is essentially the same exact thing, except the learning curve is about half as steep, and the end-game is about half as deep. No pun intended.I started out as a Dwarf Fortress purist, just played Gnomoria a little because it was in the same genre and it seemed decent enough to give a shot. Nowadays, when I go back to Dwarf Fortress, I am *amazed* that I ever thought such a truly awful interface was playable. All of the super aggravating aspects of DF are just gone in Gnomoria. Many of the things in DF you would need external tools for (Dwarf Psychiatrist, autotask, many of the dfterm functions) are included in-game natively. They're far better integrated.Also, much of the unnecessary crap around the edges has been eliminated. Why on earth do you need to generate a whole 1024x1024 world when your fortress, and the absolute boundary of your gameplay experience, will be contained in a single 3x3 square of it? The idea of of generating a huge pool of starting locations is that (after waiting forever for your CPU to do the horribly intense calculations involved) you can select the very best starting zone on the whole map, and so get a skill-based advantage. But this is just another stupid barrier to entry; should new players be penalized for not knowing that the 'aquifer' tag on a particular tile means that any mines they dig will fill up with water? When barely less than 1% of the map is even inhabitable, why even bother? Gnomoria just generates a 3x3 tile guaranteed to have access to all resources and with low variance when it comes to bad luck like large surface lakes or elevation changes.I dunno, there's lots of stuff like that, little ways the game has been improved by cutting out some in-retrospect-unnecessary element. The reason the ""game was abandoned"" and ""development stopped"" was because they had finally brought the content up to where DF is.Now, when I feel a hankering to play DF, the program I actually open is Gnomoria. I think you'll come to the same conclusion, if you try it out.If you're familiar with Dota, then you might remember a game called Heroes of Newerth. People were sick of having to use Warcraft 3's interface and scripting engine for Dota, and it was obvious that some change needed to be made, so some rich fan developed a whole external engine, and built dota as its own game, and it was therefore much easier to do things that are hard to do in the warcraft 3 map editor. He changed the names of all of the heroes, but, for the most part, their abilities and gameplay stayed the same (although, as a fan, he had a couple ideas for new heroes that he soon implemented). And it was a thousand times better than playing Dota 1 on Warcraft 3.And it had its own problems, of course, but they were nothing like the problems of a decade-old battle.net-connected game. So all the dota players flocked to it.(Later, of course, Valve published Dota 2 and then HoN kind of died or something? I don't know what happened to it, everyone I know switched over.)Anyway, I see Gnomoria as being the HoN to Dwarf Fortress's Dota 1. It changed all the names of everything, even renamed the dwarves to gnomes, but the actual gameplay is exactly the same. Except all the problems with using an ncurses-style command line interface for a GUI are fixed, much like HoN fixed the fact that players couldn't reconnect to the game in Dota 1. I think it's a good analogy.So I think this game is worth getting, if you're a DF fan looking for perhaps an even better DF experience....if you *haven't* played Dwarf Fortress, on the other hand, well. This game might be *easier to learn* than DF, but it is still a very far cry from easy. You will probably have a ton of trouble understanding how to do things like build workshops or plant crops. The UI will fight you. Your basic understandings from other games will be actively hurting you. Your gnomes will die repeatedly while you are alt-tabbed out looking at the Gnomoria Wiki's ""Getting Started"" page. It will take you a long time before you understand what you're doing. You probably won't enjoy it. And so I don't recommend this game to you.But that doesn't mean this game shouldn't exist. DF has an enormous following, and (let's be honest) there really *ought* to be a version of it that doesn't have such a truly unbelievably bad interface.			"

												Definitely a good game, and I enjoyed my 32 hours with it. But the thing that kills it for me is the clunky UI, which makes building complicated things time-consuming, and micro-management inefficient because it's hard to get the information you need at-a-glance to inform your decisions.I do like the core mechanics and micro-managing everything, but I just can't stand the UI anymore - even with lots of keyboard shortcuts enabled.If you decide to play the game and aren't familiar with the genre, I'd *highly* recommend reading a wiki because there's tonnes of cryptic things that you need to know about.

												I really enjoy playing this game, and still pick it up a few times per year and enjoy it for a short time.  Haven't played much else in this genre, so I don't know what to compare it to.Typically, I'll forget how heartwrenching the remaining bugs are and give it a go... get 20-30 hours into a new world and things just start devolving to buggy madness.  :(-Gameplay-I call it macromanagement, as you can't give any direct orders to the gnomes.  Instead, you configure the gnomes to do certain tasks, then make sure the necessary workshops and resources are also configured.-Bugs-""Retreat to equip uniform"" is THE most frustrating of incomplete features.  Always happens... a key gnome rushes into battle with a wheelbarrow instead of retreating to grab a crossbow and gets murderized by an ogre.  This isn't a ""quirky bug"", it's sheer frustration.  Absolutely nothing you can do about it.  That gnome that spent 10 years perfecting his crossbow skill and is a wicked shot?   He's going to kamikaze against a two-headed ogre weilding a pine bucket full of hooch cuz... reasons.Cascading stockpiles... doesn't really work, sadly.Beetles.  Maybe not buggy, but definitely bad mechanics.Mant SFX will get stuck on a certain location, and continue to chitter away, years after you slew it.  One of several reasons I mostly play without sound.Floating helmets?  I dunno why.  They dance merrily about my kingdom.Performance... Not great.  Single-threaded and will crush any PC once there are too many objects.  The better the PC, the more it can handle, but I've seen redditors set up big battles when they know they can let Gnomoria run 3-4 hours uninterrupted.-Overall-I LOVE THIS GAME.  I wish some of those bugs got fixed.  :(			"

												Overall if it's on sale for <$5 and you'd like to ease into Dwarf Fortress I'd say consider it a paid tutorial for the free game.  Gnomoria's gameplay is pretty straight forward, but there's not really any endgame, or enough variety to maintain much replayability.Back in 2013 I had high hopes for this game, and put a fair amount of time into it, although a lot of that was seeing how long self sustaining kingdoms would take to die to FPS.  Unfortunately the creator followed the typical EA method of stalling out development after the first year, entering into a long phase of minor updates, and then releasing a partially developed game.  If you can brave the UI of Dwarf Fortress with a starter pack, then that offers a much better game for free.			"

Early Access Review
								God do I love this game... it is so incredibly addictive to play, but if you decide to pick it up you'd best prepare yourself for some unforgiving failures. A burgeoning kingdom you've meticulously built up and spent tens of hours or more on could easily fall simply because you weren't prepared for a goblin invasion or a beetle infestation... oh, and don't even get me started on the zombie plagues... But seriously, don't let that scare you. The developer constantly adds new features, and the game finds itself with a lot of them and as a result a lot for you to do and ways to run your kingdom the way you want. If you aren't a fan of the frustrastion of the intense difficulty of this game as you progress on, it has variable difficulty that you can specifically choose how hard what aspects of the game are and even what kind of enemies are allowed to spawn. Of course, it can be played in peaceful mode, but wheres the fun in that?			"

												Gnomoria. It is hard to review this game. I love this game and have played many hours in it. It is in my top five games of all time. But that is where the good parts of this review end.This game is a backstabber. It is like one of those people you meet in high school or college. They seem to have everything together, and you can't bear to be away from them. Any flaw you can see is outshone by their shear awesomeness.The trouble comes after knowing these people for a while. The quirks and the minor flaws start to dominate their persona. They can't get out of the frat boy phase. They never seem to have found themselves on that soulsearching trip they were taking.Gnomoria is the same way. It promised a fun game and sure it was fun. But when you build up in those first few years you ignore the bugs where the gnomes stop to pick up something on a tile where there is nothing. You ignore when the gnomes don't seem to understand that they can't pile an entire mountain of stone on a single tile without spawning golems. You ignore when items become glued to the ground and it seems you have found the sack that arthur will have to come pull out and become your king. You ignore this until every minute you have to go and change a profession or else a gnome will die of thirst trying to pick up that sack.I used to play this game almost every week, but I just can't stand it any more. Boo I say. Booooooo! your true love lives! yet you marry another. :*(			"

												Having played Dwarf Fortress a long time ago, I was interested in this title, as it clearly wear it's influence on it's sleeve. This game is literally trying to recreated DF but with actual graphics and UI (and vaguely replaces dwarves by gnomes, but that really easy to miss). Sounds great on paper! ...however, it fails in execution and content.- While it's trying to emulate DF, it keeps very little of the charm of the original, and only covers about 2% of it's content. The only feature that seems to be unique to Gnomoria is the tinkering mechanic, which I haven't been able to really use as it takes literally hours to produce anything.- The isometric view, while prettier than looking into DF's matrix, makes it pretty damn hard to see and target constructions correctly. Half the time, you realize you just ordered to build a floating staircase. A lot of the UI could also be improved, it's serviceable but not very good.- The game might be promising if it was still being updated, but the developer disappeared about 2 years ago. Currently, it's bare-bones, and there's a serious lack of diversity in the content.- Balance also seems pretty poor. It could just be bad luck, but a single goblin naked wielding a door (that he broke down), killed 2 of my fully armored and armed soldiers that had been training for 1 year straight.- Bugs, lots of them. ""Oh what's this odd thing on the ground? I never built this"" No clue as the game crashes everytime I click on it...I know the learning curve of Dwarf Fortress is basically a cliff, that has been oiled up... and is on fire, during an earthquake... BUT trust me, it's way more worth it than this poor imitation, and it's also free (with optional donations). The DF wiki has lots of info for beginners (meanwhile the official Gnomoria wiki has it's domain expired...).If nothing else, encourage devs that care about their games instead of devs that runs away with the sale money without saying a word.

												Gnomoria first drew me as a sandbox management game with a more intuitive user interface than other titles such as Dwarf Fortress, but after all the time in alpha/beta and now after launch it still seems ... lacking. The visual quality of the game is underwhelming, there are few to no animations, I couldn't stand the music for more than five minutes before turning it off, and even with a mouse-driven interface, the management/interaction menus were not as intuitive as I had hoped.

												This game can be very addictive. You choose whether to settle in the flatlands or the hills or mountains, you can preiveiw the area or just jump in for a surprise. You choose the difficulty of your enemies and whether they get strong. And you plan and build. I just when you think that you are getting bored, there are mods that change the game up, easier, harder, more variety. But be warned, this game can be addictive.If you get stuck, look at the wiki or the guides online on steam, check out the screen shots, or ask for help, there is a very active communitiy. Once you learn to play the game, get out your graph paper and design the perfect town then you can go in roman camp style and throw down a design that will be efficient and easy to remember. Only you have to adapt to the terrain, and you have to survive long enough to be able to change what ever you want to change. And you may have to adapt to mods that introduce new workshops.While the game is not multiplayer, you can agree to start in the same location of the same map with same settings and then compare screenshots of the results. If you both should survive so long.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a tricky one. It needs a Neutral review. If you are going to rate this, at least read it first-ThanxIf you know what Dwarf Fortress is, and liked it, you will love this game. The learning curve is more of a cliff face, it's a long, hard slog to figure out what everything does, what order you should craft in,  learning how to use the dwarf professions, Military, Stocks tabs, and how to use Priorities to create effective farms. I suggest that 6-10h of play time will get you to a point where you are proficient enough to be able to enjoy this game. Be aware of that going into it, and you shouldn't be dissapointed.Being Early Access, one needs to remember that bugs that I mention here, will likely be fixed by the time you read the review.So the screenshots that you see of vast  fortresses? don't expect to get that far in the game for  a long, long, long time. What you are looking at there, is beautiful, but it takes a lot to get there. I'm sure I'll persist with it one day, I will manage it myself, but not today.There is one particular thing in this game that I dislike above everything else I want to say about it, good or bad; Mining isn't as intuitive as it needs to be to make this game align with more casual players, such as myself (I'm not really a casual gamer, but I play this game with a Casual mentality). This game is not ready for casual players. Read the reviews, and you will see they are filled with fanboi's. This is fine, as it can be a great game, and it deserves it's positive following. All I am saying is, prepare for something hardcore, or look elsewhere ATM.Mostly, I'm gettting OK with this game, and the more I persist with it, the better I get at not having my Gnomes Derp out. It's the ONLY realy frustration that I have right now, otherwise I would say it's an OK game.ControlsYou dont control Gnomes directly. you give sets of instructions, and they prioritise their tasks. So if a Gnome is hungry, he will go off and eat from the Food Stockpile, before he will pick up that strawberry off the ground. (its just a bug that needs to be looked at.) mostly they manage their own sleep/food/drink needs and you ensure they have enough supplies. I actually like this idea.The UI is clunky and slow. it uses the same system as Win95 where you have to track your mouse across several dropdowns to get what you want. you have to double click lots of things that should be single click. you have to click - move click to select, rather than click drag. I keep hearing from fanbois ""it's better than DF (Dwarf Fortress)"" That may be true, but it doesn't make it OK. You can't pause if you have a menu or context box up. you can only pull up the context menu if you click on a blank area of the map.This is understandable, as designated areas/ objects/enemies are interactive via said rclick. but still annoying.Graphics.Although I get it, i do - it's a throwback nod to the 8bit era of DF, it's not right. I feel the art style is archaic and unclean. tiles have a lot going on in each one and it can actually make it hard for less experienced players to 'read' the layout of the land, especially as we are talking about a mining type game with multiple layers of rock face and myriads of tunnels. I feel that this game would benefit from a clean, crisp tile set. I just looked at the gmae Project Zomboid, and it's graphics are simple, but clean, allowing you to focus on the gameplay. I feel this title here would benefit from such a make over.Sound.Turn it down, turn it off. Play your own. It gets tired quickly.Gameplay.Back to the brutal. I think this game is meant to be fun, but I'm not having any. I think that once I figure out how to mine without getting my miners trapped with no way out every 5 mins, I will like this game more.-->Pathing: gnomes getting stuck is because it's possible to work them into a corner. If, say you were to ask them to dig a pond by selecting an area that is wide, they will potentially dig themselves into a 1 tile island. because they have done this, the dirt that they need is down below their reach, so they can not build themselves a bridge out... you have to get another gnome to come resue them, and this may mean retasking a farmer to become a miner for a little while, etc etc. The pathfinding itself seems not too bad, but it pays to dig / mine in small areas/strips..-->Mining;It's hard work. not from the perspective of it's a grind... it's actually very accessible, and you can get pretty deep, pretty quickly... just remember that depth = harder monsters. Monsters Spawn anywhere that is dug that is within about 12 tiles of a gnome that is not lit by a torch. Pro tip, right there. Anyway, what I find hard, is the pathing. building stairs up/down isn't always easy. gnomes get stuck/freeze. they can remove their only way out, and then they don't build stars back up afterwards. Maybe I found a glitch, maybe I'm doing it wrong. It's annoying. There is a key (E) to make all uncovered tiles invisible, so it's supposed to make deep mining easier, and in some ways it does, but it's still really easy to lose track of where your little minions are. Then there is the whole stock piling and stacking mechanic, which is currently broken. EG. Dirt can be stockpiled, and can be stacked to 64... but gnomes will not stack dirt on a stockpile. you have to make a stockpile, get them to fill it, then destroy your pile, and the game will then stack your dirt for you. I hope this is addressed in the future.Survival.It's meant to be a Rogue-lite Procedurally Generated Crafting Survival Game With Permadeath. this is achieved with map generation at the start of the game, and a Save feature, but no Load... so youcan't go back to previous Save games. really it just feels like it's missing the load feature. I think it's because the game talks about saving so much that it becomes a thing, something that you think about, rather than just lettign it happen so that you can focus on gameplay.On enemies; figure out how to craft a bone needle, and make yourself some bandages. Minor cuts during combat will have your gnomes bleed to death if not treated. Enough Said.Crafting.I like the crafting in this game. You can see what the prerequisites are for items, you can even order an item, and your gnomes will make all the prereq's for it... if you have created/farmed all the needed Craft stations / ingredients for those (wood, stone, bone, cotton, etc) you can see what can be created and what's needed. I Prefer this to the Terraria / MindCrap style of play where items only become available to craft (aka you know of their exsistence) once you already have all the items needed to create it.The Negative Reccomend is mostly because I feel that this game is not yet ready for the Casual gamer, even though I will likely persist with it for now.Casual: well, it's Don't Starve again, but with a steeper learning curve at the start - a science machine in DS wll get you through winter if your an OK player... so, one crafting table, basically. In Gnomoria, you craft 1 table specifically so that you can craft the next 6 that you will need for winter / food / drink / stone / wood / butcher etc etc. And i pretty well need them all. Then once I have them I need to use those tables to build a loom and a  tailor, just so that I can make bandages for when my guys get injured in battle. That's 8 crafting tables in the first 6-10 days, pretty much. I've learned this with about 10h of play time, so it takes about 10h before you can start to learn the game well enough to begin to enjoy it... Thus - not for casual gamers - those who want to pick up a game and know how to play it in 5 mins. If a tutorial is good enough, even if it is really long, a player can feel like they have freedom in the game, and yet still be taught as they go. hints that pop up on events, like yak @ 50% hunger... start the ""build a trough"" tutorial... etc			"

												Gnomoria is the type of game for those who've taken a long hard look at Dwarf Fortress and asked ""Can you meet me half-way?"" It adds a graphical interface and pleasant aesthetics to the fray (and isometric camera), but it loses a great deal of depth from its source material. You don't have children, you don't domesticate wild animals (you instead have Yaks, Emus and Alpacas, which do not appear in the wild), the monsters are fairly linear and small to choose from, and the invading Goblins escalate at a routine pace.Gnomoria shines brightest when dealing with Professions- the jobs your crew handle. In Gnomoria, you have 8 or 9 Professions by default, but immediately, you're able to add, or remove them, and edit existing Professions. Do you want separate jobs for Miners and Stonecutters? Carpenters and Woodworkers? Do you want to separate your Gemcutters from your Jewelers? Do you want your soldiers to help out other professions when they're not training? Gnomoria lets you micromanage exactly how you want your Kingdom to function, and it that is perhaps what kept me going. Allowing us to choose which blacksmith worked which station, and allowing us to choose different gnomes to smith weapons as opposed to armor, enabled a sort of ""assembly line"" approach to kingdom management, that made the entire process a lot more fun and interesting. By the time my kingdom was ""finished"", I'd automated nearly every task to give me a nice, healthy stockpile of every resource available within the game.All in all, the game is great for the price. If you like city builders and kingdom management, buy the game- wait until a sale if you must, but <$10 is more than a fair price for a game that fulfilled all of its promises, and actually made it out of Early Access. Gnomoria, for me, was a little gem that reminded me that not all Early Access developers are looking to take the money and run.			"

												This game had a lot of promise as a DF-lite, but it's been abandoned by the dev. It's by no means a bad game, but it does have it's problems and is definitely not complete by any means.Here are (IMO) the problems:- Lack of end-gameOnce you have things up and running, there just isn't that much to do. This was a problem I ran into in all of my playthroughs - I'd have a blast fending off the initial goblin raids and getting my basic setup, but after that it was just wave after wave of goblins, and the only real threat that they pose to you is lagging your game to death.- CombatCombat is pretty terrible, mostly due to enemies being able to stack endlessly on a single hex. What this means is that you'll have a hundred-goblin doomstack running around, one-shotting your soldiers because they're getting hit hundreds of times before they can do anything. Now there are ways to devise traps so that enemies will trickle more slowly into your forces or eliminate the need for a military entirely, but that doesn't detract from the fact that the core mechanic - combat, is lacking. - Crashes/game breaking bugsI've lost a few of my kingdoms due to this. Most of the time it seems like something specific is causing it because I'll get crashes at the exact same point when I reload the game.- PerformanceThe game is pretty badly optimized, especially once you get to about the mid-game. Goblin raids are also pretty bad once they pick up in size.- CommunicationWhile this doesn't relate directly to the game, I thought it'd be worth mentioning. The developer, Robob0b, has disappeared off of the face of the earth, deleting his social media accounts. There was also a developer roadmap on his website listing promised features, but it's since been removed. Not a very professional attitude.			"

												I played a little over 70 hours in early access. Bought four copies for my kids. My two youngest sons still play the game and get continuely frustrated with AI issues outside of the player's control or combat issues that cause your wonderful gnomes to die. My boys solution is to play a few hours to get their community started then start a new game or play on easy mode. I would agree with other reviewers that game should really be early access until some basic things like AI and combat issues are addressed. The AI and combat issues aside. Caring for and managing your gnomes, even with the outdated UI, is entertaining to our entire family. We don't play as much as we would like due to issues stated above. The game is 90% finished and enjoyable. I just can't give the game a thumbs up when some very frustrating issues can ruin my 10+ hour gnome adventure and I lose my precious gnomes.Dev should add ability for player to manually take over a single gnome with full control. At least that would give the player the ability to mitigate problems when AI bugs tend to clog a workshop or even worse, kill your gnome.			"

								I've owned this game for 3 days and I already have 22 hours on it, truly addictive and absolutely worth £6. Only found 2 bugs, neither stopped my gameplay in any way. I managed to learn most of the game within a few hours, although there is a wiki if you want to get right into it. Music is catchy, visuals fit the setting perfectly but the UI can be a little fiddly if you're using the right click menu. Massive amounts of detail, furniture will be a different tint based on the materials used to build it, items have different quality levels which means that you want a gnome with high jewel smithing to make good jewelry to sell for a higher price.

								Gnomoria is a phenomenal game, It has its ups and downs like most good games however the positives cancel out the negatives by an extreme degree. When I first purchased Gnomoria and tried it, it made no sense to me at all, so I just quit time and time again I would try, to no avail. Something kept drawing me back though, was it the games gameplay? its mechanics? its charm? I dont know. I stuck at it, as a firm believer in persistence is key. After eventually learning how to play the game, I did, for hours on end. I was so addicted. I tried and failed multiple times to prosper in the game, But i continued to fail, to be defeated. So I can successfully tell anyone who purchases this game, CONGRADULATIONS money well spent!			"

								I'm going to start off by saying this: Gnomoria has been one of maybe my top 5 purchases I've made that have been added to my library. Within the first couple hours I enjoyed myself much more than I'd expected.That being said, I HIGHLY recommend Gnomoria for any fan of civilization/kingdom management games and other simulation-type games that similarly inspire creativity, planning, and fun.The Pros:The devs are very active, which is a pleasant surprise considering my track record of getting suckered into early access traps where devs just plain quit or worse.Gameplay is very enjoyable, and will definitely put your micromanaging to the test if you aren’t one for using pause buttons frequently.Difficulty is easy to scale to your desire. Whether you want the hardest experience possible, or if you want to just cruise in a peaceful kingdom is up to you.Large variety of items, tasks, and things in general to learn about maximizing your kingdom’s productivity and prosperity. I would even call the game immersive, to some degree.The Cons:A little buggy, but it’s early access. What’d you expect? The game is mostly pretty clean and well-functioning. The only real problems I seemed to have ran into are outfit/equipment management bugs. Nothing an exit-reload of the game and some fiddling with settings won’t fix.Some of the terrain-reconstructing options have poorly managed AI, but if it didn’t it would just mean you’d spend more time sitting and waiting than doing anything. So that isn’t really that bad either.All in all, I absolutely recommend this game. Great aesthetics for the type of game it is, great music, great development history 10/10. One of my favorite games!Also, I never played Dwarf Fortress. So I went into playing Gnomoria with zero similar experiences, it's not too hard to learn and if you experiment enough you will get the hang of things pretty easily. Some mistakes in the game aren't easily remedied, so you may want to expect to restart your playthrough in some cases.			"

												Gnomoria does little to hide its inspiration. It's an attempt at a more accessible version of the legendarily complex Dwarf Fortress. If you've been following my reviews, you probably know that I place a fair amount of value on accessibility. Adding cute graphics and a, if not modern, at least mouse controlled interface are things I'm very much in favor of.Unfortunately, the similarly stripped-down complexity ends up losing the unique charm of its inspiration, without actually making the game friendly to those not initiated in the Dorfish ways. Like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria is a game about systems and trying to keep them in equilibrium. Unlike Dwarf Fortress, it has systems simple enough to solve.That wouldn't necessarily be a problem if Gnomoria's design moved further afield. But it retains the one save per world and glacial pace. As something to set running in the background and check in on intermittently, it can bring you some entertainment. But it's too slow and too punitive, for too few interesting decisions, to pour the kind of time into that it expects.			"

												This game seems awesome at first. Starting with 6 gnomes you collect wood and stone and, from nothing, build a bustling empire complete with blunderbusses and automatons. What can go wrong?Turns out, a lot. Once your kingdom gets big enough, crashes WILL happen. There's really nothing that can be done since every kingdom uses a single save slot with new saves overwriting the old ones. There is no way to go back to an old save.Also, market stalls are currently bugged. 95% of the items you craft will have 0 worth in the market so buying from a merchant is almost impossible. With a developer that effectively vanished, its safe to say this bug will probably never get fixed.			"

												This game can be correctly called ""Dwarf Fortress lite,"" but it has several rules and mechanics that prevent it from perfectly capturing a lighter version of that experience.The big one, I feel, is that there's no real way to avoid the overworld. Dwarves can stock up on an absurd amount of wood, then bid the sun goodbye forever. Gnomes are not so lucky; They can grow mushrooms underground for tea, but underground pastures are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to make and there's no other way to grow crops purely underground. Also, most furniture can only be made from wood, meaning you will have to leave eventually. This is okay; it gives the game its own sense of identity, but it's important to know that strategies that serve in Dwarf Fortress are often not replicable here.Also of note is that, while the interface is substantially easier to use than Dwarf Fortresses', it's still awkward as hell. Most commands are selected mainly from a right-click drop-down menu that has a habit of closing menus if your cursor drifts off for even a second. The placement of a lot of tools is also questionable at best, making large projects of mountain-levelling and fortress-building take much longer than necessary as you need to remember the logic the game uses for its tools. I suggest Tacyn's Base Mod, located in the Steam Workshop, to fix this. It adds a lot of content, but much of that is cosmetic choices (such as new tree types which result in different coloured wood) but it mostly feels well-implemented and the alterations to tool logic are, in my opinion, hard to live without.Finally, this is sadly a game you can't really help but play with the wiki open; workbenches are used to craft every type of good in the game, but they follow a tech tree which the game itself does not really offer for viewing: Crude workbenches can be made without processed materials, and are used to craft your first few real benches. You need to make a stone cutter to process stone into the form used by the stone mason. You need to make the stone mason so you can craft the cutting blade required to craft the sawmill. You need the sawmill because crafting a single plank with a crude workbench takes ages, and only after you have one is it worth building your carpenter bench.The more infamous example is the creation of beds: You need a loom to process cotton, a carpenter to make bed frames, and a tailor to make matresses. To craft the tailor, you need a bone needle. To make a bone needle, you need a bonecarver. Bonecarvers have -very few- uses beyond crafting a bone needle; just creating trade goods and low-grade armour. To make the stone needle at the bonecarver you need a butcher to extract the bones from a corpse. To get a corpse for the butcher you either need to have had your yak pastures up and running for a full 12 days or you need to luck out and win a fight against goblins or honey badgers, which is far from guaranteed when you have so little armour and no experience. That means that, before you can make your first bed, you need to have eight different workbenches and either a ranching industry or a large amount of luck.That said, if you can accept the minor niggles of the tech tree being what it is and the interface being sort of screwy, Gnomoria is definitely a game worth your time. Whether it's worth your money is another story; I would probably not buy  it for over $10 USD.			"

Early Access Review
								Steep learning curve.Brain melting addictivness.Memory leaks and late game crashes. [These bugs will go away eventually, the game is still in development at the time of writing]Gnomoria is a game in which you manipulate, rather than order directly, your colony of gnomes as they reshape the landscape into their kingdom. Farms, groves and pastures, workshops built underground or in buildings, forts and castles, crossbows and rifles, swords and hammers, armors and ... well other types of armors. Mines. Lots of mines. Dangerous mines full of skeletons, zombies, spiders, beetles and the occasional golem. Also gems, valuable metal ores but mostly less valuable dirt and rock. That you can bake/chisel into more valuable ceramic blocks, bricks or crafts for trade or showing off.The essence of the game is manipulation. Each gnome can be assigned a profession which can be entirely customised by the player. Dedicated chefs, carpenters that double up as farmers, jewelers who also help tend the wounded or build things when there's no jewels to make or wounded to tend. Both the specefic jobs for a profession and their priorities can be customised and here is where the learning curve comes from.Even though the game is still incomplete, there is much to discover and learn about how to best organise and grow your workforce. Giving orders is relatively easy, but seeing them carried out sensibly and efficiently is an entirely diffrent matter.The game is difficult yet mostly peacefull at the same time. Expect lots of restarts but also expect your next kingdom to fare better than the last.There is maybe little point past survival, or survival in the prettiest and most efficient kingdom you can build, but in that regard Gnomoria is similar to Lego bricks. You don't play much with what you create, you reach a point of satisfaction (or more likely late game instability) and start thinking about how to build another world.Have loved ones on standby ready to hit you over the head with something sturdy but loving, preferably a hammer. The game is far more addictive than it seems.			"

												The game has changed very little since Feb 2015, still feels incomplete and only half finished. Since then it has mostly been bugfixes and and mod support for a game that is basically dead in the water for development. (Its still buggy and sometimes quite annoying to play.)Positives:A lot of the basic features are complete, you can build a decent enough base for your gnomes.Gnomes that have fought in battles can lose limbs that impair thier abilities which helps give some of your gnomes some character which they otherwise lack completely.So long as you only build unerground, building can be quite fun and easy to do, planning storerooms and workshops seperate to your living quarters and dining halls.The visual style and overall presentation including the UI is nice to look at and faily easily interpreted.Negatives:Being that no preferances exist for food and drink, there is no incentive to vary production and create a variety of food and drink and instead produce the same stuff for the entire playthrough.Controlling your gnome squads is difficult too, only being able to give vague suggestions of what you want them to do which can be frustrating when combat often leads to serious injury a single gnome can run into a fight before everyone else and die immidiately leading to an entire colont collapsing because you no longer have enough gnomes to fight back and the few remaining goblins take down your civilians with little resistance.Gnomes get stuck a lot unless you remove tiles in a very specific order to prevent them removing thier only escape because they can't walk on solid blocks if they have no tiles on top. Sometimes you dig down and get them stuck or they construct something in the wrong order and get stuck on top of a wall. You have to micromanage them as best you can despite only being able to designate jobs to be done, this leads to a lot of watching them do a job then designating the next tile(s) for construction or deconstruction, the larger the project you intend to build, the more tedious the process gets.The games hospital area just does not do its job, gnomes do a better job of patching themselves up after a battle. I have had gnomes who would otherwise have lived die in hospital of thirst despite having plenty of drink available. Plus they stay in hospital untill they are fully recovered and since there is no medicine in game this takes a very very long time, time which would be better spent doing work so we don't all starve.Currently missing or lacking features:No animal taming.No personalities, life goals or religions.No magic or enchanting.Diplomacy overly simplistic, either friend or hostile monster kingdom with no way to change thier disposition. Friendly kindoms exists purely for trade and hostile kingdoms will only attack you. No communication and barely any interaction outside of trade or fighting.Items, plants and animal variety feels lacking, very few rare plants and animals exist.I've never seen a random event besides being relentlessly attacked by goblins and the Mants have never attacked because I don't make too much food.Medical treatments besides bed rest and bandages, without any other forms of treatment the hospital is pointless. (Artificial limbs exist but they are quite late in the game and are not produced at the hospital.)The game is fun enough to pick up on sale but not worth a full price purchase.			"

												Gnomoria was an addictive early-access 'Dwarf Fortress Lite' game centered around an isometric view, actual graphics, and the titular gnomes. The game is charming in its own way, the varety of gnome sprites brought a modicum of life to what would otherwise be smiling icons. But aside from Gnome looks there isn't much else varied in the game. You have your standard farms and produce, your varieties of stones, a smattering of metals, a few AI 'kingdoms' to trade with and that's about it.No, really. Unless you count the monster varietes, all of which but three can be countered by simply lighting your mines with torches. Skeletons, Zombies, Beetles, and Spiders simply aren't a threat to any player (read: most) capable of planting torches on the floor. The rest are periodic goblin & ogre invasions that scale in size and armament with the 'wealth' value of your realm. Not that the scale of these will kill anything other than your framerate when you reach a point where you can trap them in corridors and let them starve to death. The last enemy is the mant, chitinous men-ants who spawn in numbers based off your food storage and can be completely circumvented by killing a scout spawned a day or so before a raid.These threats do not become more challenging over time as much as they become higher in number. Attack frequencies never increase, there are no bigger threats, and they're routine enough to be completely predictable. The difficulty curve in this game stems from the lack of a tutorial and the creeping FPS death and bugs (both beetle cascades and crashes).If you're wondering if the game has any mystical or otherwise big events/features/content, I can say there's none. Once you learn the mechanics (and the gnomish mechanisms), the game becomes trivial in the extreme. So yeah, 'Dwarf Fortress Lite' in the negative sense of the phrase.The game lacks in significant and essential content it sorely needs to justify itself as a finished game, such as a deathcare system, expanded economics and management(No royalty/nobility! Though you might consider that a good thing) , and a meaningful way to interact with the game world outside your kingdom.To top it all off Gnomoria does not support resolutions higher than 1080 and the developer has not and will never make any attempts to ever support them. Enjoy playing in windowed mode if you've a higher resolution monitor.Gnomoria was good for an early access game. It is not a finished game worthy of release. Sacrificing the last 2 years of development to focus on mod support at the expense of sorely needed content made this game another warning against Early Access.			"

								With enough time on this game to write a review i decided to finally get to writing one.Lets start with the good points: The developer listens to feedback and works on bugs extremely fast, You can sell pet rocks for yaks, Dress up your gnomes in the skulls of your dead enemies, For some reason goblins shank your yaks instead of you, Extremely fun and good to play in spare time and keep your kingdom looked after, Willing gnome sacrifices come at the start of every season to ""work"" for you, Combat system that shows where your gnome is hurt and how it will affect its battle, Skill called ""way of the gnome"" assign this to a group of 5 gnomes and watch them kill everything you see until you run out of your early supply of bandagesThe bad points: It only has a single developer so progress for updates is slow but still frequent, Can't stop yaks for bleeding so if one of them grazes its hoof you get to watch it slowly bleed out over your kingdom until you finally eat it, High difficulty curve to the point that most new players won't realise that placing torches will save your life and digging deep will be the end for a new player.Overall this game is amazing and something i keep coming back to and finding new updates each time. 10/10 m8			"

								What do you get when you cross a giant honey badger with a gnome?We can try to find that out as Irreverend Opinions looks at Gnomoria.---The BlurbSimple and sweet, a town-management game where you can't directly control your subjects.  Lead a small band of adventurous gnomes into the founding of a new colony, and defend them not only against starvation, but also hostile goblin raiders and hungry beasts!The GoodSimple and fun once you get the hang of it, with a basic 'dig and build' approach to the world controls.  Randomized terrain and gnome stats make this a slight blend into roguelike, which has both ups and downs.  The in-game orchestra sound track is quite nice, and the game sounds are decent quality for a beta.The combat is not difficult to understand; you can give instructions to your gnomes on how to conduct themselves in battle (I favor a kamikaze rush), and the enemies present a bit of variety in tactics as well; animals will run if hurt, and goblins will happily test your defenses.The BadPoor graphics* and terrible default sound track.  There's not very much to do (still early access at time of writing), and so the game can be very slow after a while.  Strong learning curve with no starting instructions, and at time of writing resources can be difficult to get together for items needed for the game.  Few explanations and warnings for events makes some facets of the game a bit challenging.  The pathing AI can be a bit funny.* 8-bit, might be your thing.The UglyThere isn't any.  Nice game, still in beta.SuggestionsAn in-game recipe book would be nice (even if such was populated only by things you had discovered and 'theorized').  A gnomish flavour to menus would be good, perhaps naming the weaponsmith a swordificationator or something.  More in-game notices that a gnome has just dug himself onto a cliff that he can't get down from and is at risk of starvation would be something I'd like to see.The Summary7/10, 8/10 if 8-bit graphics are your thing.

												People here complain about developer abandoning the game... Actually, the game's complete enough to enjoy it (and been that way since its first appearance on steam). And not only enjoy it, but spend 300+ hours playing. And before the Robobob (dev's name) ceased working on game and disappeared for good, he managed to make a game open enough for workshop-devs to actually enable them to polish it to perfection.Definetely worth a try. Incredibly addictive and relaxing. 9.5/10 on ""fun"" and ""quality"" scales amongst the games of this kind.			"

												SHORT VERSION: ***Game is buggy, seems to be no fix - Game abandoned with no fix - Do Not Buy***LONGER VERSION:I put many more hours into Gnomoria than what is shown; possibly over double.And I enjoyed the game - never played anything like this before. No DF experience, ect.However the last update for Gnomoria - in my opinion - left the game upstable. I have worlds that are corrupted due to my Gnomes climbing scaffolding. I sometimes am hoping that opening a workbench doesn't crash my game, I hope any bug doesn't crash the game, and then hope that the crash doesn't corrupt my world. It is a shame RoboBob left this project, as it was one of my early purchases being new to Steam - and I had a good amount of casual fun. The game is riddled with bugs, that forums, and those on the workshop community, even the Reddit sub, know not how to fix the problems. And it is a shame. I hope the community find a fix, but I'm not going to keep checking up on that.			"

												Wow, so much hate since the 1.0 release.Yes, the game is probably done with development.  There is no promise of future updates.  However, the game is playable and many major features were added to the game.  Most of the bugs have been fixed, so I'm not sure what the others are talking about.There are annoying quirks with pathing, gnome behavior, and interface issues.  My biggest hope is that we get a 1.1 that actually fixes many of the issues.  Better yet, open source it!  The features that were ""promised"" on the road map were pie in the sky brainstorming by the developer.  He should never have posted it. I just don't understand how someone can give a negative review, but have over 100 hours in a game they most likely bought on sale for $5 or less.			"

								This is the best game you can buy for this price. I had it for months before it even came out on Steam and I think it is a must buy. Beware however, it has a steep learning curve and you will lose your village a couple of times until you get the hang of it.The game is constantly updated with new features and more stable and bugfree than most full price games you can buy today.Edit: I should mention that I had a savegame that caused reproducable crashes, that was before the game was on steam. So I reported the savegame to bugzilla, and the bug was fixed in a couple of weeks. This was the first time ever that any bug I reported got fixed in any game.			"

Not worth 15$/e, if it's on sale on like less than 5$/e and you like this kind of game, go for it though. It's for me the closest successor of Dwarf Fortress (which is sad to say since it's a pretty meh game)			"

Early Access Review
								At first there was Dwarf Fortress. And then there was my complete and utter lack of patience for the tedious micro-management and brutal difficulty of that particular game. (Read: I love it, but sometimes lack the attention to detail it requires.) This began my search to find a similar, but somewhat less dense version of Dwarf Fortress. I came across them in droves. Rimworld, Timber and Stone, Prison Architect, and of course Gnomoria being foremost among them. Gnomoria is a game, that while being more limited in its options and features than Dwarf Fortress, still manages to capture its charm and fun. To say that Gnomoria is a blatant clone of Dwarf Fortress, does it little justice, though there is no denying a certain amount of inspiration must have certainly come from that title. This much is evident as you first embark to your new settlement. After naming your map (or fortress, or whatever you may want to call it), and choosing some options for difficulty, Gnomoria plants you into a procedurally generated map. You're able to determine if the map is mountainous, flat, or perhaps even a bit hilly via a few sliders if you choose to customize the advanced settings. This all ensures you'll never have the same map twice. You'll only have a handful of gnomes at first as well as a very limited number of supplies. Now from here, it's up to you to determine the fate of your gnomish minions. While you can't directly control your gnomes, there are a number of ways to determine how they will behave. You're able to designate professions which will determine what sort of generated tasks your gnomes will be able to complete. Gnomoria even allows for you to create and name custom professions which will then carry out specific tasks. This gives you pretty solid control over how your colony prioritizes work. I've found this feature to be particularly useful in the beginning as gnomes are not apt to doing things efficiently using only the default professions. If you wish, you can create professions that will only carry out military tasks. Assign them to squads, train them, arm them. If you master these menus, which is not difficult by any stretch thanks to Gnomoria's simple but effective UI, you will be much better off for it.Gnomoria really shines in its ability to let you sculpt the land. For anyone who has played any of a number of voxel-cube based games (Minecraft, Space Engineers, etc.,), this part will be quite familiar. However, in this instance, you will be viewing the world through an isometric perspective rather than first person. You can tunnel and dig anywhere and everwhere, but be warned, unlit tunnels sometimes spawn deadly enemies such as skeletons and even zombies. Use raw stone to craft blocks and then you can begin building a fortress. One of my favorite features here is the 'replace' tool. Using this you can easily replace any block with any other type of block. I'll often find myself following the natural geometry of the landscape to determine the layout of my settlements and simply replacing the dirt walls and floors with more permanent stone or wood. It's been quite a lot of fun being the architect of some pretty grand fortresses. Players should be careful to not get carried away with doing too much at once though as it will keep your gnomes from completing other tasks of higher priority to you. Gnomoria has a lot of great features. You can craft arms and armor for your gnomes, or craft trinkets and statues for trade. You can farm food and brew drinks to keep your gnomes alive through the winter. Fend off goblin invasions, endure monster and animal attacks, and brave the deepest caves. There is, undeniably, a lot to do in Gnomoria. If any of that sounds fun to you, I think that you'll find this game to be worth the modest price. I've enjoyed Gnomoria, that much is true, but what's more is that I will definitely continue to enjoy it for some time.			"

												I must say, many people complain about it not being finished and all, but really, it is. Game is more than playable. It is true that the developer, after releasing the game in its final form, completelly disapeared from the forums and left his main website unsuported (also the game wiki, which was great but now is in shambles). This left everybody who was following the development of the game (such as myself) with a ""i want more!"" feeling, since it appeared that he was going to do more for the game.  That was indeed halved, and many promissing  future features never did take off. But it is not fair to say it is not a finished game. Not only it is, it is also pretty bug-free, and its funcionalities work just fine. Also, it must be stated that with only a few mods (available via steam workshop) the game gets even better. I specially like the ones by ""Tacyn"", which expand the game's enjoyability manyfold. So saying it is dead is just plain wrong.That being said, this game does cater for a specific kind of player. It's a very open build and survive game, with blocks and resources,  recipies and craftables etc. So if your aim is to have a storyline, an ""end game"" crisis, characters, etc., this is not for you. If your architect itch is ... well, itching, than this is for you, as you can build pretty much anything you can imagine. A 10 stories castle with wind-powered steel doors and moats? Do it. Have your gnomes upgrade from eating raw ingredients, to having variead meals? Done. With some mods you can even raise spiders and harvest their silk, and tailor hats with it! Wanna build a 'hall of heroes' with gold-statues, to raise your town worth and attract merchants that offer more specialized goods? You got it. Done it all and got tired? Delete the game then. In a month or two, reinstall it and play it all over again. In that sense the game's replayability is huge.I admit, it is hard. In several maps I can't get those gnomes to survive enogh time to get a basic industry going. Or before I had time to build the simplest of defenses, a goblin attack wiped everybody out. In that sense the game can be indeed arid. Like ""banished"", with worse graphics but ten-fold the possibilities. But that is not the same as saying, as many people did, that the game presents you with nothing to do, or that it is boring. That is simply untrue.A gem of a game. 5 stars.			"

								After playing this game on different stage of this Early access, I can safetly say that this game feel rather complete.Not too many bugs and almost no breaking game bug (CTD, BSOD...). For anyone looking at this game, it is a ''more'' friendly dwarf fortress style game.Pros :- good graphic- very good  menu, a mix of the right click menu and a set of Hotkeys- provide a good challenge without being unfair- each game can be customize from peaceful to Impossible Hardcore Hellsish mode.- A lot, and i mean A lot, of support from the developper, many patches and many more feature to be add- a complex priority system for all the task in your kingdomCons : - No tutorial, you have to rely on some steam guide and let's play on youtube- Sometime even if everything is set correctly your Gnome just idle for a couple of in-game hours  (maybe their personality)- underground game with not a lot of visibilityIn conclusion, a solid kingdom builder with survival at its core, can be very challenging in the beginning, but overall all these type of game have a big learning curve.It is still a solid one to start with.Bonus content : in game combat log ''HIT: John swings with her copper hand axe at the goblin, hitting the neck, slicing through the skin and slicing through the throatSTATUS: The goblin lost his head, his neck is bleeding, an artery has been struck, is suffocating and is blindDEATH: The goblin has died.''

Early Access Review
								This game, as I'm sure is well advertised, is a more approachable take on the Dwarf Fortress formula.  Think Minecraft meets the Sims, but instead of a house, you build a small settlement (or a huge sprawling, multi-level fortress that goes 40 stories below the earth).+Begin with a small group of workers with various skills.+Assign them tasks, giving priority or preference to those you deem more vital.+Watch them execute the tasks and make logical adjustments, altering terrain and tasks to meet needs.+Harvest resources, build structures, and defend your settlement until new immigrants arrive.+Defend against enemies, both natural and fantastical, preparing your workers through acquisition of resources, trading, and training their skills.+Workers get better at tasks the more often they do them, with each having their own hunger, thirst, and stats. Can change occupations or create your own custom classes using a system of priorities for each task (Agriculture, Smithing, Mining, etc).It's one of those games you begin at 1800 and take a break, check the clock, and curse the fact that somehow it's now 0600 the next day and you only get 2 hours to prep for work.  Strongly recommended for weekend play only!Developer is regularly updating this game, putting it beyond the immediate competition in that regard.  Given time, it could rival the Hallowed DF in terms of content, but for now it merely noses past by a slight margin due to graphical and interface simplicity that make it a joy instead of a chore (sorry, DF, but you are a bit on the exclusive side).Strongly recommended to fans of simulations, creative world-builders, and hoarders.

								I love this game, but what inevitably breaks the experience for me every time I really get into it is the inexplicable crashes.It is an absolute blast to craft sprawling cities adorned however I want, mine deep into the earth for precious resources, develop my gnomes into skilled warriors and craftsman, BUT when you lose hours of work to random crashes attributed to things like ""too many items/enemies"" or ""That gnome is building a chair"" or ""I don't even know because there are too many variables that could be causing the crash,""  the fun factor is instantly replaced with frustration.  I've spent a lot of time on some games simply trying to figure out what factor is causing the crashes.  Is it the market?  Is it a specific building?  Again, there are too many factors, and its painful to figure out.   It's Early access at the submission of this review, so I get it: crashes are to be expected.  Regardless, crashes are never fun, so take care if you decide to purchaseThis is a fun game and will be better when/if they ever finish the game.  If the severe stability issues are eventually addressed, you can bet your bum that I'll switch my recommendation to ""yes!""			"

								Gnomoria obviously takes much of its inspiration from Dwarf Fortress, but with a user-friendly interface and colorful graphics, it is much more approachable.  While this may not have the complexity that Dwarf Fortress does, it offers an extremely enjoyable experience and has been well worth the small price currently being charged for the game.  Fans of Dwarf Fortress or any other village management games should definitely take a look.			"

								Most long time players/fans of this game will claim it is good and we should judge it in its own right. I am however, going to judge it compared the most obviously similar game to it, Dwarf Fortress. Ignoring the fact that DF been in developement for many years, it does still have much more content. Depth of features such as animals, and lore, as well as late game appeal(plus it's free), put DF in the lead. If you don't mind a ""learning wall"", Dwarf Fortress offers unmatched gameplay in the genre. However, if you want to get into a game without having to read wikis, and you want an easily approachable and understandable interface, Gnomoria gives you what DF doesn't. I couldn't recommend this game to anyone who has played DF for any length, but if you have ever wanted to, or just want to have a boatload of fun in a city builder, I heartily recommend this game.

								Gnomoria is a Beast. a Beast that can Beat on your Soul for being reckless and too greedy, or it can be a fun ride by mining and building to your heart's content. some may call this Dwarf Fortress or Gnome Fortress but i think this Game has something going on and it is unique. the Difficulty can be Ramped up for  unforgiving relentless play all the way down to an easy enough mode where no one will attack you other than the creatures underground. with a good UI for building and managing your Dwarves, it is no wonder that Gnomoria gets you hooked in, and this is no small feat for a game with so many rules and micro management.The amount of time you will spend naming, training, building, sculpting Land mass, Thinking of Bad♥♥♥♥♥kingdoms to build and Enemies to Fend will leave you in awe.  It is Also really Role play if you wish to do so, since most of the materials in the game you get to make buildings with and furniture are of different colors and Elements, you could have colorful or rugged cities.All in all if you have Played Dwarf Fortress, you will feel at home minus Dwarves. the game may feel a bit more game-y because of the simplified UI, but it still plays great. If Minecraft, try it! worth every dollar, just be ready to learn a bit of UI mechanics and 2D/3D Controls. Gnomoria Forums are also great!			"

												+ less micro management than dwarf fortress+ much easier learning curve than dwarf fortress+ moddable items and data.- Walls are impenetrable, and so are one-way traps.  AI pathfinding can't deal with this very well.- If the AI can't find a path into your base it brings a teleporter the next time it comes.  The game calls this thing a 'tunnel' but it's a teleporter.- You can absolutely use traps to prevent surface attacks from ever reaching inside your base (despite above), but your gnomes will probably wander into those traps unless you disable your butcher / corpse pile / scavengers- enemies with ranged attacks ? haven't seen em.- wooden rail fences are just as indestructible as Steel walls. more indestructible than steel doors.- not using path blocking traps is not a viable late game option, but using them properly means enemies have no chance to survive.If you wanted a very simple version of dwarf fortress - here it is.A few of the DF annoyances are very hard to solve here - want your gnomes to avoid an area? Sorry.It's still frustration prone and a huge time sink - but I didn't have 'fun'			"

Recently I gave it another shot and I am so glad I did. If you are considering this game, do yourself a favor and watch a tutorial video covering the basics. A good 30 minute video should do, but give it a shot, it's an amazing game. Additionally, you can watch my first experience with the game here:

												Understand, first and foremost, Gnomoria is something unheard of to the crowd that likes these kinds of games; Fully released. As of this writing the version on Steam is the released product and the game is not abandoned as some have claimed. Many of the negative reviews currently on Steam have nothing to do with the game itself and are about the developer stating he has finished development and this has led some people to decry the game as an unfinished product. This is not the case, and many of them do not state or list relevant detractions from the game aside from their feeling it is unfinished. The developer did not finish all the features he intended to, but he left the game in a well-beyond playable state that is beyond a fair few other Greenlight games that never make it out of alpha or beta states.I first heard of Gnomoria a few years back and at the time it had a small bit of hype for it's aspirations to be an in-depth but still penetrable city and resource management game. The premise is simple enough; You start as a group of gnomes, you have a small amount of starting resources and your goal is to build and maintain a prosperous settlement. To do this you need to mine for ores, clear forests, farm food and materials such as cotton, build structures and outfit your people. You manage what each individual Gnome can do via a Profession system that ties certain tasks to each profession (A miner mines, a woodcutter cuts wood, and a rancher fruitlessly tries to corral your animals) and understanding it, as well as the game itself, will be your key to victory.Let me state, I love this game. It's one of my favorite games to just turn on and let run when I need to kill time and it's perfectly easy to pick up and put down, yet like most city and civ management titles it's hard to actually stop playing. I spend a lot of time doing projects to reach some goal and find myself needing to do other projects to shore that up and it turns into this interconnected maze of projects that each feel fulfilling when you complete them.Each Gnome has it's own skills and each profession uses certain skills which makes managing your gnomes a key and fun part of the experience. The game has wild animals and monster invasions which provide most of the incentive to militarize your settlement and add an extra ticking clock to the survival of your settlement.It is not an easy game to dive into. Your first few settlements, without the benefit of Steam guides or other resources, will crash and burn. You have to keep food stocks up, drink stocks up and your kingdom has a Value which is the combined total of all the resources and structures on the map. This value attracts more Gnomes to your settlement, but also factors into the strength and rate of enemy attacks which means you have to be able to adapt your defenses as your population and value increase. This makes each settlement lost a learning experience and very rarely will you not take something away from the experience.It is not perfect by any means. Despite it's light feeling, the calculations and processing required can make bigger maps or older computers chug a little and sometimes the AI feels a little clunky in how it determines pathing, often leaving gnomes taking the longer routes or unsafe one when shorter/safer ones are available, but this rarely impacts the experience for me. There is a lack of variety in some things such as metals and farm-able resources but what is there is easy enough to understand and the combinations/products you can produce can easily be enough to overwhelm yourself with. There are some small complaints like the music being a bit chippy and the sprite work being basic, but they both work fine and they do not detract from the experience.Overall, I highly recommend this game and urge you to give it a chance in spite of the negative reviews currently in place. I do not deny the game has problems, but the game is absoltuely playable and a good, easy to slide into game for this genre. In terms of cost versus enjoyment, it is well worth the money and you could easily have less fun and less time spent in much more expensive games. You can benefit highly from the guides and resources in place and mods will add some depth for those seeking a deeper, more varied experience, but this does not take away from a great game.			"

												Great game.  Clearly comparable to Dwarf Fortress, but much simpler to use and play.  Much lighter on detail and immersion than DF, which could be seen as either pro/con.  I could get lost down some various menu for 45 minutes in DF just due to the breadth of detail.  The Gnomes here are blank slates.  They dont have life stories.  They dont have absurd passions or phobias.  They will not go insane and butcher everyone because they are missing a left wool sock.It is by no means a simple game, and the learning curve can be steep.  There are many ways to customize your map/difficulty.  However, once you get your military up to speed and kitted out in steel armor you are pretty tough to kill outside of absurd difficulty curves.   Endgame is growing, new additions each update.Added as of release day:Still a great game, mod support has arrived and the potential is endless at this point.			"

								An excellent game that at this point in time (the writing of this review) is still being improved on frequently.  If you're a Dwarf Fortress fan, this game is basically a stream-lined version with significantly better graphics.  It is simpler, with less actual content, though still a very well done and entertaining game in its own right.For those who are not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, this game is basically a combination of a city-builder, roguelike, and strategy, though that may be oversimplifying it a bit.  You start with a small band of gnomes and with them you construct homes, workshops, pastures, and more while making sure that they have the neccessities to stay alive and happy.  As they work their skills pertaining to that job will improve, whether they are farming or killing invading goblins.I highly recommend this game and consider it a must for any who enjoy this genre.

								Dwarf Fortress light. That is how most people explain Gnomoria and I can't disagree. It's more accessible and easier to manage than DF, it already looks better with no need for mods, it's a similar principle without the headache and massive learning curve. Where as DF takes a very long time to master and is ultimately worth while, Gnomoria fits into that gap between a game that wants to be as good and deep as DF but for more casual players, or, a wider audience.I enjoyed this so much that I made 2 Gnome forts. My first was eaten from the inside by giant bugs I couldn't stop. My second is still a work in progress some 30 hours in. It's a fun game, it's time absorbing and micro management heaven.			"

												This game is way to hard to learn.  It's difficult after you learn but it's fun.  I played a lot of this game.  Prolly not as much as the games says because I tend to leave games on overnight idling.  There's a lot of fun while you're learning how to play.  It's lots of fun to build a great fort and hone you game.  All that said, the dev did for whatever reason give up on the game.  The hopes for this game were prolly always out of reach but there's not really enough different types of baddies to fight.  Apples and oranges are the same thing in this game!  Yes, the iconic comparison to show how different things are are actually the same thing in this game.  The spawning of some of them is nonsensical.I can look passed all that and recommend you get this game on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								Highly addictive and highly playable, even in the unfinished state.  This game has been described as ""Dwarf Fortress Light with a twist"", which is... honestly really accurate.  If you've ever wanted to try DF, but couldn't get past the ASCII, then this is a good way to start.  That said, it still doesn't hold your hand by any measure.  In fact, since it tries to be more ""gamey"" than DF's bent towards ""realism"", it can actually be somewhat harder to start, since there's a real penalty to just walling yourself off, and you can't just go with pure traps and crossbows behind fortifications from day 1.  For those of you that don't play Dwarf Fortress, the nature of this game is that it just plunks you down smack in the middle of some randomly-generated grassy field with no particular instruction but to try not to starve.  Dash for the tutorials/guides/Let's Play now.  If you want to live, you better be planting some wheat, pronto, and it's not a bad idea to do a little foraging and deforestation, while your miners dig a ditch around your encampment and burrow into some hills to set up a little cave to huddle in.  If you find some stone, congrats, you can make a ""crude workshop"", which bootstraps your economy from pounding rocks together to having a couple basic workshops like the sawmill and carpenter to finally getting basically one of every workshop in the list as you can find the materials it takes to make them, and have the space to squirrel them away.  After that, goblins come to kill you, so hopefully, you created a military and trained it, or you die.  You didn't? Oh, well, it's your fault for not taking time out to train your troops, rather than using their labor to farm to survive the coming Winter.That said, it's not THAT hard, and there are difficulty sliders, but it's not a walk in the park, and there's basically nothing there to tell you when things are about to go seriously wrong.  (Kingdom Wealth, determined by what goods you produce, brings stronger enemies, and at 30k wealth, which is VERY easy to hit, you get very strong enemies starting to spawn in seiges... fanatically keeping wealth down is critical to survive.)  At least you have options to tone down the enemy...The crafting system is also somewhat detailed to a somewhat pointless degree.  There are intermediate steps for many crafting projects that seem redundant.  You can't simply make a torch out of some log you chopped down, you have to first saw the log into a plank, then split the plank into a stick, then turn one stick and one coal into a torch.  Making a shield takes two intermediate products, a shield boss and a shield backing, the shield backing only being used in that one specific recipe, so there's no reason to stockpile them.  Hypothetically, it can make certain projects take longer, but why not just make specific workshops slower to compensate?  It can wind up with clutter, both on the map, and in the menus.  There is a significantly drop in variety from Dwarf Fortress, but they do at least make the individual monsters, creatures, and plantlife mostly unique.  Goblins attack based upon kingdom worth.  Mants (giant ants) attack for food. Golems are created inside your mines when you don't clean up your mine debris. Skeletons, zombies, and beetles are found in unlit deep mines.  That said, there's definite room to grow here.  The game seems mostly focused upon the survival aspects, so the game is more based upon offering harder and harder fights at this moment than DF does.  However, it is not (yet) as sophisticated when it comes to engineering/physics exploits, or the capacity to create a compelling story.  Dwarf Fortress is such a great game because it allows for drastically different playstyles, from the challenge of modded super-invaders to crazy terraforming to creating a narrative from randomly generated characters.  The challenge is here, but the story is missing.  Gnomes differ only in what skills they have power-pumped so far, and there's no sense of a world beyond the boundaries on your play map.  In total, it's more akin to what Dwarf Fortress was back in the 2D era, where it had more obviously ""gamey"" elements, and a clear sense of progression when you cleared obstacles like chasms that spit out tougher monsters as you progressed, but rewarded you with better ores to build weapons.  DF has gone on to be more a ""Performance Art Project"" about being a simulation, while Gnomoria tries more to be a game with a difficulty curve.  If you want to have challenging fights and a sense of progression, Gnomoria has what you're looking for.  It's yet to even start on the epic world-building that DF has, so if you're more into playing a game to grow attached to some of the characters or see a story play out or play dollhouse or pretty princess dress-up, it's not there yet.  It has yet to even offer any terrain but grassy hills...			"

												Gnomoria was a “best effort” at making a more easily accessible clone of Dwarf Fortress that unfortunately falls flat on its face due to lack of developer support and the clunky isometric view that makes doing things like building vertical stair columns really awkward. It’s hard to argue in favor of this game when alternatively, you could go download Dwarf Fortress with a tile set for free and just watch a few tutorial videos to learn the ropes.			"

												Ever heard of a little game called Dwarf Fortress? It cast a long shadow for a one-man ASCII project, but if you could get past the atrocious interface it was a bewilderingly deep fantasy sim. Unique projects like that tend to attract imitators, and that's where we get Gnomoria from. But don't write that off as a bad thing just yet, because there's plenty of room to fiddle with the original formula.Gnomoria plops you in the middle of the wilderness with a band of eight stubby settlers and a few supplies. From this humble beginning it's up to you to help your little friends find food, shelter, and purpose in life. There are extensive commands to have them effect change in the world around them, including numerous digging options, room designations, workshop placements, and foraging orders. You might notice there are no direct movement or action commands, and that's because everything in this style of sim is treated like an open order. When you mark walls to be tunneled through, one of your gnomes that can mine and has nothing better to do will scoot over and start tunneling for you.You have further control over the order system by assigning jobs to your petite populace. There are several roles like Woodsman and Miner that can be further customized with granular tasks like ""hauling wood"" or ""stonecarving"", giving you full control over the workday. Of course, your gnomes will wander off to find food or drink or catch a nap if their needs persist, but they tend to be diligent enough in their tasks to not cause any headaches.What WILL cause you headaches is the steep learning curve in Gnomoria. I know all of this sounds simple thus far, but the amount of production systems to come to grips with is staggering. The number of workshops alone is utterly gobsmacking, including professions like bone carving and weaving. Production chains can be frustratingly complex, and the best example of this is making a single bed. A bed is made from a frame and a mattress at a carpentry workshop. The frame is made from planks cut at the sawmill from logs felled outside. The mattress is made from cloth woven by your tailor, using cotton grown on a farm and a bone needle from your bone carver obtained by slaughtering animals. Thus to make a single bed, you need four different workshops processing goods from forests, farms, and livestock.There are helpful tooltips that will explain where to get component materials, at least, and if you have all the workshops set up then materials will be auto-queued when ordering a finished product. Little quality of life features like this help make Gnomoria easier to come to grips with, but it's still very much a game that requires a wiki. A tutorial walking you through the foundations of production would be a godsend, and it's a shame that will likely never happen.You'll run into other difficulties like trying to dig stairs and ramps in the chunky isometric interface, or rooms not functioning and not really getting any feedback why. However, I maintain that there's enough charm and variety to keep you pushing through the rough spots. You are given impressive reign to tunnel and build as you see fit, and sprawling underground kingdoms are not out of the question. It never quite reaches the bar set by Dwarf Fortress, as you don't have a wider world to explore past your immediate map and your gnomes don't have the psychotically detailed personalities of DF inhabitants, but the accessibility goes a long way towards balancing that out. Gnomoria makes a great entry point for this particular brand of ultra-detailed sim, with enough features and polish to keep you digging for hours.			"

												At some point in the past I binge played Dwarf Fortress, enjoying the experience as far as the interface and graphics would allow. Seeing Gnomoria I had high hopes that this would be more or less the same game but with a more tolerable interface and graphics.Starting out, the game seemed solid. The interface is better, if still far from perfect, the graphics are tolerable and everything seemed fine at first.Similar to Dwarf Fortress you will fail a couple of times before you get the balance and learn what to build in which order. Pretty soon you realize that the game is a lot shallower than Dwarf Fortress however (for better and worse). Less to build, less to manage, less “to do”.This would be an okay game with a potential for many hours’ enjoyment, if it was not for the HORRIBLE PERFORMANCE BUGS. The developers have failed at the implementation of the AI/pathfinding to the point where a game with as few as 20 dwarfs/gnomes can become unplayable even on high end hardware. Prepare to lose your colony to the “performance death” (e.g. if you happen to block the path of attackers or your dwarfs) long before you reach the “end game”. The UI becomes less responsive and over a few minutes the game slows to a freeze. No error message or crash, just a freeze that cannot be avoided or recovered.  Do not get me wrong, there are plenty of crashes too, but those are recoverable. But once your colony has started to freeze, you can only start over. Until it happens again.Do not waste your time on this game. It will only bring you frustration and disappointment. What a shame./DeAurion			"

												Can't believe I didn't recommend it yet. The game was finally released and I should have wrote something a long time ago.15€ might seem like a high price since it was quite cheaper before, mostly on the early part of development, but there's just so much to do in this game, it lets you get very creative. All the added content, mod support, all the hard work made it even better.Personally I enjoyed it a lot since Dwarf Fortress had a steep learning curve, too steep for me to enjoy (lack of a nice gui didn't help either) but the idea really appealed to me. I tried Towns but as most people know it was abandoned a long time ago, left unfinished.This is the only game so far that combined what I like in this genre and I feel both satisfied with the hours I sinked in it already and the ones I will now that it's released. The development process was great, frequent updates, listening to the community, perfect.Once again, I highly recommend, not only to people who enjoyed dwarf fortress and it's clones but to everyone who likes village management games!

												I last reviewed this game back in 2013 (review now deleted for a release review).  The game had been in Early Access for quite a while.  Even in Early Access, the game was pretty solid.  If you had ever played Dwarf Fortress or any other games along those lines, this game feels a lot like that kind of game.  I had watched new features be added over the years, many new items to craft, new enemies to fight, and watched as those enemies got smarter and gained new tactics as the versions passed.  Now that it is in Version 1.0 and no longer in Early Access, it feels like a solid release.  Don't let the simple graphical style turn you away from this game.  It is fun, and it is worth the purchase if you are into any sort of fan of building, crafting, and keeping your little citizens alive type of game.			"

												My king and half of the army decided to take a nice, long, nap in their shiny armor while goblin raiders killed the other half of the army. Why? Because you can't wake a gnome up by... shaking him or tapping him. You need a bell.Edit: Got a bell. Tried sounding the alarm with out enemies. Took some one three hours to do it, but after no one would leave the great hall to sound all clear after that, so they permanently stayed in the great hall.Full game my♥♥♥♥♥Edit 2: Most jobs don't require tools, so I decided to make almost everybody a permanent soldier and keep weapons and armor on them on all times. Why not? After all, my kingdom was themed after Rome, with all its marble and long noble titles. But apparantly, if everyone is a soldier, then the moment someone sees a bear or lizard minding its own business they'll drop everything and bum♥♥♥♥ charge the thing. Simply because they never bothered to put in a system where you can just avoid certain enemies. Also, I've had seven gnomes die in one battle because half the army left to get a drink.			"

While it doesn't have anywhere near the depth or personality of DF, it does have plenty to keep you entertained, and more on the way. If you've always wanted to get into something like DF, but couldn't because of the complexities of it, Gnomoria is definitely worth a look. Even if you've never heard of DF, if you like simulation games, you should check this one out. Worth every penny and more.			"

								This game is fun enough, but the learning curve is super steep. There's no tutorial, so expect to dig into Youtube and/or the Steam community for how-to videos if you want to do even the most basic of tasks, like making a farm or building a wall. Once you have a handle on things, it's entertaining, but if you want something you can jump right in and play, this is not the game for you.			"

								Yes, welcome to another sandbox. I had this title for a long time and only graced it with my attention recently. Honestly I did not think much of the game but somehow I ended up sinking into it a few days straight and still play it.

The reason for that is... eluding me. So prepare for more of a rant than a well laid-out impression.Gnomoria seems to be done well enough for an Early Access title - what's there is good enough. What's not there, well, is a huge pile of features that hopefully will be added one day. Seems fairly lackluster, right? But somehow Gnomoria plays good enough to drag me in. Building structures and designing layouts in the isometric view is enjoyable if a little limited for now due to the small variety of blocks. The camera can be a little awkward at times but the basic 4-way rotation saves the day in most cases.

The economy is reasonable in terms of the supply chains - there are only a few basic resources to keep track of - making it easy to grasp the basics. But the dozens of ways to process and utilize those resources make for a deeply-interconnected web of processing pathways and making the most of available time and resources can be a challenge, as it should be! Nevertheless, it can also be a god-forsaken nightmare to manage the economy, mostly because of the Gnomes. There is no direct control over the peons and their activities, and even though a task priority system is in place it lacks fine-tuning and control within each task group (e.g. prioritising construction of one building over another). That's made even more difficult by the fact that there are way too few Gnomes to fill all the roles much less do it efficiently. Gnomes only join the settlement at the beginning of each season, their numbers and skills random, and the total population is capped with regards to the total worth of the settlement.

Now it'd be alright if time was not your enemy and Gnomes never died - sadly, neither is true. Unless playing in the Peaceful mode which disables enemies your Gnomes WILL BE KILLED by the dozen each season. Enemies are merciless, spawn with no regards to your wishes or objections, and even on Easy combat difficulty the game is god.damn HARD. What this means is that on top of managing the basic economy with way too few Gnomes at your disposal you still need to keep up the military production (weapons, armors, bandages) and training (which takes Gnomes off other tasks, naturally). Did I mention the game was difficult? No? Well it is!For a brief summary I'll say Gnomoria is a decent sandbox title that has a lot of potential. It is also god.damn hard. If you like sandboxes and/or difficult management sims Gnomoria is a good choice.			"

								First, I would like to confess that I used to pirate games, lots and lots of games. Until one day I came upon Gnomoria, and I pirated it.This was the game that make me feel guilty about myself, about the fact that I had pirated games. This was the game that help me realize how much efforts and love the devs had put into their games, especially the indie devs, and that having their game pirated is not what they deserve.I then uninstall the game and swore to never pirate another game again. Unfortunately although I can afford the game, it was difficult to make direct purchase where I live, so I had a friend gift it to me.With the confession out of the way, now I would like to state the love I have for this game. This is a management game where you ""program"" the gnomes to build an empire of your own. That alone in this game is challenging enough and offers huge replay value, the enemies are just icing on the cake IMO.When I said ""program"", I really mean it. You don't control the gnomes. You can't even if you want to. The game has a special programming language of its own, which unfortunately still has no official tutorial yet, that you have to learn. Learning takes time, and during that time, your gnomes will die, and die, and die, and die... As soon as you figure out how to use the language, everything becomes much more easier and you will see your gnomes ""operate"" as you however you wish. There might be flaws in your programming, which you could only see the results of it, and when you do, you have to dig through all of your codings to find that little tiny error. It is frustrating, yet very satisfying when you found it.The results of the errors might be manageable, however that is usually not the case. The thing is that the game is really unforgiving. The time you realize that there are flaws in your programming usually is when your gnomes are starving with crops not growing in the winter, or when your gnomes are dying of thirst and you are playing on a map with no water, or when your gnomes are being bitten and clubbed to death by angrily goblins, ogres and mants while your are busy decorating your great hall... and there goes your empire.And that is only the very basis of the game, which IMO already worth the price you paid for it. There are many more advanced mechanics in this game such as diplomacy, biting, trading, biting, gnome stats, biting, perks, biting, power and traps, biting, professions, biting... did I mention biting? Yes, there will be a lot of biting. And the fact that you can CUSTOMIZE ALMOST EVERYTHING SINGLE THING, which is my favorite aspect, brings the game onto a whole new level once you have mastered it.I've spent more than 100 hrs on Steam and many more in offline mode, which is almost all of my free time ever since I discover this gem.tl;dr. This is Minecraft in a much larger scale, with the same level or even more detailed micro management.Plus you can craft pet rocks.			"

												Gnomoria suffers from two major problems. 1) There are better free games (albeit more complex and less ""pretty"") that it fails to live up to, and 2) It suffers from a very common problem that games that have very long, paid ""early access"" phases. By the tiem they leave early access (and some never do) they often have LESS features than if they would have had a shorter, free closed beta process.  This game looks decent, and feels like it has potential, but that potential is not lived up to.  There are so many things I feel should have been in here - actually FEEL like they are the logical next micro-step - but are not there. Mechanisms are a great example of them.And finally I believe price always have to play into decisions to buy a game regardless of how good or bad it is.  Bottom line is that I feel like I wasted too much money on this purchase.			"

As such I cannot reccommend this game despite my enjoyment.  I expect that the minimum of content will be modded into the game with the workshop however the number and frequency of bugs make this game frustrating to play for any length of time.

												HUGE downside: NO TUTORIALI haven't played very long yet, to be honest, but the reason for this is that there is no tutorial. I enjoy playing games like this, but something I find that completely ruins a game like this for me is the complete lack of tutorial. I can get into a game but I am not the type who can just figure things out on my own. Even just a basic ""Here's how you build things, these keys do this, here's the more in depth guide"" would be nice. There is no explanation for what each function does, not even just a short blip when you hover over it. I am aware that there are player made guides, and them seem nice, but it is rather absurd to me that there isn't some form of tutorial on this. And from the sound of things, the dev is never touching the game again, which I find disappointing,			"

								Gnomoria is a game for the people who want to play Minecraft in a RTS setting. Its like an easier Dwarf Fortress, but with graphics. Even so, its by no means easy, just easier. Your first colony will die, and so will your second, and probably your third. But each time its something different, something that was just out of balance this time, but wasn't last time. But you start again, because its not about the destination, its about the journey. Plus you get to complain to all your friends who have no idea what is going on about how your entire colony was overrun by a zombie infection, or starved to death in the dead of winter, or was obliterated by a swarm of Mants. And then next time, you won't that mistake. Gnomoria is easily one of the best purchases I've ever made.			"

								Gnomoria is an isometric civilization builder. It is clear that Gnomoria is heavily influenced by (because saying 'steals from' is frowned upon) the incredibly popular but also incredibly difficult and intimidating game Dwarf Fortress (which I also love) but makes it more user-friendly and forgiving.The game can be both brutally punishing and immensely rewarding. Playing your first game will end in inevitable death, probably during the first enemy invasion or your first winter. It is to be expected. As you gradually push further and further with each new civilization you found, you become more attuned to the importance of certain resources and the nuance of city design. Finding ways to optimize building and planning are not taught to you by the game, but learned through bloody trial-and-error. Six or seven games, you'll find your stockpiles bursting before the start of your first winter and the initial goblin invasion cute at best.Gnomoria is a game where you need to be willing to fail (and fail hard), but also be ready—perhaps even eager—to try again. You'll reach a point where all of your gnomes have tasted delicious goblin sausage and are waiting, steel armor and swords gleaming in the summer sun, sweating with anticipation at the next attack, ready for their next meal to charge into battle with them like the little monsters they are.I should point out that your gnomes are the monsters in the scenario, not the goblins, and you will be proud of them for it.

								If the idea behind Dwarf Fortress ever appealed to you but the ASCII graphics were a turn-off, then this is the game for you. There are still many differences between the two games, namely that Gnomoria doesn't quite have the same level of content that Dwarf Fortress offers, but then Gnomoria is also still in early access and still recieving updates.  If you're not aware of what either of the above games are, you are essentially put in charge of a group of gnomes and must see to their survival by building a settlement.  Instead of controlling things directly, you assign tasks and the appropriate workers carry them out.  The entire thing plays out as a sort of checklist: You want this, so to get this you must make that which requires the other thing.  Because of this, the game starts out a bit slow but it definitely picks up later on once all the workshops are set up.  Now, I've mentioned Dwarf Fortress several times which may seem a bit unfair to just compare Gnomoria to another game, but the style of gameplay is exactly the same.  Aside from the difference in graphics, Gnomoria definitely improves on what Dwarf Fortress lacked in approachability.  The UI is a big improvement and makes things very easy to understand due to working off of lists and menus as opposed to exclusively hotkeys.  Gnomoria still has a bit of a ways to go to be considered ""approachable"", however due to the lack of a tutorial of any kind but as I said previously the basics should be easy enough to understand for a new player if they take the time to skim through the different menus.  Overall I have to say I really do like Gnomoria for giving an old favorite game of mine a bit of spit and polish.  I'd recommend it to any fans of city-builders. Especially those that love heavy resource management.			"

With bi-weekly updates, I can see this game getting a lot of content, and I'm really excited for it.BYE IT NAOW.			"

I love it, the ability to reshape the land to your liking is grand, and if that wasn't great enough, they made an option to input your own seed, and create your own world, this option gives me unlimited possibilities, inside the world, you control a group of gnomes, who can create absolute wonders for you, starting from making holes in the earth and chopping down trees, to building the largest fortress in Gnomoria, anything and everything is possible, you just need to know where to start.10/10			"

								Gnomes.  Everywhere, gnomes.  This game is frankly amazing for an early access product.  It has a rather solid development rate and offers up so much content for a management style game.  Learning the ropes is a daunting task but an investment in reading through in-game information is all you need to get started...and that's simply part of why this game holds its own so well.  I've invested over a hundred hours in this game at time of posting and I'm liable to invest a hundred more.  The frustrations of the game's innate challenges only seek to spur me on and drive me to build my kingdoms bigger and better.  I can't promise you so many hours of fun, but if this style of game is your bag then the $8 price won't break your wallet.			"

								Horrendously addictive. The early access status shows, but it's not so prolifically pre-alpha as some games that dare to charge you money. While somewhat difficult to start with as you figure out what's going on, it’s not overly complicated. This has what Anno2070 lacks. Soul. Every gnome counts and you’ll find yourself grimacing as the limp body of yet another fallen gnome civilian, viciously slain by goblins, is carried away by his comrades. Your rag tag band of little survivors soldier on with missing eyes, and legs. Scarred and worn, often collapsing of exhaustion, they build on; improving defences and economy so that no further comrades fall victim to the bleak winter where nothing grows, or the vicious mountain bears waiting to pounce on unsuspecting apple pickers.

								I'm on the fence whether I should recommend this game or not. On one hand, i've gotten a decent 20 hours or so of actual play time out of it. On the other hand, I've completely discarded it and returned to Dwarf Fortress, which is free.I suppose I will recommend it based on the fact that it is decently enjoyable. For me the game was painfully easy to learn and master, which is the only real issue I have with it. There is no real end game. Once you have a sizeable fortress and a decent number of gnomes, all manner of goblins, ogres, beetles, and skeletons will become trivial.I suppose for 8$, 20 hours is acceptable. Keep in mind that I love this type of game, and have sunk hundreds of hours into games such as Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, Majesty, The Guild 2, etc. However, I loathe Minecraft which has a similar draw of ""make structures that look pretty."" So if you enjoy games like that, you may find more appeal in this one after you've conquered the challenges it presents.			"

								Casual version of Dwarf Fortress that seems to lack some of the finer mechanics. I feel like there needs to be a triple speed function instead of just normal and 2x. Your gnomes won't really think of using other workshops if you build them after starting an order and they usually try to make everything out of wood. The mason shop will sit empty as they furiously use one carpenter bench to fill out an order for 8 chairs and tables. The UI is pretty good, only thing that bothered me was you can't right click for orders when you're highlighting a stockpile. Combat is alright but you have to manually access the event logs to read the fight details in a tiny window. Overall a pretty solid game if you can't get into DF because of its interface.			"

You edit most of the ruleset when creating your own map, down to small details. You can play with hard monsters, normal foes, you can play with only wildlife or simply peaceful with no one disturbing you. You can  select world properties, tall mountains, lots of lakes, flat land, rich of ore or dry of resources. You decide how to play it. And with a fantastic style art and classic 8bit music, you really can't go wrong. I love this game, and it only keep getting better and better.

								Gnomoria is a surprisingly fun and addictive game. If you've ever been curious about Dwarf Fortress, but were intimidated by the lack of UI and graphics, Gnomoria is a fantastic game to jump into. Orders you give to your gnomes will be followed according to the guidelines you set. You do not directly control them, but you affect how they behave by determining the gnome's professions, priorities,  and other parameters you impose. It becomes an extremely fun balancing act of figuring out exactly how to acheive true efficiency while also struggling to plan ahead. The more expansive and 'worthy' your empire becomes, the greater dangers arrive to destroy it. It takes hours to finally feel like you've gotten a foothold in the world you've generated, but when you do, you feel a great sense of pride in what your tiny gnome society has accomplished. The only gripes I would have would be the lack of variety in environments as well as the flora and fauna. New biomes as well as new animals and trees would make this game way more replayable. Also, this game has no form of tutorial so the learning curve is quite steep. It took me 3 different restarts before I fully understood the importance of key aspects of the game like action priorities, training a strong military, and proper item storage to name a few. The wiki and video tutorials should definitely be used when first starting off. Beyond that, the game is definitely worth the eight dollar inevestment and is worth your time. If you've ever been inquisitive about these types of strategy games, Gnomoria is a charming and enjoyable place to start.			"

The developer is really working to make a spectacular game.It's horrifying to watch goblins and two-headed ogres stomp through your entire army, only to bleed to death, and you survived with two gnomes. But it's so gratifying to see all the new recruits so you can fix the mistakes and try again.This game made me interested in trying Dwarf Fortress. This game makes me wish Dwarf Fortress was Gnomoria. I can't wait to see how far along Gnomoria goes. I'll be watching the entire time.			"

								This the best version of what I'd call an ""Accessible Dwarf Fortress"".Pros:   Relatively easy to pick up and learn.  The wiki helps.  In depth terrain generation controls  Fairly intuitive controls (could be better, but far better than some that come to mind)  Very nice isometric graphicsCons:  This game (especially early on) has a lot of waiting, but that sort of comes with this genre of games.  The fastest you can move time forward is 2x speed.  Music is repetitive.  Some sounds can be particularly jarring or otherwise seem to clash with the game's atmosphere.  No combat animations.  Unless you pause the game very frequently during fighting to check the gnomes' health it can be difficult to tell if a battle between your gnomes and an enemy is going poorly or not.For all the DF-likes I've seen on Steam, this one is the best.

								Honey Badger slaughtered half of my population. 11/10.But in all seriousness, it's a fun game.The amount of options you have before you as far as create and manipulate is wide and varied. The controls are good (the U.I. is a little clunky, but very workable). It's an all-around fun, challenging, frustrating experience that I'm already hooked on.The only issue is a few minor problems with actions being performed in the order you want them or some of your commands being ignored, but most of these can easily be resolved.I would highly recommend that people that enjoy games like minecraft or terraria and are interested in a top-down god-game with a similar feel try this game out. Just make sure you look over a few tutorials and have the wiki handy.			"

								Casual version of Dwarf Fortress that seems to lack some of the finer mechanics. I feel like there needs to be a triple speed function instead of just normal and 2x. Your gnomes won't really think of using other workshops if you build them after starting an order and they usually try to make everything out of wood. The mason shop will sit empty as they furiously use one carpenter bench to fill out an order for 8 chairs and tables. The UI is pretty good, only thing that bothered me was you can't right click for orders when you're highlighting a stockpile. Combat is alright but you have to manually access the event logs to read the fight details in a tiny window. Overall a pretty solid game if you can't get into DF because of its interface.			"

								Do YOU enjoy planning massive and well thought out underground structures and then watching the people supposed to be buliding them instead hauling dirt back and forth?Do YOU enjoy building a hospital only to find out that your gnomes are all hemophiliacs and don't have any bandages and the only way they can get them is if they make bolts of cloths and then get A TAILOR to ♥♥♥♥ing cut them up all special like and THAT THERE IS NO POINT IN HAVING A HOSPITAL?Well this is the game for you ♥♥♥♥nuts, this is the game for you.You can attempt to light up an area you've just mined to stop golem from spawning and then have the gnomes instead HAUL DIRT AND STONE BACK AND FORTH FOR DAYS AND WHEN THEY FINALLY GET TO IT, IT TAKES AS LONG TO BUILD ONE TORCH AS IT DOES TO MAKE A CABINET.Ok but to be serious, this game is basically low tech dwarf fortress with a VERY tolerable GUI.6/10 in comparrison to dwarf fortress, 7/10 just by itself.

								So, starting with the obvious: you might heard or know of another game called Dwarf Fortress. This is indeed very similar, yet it's very worth your time in its own. Think of this as DF a hundred times more relaxed and less complex, but a thousand times prettier. I would call it a friendlier Dwarf Fortress.Now, if you really don't know anything about either game, this is a management / sandbox game. You start with a crew of settler gnomes, and that's pretty much it; you're thrown into the wild and after that it depends on you; these gnomes can and will use materials around them at your command, build structures as complex as you can imagine, fight your battles and of course, deplete your alcohol and foods. Doing these simple things plus all the intrincate delicacies will take most of your time, and as you expect from any good game... you won't know how much time you have sunk in here.10/10 "

								UPDATE: With Dwarf fortress newest release 42.05, it really blows Gnomoria out of the water in terms of depth. Still recommended, just less so. I've probably spent 2-3 times the hours played in Dwarf fortress than Gnomoria since I last wrote the Gnomoria review, so I definitely prefer DF.If you loved Dwarf Fortress, but wish it was just a little easier on the interface and the eyes, look no further than Gnomoria. Gnomoria vs. Dwarf Fortress Comparison: Interface: Average versus Horrible. Graphics: Average versus Horrible. Overall Depth: Good versus Amazing. Combat Depth: Average versus Great (Upgraded DF's combat depth due to recent release that have mercenaries and more usable war animals). Mechanism/Trap Customization: Average versus Amazing Simulation/Realism: Average versus Amazing.Learning Curve: High versus Colossal. (2 hrs versus 12 hrs)Pacing: Superb versus Good. -----Further comment on pacing: Gnomoria imho has amazing pacing, it takes forever to achieve things in Gnomoria, but it doesn't feel that way until you stare at the clock and realize you just lost 5 hours setting up 5 rooms because of the four intervening goblin raids with Ogre support and food shortage. Yet, you were having a blast and didn't notice how much time went by. This sort of time loss never happens to me these days; it says a lot that this game is able to recreate it.			"

												Good concept, everything works well, except that the combat system is garbage. Gnomes run to their deaths at the first sign of ennemies regardless of personal safety. There should be an override action to tell gnomes what to do on an individual basis other than the generic profession checkboxes. SInce Combat is a big part of the game, it should be possible to gather whatever gnomes you wish in groups through a selection box, like say all strategy games out there, and click on an ennemy to attack, or move away to safety, as opposed to the system that is in place now, which is, to say the least, garbage. I'm sure it's possible to code this in such a way that you can put the current automation programming on hold with an override option, and then revert back to automation once satisifed with whatever you wanted to do in the first place. Sadly this is not so. Buy this game if you have nohing better to do, in my opinion it's unfinished and unpolished. I don't think there was a proper update on this in a long while, its a shame because this game has a lot of potential. Is it playable? Yes. Is it fun? For a while, if you dont mind saving a lot and alt tab quitting to exit the game because there's no better way to exit this without saving. For a micromanagement game this fails miserably to satisfy my ocd. It's a shame because the building aspect is actually fun.			"

												I first bought this game in June of 2012 on Desura. I played about 150 hours before I activated my Steam key. Since activating I've played almost 180 hours more. The developer has been diligently churning out regular updates and solid communication for the four years I've owned it. He has listened to the community and truly shows how early access can work well.Gnomoria is one of the greatest base-building games ever. The random start conditions (and extensive options for customized starts) result in a new challenge each time. It's frequently punishing, occassionally frustrating, and consistently fun. Players can enjoy a complex village sim with emergent gameplay that rewards patience and perseverance. There have been many who have described Gnomoria as ""Dwarf Fortress Lite,"" which is not entirely inaccurate, but it's (mostly) modern UI and colorful sprites make it far easier to overcome it's learning curve. It's easily one of the friendliest dwarves building fortresses games out there.I highly recommend Gnomoria.			"

												Just as my two cents, but if you come to this game not loving Dwarf Fortress already this game is most definately a effort in futility. Sure, its buggy. Its not quite complete. Its not as feature rich as dwarf fortress. Its more casual. But its still got that same old Dwarf Fortress heart, and thats honestly what makes it tick.If you just want to walk into this game to see what Dwarf Fortress is about, your going to leave hating this game. Its simply too dense, and the initial curve is a direct brick wall with not a lot of reward. Those of us who've done this before though, this is the casual romp to scratch that itch - with upgraded graphics! "

It's deeply rewarding in the same way Civilisation is, you'll be playing and saying, ""Just one more day."" and before you know it it's 9 AM and you're late for work. The game does throw you to the wolves without any guidance and has a UI that takes some getting used to, but there are numerous ""Starting the game"" tutorials that show you the very basics for you to build on and really make your kingdom yours.

								I recommend this game for those searching for a game similar to DF (and a lot of patience). Among indie games, I find this more polished and fun than others. Recently, I've seen many early access games on managing a town/castle like this but Gnomoria is the one that has basic features implented for now. Gnomoria is also quite challenging, 45 hours of playtime is merely at the stage of grasping the basics of this game. For me, it took 5 hours to understand digging and building, 10 more hours to understand creating items and extra 25 to know I was doing it all wrong. On the other hand, this game is rather unfriendly; no tutorials, no explanation except a little bit of text that can be found in Help menu. Around 30-40 different buttons to utilize, yet without any description on what it does. Some are straight forward, setting up a farm area is one. But other buttons such as Dig Stairs Up and Mine Stairs Down may be a little bit confusing combined with 3D textile map in which tiles overlap each other. For those who likes to rage quit or play very casually (playing most games on normal or easy difficulty), Gnomoria is not recommended.			"

I particularly like the balance between building and protection of your community.  Plus as an early access game, new things are added every so often. 3 favorite things about it:-Scratches that survival/fortress building itch-Simple to use user interface that allows complex building combinations-Management is hands on, but not overly burdensome.3 complaints/wishes -Its too easy to survive by just walling yourself in.  AI needs a way to get through your walls.-More building materials and building styles would be nice...add diversity to what you can build.-More variability to Gnome personalities, they are all a bit one dimensional.Overall I recommend this game!

								This is one of the few Early Access games I've heard of or played that is actually updated regularly. Before the beta phase, patches were distributed once a week with most weeks including new features and items that added to the depth of the title.I've usually heard Gnomoria described as ""Dwarf Fortress Lite"", and that would be a correct description in most cases. There are still some missing features that DF has over Gnomoria, like behavior and moods, but the developer has stated that he is currently working on including those behaviors into the game at some point.Overall though, I've had much more fun with Gnomoria than I have with DF due to the easy interface and the challenge it provides without having to learn the horrific controls and hotkeys in DF. All Gnomoria needs is some fleshing out and it will be an amazing management sim.			"

								I've been playing Gnomoria for a while now and it's the game I keep coming back to.  Regular updates and very fun content give good replay value and once you learn the mechanics, starting over after a wild honey badger dismembers your colony, or when that first goblin turns out to be a kung fu master, is a lot easier.I've been burned ALOT by early access games that have gotten abandoned, are too buggy to play, or that promise a lot of great things that you find are not in the game yet when you buy it.  Gnomoria has delivered in spades on what was promised and remains one of the best early access titles that I have purchased.  Well worth the price of admission!  8 bucks, are you kidding me,  SOLD!If you liked Dwarf Fortress style games, but are looking for something that is more approchable without the vertical learning curve of DF, then this would be a good experience for you.  If you already are familiar with Dwarf Fortress, then most of the mechanics will be immediatly familiar.  And if you've never tried either this is definately a good starting point, though read some guides.Great job RoboBob!			"

In the fall of the second year, my strongest warrior sacrificed herself to fend off an first-sighted Mant, after the battle she sustained her wound for at least 2 hours, slowly bleeding out without the care of the nurse, which I later blamed for her death, since she refused to treat her (R.I.P Pixel, the greatest warrior there ever was).On the sides of our mountains, there are fields which possess strawberries, cotton, and wheat, which provides my people their needs all year long, fill the storehouse to the brim with food and cloth, also fill everyone's room with a bed. A nearby mountain has been turned into a mine, where we mine for copper and metal to suit our soldiers at arms with good equipment such as armor and weapons, which allows to them to face off against the Goblins and Wildlife. Our Soldiers are our pride and strength, making Tiera an strong nation, They train daily at the Training grounds in hope of being as great as Pixel, who killed 10 goblins, 2 honey badgers, and a Dirt golem but was sadly killed by a mant and a careless nurse.This Kingdom still lives on in these lands to this day, which may someday conquer over all foes who challenges it as well as the land of the Severed land merchant kingdom and the Goblin kingdom. ""May Tiera be the mightiest kingdom that ever stood, Coraina's trade will never beat it's strength of two thousand soldiers"" - King Jake Windti of Jakltina from Tretogo Mercenaries. Game 9/10, Story by Artin S. Kanell (EvilGuanXing), a boy with dreams of making games.			"

								Finally, DF with easy controls and appealing visuals. Well, not yet. Though the game is pretty good, but it has a reeeeeeeaaaally long way to catch up with DF in depth. Main problem i have at the moment is complete lack of control of your gnomes (except military, you have some options to change their behaviour), they WILL try to grab everything they see to stockpile even though it's dangerous, they WILL try to rearm that trap right under the ogre, etc.Tl;dr: It's not DF (yet?), it's early access, don't expect too much and have FUN.

								Great little village/kingdom management game inspired by Dwarf Fortress and several other games.  If, like me, you loved DF but found it a bit too complicated, then Gnomoria's definitely worth a shot.  For an Early Access game, it's got a lot of stuff to play with.  There's plenty of content to keep you entertained for quite some time, and more is added on a regular basis.  There are plenty of options to customize the game to your liking, and mods are also available.If you're not too familiar with this type of game, I strongly recommend trying the demo first.  Gnomoria is definitely not for everyone, especially those who expect to be able to jump right in without doing some reading first.  The demo is available at gnomoria.com.			"

Watching your gnomes go about there buisness in a cave/town that you sketched and they made, its a different feeling than just you doing it. The goblins are aggravating but the combat logs always give me a laugh. *Pro-Tip* Dont fight Monitor Lizards without lots of bandages and proper armor, i've lost to many gnomes to the bane that is unstoppible bleeding.

								I grabbed this during a Steam sale a few months ago and have been playing it since.  For what is still classified as an ""incomplete"" game, you are getting a stable and polished product.  Sure, there are some aspects that still need to be further expanded, but the developer adds new content on a regular consistent basis and this scratches almost all the itches Dwarf Fortress does in a far better graphical and UI environment.  Even if it never is finished, I've certainly gotten more out of it than most games I've ever played - just look at my hours on record and then look at the price!  If you get 1/4 of the fun out it I have, then you are still coming out way ahead.  Just buy it now.			"

								 GNOMORIA is great. Is a DWARF FORTRESS with better graphics, less events, and easier to learn.That said, it´s EASIER TO LEARN THAN DWARF FORTRESS, not EASY... expect a challenge: you WILL have to figure out how things work, and until you do you will be beaten senseless by goblin hordes. After you fail misaribly a few times (because you will), you´ll start to work on better strategies that WILL defeat entire hordes of goblins without loosing even one Gnome: building and testing floor traps with a 10 level fall, building pistols and ammo, fully steel armored gnomes in front to hold enemies, statue building for trading, specializing a Gnome in Tinkering only to have access to inventions, duplicating farm groves... not for the weak willed!

												Gnomoria is a game where you control little gnomes and build your town. Its a management game. Pure and simple. However, the more tech you research, the more you can end up killing yourself. For instance, I made a pitfall trap that killed all invaders that came to attack. However, I was careless, was not paying attention, and ended up killing all of my gnomes cause i didnt turn it off. Another time, I wasnt careful with lighting up the caves and I was overrun by the mobs that live below the surface of the earth. This game is both fun and unforgiving. 10/10 would send my gnomes to death by hole in the ground again.			"

If you're up for a challenging city/town builder similar to Dwarf Fortress, this is the game for you.There were many times I had encountered bugs that rendered the game unplayable, such as Gnomes being persistently idle and refusing to work, but there are usually workarounds to these.PROS: - Addicting once you get the hang of it- Challenging gameplay- Catchy soundtrackCONS: - AI pathing/priority/combat mechanics still need to be improved- It is only a matter of time before you encounter some sort of bug- No tutorial (or tooltips/info)			"

								Gnomoria is literally perfect. I have played ~80 hours of Dwarf Fortress and loved it, but Gnomovia is a perfect mix of DF and GUI. I think I have dumped more hours into Gnomoria than any other single game in the last year or so (other than perhaps Minecraft).The price is honestly too low - and updates are still rolling in. This is an instant classic. I should also mention that the music is 10/10 super good.			"

								BLOODY AMAZING!! SO addicted to this game right now. It's like Dwarf Fortress but sooooo much better because you can SEE everything and everything actually makes sense and Gnomes are more user friendly. If you haven't played a Fortress-like game it's gonna take a while and a bit of wiki'ing to grasp, but the challenge is worth it. I seriously cannot put this game down, and the best part of all, it's cheap, and only in Alpha! I haven't been addicted like this in a LOOOOONG time! GET! THIS! GAME!!!			"

								Highly enjoyable, very developed internal economy with the various shops and resources, excellent backwards-compatibility as each update rolls out, too. I haven't had to restart my savegame in a while. Widely adjustable difficulty from zero enemies up to punishing yourself. Excellent interface with fully customizable keybinds. Well-polished visual elements, excellent notification system and a great customizable ""tracked items"" list in the display.In short, the massive leap forward Towns was over Dwarf Fortress was a small step compared to the leap Gnomoria takes forward from Towns.

It's far from perfect, but it has more than enough to provide endless sandboxian entertainment.  Be aware thought that the game is FINISHED in that the dev has moved on to other things.  He has stated openly that after 1.0 he would be leaving this project.  I have yet to encounter any gamebreaking bugs and the only thing I don't really like is combat.. it seems too difficult. Other than that.. buy it and add it to your sandbox collection. Worth every dollar!!			"

								Gnomoria is a great Game It is one of the Games that you can turn on and play a bit but u can also play it over a long period of time and see how ure kingdom grows and how you establish trade routes with other realms.The pros of the Game are that it is a replayable game and that you can play it actually over a longer period of time on the same map and it isnt like in lets say minecraft that you can achive easily the highest level of tool and whatsoever and the enemys in the Game are Quite ""annoying"" but i have to say in a good way.The cons are that you can easily get addicted to it and play a few hours straight (i played 12h without rly noticing it (i thought i only played a hour or so)). I guess the Game is grate I would give it something like a 9/10I recomend the Game for everyone how wants to see his kingdom rise and who wants to get in an everlasting war against the Goblins ;). "

								I bought this game pretty early on and I have to say this game has infinite replayability. I have clocked more hours on this game than any other I've purchased on Steam. People have claimed this is ""Dwarf Fortress Light"", which is true in one sense, but I feel it's kind of gone off on its own path lately and you can't really compare the two that much anymore. This one is WAY easier to get into whereas DF (despite it's tremendous depth) is hard to start out because it's all in ascii characters and not graphics. I -want- the depth of DF but I'm quite content with an ever developing Gnomoria where it will one day get to that point.			"

								YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME>>>>>I have tried countless Dwarf Fortress style games and none of them come close to Gnomoria's level of detail and fair challenge. There is a learning curve if you dont read guides online, there are times you will completely work yourself into a corner, and there are times you will scratch your head and go ""why isn't this working the way I thought it would."" But everything in this game is built with a reliance on something else. Learning those relationships and how to maximize your productivity is exceptionally fun (in my opinion) especially when the game is so fair. Every time I've lost a gnome, starved out my colony, or dug too deep too quick (you'll see why) I would sit back, cry a little about the last 20 hours that I just burned into the ground, and say ""ok... that's fair... lets try again.""If you've ever sunk 200 turns into Civilization after swearing you'd go to bed this game is no different. ""Just another 10 minutes"" always turns into hours of doing things! Alot of these games have moments of busy work then a sit back and watch factor but I have ALWAYS found something to do with every minute in Gnomoria. I know this might just sound like a gush about the game but I absolutely love this title and the dev is still updating frequently. You owe it to yourself to buy Gnomoria. You owe it to yourself to sink a few months into it. As Shia says: JUST. DO. IT.			"

								Do you like DF but hate DF's UI and graphics?Then Gnomoria is for you.Be warned though, it is a extreme light edition compared to DF and it doesn't seem like the creator will add a lot of complex mechanics and i hope that he doesn't stop adding content anytime soon. I especially miss blood mechanic... for... science purpose.... not to give my colony to drink, which reminds me, there are no seasonal effects other then that you cant grow crops in the winter, i would love to see some ice/snow so that you need a water reservoir and maybe clothes/fires to keep the gnomes warm.Otherwise I love the game, as I'm writing this review i have played 225 hours of gnomoria and will play this game for a long time to come. The game is underpriced so BUY NOW before the developer realises this.Edit;P.s I would like to see offspring so that you don't need to rely on migrations waves			"

Lots of stats for each gnome and ways to make your kingdom grow and prosper the best it possibly can and defend it from the evil goblins and agressive animal life as best as you can. One day you can have a kingdom of 30 gnomes, the next you could have 2, walling them off and keeping them alive as best you can until next season where 20 more gnomes will arrive, completely unaware that they will be just another name in the ""Deceased"" tab by the end of the season.

I love seeing the little dudes run around doing my bidding, and it's especially hilarious if you save the combat logs and read those.Be warned: this game does not hold your hand, so you'll have to either figure things out through trial and error, or look up a guide online to get the basics down. That being said, it's still worth it. Don't be afraid of the 'Early Access'; it's still a robust game that can keep you entertained for hours.

								Now, when a game is ""Abandoned"" by it's developers, many people start to post negative reviews, and I've decied to update mine to adress this point. This game, is worth the money, sure it has a limited tech tree, sure it has some bugs from time to time, sure it has some really cheap deaths and trheats that range from free meat to kindom crushing. But, I came back everytime, and one you figure out you're own style of doing this game, you'll come back too.Why you ask?Because, building your settlement up from spring of year one is always a fun time, especialy if you try and rush bone needles. beause sometimes gnomes are such ♥♥♥♥ing badasses, like one shotting bears with ♥♥♥♥ing beds, or striving though a lost limb to sway the tide in battle and save the colony for another mounth. You'll come back because of the awesome things you can do with the mecanics. You'll come back because the mods are alive and well and offer some sweet changes in game play. But most imporantly of all, you'll come back, because this game is ♥♥♥♥ing FUN!So don't just decide not to buy it because you think it's unfishined, buy it because what's done, is wroth it!			"

								Gnomoria is a great Game It is one of the Games that you can turn on and play a bit but u can also play it over a long period of time and see how ure kingdom grows and how you establish trade routes with other realms.The pros of the Game are that it is a replayable game and that you can play it actually over a longer period of time on the same map and it isnt like in lets say minecraft that you can achive easily the highest level of tool and whatsoever and the enemys in the Game are Quite ""annoying"" but i have to say in a good way.The cons are that you can easily get addicted to it and play a few hours straight (i played 12h without rly noticing it (i thought i only played a hour or so)). I guess the Game is grate I would give it something like a 9/10I recomend the Game for everyone how wants to see his kingdom rise and who wants to get in an everlasting war against the Goblins ;). "

								YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME>>>>>I have tried countless Dwarf Fortress style games and none of them come close to Gnomoria's level of detail and fair challenge. There is a learning curve if you dont read guides online, there are times you will completely work yourself into a corner, and there are times you will scratch your head and go ""why isn't this working the way I thought it would."" But everything in this game is built with a reliance on something else. Learning those relationships and how to maximize your productivity is exceptionally fun (in my opinion) especially when the game is so fair. Every time I've lost a gnome, starved out my colony, or dug too deep too quick (you'll see why) I would sit back, cry a little about the last 20 hours that I just burned into the ground, and say ""ok... that's fair... lets try again.""If you've ever sunk 200 turns into Civilization after swearing you'd go to bed this game is no different. ""Just another 10 minutes"" always turns into hours of doing things! Alot of these games have moments of busy work then a sit back and watch factor but I have ALWAYS found something to do with every minute in Gnomoria. I know this might just sound like a gush about the game but I absolutely love this title and the dev is still updating frequently. You owe it to yourself to buy Gnomoria. You owe it to yourself to sink a few months into it. As Shia says: JUST. DO. IT.			"

								Warning: This game will devour your soul for days on end.  Despite being an Early Access game, it is not only quite well made, but you can prettymuch just run it in the background while you do work.  I think my favorite aspect is just wtaching things slowly take shape in the world.  A fortress, a castle, whatever you dlike really , long as you keep your gnomes fed and healthy. That said, Ive laso gotten quite attached to my settllers.  You should too.  Play Gnomoria! ^^			"

								FINALLY! A game that essentially is Dwarf Fortress without the awfulness of a keyboard-only interface. That's basically it. You'd be surprised how much easier the game is to play with just the simple addition of a GUI and mouse input. A tutuorial would be nice, but DF doesn't have one either. I've only played for a couple hours, but so far this feels like a very close port of DF, but with graphics and a mouse.			"

								Gnomoria seems like a simplistic game by what you read, however It's a bit more complex than that. It's that game in the center of the scale, balancing between Dwarf Fortress and SimTown in difficulty. Aside from that, Gnomoria is a quaint little title, that is decently good. The game (As said by the description in the Shop) Is a game where you manage a small group of Gnomes who've left their past residences to form a new kingdom, and you must play that ""God-like"" Entity and help them thrive in this dangerous new landscape, by giving them orders to designate an area living quarters or Farm and have them construct such. However, the game is a bit stiff in that it's a tad difficult figuring our how to mine at first, as well as finding a source of water and how to stop a Gnome from building somewhere they should not.Overall, Gnomoria is a fine little game, not as good as others of it's genre (It's still in the begining phases) but it is getting there.Originality: 7Mechanics: 6Polish: 6 Rating: 6.3/10Tips for New Gnomes!To mine use the ""Mine Wall"" option under ""Terrain""To stop someone from building a designation where it shouldn't be, use ""Cancel Job""And don't dig further than depth 7. (Spiders will start spawning below 7 and you can find stone in the depth 7.)			"

								Gnomoria is a game in which you start out with a small team of 9 Gnomes and are tasked with giving those Gnomes various jobs with the ultimate goal of turning the wilderness you start off in into a bustling kingdom. As the value of your kingdom increases, you will attract more ""Gnomads"", and gain the attention of other kingdoms, both friendly and hostile. If you don't want to deal with the latter, you can set the difficulty to ""Peaceful"", which eliminates enemy spawns. The game only ends if your kingdom is completely wiped out, or if you get bored and give up. This might sound a bit familiar to some people, as Dwarf Fortress (and Dungeon Keeper, The Settlers, and Anno) was a big inspiration for the game. The developer clearly states this in the FAQ on the game's official website. This game does not have the sheer, unbridled complexity of Dwarf Fortress. It makes up for this by being much more accessible while still having a good amount of depth, and having its own innovations and ways of doing things compared to DF.Now, the game currently lacks a tutorial, so you will need to either spend the first few hours experimenting to get a feel for things, or consult a guide/wiki while you are playing to speed things up. If that's a dealbreaker for you, I'd suggest waiting until the tutorial is actually implemented, whenever that is. That all being said, the game is still more immediately accessible than DF in my opinion due the graphics and simple mouse-based interface. The game also does not have any actual animation for character movement, somewhat true to its inspiration, but I have personally never found this to be an obstacle to my enjoyment. All it means is that the sprites ""jump around"" from one tile to the next rather than spending frames actually animating their arms and legs moving, which actually speeds everything up. There's also only one biome available right now, but there are plans to add some more eventually (the two specifically mentioned in the development roadmap are ""Desert"" and ""Jungle"").The game is under active development, with updates coming fairly regularly with a schedule of one update every 2 weeks (minus the occasional hotfix). New features are added often, and as is often the case with such things new bugs will pop up. That being said, the game is very stable and the vast majority of bugs are a mere annoyance. There's nothing truly gamebreaking to worry about.A common question that comes up on the Steam discussion forums is ""how does this game compare to Towns?"". I have not actually played Towns, but I know enough to at least say that the gimmick of ""attracting Heroes and having them clear out a huge dungeon for you so your citizens can bring up the loot"" is not present in Gnomoria. You have to dig your own mines, and you'll have to organize your own military to deal with the problem if you find yourself encountering monsters while you're doing it.Bottomline: If you're the type of person who is enamored by the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but really just don't want to deal with learning how to wrangle with DF's unintuitive keyboard interface, or if you find DF to be essentially unplayable without throwing a bunch of mods on top of it and just don't want to deal with that, I cannot recommend Gnomoria enough. If you have no idea what Dwarf Fortress even is, but like the concept of the game described at the top of this review, I'd also say it's worth checking out.			"

								Well bloody done.i started this game when it was in early Beta and it was already more pollished than a fully released game. (For example the failures of Citadels and Stronghold 3).   It was perfectly stable, clean and best of all, fun.  This gnome management game has only improved since then.  Gnomoria is a top down, micro management game all about the balance between defence and your economy.  To help describe this game, it may be easier to think of it as a simplified dwarf fortress.  So far Gnomoria has recieved numerous and frequent updates throughout the entiety of its developement.  (As you may have noticed, this fact is quite rare.)Graphics:The graphics in this game are nothing special.  That being said, its simple, 2d and nice to look at for quite some time.  It fits the gameplay and overall feel of the game.  It doesn't become an eyesore after a few hours like a bad minecraft texture pack.  The only real complaint a perfectionist could have with the graphics is the animation of gnomes moving through tiles, But trust me when i say it irrelavent for this type of game.The Gameplay:This is why you play this game.  All the way from the growth rate of trees, to the construction pathways for needed tools and weapons.  The only item that needs work is the settable priority for starage zones and work benches (which the developer has been and continues to work on.)  The core gameplay is all about setting tasks and then the allocation of gnomes to that type of task.  More like running a business than a typical rts.I must advise all new players build a terrain wall around thier settlement and get the basics before managing combat.Strengths.As addictive as minecraft.Once you set up your economy and defences, its quite easy to play whilst watching a movie or anime.Weaknesses:For those who are not patient, do not bother. Completing a task can take days ingame and real time hours.Can be annoying to debug why a specific task is not being completed.Summary:One of the most unique games that i have played in the genre.  Once you get the hang of it, its an excellent game. (just do not expect your first try to do anything other than fail miserably.)I have easily put over 50 hours into this game.  Its amazing to see a game in beta that is already near the top of its genre. "

Early Access Review
								I'd like to start off by saying that I noticed a trend in the negative reviews for this game.  Mostly that nearly all of them have between 4 and 10 negative votes and I'm willing to bet it's the same 4 to 10 petty people who abhore critisism in any form of something they can see only as being unequivicably perfect.  That being said, this game still has some serious faults but considering that it is still in the development phase I think at least most of them are forgivable.VISUAL: Retro, pseudo-3D, 16bit.  I grew up on this kind of game art style so I particularly like it.  It's cheap but effective.  This game is often compared to Terraria but if I had to choose it would be this game.  I like having a small army at my disposal over a singluar character.  The graphics and sprites are probably still being tweaked and after looking at earlier screen shots the game is only getting better in that regard.AUDIO: I like the music, but I'm weird.  I don't like all of the tracks but it's more than one singular song that plays repeatedly so I have to give it that.  I try to keep away from where my Gnomes are working because the sound effects are a bit grating but other than that it has a nice retro feel to it that keeps with the art style.GAMEPLAY:  And now for the meat of the review.  The part of the game that has the most issues but also the most potential.  Let's kick this part off with the elephant in the room.  There is no tutorial for this life sim strategy based game.  There is a good reason for that, the base game is not finished yet.  It's still in development and making a tutorial would take away from getting the game to a finished, balanced, and polished state.  The tutorial will--hopefully--come with the v1.0 update.  Beyond that, there are several guides on YouTube that are easy to find and easy to follow to learn how to play this game.  Even finding older tutorials is enough to give you a basic grasp of the game.The game starts paused.  You need to clear a large area of flat land for farming and pasture.  Start with foraging, then clipping trees, then fell some trees, then replace any clay spots with dirt, and mark off your farms, pastures, and groves.  You also want to dig into the hills and start building your fort.  Designate a small stockpile for soil and stone, and larger stock piles for everything else you need.  You need to start building up your workshops once you get inside.  Start with the crude work bench then find your way through the other workshops until you get to the tailor so you can make beds to sleep on.Here's what the game doesn't tell you and several older guides don't cover:  You need to go into the population menu, pick a Gnome, go to skills, go to Misc Craft, and turn on bone carving.  As far as I have found, this is so far the singular skill that is not immediately attached to any class and has to be manually turned on.  There is NOTHING in the game so far that indicates that this needs to be done or how to do it, but it is crucial to advancing the game.  Once it is turned on, that Gnome should eventually go to the station to make the bone needle.  You will have to wait until at least your first summer to slaughter a yak to get the bones to make the needle but this should give you time to do other things.Once you get into the game, the strategy is fairly straightforward.  Keep enough food and drink on hand for your gnomes, enough wheat straw for your yaks, keep your groves going and your tunnels deep.  Just like Terraria and other digging games, the deeper you go the better materials you find.  There's no story that I've tripped over and the Gnomes have no individuality and don't have relationships.  They work endlessly, new Gnomes finding you over time (apparently linked to your Great Hall in some way) and join your clan.I recommend this game if you can get it rather cheap.  I bought it for $2 and got a few copies for my friends.  I really want to see where this game goes.  The workshops seem to be overflowing and a couple seem over stretched at times but I think that it works.  The longer I played the more I noticed that the characters seem very obsessed with rearranging the dirt in my stock piles until I can find them all and turn them off.  The priorities don't seem to be as effective as they should be.  Even after turning off stock piles and fields there are a list of jobs marked as highest priority that just never get done.  Perhaps it will run more smoothly in a future update.  Until then, if you see this for cheap, add it to your inventory and let it stew.			"

								Steep learning curve for some, but well worth learning. I used to play ""Towns"" which in some senses is about the same... but ""Towns"" lacks a LOT of what this game has to offer.  Especially love the raids of goblins, mants, etc to keep you on your toes. (Giving you don't CAREBEAR a wall on the outside borders to prevent spawning lol) Plus each game has a lot of ability to customize various settings to go from easy, carefree living to tooth and nail blood bath scraping by to survive. Best of all, this game is still under active development and very playable during that time. Each patch normally comes with some pretty good updates to increase and enhance various aspects of the game. Some things I would like to see? # More Kingdoms, with ability to go to war with more than just the Goblins# Ability to send a war party to other kingdoms to raid for supplies, with settings to determine when to pull back so you dont lose all your Gnomes# Ability to incorporate player created modifications to the game to massively expand the creavity of the game#Ability to control gnomes to give direct commands (Toggled option, as some people probably wish to stay with the default roaming gnomes)#MMO Server with kingdoms that you can trade with and go to war against to raid (Far off dream I'm sure, but hey I can dream)There are other things I could think off, but I'll just sit back and enjoy the game while I watch what unfolds in due time. Recommended purchase? Certainly, as long as you are paitent and willing to learn a game that may have a somewhat steep learning curve.			"

								Buy it when it's finished. Already a fun game but let's give the developers a reason to do bugfixes and content updates and enhance performance. It really uses a lot of resources for a game with like max. 7 fps. Lagged on my old laptop with 30+ gnomes. I don't know the exact specs but it ran Borderlands smoothly on mid.+ settings.			"

								Steep learning curve for some, but well worth learning. I used to play ""Towns"" which in some senses is about the same... but ""Towns"" lacks a LOT of what this game has to offer.  Especially love the raids of goblins, mants, etc to keep you on your toes. (Giving you don't CAREBEAR a wall on the outside borders to prevent spawning lol) Plus each game has a lot of ability to customize various settings to go from easy, carefree living to tooth and nail blood bath scraping by to survive. Best of all, this game is still under active development and very playable during that time. Each patch normally comes with some pretty good updates to increase and enhance various aspects of the game. Some things I would like to see? # More Kingdoms, with ability to go to war with more than just the Goblins# Ability to send a war party to other kingdoms to raid for supplies, with settings to determine when to pull back so you dont lose all your Gnomes# Ability to incorporate player created modifications to the game to massively expand the creavity of the game#Ability to control gnomes to give direct commands (Toggled option, as some people probably wish to stay with the default roaming gnomes)#MMO Server with kingdoms that you can trade with and go to war against to raid (Far off dream I'm sure, but hey I can dream)There are other things I could think off, but I'll just sit back and enjoy the game while I watch what unfolds in due time. Recommended purchase? Certainly, as long as you are paitent and willing to learn a game that may have a somewhat steep learning curve.			"

								Having played Towns and a Game of Dwarves, I'd say Gnomoria is probably the best isomorphic town management, digging and building game around right now. It's also still in development (the version number as of right now is 0.9.9, and the next version is expected to be 0.9.10), so I expect it to get even better.There's a lot of charming pixel art to look at, including the gnomes themselves and different kinds of decorative blocks.It imitates Dwarf Fortress's brutal combat with strong armor, limb severing and bleeding, but unlike DF it's actually fine tuned to be fun and balanced.The economic and crafting system is one of the better ones I've seen. I like the additional detail needed various tools in order to build workshops brings, and find it doesn't really increase the complexity of playing the game.It's also relatively easy to setup entirely automated production chains that automatically keep production at maximum and keep going without any further player input. There's clearly been a lot of thought into how the GUI can help the player manage their settlement.My only complaints are the keybindings, I found them a bit counterintuitive. But you can change them, so it's no big deal.			"

								TLDR: If you like sandbox village games heavy on micromanagement - get it!While it does not quite have the complexity of Dwarf Fortess, it is the closest thing I have been able to find so far.  The world mechanics themselves are quite marvellous, but there is no real ""personality"" to the gnomes beyond what you project onto them, you can't see what they are thinking, there are no fun personality conflicts ending in bloodshed.  There are no cats.It takes a little patience to pick up at first, you can count on your first few games ending within a year or two as orcs and/or viscious wild animals kill your sweet little gnomes.But if you push through you'll soon be able to build defenses to withstand these early problems long enough to run into entirely new and exciting ways to end your little gnomes lives.Word of advice - when experimenting with water, it is wise to save the game just in case one of your lovable but none too bright gnomes decides to jump in over their head in order to retrieve something only to find there's no way out and drowns.

												I have mixed feelings about this game. Everytime I play this game i fall in love....then the game tears my heart out and leaves me bleeding on the ground. For the first year everytime I would get a few years in the game would corupt and i would have to start all over. I ended up having to copy my saved file every time i stoped playing. I cant build like want because the gnomes sometimes get stuck for no reasion and will die if job is no changed quick enough. All this should have been fixed asap not waiting months or even years. All in all It's just not worth $14 for the heartbreak. As soon as the dev fixs the bugs and AI I would happly change my recommendation. Just play lazie nuwb pack mod for dwarf fortress its all free.			"

								  This is one of those games you either love or hate.  It has a pretty steep learning curve and getting good enough to survive will take practice and reading a few guides. But it's very satisfying to watch your little village / castle / underground fortress flourish.  In my opinion this game is a little easier then Towns, but much more polished and playable.  I would for sure recommend that you watch a few videos first and check out how it plays because like I said, you either love it or hate it.  I hope you end up loving it like I do, and help these indie devs out!!			"

												Ive played more to the game before i decided to use the steam key and play more to it,  first,  the game is in abandonware state,  even the main website already been decaying since its launch out of alpha or beta...  probably the dev got tired about it as it happens when games drag for years before it is released and lost interest,  probably but thats how it feels when ive seen the same pattern but who knows.   But to talk about the game,  inspired from dwarf fortress but a less or light learning curve,  you build your city over and under the ground,  farm,  craft,  manage and defend from attacks if you set it up,  the game itself is good even so the lack of more features that isnt dependant on mods but depending on the person it might be good and bad,  why?  To what point you will play and then feel ""this is enough""  get tired playing because it wil reach to a point that you get tired of playing the same thing once you explored everything and when i play,  usually is play few months and then theres a large gap were i play again to get my interest renewed.  Is it worth 15 dollars? Depends... maybee not anymore,  get the game when theres a good discount.  The game engine for modding it is very old style probably due to the coding,  the type of modding i used to do back in 1997 when space games used large templates for many objects but here it never evolved to the point that it is very limited instead of evolving to set of vasious separated assets and a script source where you just had to point to the id of the picture and that could have opened the game to better modding			"

												To start, I love this game.  I thoroughly enjoyed the living hell out if it.  There's no tutorial, and things are really confusing at first, but once you figure out how to get things going it really is a blast.  Sure there's a few bugs, but in a game like this you should be saving your game every few minutes anyway.Bugs?  Yes.Will you still get $15 worth of enjoyment out if it?  Yes.People gladly pay that much to go watch a movie in a theater for an hour and a half and get unreasonably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when they don't get 60+ hours of gameplay for something that costs four times as much.That said, the game is unfinished, like many of the other reviews say.  I'm not sure if the original developer got burned out or what, but there are many things that just got dropped on the floor.  After modding was introduced, the website for the game changed, mainly the fact that their original development plan was removed.  This is what they didn't want everyone to see: Development plan[web.archive.org]I'm only recommending this game because I hope people start playing it and the developer realizes he has a gem just waiting to be polished.  It's hard to find enthusiasm about something that everyone just craps on.			"

												I'm happy with my purchase. It's a lot like DF, a lot more accessible, and somewhat less deep, so I will compare this game to DF. It does improve on DF here and there, like with automatons and mechanic limbs. I also found combat to be more game-y, since you regularly get varied opponents with specific strengths and weaknesses, depending on their race and equipment, so you need to balance your single/double handed swords, hammers, shields and crossbows, the materials and qualities they are made of, and how much training your gnomes have at them. All of this is also simulated in DF, but in Gnomoria it affects the strategic choices you have to make a lot more.Core crafting is more interesting as well: for example, beds require a wooden sub-part to be made, and a cloth/wool mattress, each with their respective quality depending on the material used and the skill of the carpenter and tailor that made them. Metallic armor requires cloth padding and metallic weapons require wooden handles.If what you want is gnomes that learn skills over time, crafting quality, material modifiers, digging for metals, training and equipping a varied army; getting it good at different weapons to beat the very distinct kinds of enemies you'll get; starting with wood and stone and then going through bronze and steel; traps, invasions, butchering orcs, smelting their drops, and then laughing at the combat log; trading and amassing wealth, legendary sandwiches and majestic dining rooms, then this game is for you.Regarding the other reviews: There are (in my opinion) very few bugs and nothing game breaking. At least I never encountered a bug that broke my game or put me off from playing it. I paid about 9 bucks for the game a pretty long time ago, and I've personally considered my purchase worthy since version 0.8 or so. I'm not sure what some of the other players were expecting, but during development, the dev was always open about what might or might not make it into the game, what were the priorities and what (few) things might get dropped; and as far as I'm concerned, everything I realistically expected made it into the game, and more. Sure, he could have gone on working on it forever, but the same can be said about every other game.			"

												I will first start out by saying that yes this game is abandonware, but its still a great game. Sure the developer quit on us or died or whatever happened, but I have still logged many hours into this game and I am quite happy with it. Yeah sure it has a few bugs, but nothing I have noticed yet has seemed to be game breaking. A lot of people seem to be comparing it to Rim World saying Rim World is better and not to waste your money on this game. I think that is not true! Yes both are great games and I highly reccomend getting both. It really just depends on your playstile. Gnomoria is more focused on base building and being complex while Rim World doesnt really focus on base building but instead focuses on combat and the social life of your colony, it is also is a much more simple game than Gnomoria. I hope this helped you and thanks for reading! "

Early Access Review
								Gnomoria is, by and large, a surprisingly deep game. Often remarked as Dwarf Fortress Lite, it is a game that puts you in charge of a community of gnomes, and gives you the task of making sure they survive and thrive. Sound easy? It's not. There are many things that need to be managed, and your first few communities are almost guaranteed to die off. The control scheme and menus are at first daunting, but once you figure out the HOW of things, it's surprisingly intuitive (Hint: Right click controls almost everything). But no matter how skilled at controlling the game you become, there will always be new things to learn. From base defense against goblins biting your hearts, to properly lighting your mines so golems don't come out of the deep, there will always be new challenges, and new ways to solve those challenges. As you attempt better structures and more elaborate designs, the enemies will react to your increased worth and start bringing armor, and bigger friends, though you will also attract more gnome migrants (Known as gnomads). So if the controls seem oppressive, don't lose hope. Look up a let's play of the game, watch for a bit, then mimic. You'll quickly figure it out, and have the time of your life.			"

								I've played this game off and on for over a year now, coming back whenever there's a major update (which is surprisingly often) and I absolutely don't regret the $8 I spent on this. It would have been a great value if I'd only played it for ten hours, let alone fifty and counting.			"

								Synopsis: Inspired primarily by Dwarf Fortress (http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), this is an isometric 2D building game where you start with a small group of Gnomes and issue them orders to build, mine, craft, harvest and defend themselves. As you improve their new home, more Gnomes will arrive that you must feed, provide shelter for and issue orders to.I'm really enjoying this game when I play it. I can pause at any time and issue orders, which is a real plus for me because I can use all the time I wish to plan several moves ahead. The pause feature also allows me to play this game as I do other tasks around the house or while at work.Be advised, there are no animations as of the last time I played it. Also, the control interface still needs polish. Once you get used to it it's not too bad, but it's takes some time to achieve that comfort zone.I also have some issue with the 2D terrain where I'm not always sure how terrain on one level will interact with the terrain above and below it, particularly with trying to place/remove dirt and stairs. Might just be me though.Developers are making progress and have not put this one on the back-burner as is happening with too many pre-releases on Steam lately.Usual advice is that you should peruse youtube for as much footage of the game, filtering for the most recent videos for the latest release versions, before you buy. Also try to get it on sale. When it's on sale, it's a no brainer.			"

								This is a regularly updated micro-management type game, similar to dwearf fortress, but with better graphics!  While the interface can be difficult to navigate, and some of the production chains and the workshop system can be a little counter-intuitive, once you have the basics worked out it is an easy game to play.  That is not to say it is an easy game to survive however!  The enemies that spawn are related to your total value, but if you manage this they can be controlled (sort of) easily, or simply play a peaceful kingdom and dont worry!  This is a game for those people who would like to run their own personal kingdom and build things just the way they want, with a developer that regularly improves the game, and i can't recommend it enough!

								Let's get this out of the way. Is Gnomoria a good game? yes. Should you play Gnomoria right now? not unless you're exceptionally talented with city simulation games.In case any person reading this review somehow missed it, as of this review, Gnomoria is still an Early Access game. As such, the game is not feature complete. One of those missing feature is a comprehensive tutorial. That's right, gamers have to learn everything the game have to offer through trial and error. Which I can imagine being a barrier for anyone who lacks experience with this genre. Most of the game's core feature seems to be there already. And my only problem with the game so far is that my control over my gnomes is somewhat looser than I'd like; the game's control revolves around this priority system. Which sounds like you can tell a Gnome what's important and what's not; but the problem seems like either the Gnome doesn't always listen, or the command take quite a few hours (in game time) to take effect. Once I have several wounded combatant bleeding all over the place (which is so ridiculous that it's actually quite ammusing to watches my Gnome nonchalantly going about his business while his arterial spray hastily colored my kindom red like his life depends on it, WHICH IT IS!!!), but even though I hastily push the priority of hospital to the top of priority list for several workers, and made sure someone produced several bandages, those two workers still bleed to death anyway. Another issue I saw so far is the lack of assignment for certain post such as grove, which made it that much harder to micromanage you kingdom. But enough of my complain, let's get down to the pros and cons:Pros:-Visually appealing graphics.-Birds eye view with option to rotate camera and ascend/descend height is the ideal choice for camera control.-Can build structure of any size and shape, then define it's use.-Multiple combination of meterial and product, i.e: can build chair from 4 different type of wood.Cons:-Lacking a proper tutorial.-Background music is present but lacks variety (only classic, and orchestrated).-AI either broken, or intentionally difficult to control.-Player controls the task, but not the worker. Which makes it hard to rush urgent job at a moment notice.-texture of stone is too dark, making it hard to see underground when all the blocks blended into a grey mesh.Score: 8/10			"

								This is a game, lovingly updated with bugfixes and really super cool features.  The care the develope is taking with this game is a beautiful feature worth reviewing. As for the game itself, it has truly become a diamond, worth mining for.  The integration of a smart crafting AI I think has really set the game apart.  Most games that have ""crafting"" development, require a player to micro-manage each step of a raw material extraction - refinement - multi-stage construction.  In this game however, if the player has provided the necessary tools and labor allocation, the workers actually can work, automatically all the way through the proccess on their own, with blacksmiths, stone carvers, and carpenters each doing their part to make your ""ordered"" final pieces constructed.  Great game, great attention to detail - perhaps a bit overwhelming at first - to which I suggest watching a couple of youtube videos.			"

								Hello,I really reccomend this beautiful game. You can be 'lost' in in for hours and for this price (6.99 euro) it's really worth it. The game on itself isn't that hard, but you have to learn how to play the game due to its special, but efficient, layout. There are frequent updates, which constantly add new (and cool) stuff. :DIt's really satisfying to see your miner who I've had for 3 years with very good skills die of starvation when you forget to build a bridge and he's stuck on a ridge. You really have to be concentrated for this game, and this game can be really rewarding when you've sorted things out. I must say, I 'cheated' a lot by closing the game without saving so my miner wouldn't die. And that's wy Ichabod Sugarbottom is still alive. :DI remain,Lordaverap			"

								This game sucked the free time from my life for a month straight. Why? You may ask? Simply put this game is fun. I have to admit, i bought this game and tried it for 5 minutes long before i tried it out further. It was kind of one of those scenarios where you say to yourself 'Yeah this looks too complicated, ♥♥♥♥ this, i dont want to take the time to learn it'. Eventually when I came back to it and put the 5 or so minutes into actually learnign the controls i found a game that has enticed me and has been a marvelous example of what a successful early access title can acheive.Pros:You can build thingsYou can build whatever the hell you want pretty muchYou can build trapsYou can customize the game to your perfered difficultyYou can exact your god complex on little peopleLarge amount of depth and complexity involved with creating a succesful economy for your gnomesOverall fun gameCons:The 5 minutes it took to learn the interface.Sincerely, get this game, support the small guys out there that had a really fantastic dream and stood up to be it.

								For posterity, I am leaving my original review text here, intact. I have managed to play the game for a couple of hours and - it succeeds very well in itching that Dwarf Fortress scratch.  The font issue is STILL an issue for me, but your mileage may vary. I still have hope for a better font, because I simply can't play this game as much as I'd like (or as much as I think I need to, to really dig into its meat).------------------------------------I wanted to love this game. I waited until it had been out (even in Early Access) for almost a year (or more) before trying it. What's the deal breaker?The font.I cannot look at the text menus for more than a couple of minutes without it hurting my eyes.The only reason my review is a ""No"" at this moment is because there are threads a year old asking for some kind of font options and I didn't find any sort of dev response to this. Lots of people offered helpful hints like ""play at a lower res"" or ""get over it"" (even putting it at 800x600 doesn't help) - but a font seems like it should be a simple fix. And it seems like something that should be an option for people who may have visual troubles.Should the font get a fix, maybe I'll be able to play this game properly, and I'm sure at that time I can edit this review. But for now? No.			"

												11/10 Would be happy getting 700+ hours of enjoyment for under $10 again.Yes, like many people on this foruml I've topped 1000 hours on this game (inclusing 100's of hours before it was on Steam) for less than $10 1 cent an hour? But, there are some serious caveats to my thumbs up.The game is now released. - Is it everything Robobob (The developer) said it would be 2-3 years ago? NO - Is it still a very good game easily worth the pocket money price? YES - Is it dissapopinting that magic, better enemies (and logic for combat)  and more personalized gnomes (among other things) aren't present? YES - Can the modding community fix all these things? MOST BUT PROBABLY NOT ALL - Should they be expected to? PROBABLY NOTSo a good solid game that falls short of what it should have been - but still a good game? YESAre these unfulfilled promises good for the reputation of EA on Steam in general? OF COURSE THEY AREN'TAnd that's the rub. Robobob's own roadmap for the game that was up until sometime in 2014 had 4 of 5 killer features down to be added and a collection of smaller stuff that would have made a difference.In the end I think it was some design decisions very early in the game that stopped it.The single threaded nature of the programming meaning that, with 30 gnomes, dozens of animals and perhaps 100 skeletons, goblins, mants, spiders and zombies roaming the game, it crawled to a halt and lagged.Playing the beetles turned off helped,  lighting everywhere helps a lot. Unlike most games where lighting calcs destroy the frame rate, in this game good even lighting seems to make it run a lot smoother. Get those torches going!A good PC can play indefinately if you sell your excess, don't encourage massive goblin invasions with ever larger taunts, turn beetles (and maybe spiders) off and keep your automaton population down.Interestingly games like this (Clockwork Empires) that have big ambitions have developers who come right out and insist on a MINIMUM of a 4 core machine and as many threads capable of running as possible. Although Robobob has never said as much, I think it's the single core nature of the game code that hobbled it in the end.A good game that falls short of a great game but still worth every cent of the measly 10 bucks it costs.

								NEW REVIEWI see a lot of rewiews stating that this is abandonware, that the dev jumped ship, etc.Some say the UI is clunky. For a game this complex, it's hard to not make it clunky. I disagree with the claim that the dev abandoned the game. If you pay someone to build your kitchen, you don't expect them to work on it after it's done. The game was done and he added some extra things like golems and better mod support.It should also be noted that there's only one person developing this. Stardew valley also had only one person and that game is much simpler than this, being only in one plane while this one, while 2d, also goes up and down, has to calculate all the pathing, do all the databse stuff, have all these modifiers for things, etc.The negative rewiews post release are, in my opinion, asking superhuman feats from a single dev.Knowing all that I know now, were I to lose my steam account... I'd buy gnomoria again.------------------------------------OLD REVIEW FROM EARLY ACCESS95% of early access games are ealy alpha trash. This game is in the remaining 5%.Regular updates, feedback, etc.Install it, play it, fail a bunch of times due to the steep learning curve, survive a year. Next thing you know it's light outside and you go ""Oh poop I forgot to go sleep!""What you'll be doing in Gnomoria:- Being an architect. Where do farms go, where do beds go, where the crafting stations, what about storage. - Being a boss. Look at who's slacking off. If they are, fix it. Put the right dude on the right job.- Being a judge/god/person who controls life. You may have to do ""mercy"" killings. Or can you afford to care for the disabled while that person could make room for a youngling of strong physique and ability?- Being a commander. Leading troops into battle. Well, not directly. You kinda tell em ""you're a soldier dude"" and they go be soldier dude.- Being an economist. You need to handle scarcity from the second you start your empire.- Being a merchant. Trade is important and often the only way to get certain items.- Being stuff I forgot.Protips: - Change the music setting or turn it off. The 8bit style music gets old fast.- Your gnomes are like pets. You probably get attached to them. Then they die. Then you're sad. Game comes with onions pre-installed. - Legendary beer is legendary.			"

												Gnomoria has a few bugs here and there, but it is still the best graphical version of Dwarf Fortress I have found. Many people refer to it as a very simplified version of DF, but I personally find it to contain more than enough to keep me busy without overloading my brain. The game is all about helping your small group of gnomes carve out a new home in the wilderness. Dig into the side of a mountain and carve out your perfect kingdom, or start above ground and construct a mighty fortress. The choice is yours to make. Cut down trees, forage for food, gather resources, cultivate your own farms and groves of fruit trees, build a brewery and brew up some of the finest fruit wines and beers, raise livestock for wool, milk, eggs and meat, dig into the ground and gather ore and gems, craft your own weapons and armor to protect your gnomes from the invading hordes of Goblins, Ogres, and MANTS! ... evil evil Mants. >:EAgain the game can crash, but you can save at any time by hitting F4 and it reloads after a crash without issue. I am creeping up on 100 hours of gameplay, and see it going well beyond that. What more could you ask for from a game that costs about the same as a movie ticket?""Foodo punches the goblin, hitting the upper body, smashing the skin, crushing the ribs and piercing through the heart.Goblin's upper body is bleeding.Goblin has died.""Gnomes proceed to take dead goblin to butcher shop, create goblin sausage, take sausage to kitchen and combine with bread and yak cheese to make Goblin Sausage Sammiches!10/10 Would Eat My Enemy Between Two Slices of Bread Again!

								As a huge fan of Dwarf Fortress, I picked this game up about a year ago and I haven't regretted it for a moment. If you're not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria is a game about building a place for your gnomes to work, eat, drink, sleep, and live their lives. Some improvements on Dwarf Fortress are that the UI is very intuitive, and I can craft goods out of a specific material and automatically set workshops to craft missing components of an object I'm building. I've also been happy with the regular update pace, although unfortunately this game is not moddable (at least at the moment). All in all, if you're interested in this sort of game, I'd recommend buying it. At the moment I'm writing this, it's on sale for 50% off or $3.99, and at that price it's a steal.			"

								Gnomoria is one of those games that decives you. once you know the controls and build your sorry fort you think that this is easy until enemys arrive then youre very screwed and once that happens you'd better start fighting them or your kingdoms gonna fall to bits then you have to restart over and over untill your stratagy kicks in. i did this atomaticly ecause most of my kingdoms are under ground or in the sides of hills. the gameplay can be frustraighting at times and without a wiki to help youre done for. the graphics are minecrafty style exept its got more colour and its in 3rd person view.the enemys are the best part there hard and challenging just the way i like it.7/10 silver ingots. not bad but not good enough. still good thoughadvice for the makers add more things to mine chop and find like tresure chests and hidden dungeons of loot and monsters.

								This is a marvelous, adorable spin on Dwarf Fortress.  If you liked the idea of DF but couldn't deal with the ASCII and convoluted controls, Gnomoria will be worth every penny.  Relaxing but challenging and still plenty of depth, and WAY more intuitive controls.  It does seem that the devs have let it sit for quite a while now in early access without more updates; hopefully it's just a slow period but it's not riddled with bugs either, so you're not buying a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥feature-starved moneygrab.

								I have played this game a lot. It is, overall, a simple graphic update to dwarf fortress that is a tad dumbed down. That said it is one of the most complex town/ colonization sim I have played that keeps you entertained for a long time. I played it before it was on steam and was excited to see it come out finally, but since it got on steam there hasn't been a whole lot of development. I'm really waiting for the end product to show up. As it stands once you have built everything you run out of things to do because you can literally walk away from the computer and your town will do fine most of the time. Its worth buying as is, and I can really see the potential in the end product. But its like getting halfway through a book and finding out the author of the series you are halfway through died without writing the last books, and unlike Robert Jordan, the author didn't leave notes that someone else could follow to write the ending to a monumental series.Pros-Manage a settlement of gnomes-You can micromanage as much as you want-Simple graphics, but not a text game-Addictive, way too much of my life-Challenging-Customizable difficulties-Diplomacy looks promising if it ever gets improved, like maybe I want to conduct a raid on a neighboring goblin kingdom instead of just insulting themCons-Stupid zombies and beetles-Steep learning curve-Not much developement on the game, snails pace-Produces a lot of activity that I never get from other games on my CPU-No tiered crafting system- the Gnomes can make everything as soon as there are materials and the skills involved don't change the end product enough that it matters- only skills that improve anything are fighting skills, and farming.-Trade doesn't really change over time- you get wealthier but your neighbors stay the sameI realize I have a lot of cons but some of them I enjoy like the steep learning curve, and just the way the game works.

												(my rating applies only to vanilla game, I do not review mods here)This is a very unfrogiving game. The early game requires a very specific order of tasks that if done perfectly right may grant you the chance of survival. Unfortunately many things in the base game are simply poorly designed and at least for me it is nearly unplayable without mods. It really is the simple things like hauling one piece of coal at a time or fully armor clad warrior losing to a monitor lizard that kill the joy I wish I had from Gnomoria. If you're thinking about picking it up, I highly recommend browsing through mods first and going through a solid online tutorial.			"

												Gnomoria is overwhelming at first — enough so that It took me a few attempts and a few wiki lookups to actually get into it.  Once I did though, it was worth the effort.  It’s a great mix of exploration, building, and managing your population of gnomes.  The menus are sometimes difficult to use (especially trading with merchants which requires scrolling through long lists) and I’ve seen an update cause my gnomes to ignore their thirst until it kills them, but it’s also under active development so things are changing and new stuff keeps getting added.  Despite it being an early access game, I think there's enough there already to make it worth its full price.Sadly, Gnomoria has been abandoned.  It’s still fun, but the developer decided that since he wasn’t going to work on it anymore he may as well call what he had the full release, even though it still has a lot of the sort of problems I was expecting to see addressed late in development.  The UI is still difficult (the bug I see the most often is gnome skill tooltips that get stuck open) and performance is a lot worse than you’d expect for 2D sprite graphics.  It still feels unfinished, but it’s no longer early access so doesn’t say it’s unfinished.  How disappointing this is as far as it got — I was really enjoying watching the updates roll in.			"

Early Access Review
								Gnomoria is a simplified dwarf fortress. For those of you who are avid fans of dwarf fortress, don't mind the ascii graphics and the keyboard hotkey menu shortcut controls, you'll probably dislike this game as simplistic. For those of you who wanted to get into dwarf fortress but didn't want to have to learn to read live matrix code and like the invention of the mouse, this game is for you.Gnomoria puts you in charge of a small group of gnomes as you have to build them into a thriving settlement. The game difficulty can be manually set at anything from ""I'm never attacked and all my resources are easily accessible"" to ""I hate my life, and want to discover what life would have been like in the stoneage with zombies and invading ogres.""Its system also now supports some decent modding capabilities. While it does not support an api for adding new game mechanics, large swaths of content are available for your complete control. To give an example, I recently started on a mod to redesign the entire game as a moon base simulator with either no enemies or possibly competing companies (I haven't decided which yet), and the hardest part is simply the graphics since I suck at pixelart.However, what I have enjoyed most about this game is that I can totally play it while doing other things. As a recent college grad, I was doing a lot of note taking, and classwork. During boring parts of lectures where we reviewed things I already knew, I would set up the instructions for my gnomes and then let it run without me when something came up to work on. It would run without me just fine, and had been set up to pause whenever anything came up that really needed my immediate attention. This isn't to say that, when playing the game there's nothing to do. But the fact that I was able to get hours and hours in during class and homework made it even more fun for me because I could actually play it during busy weeks.Some people are complaining now that the maker has declared he will be finishing it soon without completing all he said he wanted to. But pretty much everything he said he'd like to do, he has made totally available to people to mod. While this may sound like a cop out, I frankly would love to see what else the community can do with it, since the entire development team consists of one man.I've been part of enough early access games thought to declare (in my opinion of course), that this is among the greats. While I will admit some of the features of the game are definitely not particularly strong (eg: the diplomacy system consists of inviting an ambassador and making sure he has a nice room to stay in), the base game is actually very solid and very fun. The game has felt complete to me since I bought it, everything else that's been added since then has been icing on the cake. And the addition of a decent content modding system promises lots of new content (especially when the current indev branch is released since a lot of mods-in-work are waiting on it).The game is totally worth its current price tag of $8. I would personally buy it again for $15 myself. And while I'm normally very against people ""finishing"" development on a game just so they can start charging for expansion packs, I would totally be up for purchasing some dlc or expansion packs for this if he ever did that. Gnomoria is the bar by which all other village sims have been measured by me, and none have come close.			"

												By way of content, this game is a lot like Dwarf Fortress without the asymptotic learning curve at the beginning (there's still one, mind you).The mod support that came out in late early access definitely helps the community build more upon the base game but at the same time allows the developer to throw out the majority of the future plans listed on the game's website during early access because the game is technically finished.Scripting mod support (Lua??) would be gratefully accepted, even though we'd be wishing for a miracle.Overall, the game is very enjoyable and I would highly recommend this game to fix that fort management itch.

												I like Dwarf Fortress. Well... No, that's not accurate... I want to like Dwarf Fortress.Wat makes it difficult to like is the ungainly controls, and learning curve that's a mile high. I don't mind losing so much as I mind not having the foggiest idea of how to get from here to that point. Gnomoria makes things easier to read, visually, than Dwarf Fortress even with the best of tile packs installed. It's *just* intuitive enough to make it possible to reach your goals even if you haven't memorized exactly what order you have to build all of your parts in, to get there. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a simple, plug-and-play experience that very accurately replicates Dwarf Fortress, except in a more approachable fashion. "

												This came out of early access awhile ago and so I wanted to update my review. I play this on a Linux Ubuntu 14.04 rig plugged into the living room TV. Works great and fills the screen well.Great game.This is like a cross between Minecraft and Stronghold or Minecraft and Dwarven Fortress.  It's highly addictive and you can customize your world to make it as easy or difficult as you want. If you are into to building/survival and god games then this should be a good match for you.HIghly recommended. It is in my top 10 games of the last 10 years list. I would play even more, but it's one of those that I can only play ocassionally because it sucks me right in.			"

Does not have a tutorial, so you may have to watch videos on it or read some guidebooks to get the hang of it.  You start off with a handful of gnomes, 2 animals (back when it first came out), and some food and first aid items. You can play in peaceful mode, normal,  or hard mode(which includes attacks from creatures and other invaders.  Build a small village to maintain your gnomes or build large villages to expand your population. The music is  annoying.			"

The games content for a supposed finished game is still extremely lacking, I love the concept of the game, and the gameplay, but it hads so much more potential on what it could be. On a regular playthrough it still feels like the game is missing huge gaps on the edges, and some of the menu systems (definitely anything to do with setting up your military) feels clunky.

Early Access experience is kinda clunky and unfinished.Buy:You like the challenge of unfinished games without introduction or tutorialYou like building stuff and macro/micromanageDont buy:You lose yourself and your time in endless games and like your social life.

												I think the best way to describe Gnomoria is to call it Dwarf Fortress Light with a superior Interface.  So, if you ever wanted to play Dwarf Fortress, but thought Dwarf Fortress, even with Stonesense wasn't appealing due to its interface, give this one a try. I promise, you won't be disappointed.But the most appealing thing about Gnomoria is probably the fact that it is DRM free. It can be played without Steam, which is how I mostly played the game, which is why there are so few hours listed. Still I have played this game probably the most of all the games i've played in the last couple years. Its one of those “go to” games that is not only a time vampire but also never gets old, much like Minecraft. Yeah, sometimes you have had a bit to much of it and play something else, but I always return to this game, and with 240MB you can put the little thing onto an USB drive and take it where ever you want to go.I highly recommend the game. As for those wondering what the similarities to Dwarf Fortress are, well, this game is a bit more technologically minded and focused on stereotypes Pop culture associates with Gnomes instead of Dwarven. So its similar, but simpler. It also lacks the social system from Dwarf Fortress, so no suicide spiral when a Gnome does.Gnomoria is definitely one of my top 5 video games, and i should have written a review a long, long time ago.

It's very well executed, but is currently limited in scope. Not an unexpected problem for an early access, and certainly a very justifiable reason for avoiding it. However, let me just say this. One of my gnomes once lost all of his limbs. He proceeded to lay on the floor and bite his assailant's foot until he bled to death. If that doesn't convince you to buy this game, nothing will.			"

												[March 11, 2016]Finally it got out of Early Access and all in all it's a good game. From what I played in EA to what I played now I'd say the additions are not to big however they make the game better. This is still one of the better games out there of the same genre. (it got out of EA.)(EARLY ACCESS REVIEWOctober 15, 20154 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful1 person found this review funny)I was delayed in making this review, mainly because I was trying to go far in the game.I got this game during a sale mainly because I was reluctant to get it as it felt like I would not like the game, but I was so wrong. Well just look at the hours I've put into the game in just about 5 playthrough (should just have been a single playthrough however I don't want to lose a single gnome).The game is not abandoned which is awesome, and so far the content is good enough. The updates are slow (but at least they come)The learning curve can be steep when you're just starting as there are no tutorials in-game.Once you get the hang of the game it's really good. Where else would you get:To kill goblins and after you killed them you can butcher them and eat their meat. (♥♥♥♥ed me up at first! lol)To kill ogres and butcher them and make sausages out uf their meat and use their skin as armor.Decapitate enemies or bleed them to death, cook their severed limbs.Scavange dead bodies.Get your Gnomes decapitated (one of my gnomes lost a limb and I was like ""what the ♥♥♥♥! Poor military gal"" Then it turned out it you can get prosthetics and rock more with it.)Make Automatons.Make a colorful armor.

												I bought this game for $15 and it was worth every penny. I haven't had all the time i wish I had to do everything I wanted to yet in this game but its bounds are almost limitless. I hear what people are saying about the devs giving up and how it could have been so much more, and all that is true. However the reason they dropped it was because the game was not getting enough attention. They were tanking on money so they had to move on. Maybe if enough new people started showing interest then they would pick it back up? I dont really know though. Even still what they have left is a great game and I think people are being a little narrow minded in saying it couldve been more. I mean look at it. Enjoy what you got guys this game is fantastic. Don't look at it for what you wish it could be soak it in for what it is. Stop complaining and enjoy a really great game. Overall give it a buy; it really is worth the money			"

												An amazing game for those who always wanted to play dwarf fortress but didn't have the time or patientce to learn how to make a block of text run smoothly. Currently I have had alot of crashing problems (unsure if this is due to low specs or early access) but the game provides plenty to do even in Early AccessEDIT: Now that the game is ""complete"" I'll finish my review. The games content for a supposed finished game is still extremely lacking, I love the concept of the game, and the gameplay, but it hads so much more potential on what it could be. On a regular playthrough it still feels like the game is missing huge gaps on the edges, and some of the menu systems (definitely anything to do with setting up your military) feels clunky. Still concedering how much game time I got out of the game and the low pricetag I'd have to reccomend it, hopefully the dev or the modders will fill in the gaps			"

												Gnomoria is overwhelming at first — enough so that It took me a few attempts and a few wiki lookups to actually get into it.  Once I did though, it was worth the effort.  It’s a great mix of exploration, building, and managing your population of gnomes.  The menus are sometimes difficult to use (especially trading with merchants which requires scrolling through long lists) and I’ve seen an update cause my gnomes to ignore their thirst until it kills them, but it’s also under active development so things are changing and new stuff keeps getting added.  Despite it being an early access game, I think there's enough there already to make it worth its full price.Sadly, Gnomoria has been abandoned.  It’s still fun, but the developer decided that since he wasn’t going to work on it anymore he may as well call what he had the full release, even though it still has a lot of the sort of problems I was expecting to see addressed late in development.  The UI is still difficult (the bug I see the most often is gnome skill tooltips that get stuck open) and performance is a lot worse than you’d expect for 2D sprite graphics.  It still feels unfinished, but it’s no longer early access so doesn’t say it’s unfinished.  How disappointing this is as far as it got — I was really enjoying watching the updates roll in.			"

												Another Early Access game that was left unfinished, look at the update history on Steam: 	


Announcement: Gnomoria v1.0 released! 
Gnomoria, Feb 23, 2016

			This release marks Gnomoria's transition out of Early Access! This update adds a ton of quality of life changes, additional support for mod developers, a debug mode for testing and spawning items and...		


 last update was the 24th of February. Was looking forward to a Dwarf Fortress with graphics and a mouse compatible interface, I imagine it would have been a good game if development had continued. Instead if looking for a game like Dwarf Fortress with a simpler UI and although basic but functional graphics try RimWorld although it is also in Early Access if development stopped today you would get your moneys worth.

I understand the frustration that there are some remaining bugs, but I haven't found anything game breaking and clearly people are getting some value if they have 20+ hours and spent 15 bucks on it. If you love Dwarf Fortress, keep playing Dwarf Fortress because this is a simplified version and you will probably find Gnomoria lacking. If you WANT to play Dwarf Fortress but bounced off it, give this a try. I think it's pretty great.			"

												Dwarf fortress inspired, but Gnomoria has definitely come into its own. This game has been a great ride, one of the first early access games I supported. Every update brought more fun and more experimentation to do, different ways for my gnomes to thrive or get brutally murdered.I have watched my gnomes toil away so many different ways. From slaving away building a giant gnome out of a mountain range to building an upside down pyramid. I have watched golbins tear apart my guards and skeletons eviscerate my miners. I have built a magnificent palace for them and trading posts. Barracks and factories! Farmlands and military states! There's so many ways to play this game it's crazy. Robotronic has put heart and soul into this game over the years and it shows! I am grateful that I got to experience the journey!If you like building games, or army games, or economic games, or just like watching things die, this game is for you! Gnomoria will frustrate you and entertain you, but always leave you with a fulfilled feeling no matter the outcomes.			"

												Now that is the game is released I'd really like to write a review in support of the developer. m This game is in the vein of Dwarf Fortress or Towns.  It isn't as complex as DF but has a vastly superior interface.  It is a hands down better game than Towns.If you have played either of those games this is like those but in a pretty wrapper.  Take your gnomes, cut trees, plant food, make beds, mine ore, smelt ore, form an army, etc.  It is a well designed game and a blast to play.  Monster spawning could be done better.  Caverns underground would be nice. But we can't have everything, I suppose.Overall a big thumbs up on ths game though.  Well worth the money.			"

												I created a job to mine a fairly small plot, probably 6x6. The gnomes dug the hole out in such a way that a portion of the targeted dirt was now inaccessible. That level of micro-managing just to get started put me off almost immediately. There is no fun in having to constantly manage a gnome performing very simple tasks. If it messes up that quickly on such a simple task I shudder to think what It'd be like to perform something more complex. This game has a lot of potential and I'm sure the content is great but having to constantly fight the gnomes' AI is not something I'll deal with to get to it.			"

You are just sitting chilling in your own world, then suddenly a golem arrives and kills everyone.. Ok start over, train gnomes to battle, 2 golems arrive, kills everyone.... ok start over, train MORE gnomes, 2 golems arive, send ALL gnomes after them, they die without a casulty...?I miss some kind of goal or challenges and way WAY less obscurity.All that said, it's still a fine game with some good mecanics and tech, just sad it hasn't been run through some QA			"

												I just want to show you just some of the top google search suggestions when I enter ""gnomoria how"":Gnomoria how to get stonesGnomoria how to remove stairsGnomoria how to build wallsGnomoria how to get drinkGnomoria how to PlayThis shows pretty well that essetial parts of the game are quite complicated.The main reason for that is a poor UI and a missing tutorial.If you want to buy this game, you should consider that it takes some time to get into the game.The first 15 min of this game are simply horrible. Besides food and drink you don't know how much resources you have and besides that, you have no idea, how to get the resources for most of the buidables.The ones who like to figure out the game mecancis by themselfs may give this game a try.After about an hour you know the basic game mechanics. Build stuff, cancel jobs, modify the terrain according to your needs (which is not that easy) and how to get the resouces you want.At this point, this game can be quite fun. You will start to plan your empire and you'll start a new game with the largest map this games offers.At this point my motivation was at the highest level. After that, the game became more and more frustrating to me.The main reason again are the UI, the game mechanics and the bugs.Gnomes get stuck so often, because of a task which they can't handle. You to figure out whats their problem and fix it. Sometimes it is enough to cancel a job,sometimes you have to build a whole new tunnel to rescue them.Also the order/categorization of the action annoys me.For example everything about removing terrain is under the terrain tab.Besides that there is a fill hole action, which construcs a wall and a ceiling.But there is no way to fill up a tunnel in the terrain tab. It's under the build tab.cause you build a soil wall. Also the fact that gnomes can walk on a ceiling out of soil is pretty strange.In my opinion, the ceilings are useless and destroy the build flow.Minecraft has shown, that building with blocks works flawless and super easy. This is not the case in this game. Everything simply takes to long in this game.Besides that, you notice after a while that this game has a very limited content for a game which was in development for such a long time. An I don't see hope that more content will be added, cause this game was offically released.For example you have got 3 tamed animals, 4 trees, 5 cops and a pretty limited amount of furniture.In my opinion not enough for a game, which just focuses on sandbox settlement building with super simple graphics.

								Gnomoria is a bit like Dwarf Fortress-Lite with cute isometric graphics. Don't get me wrong, it's not just a DF clone. It's got a flavor all its own and the learning curve is significanly easier than DF. The developer communicates with the community regularly via the official forums and updates to the indev beta branch are pretty regular. Right now the dev is working on getting the modding platform all worked out so there haven't been content updates in awhile, but the game has a lot of depth already. Really, this game is incredibly fun and you should pick it up.			"

												I purchased this game around March 11th, It just came out of Early Access.Update: Today is Jully 22nd, the last time the Developer logged into his ""opt-in"" update forum was  --> Last Active: April 11, 2016, 03:23:55 PMI want to start off by saying that this game is a lot of fun. This is your Population/Kingdom management game, where you build brick by brick, The only templates you're looking at are the workshops where you craft the materials you need to make better gear, weapons, and asthetics. You can shape the very land you live on.The Learning curve, is pretty steep at first. When you start the game, you have nothing really guiding you on how to begin. There is help menu that provides some information, and a context menu that allows you to generate jobs for your gnomes. Here is where the game struggles a bit. As far as I can tell, Everything is great while you're above ground, dealing with your farms and animals. But once you start digging, the AI tends to hang and you have to figure out where the hang up is before your gnome decides to stop drinking and die. Then there are the mobs... I feel that the mobs are a bit over powered in the beginning. Even at the easiest, lowest setting, a Honey Badger for example, does so much damage that while you might survive this fight, you'll have slim chances of surving the next as a beginner. Later on, there are these beetles that multiply like tribbles (StarTrek reference), and can cause your game to lag/crash. So there are still some issues that need to be worked out as far as mobs go.Once you've gotten passed the learning curve and you've tempered your patience with the faults in the AI, you'll be able to build bigger better kingdoms.

												Gnomoria is a complex kingdom management game in the same vein as Dwarf Fortress.The starting point sound simple enough: You've got a handful of gnomes, a few livestock, and enough food and water for a few days. You must direct your gnomes to build a kingdom in which they will live. Simple, right? Wrong. It turns out that building a kingdom from scratch is no simple feat. You only have a limited amount of time before hordes of monsters will show up and attempt to slaughter your settlers. You'll need a sword (or many, many swords). But to make a sword, you need bronze bars to make it. Bronze bars must be made of tin and copper. Tin and copper need to be mined. Mining is dangerous and may force your gnomes to come face to face with monsters deep within the earth. All of this just for a sword, which is most definitely not the most complex thing you can make.As you progress, you'll need to get a feel for the supply chain required to make things. You choose which gnomes do which jobs, you choose the priority of their tasks, and you hope that you don't make a mistake somewhere because production will halt if you do, and there's nobody to hold your hand and tell you that you forgot to assign a gnome to burn wood into charcoal for your torches, and that's why none are being made. You'll make mistakes. You'll lose dwarves. You'll see your kingdoms be completely obliterated from one small band of goblins or a rogue golem or a horde of subterranean insects. It's all part of the game.But that's the fun of it. It's not an easy game (though not as tough as Dwarf Fortress), but it's quite rewarding to see your kingdom grow and take on new challenges. It's great to build a giant, walled marble city with trained archers wielding steel crossbows at every entrance. It's satisfying to build systems of gearboxes and axles which power mechanisms which keep enemies out or deploy traps against invading giants.Overall, Gnomoria is a really great game for those interested in the kingdom management genre, but be aware that it's not a game that's simple to pick up. You'll fail a lot. It's part of the game.			"

												I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but this one deserves it. Gnomoria is a fantastic game that I have been playing on-and-off for quite a while now, since it was in early access. I haven't played a lot of similar games, like the one most compare it to: Dwarf Fortress, but I was hooked on this one pretty fast.The main reason I want to write this review though is to counter the recent reviews the game has received for being 'abandoned by the developers'. First of all, if you're going to say something like that, do your research. This game was made by one guy. A single person. Not a development TEAM. One person, who had a dream. He put in massive amounts of work on this game, even worked with the modding community to help them integrate everything before he was even finished. I think that, taking that into consideration, this is a pretty amazing piece of work. Then he had a kid, so his life got a little hectic, but he still did what he needed to do, because this game was a big deal to him.All that being said, is the game perfect? No. Very rarely do I ever see a 'perfect' game. If that's what you're looking for, go to sleep and have some dreams. Maybe you'll find one there. But for what it is, this game is fantastic, and I love it dearly. Even in early access when it was super buggy, it was worth the cost. I'll keep coming back to this one every so often, simply because it's fun and addicting.			"

												Let me tell you about Jenut Farmer.In the early days of her gnome colony, Jenut was assigned to militia duty when goblin raiders came a-calling. The colony only had armour for one gnome, and it wasn't Jenut, so she fought bare-handed. With one lucky blow from a goblin's weapon, Jenut lost her right arm.But if anyone had ideas about withdrawing Jenut from the militia, they quickly changed their minds. Her comrades reported that losing an arm barely slowed her down. On the ground after being knocked down, Jenut had throat-kicked the goblin attacking her and killed it in one blow. She survived her injuries, and even with one arm, her combat skills were rated the best in the colony.So Jenut remained with the militia. With every goblin incursion and wild animal hunt, she racked up more and more kills. Still bare-handed, still unarmoured, Jenut punched, kicked, and bit to death anything that crossed her. By the second year of the colony, she had killed over a dozen goblins. Ogres started coming on goblin raids; Jenut called them ""oversized kickboxing bags"" and smashed their ribs into their lungs.Oh, and she was also a good farmer. She baked the legendary loaf of wheat bread, ""The Bakersmasher"". I like to think she made that one into a goblin sandwich and ate it herself.""Was""? Well, Jenut's still alive, but the colony has a real military now, with proper weapons and all. So she doesn't see as much action as she used to. But she's still on militia duty, and she's still got the most kills of anyone on the roster, if you don't count the crossbowgnomes and their nice, safe runs in the beetle-killing gallery. She's a legend in the colony, too. They say she can see a goblin-skull helmet and show you exactly how her fist or foot fits the odd dents in its side. They say that when she plants saplings, she punches them into the ground, not because it's efficient, but because it freaks out the gnomads. And they say that when she finally does die, she'll kick Death, hitting the upper body, splintering the ribs, puncturing the heart and piercing through the heart... and take his job.Gameplay: 9/10Playability: 7/10, still some bugs and frustrationsLongevity: 7/10, some things get tedious with repetitionOne-armed Gnome-fu Biopic Generator: 10/10			"

The game is recommended for all those who like DF style games. Old school graphics and a lot of things to do.Create a happy city, trade, dig and survive.No tutorial, learn by yourself or go to youtube and mimic others.

								As someone who really enjoys the depth of Dwarf Fortress as far as a city builder and management game goes, this game really captures the style of game that Dwarf Fortress is, but in a much more simplified and pretty way. Now that's not going as far as to say it's a better game, but if you prefer graphics over game depth, then this is the game for you.It's soundtrack is just incredible and very cute, happy sounding generally. The tiles and sprites are really adorable, in my opinion, and it's very easy to manage, especially with the mouse controls.It still doesn't beat Dwarf Fortress, but if I'm not up for insane levels of management, this is the game I go to!

												Gnomoria is a fantastic managment and sandboxy game that lets you decide exactly what you want and how you will get there. Called dwarf fortress-lite by some I can see it but that is a good thing to me. The UI is SO much better than Dwarf fortress in every single way. I also feel not having things like exactly modeling of every detail of your gnomes pysche is not a negative. I like dwarf fortress but the excessive detail it to much very often. You can make it as easy or hard as you like with monsters and how much ore the map contains and how far down it is beneath the earth. Decide if you want no monsters or have a army every time they show up. For the money you can easily lose yourself for hundreds of hours in this game. I wish I had the time to play it more, nothing like starting a awesome little kingdom and watching it grow to 20-30 gnomes strong or more. Some Quality of Life things that coud be fixed but sadly the Dev now has to do other things to make a living. Summary, an excellent game well worth the money asked for it but it is as it is and unlikey to get more patches.			"

If you have been wanting to play Dwarf Fortress (DF) but its way to complex for you?  Then I would recomend this game.   I feel like i have gotten my moneys worth out of this game and then some.    Yes there is no tutorial really in the game but it is not hard to learn at all.  And there are many tutorials on Youtube on how to play.   So if you are looking for a fun DF stile game, this is one of the best out there.  Besides play DF its self.			"

												I love it. Dwarf Fortress with a GUI.But at its current stage it can be gamebreakingly buggy in some saves and I lose them... The developer has unfortunately abandonned the project and I wish he really had not, or open sourced it for others to take over.If you get lucky or can overlook or work past the bugs this game is still very solid/finished feeling. It has content for >50 hours depending on how quickly you learn and how creative you get. I also feel inclined to come back after a year or two to experience it again -- it is a genre of game that is seldmon executed well or easy to control, but unforgettable and eversought anyway.So if it sounds interesting --- get it. If you're played dwarf fortress -- I doubt you'd be impressed, but for those who cannot get over df's unfriendliness this is the game to go to.			"

								This is an absolutely awesome implementation of the most basic core Dwarf Fortress  ""fortress mode"" mechanics with a UI that makes a Dwarf Fortresslike game very accessible to those who are too put off by the ASCII graphics and UI of DF. I don't mean to make it sound like a ""DF clone"" because really Dwarf Fortress is way too elaborate of a simulation to simply be ""cloned"", and even as elaborate as it is now, Gnomoria still doesn't implement 95% of the insane level of detail in DF. But Gnormoria successfully makes the DF style of game very accessible and is successfully heading off in its own direction in game mechanical terms. Even in the early access state, it's very playable and worth buying especially given the low price.			"

								This game is more fun than I ever expected and am glad I got it.  The interface is simplistic enough to charge head on in and figure out yourself, and complex enough that you still need to discover things to build up.  The simple fact it has a pause button is a wonderful idea since you can pause the action and place things for your gnomes to do, figure out what you need or any myriad of things while it's paused and the save feature is wonderful.  I would like to be able to connect to friend's gnome kingdoms though but I understand that's a bit hard to pull off.  Right now, Gnomoria is a simple, fun game that you can spend hours playing, even if it is just watching them run about like mad men.			"

								Enjoyable building sim game. Guide your Gnomes and build up a prosperous community for them. Reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress, but with updated graphics and better user interface. It is by no means as deep or complicated as Dwarf Fortress, but it does capture the basics of it.Watching your original group of Gnomes successfully build up their settlement and eventually letting it grow to a busteling town gives you a gratifying feeling. To succeed you must manage the Gnomes' workload and see to it that they are well fed and kept out of harms way. Goblins and other nasties will soon try to invade your settlement, so you'll also have to build up your own army as well.  Flexibility and freedom are core in this game. Build your town how you want it.The graphics are basic, but I find that not a problem for this kind of game. The user interface is managable, but could be better. The artificial intelligence can sometimes be a bit quirky. And finally, for me, the gameplay could be a bit more deep. "

								Really enjoyed this game. It's got some great balancing and challenge mechanics that allow you to take your time and progress at a pace you can handle. Get too greedy with your digging or grow your city without proper protection and deal with the consequences. Some features I really love is having individual gnomes with names that you can assign jobs, track their lives and achievements through the seasons. See how many goblins they can slay and keep them alive when they get injured. I had a gnome called Jazz that had an arm and both legs cut off. He had served my kingdom well since its inception so I built him his own bedroom and workshop right next to each other. He then became my kingdoms master jeweler until my entire kingdom was wiped out by ogres and goblins. I was getting worse and worse attacks because master Jazz was making the best jewlery in the lands, which raised my kingdom value enough to see hordes rushing me.You can farm crops, tend to livestock, craft all kinds of furniture and weapons and armour all which take into account minute details about what its components are and the quality of construction.You can also terraform the lands to suit your purposes, make a base inside a mountain or build a castle whatever tickles your fancy.You do not control your gnomes directly, rather control is done in 2 stages. First you give gnomes tasks they are allowed to perform like chopping trees. Then when you assign a tree to be felled the most available gnome runs over and does it. This cuts the micromanagement to a level you can decide which is great. You can micromanage every task to happen straight away or just set a task and forget about it, someone will fix it later. This is the opposite to facebook/browser style village games where you have to do every little thing yourself.			"

If you have the time I absolutely recommend it especially if you're into survival town-building games. Takes some time to get used to the per-layer feature. I've played a few town-building games in the past and this has to be the most graphically appealing and interesting one.			"

								Beautiful game and highly addictive.Gnomoria is the work of one man, RoboBob, and is inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress. RoboBob updates the game twice or thrice per month and is in direct contact with the community. While it takes some time to get used to the game mechanics and UI, once you are there it plays very good.Games like this are the reason why Early Access and Indie games are good for the PC gaming industry. It feels to me almost a finished game and it has provided much more enjoyment than AAA games.			"

								First off: be aware that this game has a select target audience.  It is essentially Dwarf Fortress Lite, and therefore a micromanagement game.  This means you will spend a lot of time in menus, messing with lots of stuff to get your dudes doing what you wnat them to.  However, where Dwarf Fortress has a learning curve about like a brick wall, This game's curve, while still steep, is not near as bad.  The UI is fairly intuitive, and once you have an idea of what you want to do, getting it done is usually fairly straightforward.  A starter quest system or some other form of tutorial for the game would be extremely useful in indicating your priorities and helping fortresses to actually survive their first year (my first didn't), but unfortunately all that is availabe at the moment are youtube videos.All in all, I would reccomend Gnomoria to anyone willing to take the time to learn how to play, as it is quite enjoyable at that point.

								A good dwarf fortress/resource management game. I bought it way back when it first appeared on Steam in Alpha, and I have not been dissappointed. The developer updates regularly and has been both fixing bugs and adding huge amounts of content in a relatively short amount of time. The first couple hours of each game can be ridiculously hard on any other setting than Peaceful, but I'm hoping that gets balanced out in the future (perhaps starting out with a bone needle, and more straw would do it).

								From the screenshots, I thought this might be a cool game, so I waited for it to go on sale (in case it sucked) and purchased it.  I fell in love with the gameplay quickly, and now I wish I had bought it when it first came to early access!  This style game isn't for everyone, but for those who do like city management games should love Gnomoria as well.  My friends hate me for playing too much Gnomoria instead of multiplayer games with them, but this game is just ridiculously addictive!  There is a learning curve, but it's not very steep.  I'm hoping that future updates (it's still in development as I am writing this) will provide a starting point for beginners, and perhaps a few UI improvements that will make it easier for those players to grasp the gameplay conventions in use.

								I originally didn't like this game because it was a little difficult to play but once I got the hang of it I loved it. I sometimes play for hours without knowing it. When i get home from work I always tell myself I will play just for a little bit and then its time to go to bed. You will go through a few games and just get destroyed if you aren't careful. So I recommend watching some of the videos out there for some Tips & Tricks. Start off on a Flat map then once you think you have got the hang of it try a more Mountainous map.			"

The challenging part is keeping your gnomes alive at the start and from then on keeping everything running smoothly for the years to come. The game has it's quirks and sometimes these will cause losses to your population, but in general there are no game stoppers. The game currently is still in early development, but bi-weekly updates and a lively community keeps it going strong.			"

												Updating my review: Full release is great. Love the music -- the orchestral version -- the job queuing is 1000x better than it was in EA. I'll leave it on in the background while I'm working at night so my gnomes can work through their queues while I do something else. It is definitely a slower-paced for someone with patience, but it is very rewarding.			"

								Long story short, this game is an amazing dwarf fortress like game. Its very deep, its calming yet still has some good challenge, and its one of the based city sim type games I have played in a long time. Throw on the fact it is only 8 bucks and I dont see how anyone can say no.Come on guys, pay the 8 bucks, gather your gnomes, and get ready to quit your job. Gnomoria is here			"

												Gnomoria has brought thousands of hours of enjoyment to my family over the years. So much so, that I have purchased this game multiple times for friends and family. It's basically a colony sim with heavy management elements, city building and some soft strategy. 2D Isometric pixel art and quaint musical themes really hits the sweet spot. It's a shame for sure that development has stopped. Though the game as it stands is so very playable and re-playable, so my full gratitude to the developer.Bottom line, Gnomoria is just lovely, even with some rough edges.			"

								Gnomoria is built off of an awesome concept... the concept of Dwarf Fortress. The people who made this game essentially made a dumbed down version of Dwarf Fortress and added their own twists to it. This makes for a fantastic game that provides a level of almost infinite creativity and gameplay. I highly recommend this game (it's only $8.00).			"

								Like Dwarf fortress but want a easier to learn game? Want more graphics? Like a active modding community?  Then get this. You can play completely with assignable hotkeys and/or GUI mouse controls.You start off with area to start your gnome colony in.From there you have to assign jobs for your gnomes,set up farms,plant seeds,gather resources,etc. Build your homes/kingdom both above ground and/or below.Mine materials,craft them into various things,keep food and water stockpiles etc. Its pretty much like what any new colony would have to do in order to survive.Lots of fun,(remember its still in alpha/beta) a good amount of growing content,responsive Dev that tweaks the game based on community feedback,weekly -biweekly updates. Lots of fun for hours on end. Your choice of playing pure survival with no hostiles (peacemode) or switching to or started normal mode which has everything in peacemode but with hostiles.if you like what you read then do yourself a favor and get it.

												[EDIT] Switching review to negative, unfortunately. Game has been abandoned by the developer with a lot of the fundamentals left unfinished. [/edit]Have you wanted to try Dwarf Fortress but got scared by the ASCII graphics, a crafting tree so complex your eyes glaze over just trying to figure out how to make soap, and game mechanics so complex that you actually need that soap to keep your post-surgery dwarves from dying to infection? Fear not, Gnomoria might be just what you're looking for. Gnomoria takes many of the mechanics of Dwarf Fortress, tones them back to a moderate complexity level, and gives you an improved GUI and charming graphics to work with.  In Gnomoria you'll command your gnomish settlers to dig out a fortress and work in 3 main job categories: agriculture, crafting, and defence. Like Dwarf Fortress, many of the jobs in these fields are interrelated, with one supply chain feeding into another. Combat is both one of the fun and weak points of the game. You'll enjoy kitting your gnomes out and watching them chop goblins limb from limb, but you'll need to work fast and train hard to prepare for your first Mantis invasion. Inevitably, your first (and second, and likely fifth) run-through will leave your fortress a slaughter house, if it doesn't end with your dwarves starving and dying of thirst.  That's ok, though. Gnomoria, like DF, is a rogue-like. And, like DF, ""losing is fun"".			"

												Fun! Heavly expired by Dwarf Fortress, but in it's unique style.  But I kinda recommend Dwarf Fortress first, but the DF will probably be finally finished in about ""10 years"". So this game is great if you just want to manage a fortress. But still love the game.			"

								I am having such a good time with this! You might find the game overwhelming at first! There should be and probably will be a standardized tutorial, it should show you the basics of survival. Also start with an easier game, no enemies, and just learn how to build and play it first, THEN make a world with some monsters if you'd like.   After a solid hour of reading up how to play online I really got to enjoy Gnomoria. For $7.99 I really got a good deal on this. I prefer setting the music to it's more orchestrated less ""8-bit"" version but that's just me.   I would enjoy being able to change how your gnomes look like off the start. Maybe get to create one leader gnome that you get to distribute their starting stats from, using a set pool of points or something but that's such a minor thing that I would never care if I didn't see it.

								Wait for this to be finished, there is a MASSIVE amount of things to do in game, so much so that the number one guide on youtube is 2.5 HOURS. My personal thoughts are the same with any ""Early Acces / Beta"" games, Starbound comes to mind, that until it's 100% finished, it's not worth playing as you'll end up investing X hours into a game with possible character wipes and to be frank, it's not finished.

												First of all i would like to say that i realy loved this game. Ive played well over the amount of time I originally was intending.  With that being said, I am fully dissapointed with the final release, we were told that magic would be added, and wasnt, we were told that gnomes would have more personal goals and actually leave if those goals were not met. as well as some other things.  The final version has been left up to the modders to finnsh. This practice in my opinion is lazy. Considering how long we had to wait for patches and updates, this practice is a slap in the face to all the fans of the game.  I understand it is one developer, and i understand he has a life. But if you tell us one thing and then do another your no better then all the othe companies that took our money and said eff it.  Please dont let this be the end of the devlopment and realy on modders to do the work, you turn them into free labor and make yourself look like alazy doosh in the process. Being a developer myself I understand the need to know when to stop a project.  I also know that saying one thing and doing another is an awful way to go about your game.  EA has done it, SquareEnix has done it, this does not give you the right to do it.  Untill these practices have ceased the Indie community will be no better then the AAA community. Dont slap your fans in the face and be a lazy devoloper, mods are fun but content from the developer is better. I will recomened this game but I do not believe it is any better at full realese then it was when it was put on for early access.  Dont let this stand.			"

												[EDIT] Switching review to negative, unfortunately. Game has been abandoned by the developer with a lot of the fundamentals left unfinished. [/edit]Have you wanted to try Dwarf Fortress but got scared by the ASCII graphics, a crafting tree so complex your eyes glaze over just trying to figure out how to make soap, and game mechanics so complex that you actually need that soap to keep your post-surgery dwarves from dying to infection? Fear not, Gnomoria might be just what you're looking for. Gnomoria takes many of the mechanics of Dwarf Fortress, tones them back to a moderate complexity level, and gives you an improved GUI and charming graphics to work with.  In Gnomoria you'll command your gnomish settlers to dig out a fortress and work in 3 main job categories: agriculture, crafting, and defence. Like Dwarf Fortress, many of the jobs in these fields are interrelated, with one supply chain feeding into another. Combat is both one of the fun and weak points of the game. You'll enjoy kitting your gnomes out and watching them chop goblins limb from limb, but you'll need to work fast and train hard to prepare for your first Mantis invasion. Inevitably, your first (and second, and likely fifth) run-through will leave your fortress a slaughter house, if it doesn't end with your dwarves starving and dying of thirst.  That's ok, though. Gnomoria, like DF, is a rogue-like. And, like DF, ""losing is fun"".			"

								Gnomoria is decent town simulator game for those who either played Dwarf Fortress or are looking for something more than banished. The community is very active and the devs are very good and quite approachable. The forums are very helpful for new players and are constantly reviewed by more experienced players.Pro's - Easy to use UI- Gameplay the entices you to try again after you fail- Moderate native content but a fairly active modding community that adds alot of depth- Retro style 8-bit graphics- Regular Updates (Cancelled)Con's - No in game tutorial meaning you have to trawl youtube and the forums to learn how to play- Limited range of enemies, sometimes destroying goblins and mants just isnt enough- Very AddicitiveOverall a great game headed for a greater future. :DEdit*Unfortunately the developer of this game is no longer working on it, bascially since the game left early access there have been no official updates. However the modding community has kept the game alive to some extent. It is sad for me, as in the foreseeable the future of my favourite game is dark.			"

								Well first, I give this game a good rating because it has a lot of options (Also because the gnomes can be horrible fighters and you have to train them.)I spent about 3 hours building a fortress and when my gnome went down in the mine to get some coal, he was attacked by a zombie. My gnomes defeated the zombie but one gnome went to the hospital. The gnome reanimated and ate my other gnomes. One gnome was left in the dormitory. he went outside and noticed about 13 FREAKING ZOMBIES.He ran for his life, stupidly he went in the hospital and, he was attacked by the other 3 zombie gnomes.I was very sad, but what cheered me up was when something came up saying ""congratulations, you kingdom has fallen""			"

								this is a fun game depending on what you want. if you wanna fully customize your very own kingdom to the fullest then yes this will be your dream... but if you want to survive and overcome challenge to reach a higher purpose then no...simply put this game isn't rewarding ""per se""when you've set up all your workshops and entered mid game what more is there to do? you've done your sleeping quarters, you've optimized your crafts, the kingdom is stable. and you stop having a purpose... you can mine for more worth and increase your great hall and thats about it, and by now my colony looks like a cramped death star... heck I even created one! tho it was more like a borg ship from star trek... Quadrangular not Circular... I can take on anything the game throws at me and its not rewarding at all!now if I were to create a beautiful town with houses and a castle, and the smiths house and the farmers house and all... sure maybe I would enjoy myself accomplishing building a village! but why would I wanna do that? sorry but for me thats a waste of time... and if thats what this game is meant to do then no, this game is not for you.on the otherhand if you enjoy crafting and building and manage to create a sustainable town with fashion then yes! this game is for you... though chances are you will get invaded and killed because you were focusing on the beauty of your town rather than working on your defenses. but if you manage then yeah you could consider it very rewarding.as of now all there is to do is to build a kingdom and survive, make it pretty. the game promises many features such as diplomacy and catastrophic events maybe even adding magic. tho I think this game will still be the same with simply more added features.I've played this on and off. I know how its like when they add new features. I feel done with this game. I forgot to mention building and trying to make a kingdom stable can take from 6-100 hours depending on what you want. it could also be never ending if your kingdom never fallsthis game is probably worth your money... but is it worth your time?

												EDIT: I had my hopes so high for this. It would have been everything I wanted and yet here we stand, forgotten and left undeveloped. I loved Dwarf Fortress and this had so much potential to be that but then it got tossed away and never finished even if 'fully' released. I forced myself to like it and to overlook the bugs but you can't forcefully love something can you? I'm sad to not recomment it, even with my deep desire to shout that I like it. The community is welcoming and modding but there needs to be someone who can mold the basic game otherwise it's just a disappointment.OLD REVIEW: I'm going to be honest with this review. As far as I've played it, I did run across some bugs, mainly crashes because I was repeatedly pressing Alt Tab to get in and out of the game. That one was solved by putting it in Window Mode. The gameplay, for me at least, is quite good; some of you are complaining about the replay value and that the game doesn't have consistency alongside the boring end-game. Look fellas, I don't know what you were expecting from this, but giving its state and growth, I myself am contained with what I bought. Let's not get into the fact that I've created tens of maps just to get things right and I'm not saying that as a bad thing. As for the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, yes, they do sometimes run across some difficulties, mainly the floor bug confuses them but if you're careful and give the ♥♥♥♥♥ one order at a time, you won't have any problems. I've watched the developers too, just check how many bugs fixes and things they've added on the last update http://gnomoria.com/news/ . For me, as a casual player, I find this game a gem in the mud. It has tons of potential and even now it has tens of hours of gameplay waiting for you to sit your♥♥♥♥♥in a chair and curse at the next goblin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s diggin' a tunnel through your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Farewell and buy this ♥♥♥♥ing little gem.			"

												Gnomoria is the successful attempt to simplify the overly complex Dwarf Fortress, mix in some elements from other games and combine it with some basic isometric graphics and a very well-designed user interface. Basically you get to build a more or less working little gnome village, containing living quarters, industry, farming, mining and so on. In addition to placing buildings and tools, the management of the gnomes and setting their priorities makes up the bulk of the gameplay - and it works really well! Especially at x2 speed, which feels good, there is always something to tweak and improve. Keeping your gnomes alive for a prolonged period of time is a real challenge and min-maxing all aspects of your colony is a really motivating task. That being said, there are unfortunately still some issues and I feel like the game was declared to be finished a bit too early. My main bug bear is the combat system: For one, the way combat is shown is too basic - usually all your gnomes merge on one tile and sit next to the enemy's pile until gnomes retreat to bandage themselves. More importantly, the difficulty seems pretty off-balance to me. Often there are huge spikes in the amount and strength of enemies that arrive. Also, since you cannot micromanage your warriors and only order whole groups, I've often died because I happened to fight on multiple fronts at the same time or because some of my soldiers were sleeping during an attack. Alas, most of the time dying did feel cheap rather than fun. (The fact that most tips/forums recommend cheesing out enemies does not really help.)That being said, I think that Gnomoria is an awesome game. While the game has its flaws, I've literally played it for hundreds of hours and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the genre. I've had a lot of fun with the game and would love to see the dev continue working on it or start working on a sequel.Edit: Originally this was a positive review. However, I noticed that the support email address given on the game's homepage is no longer invalid. Since I cannot wholeheartedly recommend a game that is no longer supported, I have to amend my review accordingly. If the situation changes, I'll update this review accordingly.			"

I bought this over a year ago during early access, put in over 100+ hours and I never ran into any major bugs. Development on this does seem to have stopped here, but it's still a good title and fun time if given the chance.			"

								For those that want to play Dwarf Fortress, but can't quite deal with the lack of interface, this should be their go-to replacement. Gnomoria plays much like Dwarf Fortress, but lacks the staggering amount of content, that DF is known for. Instead, it has a UI that makes the game much more accessible, and actual non-ascii graphics, that also happen to be rather charming. I'd recommend this game for anyone that wants to play a city / village / fort / hollowed-out-mountain builder.			"

								I had a very positive review of this game up for over a year.  I loved Gnomoria for a long time.  Colony management simulators had really moved up a notch when this game came along.  Since then, it's been a rocky road for this developer, and I've finally changed my review from very positive to negative.This is an okay game.  It used to be a great game.  It seems though that as the code grew (especially the AI code), the developers began to lose control of their project.  Now there are some game crashing bugs in the game, some AI pathing that is very poor, and some serious slow down in the late game.  Seems like a memory leak that can't be tracked down to me, but whatever.On other fronts, other developers have been making some awesome progress in this genre.  Rimworld in particular set the bar much higher than anything before, using the Prison Architect engine, and as it sets now in Early Access is a much better project than Gnomoria is now or ever has been.  Granted, you can't dig down as you can in Gnomoria, but that entire process in Gnomora was always a little more trouble than it was probably worth.  It created some serious bugs in the code as well, it seemed. In addition, it seems the developer has taken a long break or completely abandon Gnomoria for now, so it's probably best to steer clear of it until this is sorted out.			"

								It was a long load to get a new game fair with a big world and no servers but the game is like rimworld and not as good (specific). The stocks were not specific to each item just their type unlike rimworld where they list each item for each different stockpile you want. It's more unorganized in other ways like I cant specifically control the characters just their jobs and even then the tasks arent prioritized very well as they are generalized as well. So when a character's sleeping or idle for no reason I can't change that and have to wait for whatever reasont they decide to do their job. The worst part was no tutorial to help along a little. I usually learn on my own but having that as an option would have helped.Lastly ♥♥♥♥ these spider trading cards scared the crap out of me!!			"

Early Access Review
								Updated 10/21/15 - The dev has deleted his list of features from the website and decided the game is more or less done. Gnomoria is still missing a lot of necessary content, and simply relying on the modding community to finish his job for him is extremely unprofessional even if it is an increasingly common story in early access. This game will not be worth the $15 full list price, don't buy.I wish there were a third option between recommending and not recommending. I don't recommend Gnomoria yet.The pros: This is a stable game with great core mechanics. It's Dwarf Fortress with a reasonable interface, solid graphics and many of the unnecessary complications smoothed out. That's a great start.Unfortunately, there are also a lot of cons.As others have pointed out, there just isn't enough content. Gnomoria gets boring... fast. Most of your game is spent underground in the mines, but aside from some topography and the occasional monster there's just nothing down there. It's level after level of emptiness that you excavate because you need minerals, not because there's anything particularly interesting or dangerous that's worth finding.The monsters represent a real threat in the early game, but once you've built up your base and gotten some good equipment they're kind of pushovers. And they're very repetitive. There are 9 types of monsters in the whole game, and even among them the only interesting one are zombies (which can turn your gnomes into zombies on death). The rest only differ in toughness.Developer support has slowed to a crawl. The last update was back in February and the one before that in November.  More worryingly, though, is that the developer doesn't seem aware of what the game really needs. In the past year he's added the following: prosthetic limbs for gnomes, ceramic tiles, craftable automatons and UI/stockpile updates.That's it.For a game that badly needs mid- and late-game content, the developer has been more or less nibbling around the edges.Gnomoria is a game that could be great. I keep coming back hoping I'll have more fun the nth time around. Back when it looked like it was on track this was a solid purchase. Today... follow it and look again once it's out of early access.(I also just noticed how many hours Steam says I've played this game. That's for two reasons: the amount of time it's spent paused and forgotten, and the two weeks I once just let it run in the background to see if anything would actually happen to my gnomes. No.)			"

								I have to give this a thumbs up because it is a good, stable game that is fun.I considered giving it a thumbs down because the development is extremely slow, and after seven months of no updates, the next update is to expand compatible OSs. I feel that completing the game should have come first. That being said, if the choice to hold off development of the gameplay was an effort to expand the user base and generate needed revenue, fine, good.Because I am rating just the game and nothing else, thumbs up.

								For those that want to play Dwarf Fortress, but can't quite deal with the lack of interface, this should be their go-to replacement. Gnomoria plays much like Dwarf Fortress, but lacks the staggering amount of content, that DF is known for. Instead, it has a UI that makes the game much more accessible, and actual non-ascii graphics, that also happen to be rather charming. I'd recommend this game for anyone that wants to play a city / village / fort / hollowed-out-mountain builder.			"

								Great game, it's like Dwarf Fortress but without the hassle of the mods you would get for 3D view, although it doesn't have as many features as Dwarf Fortress, it can at least appeal to people who would be interested into Dwarf Fortress. Don't understand or want to learn DoS graphics, then this game is for you. If you do want to learn and understand DoS graphics and learn how to play Dwarf Fortress then you would LOVE to play Dwarf Fortress rather than this.Dwarf Fortress makes you use your imagination on which games now lack now-a-day's lack the ability too.Basically, Dwarf Fortress ""blunt"", get this, if you want the Dwarf Fortress ""cocaine"", go for Dwarf Fortress itself.

								I am having such a good time with this! You might find the game overwhelming at first! There should be and probably will be a standardized tutorial, it should show you the basics of survival. Also start with an easier game, no enemies, and just learn how to build and play it first, THEN make a world with some monsters if you'd like.   After a solid hour of reading up how to play online I really got to enjoy Gnomoria. For $7.99 I really got a good deal on this. I prefer setting the music to it's more orchestrated less ""8-bit"" version but that's just me.   I would enjoy being able to change how your gnomes look like off the start. Maybe get to create one leader gnome that you get to distribute their starting stats from, using a set pool of points or something but that's such a minor thing that I would never care if I didn't see it.

								This little game is relentlessly compared to Dwarf Fortress, and it is a just comparison.The likeness to dwarf fortress is obvious in many ways. The game is not as deep as dwarf fortress but has one MAJOR advantage; The game is designed to not fry your brain with ASCII and fey moods, tantrum spirals or catsplosions. It has some nifty automation features and an isometric GUI with mouse navigable menus . Not DF's arbitrary keyboard shotcuts and terrible ....... can we call them graphics?If u had any love for DF at all, but just didnt want to commit weeks to learning WTF you are looking at, then Gnomoria is worth a go. You could even get this to warm you up for DF :P. The game is perfectly playable in current state and updates are very regular and well documented. The developer is friendly and makes time to answer questions about updates or technical issues. With time i hope its depth will rival DF's!  All round, a nice little management game. 7/10 (P.S. my steam playtime is 0hours as i bought the game before steam early access but much time has been invested into this game)			"

												Ignoring every tiny minor issue that other reviewers have stated, Gnomoria is in fact, a brilliant game, and a shining example of where Early Access can go right.  Most of these other reviews have just talked about where promises fell short, but the fact is, this is a review of the game it's self, and as it stands, this is by far one of best, most addictive, City Builder I've played in a long time.It's tough, unforgiving, and above all, will grab you attention until it's 7am in the morning and you've forgotten what day it is.

												Downvoting a game because it is no longer in development is a scumbag move. As a fellow game developer, it is easy to see that Gnomoria is a fantastic game that has been built to serve a purpose and does exactly that.Downvoting a game because the author will not provide source code is a doubly scumbag move. Again, as someone who develops games I can say that there is no way in hell I would let players dip their fingers in a game that I worked extremely hard to produce.Unfortunately we can see here that Gnomoria has been poisoned by spoiled players. People who feel they are special snowflakes and that developers live and breathe to serve their interests. Again, Gnomoria was built to serve a purpose and does so nicely. I am loving this game so far and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a challenge!			"

												Ok, let's begin with the simple: the game is not abandoned. It is FINISHED.The GoodThose 206h (As of the time of this review) I have, are from 4 to 9 updates ago. Know what this means? That the game was very ♥♥♥♥ing playable when it had much less content than it does now. And even then, I hadn't done everything the game had to offer.I can't remommend this game enough. I bought it once on sale (When I first discovered), and again on normal price just to support the dev.People are just ♥♥♥♥ing spoiled. They expected this to be like Minecraft or Dwarf Fortress, and get updates forever. This game could have 10 times the content it has now, and when the dev said it was finished and stop updating, people would consider it abandoned all the same.Do not expect Dwarf Fortress levels of depth and content to the game. DF is a multi-dev decade and half spanning game. This is a solo-dev 4 year game.The game also has mod support, but I haven't played since it got it, so I can't say much about that. But you can see that how that will help.Also, as a final note, the dev was very active on the gnomoria subreddit during development, so you know that what he did was very community guided, not like most games, where the dev team does what it wants, and you have to deal with it. Especially many Quality of Life updates.The BadOk, now to be honest, the game isn't perfect. (Although it is perfect enoughSince I last played, and as far as I know, some tasks might have inconstant effects (Like Hauling, where the gnomes pick up very far items on the floor, instead of the closest) and using wheelbarrows (Where they should pickup many itens, but sometimes pick just 1, like it was done without the wheelbarrow). But than again, this doesn't happen all the time.And if you are very good and your kingdom grows a lot, depending on your PC, the game might start to lag, since it has so many gnomes (And maybe enemies too!) to process. Now, this isn't exactly the game's fault, it's a computing limitation. Physics will only let your computer run so many CPU cycles per second.			"

												This game could be awsome and it is quiet good! But it has many flaws and sadly some which make it sometimes unplayable :(Positiv: Easy but still kinda complex I love the art style Small mod support (this is very nice as it add lots of different items) You can insult goblins Your Yaks can kill bad things(With rating 1 - 10 | 10 = worst)Negativ: 10/10 it's programmed as single core game you notice this heavily when you get attacked by a large horde of Goblins.    This case is not nice but it's okay to deal with.The real problem appears when it starts to stutter and you have        absolutely no clue why. This can ruin a whole kingdom and several hours of gametime. 8/10 Altough this game has a lot of fun (for me) and I could play this for thousends of hours it has one big flaw... Bugs...    As everybody else i just can say this game is probably abandon by the Dev,    although he said that he still want's to fix bugs after the release and I would love this as it has a lot of little flaws like:   You can check ""Avoid fighting"" for a squad but if you want to train your gnomes after this they keep running away                which is a little bit annoying if you want to train new gnomes  The AI for building or mining jobs is bad! When you have multiple build jobs (Walls) it could happen that they shut in                  themselfs  Various small things which don't occur that often 1/10 You cannot ride your pastured animalsWhen he would fix the stutter problem I would give it a thumb up... but like this... it sometimes just gets unplayable!Sorry for grammer and other mistakes as english is not my main language!

												My Yak fend off and killed 2 goblins before it died. I salute it for defending my gnomes early in the game.I would like to add that this game at this state is actually playable if you are able to tolerate some bugs. Yes, there are some nuisances within the game like when your gnome builds walls and gets trap within the walls he built, because of the lack of scripting in the AI in the game but, if you are patient enough then the game is worth it. I understand this game was in early access for a long time and has been released unfinished and future updates may be bleak. I still can't blame the developer for this because he lacked the funds and time to continue developing it. The audience of this kind of game is quite small compared to other mainstream games so, it was expected that support for the game would gradually disappear of the years of the development of this game. At the very least, the developer managed to push out the workshop update for people to be able to mod the game so, more features can be added. I hope the developer may be able to continue updating this game in the future if possible.			"

								I just spent half an hour of my life trying to find a button that would make a bunch of jittery, jerky sprites clear some crudely rendered rocks off of some land and failing miserably.  Seriously, in a mining game, there should be a big, clear button for mining.  Digging through menus should not EVER be necessary.			"

								Gnomoria feels like a very light version of Dwarf Fortress with much better graphics.  There are plenty of glitches and some things, like combat, are more frustrating than I would like.  But overall, the game is well worth buying.			"

Next was slaughtered by marble golems. I love this game and recommend it to anyone to play. However, do be aware the updates have become almost non-existant. Mods however brighten up the experience. I'm still waiting for a multiplayer mod. Also, still havent got to steel yet, but have fun!			"

								3/10 Get it for the graphics, and on sale only.First off, those cute little Gnomes you see, are all made of solid stone. They are not animated. Nothing is animated.It is a cute game for about 10 minutes, then you have to start over usually. For some unknown reason, all of the sudden all of your gnomes will become unresponsive. There are no hints or clues on what to do next,,,, Are they hungary? Are they out of tasks? Are they on drugs?have had this game since its beginning on Desura, and it is a dammed shame the hint system has never gotten any better.i see it on sale today, it seems like a fair price. i feel i got $2 before it became completely ignored by me.Make sure you have plenty of time to read forum posts on how to play.

This game is a complete experience and development has not been abandoned. People were hoping that more and more would get added, but to be fair this game already is worth more then the asking price. Sad that people expect a dev to stick with a game forever without any further compensation.			"

								Sublime upon sublime scarcely presents a contrast, and we need a little rest from everything, even the beautiful. On the other hand, the grotesque seems to be a halting-place, a mean term, a starting-point whence one rises toward the beautiful with a fresher and keener perception. The salamander gives relief to the water-sprite; the gnome heightens the charm of the sylph.			"

												I want to reccomend this game but can't. The user interface and mechanics are great, but this game( in so far as version 1.0 is concerned) was not ready for release from early access. Gnomes often get stuck, won't begin tasks, won't drink and die of thirst, and most importantly it crashes. I played a game on a large map area, attacked a golem and it crashed twice. While this game is very fun and I am still going to play and enjoy it (and you may very well enjoy it in its current state, I waited to purchase the game untill it was released in order to avoid the bugs and was dissapointed that the devs released in its current state. I only do not reccomend it because it was not ready to be realesed. If the game updates to corect for the bugs I have encoutered I will happily reccomend it.			"

Now I gave it an honest chance and I waited a good long time for improvements.  I did well in a lot of my games and the building aspect was fun.  However I was still promised content by the creator and he has now given up on this game, for reasons i dont know but this game isnt worth the asking price.  To many bugs and simply not enough content.  I cant say I am upset i played many hours on this game but it has been given up on by the devs and that right there to me states ""if it is not worth updating then it is not worth 17$ more like 10 or 8$ Even then i would buy it on sale.

												Constantly crashes. Change your resolution? Crash. Go to windowed mode? Crash. Start a new game? Crash. Try and load a saved game? Crash.Text is unreadable in most places and ui is tiny, with no way to change it, from what I could find. An example of the text: Dirt Floor looks like Jirt fluur: http://i.imgur.com/MwkooFE.png I almost thought part of the game was in another language, or something.There's no tutorial and the ""help"" menu is pretty much useless, even if you can make out the few words that are legible. It doesn't tell you how to get started, and instead tells you about specific game mechanics or characters. It'd be like trying to learn how to speak a new language, with nothing but a dictionary.The music randomly cuts out at times.Just a generally unenjoyable experience, in my opninion.			"

												Its pretty much dwarf fortress missing a ton of stuff. It has potential to be better. Maybe give more control to the players on what the gnomes do, my gnomes literally died of thirst living next to a lake, because i didnt know ahead of tie that i needed a well in order for them to drink the water. That brings me to, you need a better tutorial system, just having some mediocer(I spelled that wrong didnt I, sorry) information in the help section(which branches off to much in my opinion), is not enough to start a player off.

												This game may look like Dwarf Fortress on the outside, but you're going to find out really fast that this is more like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son that nobody in the family ever talks about.  Here are the reasons why I am hating on this game:Building anything in this game takes FOREVER.  Even if you have all of the base materials Queue'd up, it still manages to find a way to take a long time.  You literally have to go one by one building this thing here and then that thing there.  God forbid if you Queue up a few beds and then try to make 2 pieces of armor.  Monsters can spawn from dark areas within the inside of your town. I don't agree with this choice because it forces you to build torches EVERYWHERE.  Plus I feel as if it loses the immersion for me.  In Dwarf Fortress there was always a reason for everything.  Goblins came from the town nearby and raided you.  If you picked a location close to a haunted mountainside Cavern then you can bet that undead monsters will begin to appear by your Fortress. Gnomoria has no tutorial or anything that tells you what you need to play this game.  New players will be absolutely LOST.  Even if you have played Dwarf Fortress before you will still have some learning curve as this does not play exactly the same way.  If you haven't played Dwarf Fortress, you better start reading the wiki and learn to ask nicely on the forums how 2 play game.  You don't know what is going on during the fights.  You have to click on the events and find out what is going on by pausing the action and read through a few menus (at the top of the screen).  Even in Dwarf Fortress with its lack of graphical representation still allowed you to see how well the fight was going by simply making your character blink and blink faster if they were dying and cover the Dwarves with blood.   Loads of times I have lost a Gnome simply because I thought the fight was going well, but in fact it wasn't.I know that the more worth your Great Hall is the greater your chances of getting more Gnomes to come settle will be.  However I went and I built that stupid Great Hall up and I received 1 extra Gnome.... just 1.  But there are a couple of positives:The graphics are prettier than Dwarf Fortress.  I do like the military system in which you gain perks for certain formations and also what type of soldier you want them to be.  


YouTube™ Video: Gnomoria - Gameplay Review 

			Views: 1,646		

			Developed by Robotronic Games If the developers of Dwarf Fortress were a little worried about Gnomoria taking away their thunder then they have nothing to worry about.		

TLDR: Playing this game actually makes me feel like going back to playing Dwarf Fortress.  I hate comparing any game to another but the comparison has to be drawn since these 2 games are extremely alike in a lot of ways.   In fact just do yourself a favor and instead support the guys who are developing Dwarf Fortress and play that game.  It's way more immersive and there are plenty more things to do in that game without feeling bogged down or frustrated.			"

												This game seems like a sandbox game but with no instructions and difficult to learn commands. I would not recommend this game at all. Some posts say its similar to a game called ""Towns"" which I have never played. Apparently there is a following but the developer is incognito so no new developments possibly ever. Even with the player aids I still dont know how to play this as there is no getting started instructions. I bought it on sale and it still wasnt worth it.			"

								This is a highly underrated game, there's nothing quite like Gnomoria. Actually there's tons of games similar, but nothing as good as this.  Sure your gnome can get stuck 15 stories high because they deleted the floor the wrong way, or dig their own graves -30 bellow when trying to make stairs, but it's still very fun to build mighty walls and giant structures that you dreamed in a block world!Very addicting, very fun, takes some time to get the swing of it but it's definitly a must have!I recommend peaceful mode ;) "

								the the biggest weakness point now in this game (ver. 0.9.x) is path finding and some other AI related stuff, they are buggy.it is very easy for one player to keep 20,000 + items in the third year, then you get into the middle part of the whole gameplay. and the game client would go insanely crazy LAGGG~~~and you may find the path finding of the in-game gnomes , they run like idiots... their job focusing point, especially those item fetching targets would be weird... the FPS drops greatly.and, if you assign multiple storage area, and installed a lot of crates and cotton bags, some of them would empty, and gnomes would put items onto the ground of the storage area, where without a crate/barrel... this is really stupid of the game AI, how come??that thoroughly ruined this game. stupid A.I. algorithm, and lagg issue. (well i created my own profession, and that profession contains all the jobs in-game, and i tweaked the job priority frequently for gnomes in different situations along with the in-game time passing )and other things... yea, it is not bad. but the issues above now is a big barrier against core gameplay... and the game got no update for months! this stupid bug been there for so many weeks...i cannot vote ""GOOD"" for this game...

As of writing this review, here's some titles on the first page:""Does this game still crash a lot?""""No suitible graphics card found""""Game won't launch""""Crashes and bugs on Gnomoria""""No ores bug""""Font unreadable""""Game won't start on Windows 10""""Goblin tunnels crash the game""These are red flags people. And the devs have replies to a whopping zero of these. Why anyone reccommends this game is beyond me.

								A neutral review. As of 25/05/2015The game has been in development for years and frankly it still needs years given the current progress being made before it's ready for release in my opinion. A fun ride but it's very bumpy.The cons.1. Some crashes still exist (although I haven't been plagued with them myself)2. Pathfinding is awkward at best due to the next problemVVV3.""Fail states"" exist, if you deconstruct a well sometimes the gnomes bug out trying to pick up the deconstructed parts or something. Or if you mine in the ""wrong"" way you can isolate your miners who eventually die of thirst, thus killing your colony before it even begins.4. Lack of information about what things do. It's hard to know when it's a good time to ""tech"" up and when the build defenses, do I want extra armour? I don't know. Do I want to fight that bear? I don't know.5. Learning curve is steep and doesn't show signs of slowing down after 14 hours of play. Yes this is a con.6. Under constant attack, dealing with constant attacks from things gets annoying, and feels like i'm on firefighting duty rather than building a colony or town.7. Combat system is bad sad bad, lots of little things you can forget can bite you in the behind later on. The lack of individual control over the gnomes feels especially frustrating here.8. Animations are incredibly lacking if even present. Understandable but not acceptable.9. Camera view is awkward. Not a huge problem but at times it becomes a hindrance being stuck in diagonal view.Pros.1. Very satisfying figuring out problems and optimising things.2. Lots of replayability, if you can figure out the issues with the game it's not that bad to play.3. Balancing what to build and when is quite fun, and is probably one of the main reasons people play the game. Just because I haven't figured out the optimal way doesn't mean you can't.4. Customisation options are quite varied, provided you can survive long enough to reach them.5. The game is still being worked on despite being several years in the works which says something about the dedication of the developers.6. Lots of ways to play the game...after a certain point.7. You have a lot of control over how the gnomes behave, granted the interface for controlling them is very very awkward, you do technically have a lot of say over how they behave.Conclusion clunky controls, annoying combat mechanics and general lack of polish means this game should be avoided until it's complete.Lack of information to the player and any real feedback on what they're doing increases the learning time required to get the basics understood. Proceed at your own risk to investment in time. "

								You want a review? here goes.I bought this game when it was at 0.8. *something* (end of 2012/begingin of 2013?)... and yes, although this is still in Alpha (it has been for a whie, admittedly) the reason is because there is mainly (only?) one person working on this game, and he is amazing.Don't forget, real life happens to devs too guys...Back to my review:So i bought this... whenever i bought it. The reason? I never bought an *early access before this game, and i wanted to contribute my ideas to the game as much as anyone else...My first thoughts were... OMG... NO ♥♥♥♥ING TUTORIAL!!!! WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO??? so i read the forum... i TROLLED the forum, i rage quit, i deleted it from my library... I waited a week or two, went back to the forums and someone had replied to my post (Sorry Merry. i forgot your full forum tag :D) and that person was a great help... I went back to the game... i ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned about the bugs... i spoke to Merry again, and we p'd each other off... i ditched the game again for about a month, i went back to the forums, apologised to Merry... got the game again...So after a long time of ditching/reinstalling here i am again.I have only played on peaceful so far, admittedly... (I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE MANTS!!!!!)But this game has come a HELL of a long way since i first played it...Pros:People who love city/world building games will hopefully love this (im talking to you DUNGEON KEEPER fans... CEASER 1-3 FANS... PHARO fans... etc... +Customizable map generators+a *mini-isometric-POPULATED minecraft clone* (i know you guys will hate me for this, it is NOT a clone i know, i just didnt know what comparison to use :P)+Depth and logic thinking required (this is not a *Dumb-man's* game) you want to survive the first year? you got to keep your gnomes fed/watered/somewhere to sleep/somewhere to recover after losing an arm/leg/head? to a Mant raiding party+almost infinite building posabilities (i am talking about asthetics... not description)+heavy replayability (read the *entrence script* above)Cons:-HEAVY trial and error if playing anything above peaceful (it does take a while for most (not all) peaople to get to grips with this game)-a myriad of bugs (some game-breaking)*-heavy lag when a tonne of enimes are on the map :D- THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STILL READING THIS REVIEW AND NOT BUYING THE GAME :D :Pignor that last bit... i do not endorse or sponsor this game at all...* Don't forget, this game IS still in early access and it is worked on by only one person (?)All in all, great game... ofc there are BETTER games out there... it just depends on what you are looking for (i think you can get a demo from the offical Gnomoria site??? but i forgot the URL)Would i recommend it?.... even will all the hassles and stop/starts i had with this game??? ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥BANDITS I WOULD!!!! (thats a good thing BTW :P)so stop reading... by this game (or find the demo) its the best £5.99 you will spend :D			"

												So it has finally been 'released' and with hardly any updates apart from more tinkering around the edges.I guess i should correct my comments below to ""Now that it is 'finished' you should not buy the game. The Dev has abandoned it progressively over the past 2 years and 'released' it just to pretend it was done.""*********************************************************************NOTE: Look at the time of the last Update. February 2015 and it was a minscule Update at that. If it ever gets finished (BIG IF) then you should buy this game. But honestly, that is not going to happen. This game is dead in the water*********************************************************************I have had this game for a while and came to it because i did not have the time to dedicate to Dwarf Fortress and also wanted something with more intuitive control system and at least minimal graphics.My initial expectations were met but each time i pick up the game (after 3-6 months off) i come to find very little has changed of value. Development has slowed to the point where it is a legitimate shock when there is an update and then disappointment when you discover that what is an 'Update' to this Dev would be a tinkering of the system in any other game.If, and thats a BIG if, it gets released then it might be worth buying but it is essentially dead in the water and has been for quite some time.

												Dwarf fortress clone. Pretty solid at its core.The graphics are better, but still very basic. The lack of any animation is a bit disappointing.If the devs tie up all the loose ends, this could be a really fun game to spend a lot of hours on.The cumbersome UI is one of the major drawbacks of this game. Performing actions, or even getting access to basic information is often difficult if not impossible. However, the UI is much prettier and more intuitive. Bugs and glitches are prevalent throughout the game. Some bugs are merely annoying, while other totally ruin your game.All in all, the game feels 90% consumer-ready.			"

I learned how to play it and fair enough you stop paying attention to the graphics after a while but then you play a game like this and it's obviously an improvement.The actual game though isn't as deep, it's still good but it's almost like a very lite version of DF. There's a handful of rooms and it's way more self explanatory than DF is but that's almost entirely down to it being so shallow in comparison.It feels like the closest thing you're going to get to Dwarf Fortress currently, but if you've played Dwarf Fortress this will feel very shallow in comparison.. it's not as complex by a long way and relatively user friendly but for some people that will be a perk.I'd say get this game and if you enjoy it, then get Dwarf Fortress as it's a much more in depth version. The trade off is horrific graphics.			"

								Rating: 3 of 10I just started and already hate it.# Bad* When you start a new game loadings take alots of time (~15 minutes).* Saving pauses the game for few secs and game remains paused after the save.* The units dont walk, they just teleport from tile to tile. It looks bad.* Its a pain to place stairs and ramps underground. Did the devs ever played this game?* The default music is very annoying. The orchestral music is not that bad.* To build something you have to left click, release, drag and click again instead of holding mouse button, drag and release.* Its hard to see where your placing the objects. Most of time you missplace objects.# Good* Alots of gameplay content and you can configure everything you can imagine.# Advice:* Go play Rimworld.			"

								It's a good game don't get me wrong. But the way the camera and map moves is really confusing. Like how when you are looking though objects you really can't see more than a block and the lowest block dug down. unless they give some kind ov mode where you can view things more easily then its probally not woth spending 10 hours on how to control the camera. Other than that the game is great. So if you can get around the camera thing then you are good to go! :)			"

								My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

								Update: Over a year later and the AI still isn't fixed. For example, when you start a new game you will have 2 yaks and 1 rancher. If you assign an area for ranching, the rancher will not put the yaks in the ranch and start caring for them. Honestly, I don't understand how something so basic can still be broken this far into the development cycle.I really wanted to like this game. The concept is great, and I was in love with the idea of building, staffing, and defending my own fortress city.Unfortunately, the AI is just not there, and without the ability to directly command the gnomes, it is often difficult to complete tasks.In the mid to late game, you will find yourself frantically trying to get your gnomes to do basic tasks like craft critical ingredients, and nothing you do will convince them to do it.

												New review:1.0 is out. It's fun, but still game-breaking bugs and, worstly, several design issues. No depth in the game. As some other reviewer perfectly described, Gnomoria is just a paid tutorial to Dwarf Fortress (even when Gnomoria has no tutorial itself).Old review:Great potential, specially if you are planning to learn something more affordable before jumping to Dwarf Fortress, but too buggy at this present state (0.9.17). It's frustrating when you spend hours trying to do a thing that you are doing it right but it's just a bug in the game. My gnomes nearly die of thirst even when I had a brewery, nearly 200 fruits, an order of making a minimum of 100 wine, two or three gnomes with the brewery profession, and brewery at highest priority. Assigning to a gnome didn't work, the one who made all the wine in the settlement before, so I had to manually delete all his other profesions. And this is only one of workshops that suddenly stops working for no apparent reason.I'll check again the game when it's 1.0. This game will be a joy when everything is working. But until it's fixed and playable, better spend your time learning Dwarf Fortress.			"

Partly, the problem is actually being able to see, since the game forces you into an isometric view. The game needs ladders from the beginning, or a tool that makes a multilevel ramp. As in, click & drag and the ramp goes further and further down, instead of making a row of ramps...			"

Early Access Review
								Gnomoria is, of course, a population management sim in the vein of the venerable Dwarf Fortress. While not nearly as in-depth as DF(as one might expect), it does bear a similar ""feel"" to that game, The main strengths Gnomoria has in comparison are its graphics and interface. Both are much improved and more intuitive.. The game suffers from its combat system, however; enemies are universally much stronger than many of your citizens put together. Seven of my gnomes, even with metal armor and military training, were unable to best a monitor lizard.The result of this is that combat is futile and therefor pointless, and the best way to protect your citizens is with traps, the more useful of which come at the very end of the tech tree. Ultimately, however, with infrastructure then conquered and enemie tamed, the game becomes one less of one against an antagonistic force, but your own patience, as you wrangle resources to keep gnomes from starving and making torches to keep even MORE unstoppable enemies from spawning in the depths of your fortress.On a personal note, I gain enjoyment from this style of game in the form of creation of sprawling urban centers and impressive mega-projects. Lacking the first, the second stands by itself, relegating Gnomoria, for me, into being a rather slow and program for making isometric art. Perhaps the game could be improved by combat balancing and more engaging character behavior.			"

												No tutorial. Very slow gameplay. Gnomes only seem to work when/if they feel like it. You will constantly have to micromanage every gnome to get them to do the jobs you want. Could use a much better interface with more feedback to the player about why things are or arent happening. Pacing should be sped up, it takes so long to start that you lose interest before anything really happens.			"

												Bought this in 2013 in Early Access. It released this year finally. It took 4 minutes to generate a map that had graphics similar to an early 80's videogame console system. It looks like it is running at about 1 or 2 frames per second.There is no tutorial. There was supposed to be a tutorial. Don't buy this game unless you already know how to play this game.It took 20 seconds to save my game before exiting.Maybe when I load it up next time to get my last 2 trading cards, my gnomes will have figured out how to pick up the logs from the trees they cut down. If the tutorial has been put in by then, maybe I will figure out how to make them do it.			"

								This game, while it seems to be very similar to Dwarf Fortress, is much more annoying to control. Yes, it's nice how much the mouse is used. However, the problem is the isometric view. It has happened quite often to me, that I gave digging orders for the wrong areas or simply not noticed something that was directly behind a wall. I would rather play Dwarf Fortress, which, while certainly having less spekaing for it in the way of graphics, provides a much clearer overview over your fortress.Now, do not mistake me for saying this game is bad. It certainly is not. But there is a better one available and for a smaller price.			"

								""That's the most useless review I've ever seen"" - Said by someone about my last review of the game.Here is the new review, which will hopefully prove that there are much more useless reviews than the one I wrote before.Gnomoria is an interesting kind of game. You do some stuff, in this place, with these things. Eventually you can do more stuff, and then you can't do any more stuff because all the stuff is done.I've played other games where you do stuff, but the stuff you do in Gnomoria is different from the stuff you do in most other games.Overall, I enjoyed doing stuff in Gnomoria, and if you like doing stuff too, maybe you'll like the stuff that you can do in Gnomoria.10/10 - Would certainly do stuff again.

								Not sure what the appeal is. But this is really awful game technology and hardly usable UI. The little gnomes ""move"" by disappearing and reappearing in isolated blink movements, and to actually drill down onto one of them you have to first select the ground, then select the appropriate item in that block. The landscape is only visible among two height levels; scroll wheel is like an elevator where things suddenly disappear as you go higher/lower. While I would really love to set up a workshop, and a little home for each little gnome, and add decor, and so on, well, no, I really, absolutely would not. What a pain!!			"

												The in-game font is hard to read and very small. This became a huge issue on a normal 24"" 1920x1080 monitor, and my eyesight is otherwise excellent. Reducing the game's fullscreen resolution does alleviate problem to some degree, but that introduces blurry TFT scaling. (And the font still remains hard to read because of its design.)Speaking of resolutions, the game always crashes upon changing fullscreen settings or the resolution.Otherwise the game seems aesthetically pleasing and the orchestrated music is nice to listen to. Here's hoping the font gets a makeover at some point, or at least text scaling options are introduced.			"

Early Access Review
								This game will drain away many hours of your life.   Nevermind the early access designation.  This game has been completely playable for a couple years, and has been getting updated/bug fixes and new features regularly for years.The game was originally posted on Desura(Where I bought it), but desura has gone defunct, and now its here on steam.To be honest, Im not sure why its designated early access.  The game functions as well as any finished product.  Possibly because the developer still has big plans for this game yet.  I dont know.There is no reason not to get this game.   Its underpriced at $7.99.   I think I payed $20 for it over a year ago. No regrets. no complaints.About the Game:  It does have a a somewhat steep learning curve, and you will find yourself starting over alot until you get a system figured out.  But you wont find it discouraging at all.  Its actually gratifying to come up with your own methods of survival.  Do you build farms right away? Or rely on foraging for food in the first year.  Do you build a well?  Or rely on yakmilk for drink.  Do you build a wall and limit your resources in exchange for safety?  Or do you risk your gnomes to dangers of the wild to have access to to everything.  Do you begin training your militia right away or wait til you have secured your sustenance for the coming years.   How deep do you delve early on to find minerals underground? because the deeper you go, the more dangerous it becomes for mining...Once you have secrued your sources of basic sustenence for survival, and trained up a basic militia to guard against wild animals and goblin attacks..   you can then begin constructing your ... whatever you can imagine.  Castles....  underground complexes...    This game is like a minecraft meets dwarf fortress...I have one friend here on steam who I showed this game to. He now has over 900 hours of playtime in Gnomoria.  I have alot of time in ti myself, but it was mostly before it came to steam. I recommend watching a few 'lets play gnomoria"" on youtube first to get a feel for what this game really looks like.			"

I didn't really expect to be blown away, DF (despite the graphics) is a beautifuly complex and ever growing bundle of Fun (plus, it's free to play), and it's hard to beat that. I tried to not be ... too biased. Still, I'm left with a feeling of ""eh...""It's probably a great intro game, or younger kid game. Maybe? If you like Gnomoria, I would suggest you try your hand with DF. There are tile sets out there, so don't be too afraid. Overall, I'm glad I didn't actually pay for this game.			"

Perhaps I have not learned enough about it to fully understand.Maybe updates will come along and clear this up, or more walk-through guides will surface. Either way, this game wasn't for me.

								This game wants to be Dwarf Fortress lite. First few hours of gameplay it looks like it succeeds spendidly at that. Later on however it becomes apparent that the game is not only beautiful, but terribly balanced in the way it equickly escalates the difficulty of incoming enemies based on 'kingdom worth' (a measure of the technological advancement of the player kingdom). The best strategy becomes to be walled in all the time and let the enemy starve.Managing the economy quickly becomes a tedium (even compared to Dwarf Fortress) because of the exponentially growing number of interdependencies between production facilities (e.g. 1 trap requires engineering components, which require metal bars, which require coal, which has to be mined or burnt from wood, all-in-all generatig, automatically, tens of job orders that can fail or get stuck for various reasons and need to be diagnosed).Overall Gnomoria looks much better than it actually plays. I'll wait for the beta to be over and give it another go, but considering the current game is considered close to release (version 0.9) I'm not holding my breath.			"

								Ok so heres the thing, I dont think gnomoria is necesarilly a bad game. I honestly dont know if its good or bad, because ive barely played any. The thing is, I have very little experience with games like gnomoria, and upon entering the game, I found no easily accessible form of instructions. Im not asking for a tutorial, but even just a short, basic intro to the general principals of the game to set you on your way. If you understand these types of games, or have the patience the go learn how to play, then by all means, you should try it out.  But if you're like me and are too lazy to go off and find a video on how to play or find an intro somewhere, then hope that when this game is officially released, it has some way to introduce new players to itself			"

								It's an okay game but it, like towns, is a dwarf fortress clone with less features and less responsive citizens. The only real upside to it is that building upwards is less of a chore and the graphics look nice, but at present, the free game that is dwarf fortress gives you more and it'd cost you less to donate to that absolutely free game.Admittedly DF is clunky, but it is moddable, has mods, plenty mods, gets better with mods and while it's getting updated with sparse frequency, I wouldn't reccommend -another- DF clone that has quite a few glaring bugs and doesn't seem to be updated all that frequently for a game that's supposed to be early access.it seems like it could be a 6 or 7 out of 10 game, which means it isn't a bad game by any means, but there's better things out there than what this currently offers you, for -zilch- out of your wallet.It's promising enough, hence the 65%-ish which I'm allowing it with the benefit of doubt.But there are issues. blocks that refuse to vanish, unresponsive (at times) gnomes, clunky isometric controls that aren't quite targeting the things you're trying to get at. Even for seasoned players of this particular type of games it's frustrating to learn the order in which you have to excavate a thing to avoid floating floors in the middle of your glorious construction.And it has an aversion to giving you enough -base- materials early on to actually get you going.This is just to name a few of the things I remember from last I played it, in december.Maybe if they could at least, for a game that pretty much grabs dwarf fortress and removes the fortress and all the things in it, and renames dwarf as gnome, refine what they have - I might reccommend it to people that don't like the -potential- complexity of DF if they did that much. Until then, this isn't quite the game it should be. It's not an issue of something as hipster-y as being casual or any notion of that silly word, it's an issue of cloning something imperfectly.But then.. that's just my opinion, keep that in mind.			"

								Apart from gnomria I also have rimworld and spacebase df9. These are all very similar in style. Gnomoria is possibly a good game, one day, but at the moment it is unintuitive to use. There are lots of options but no clear indication why you would use them and to what end. A game with this level of complexity should scaffold the player into it, remove options until you are ready for them. Have on screen hints as to what you may want to do next.I don't like the UI of the game, the options are dense and unclear, the build process using the mouse is awkward and cannot be easily undone. The graphics are pretty lame. I understand people get into the whole retro stuff. Us older players who cut their teeth on 8-bit micros are not so keen to have pixlelated characters that don't animate.I will keep an eye on this game see where it at in a year's time. Ine the meantime I will get my base building fun out of other titles.			"

								A rather unbalanced game with artifical difficulty that punishes you for not knowing in depth numbers that no regular player should really know about. After my 3rd play with getting still slaughtered by goblins that easily kill 5-6 gnomes equipped for fight I'm still at lost what do I do wrong.Now I'm not a new to this genre I did play enough Dwarf Fortress to know how to build efficient settlement and what to concentrate first on. No dabbling in merchandise crafts, no furniture, just basic workshops, farms and metallurgy to get gnomes equipped in weapons and some armor to deck out one squad of military.I guess there are some hidden numbers or cheesy strategies that more or less abuse game mechanics, but that should NOT be requirtement to play the game.I did like the UI improvement and mouse/keyboard interface, that a huge step up from ASCII DF.So do yourself a favor and skip this one, there are better survival games out there.

								While not as complex as Dwarf Fortress this game has a certain charm to it. However crippling lag prevents many people myself included from enjoying it. As well it seems as though some of the requirements and general exploration and economy is broken. Monsters spawn underground after depth -7 if it is dark styming the ever worsening quest for coal. Which is itself needed to make those torches. Wood in particular is a mystery. It takes vast amounts to make a workshop or bed. Also it can be used in lieu of coal by having a furnace. The way workshops interact to provide resources to each other, as well as the well done but perhaps not totally tuned military system are high points.A lot of people however are unable to play this game past 15 or so gnomes due to intense system lag on even very robust machines. As well the game, pun unintended, lacks depth. You get migrants. You build your town. You mine ever further down. No caves (there are tiny ones for monsters to spawn) or other features impress enough to enable a solid game experience. This game would be quite the gem with its simple if a tad akward interface if a few features were improved.1. Lag needs to be fixed the game feels like it is just oozeing memory loss on 16+gb. This is a notable problem with indie games not being properly optimized to work with multiple cores or just not having tight code.2. More going on underground. The spawning monsters in dark sections is a alpha feature of Minecraft. A alpha feature that became the standard for his game due to Notch's laziness. Perhaps having undiscovered things underground which produce or allow monsters to come in on map edges in cave systems. Spawning increasingly higher level skeletons just because it was dark is obnoxious and easily sidestepped by torch spam. Have the underground features possibly be inactive till discovered if lag is a problem. Things like golem factories or lost temples. 3. More factions or civilizations to interact with. Traders, gnomads and fort value = higher level monsters is too basic.4. Perhaps rudimentary physics for unsupported titles. They are especially cumbersome.While a fun couple hours and a good visual interface. This really fails to deliver a solid city builder experience. The crippling lag is especially disheartening and problamatic.I could see recommending this game in the future if it improves. Unfortunately I have many reservations about early access games due to experience with them putting in placeholders then calling them final features.			"

								Despite being, essentially, a game about surviving gnomes, the graphics seem very similar to Dwarf Fortress. You know, the part that lets you understand what the heck is going on in your game. It IS basically Dwarf Fortress with, uh, gnomes. You go around, collect resources, build houses, set stockpiles, etc. Now, I would've liked this game if it weren't a bit of a Dwarf Fortress ripoff. The music was unappealing because it sounded like it should come from a Commodore 64. Though I honestly don't like the idea of making a whole game out of a visionary system for a game that happened 8 years ago, which, was suprisingly popular for a set amount of years, I don't think Gnomoria got off on the right foot in general. They didn't just copy and paste, though. They added different features, like an ingame time warp option, which features three settings: Paused, Slow, and HOLY CRAP WHAT'S GOING ON! Yes, I did just make that joke, but now that I think about it, EA deserved it more (So pretend I never made that joke. I can make an EA game review and use that.). They also added a bunch of graphs. You can take all my money and kill me when someone says ""Graphs! Oh goody. Now I don't have to worry about NOT being confused!"" Overall: The game had a lot of potential, but the music just really got on my nerves. But if you're deaf, this game's  perfect!			"

								I grabbed this as an impulse buy during the Greenlight Sale (and a hate/love cycle with Dwarf Fortress) last year for 1.99 or 2.99. Frankly, that is all that it is worth. The game captures a fleeting glimpse of what Dwarf Fortress could look like with some serious effort on creating a GUI. Basic facts... even after quite some time, the game has only been updated a few times. There really isn't much to the game at all and generally makes you long for ASCII blips running around the screen creating all sorts of fun (pure chaos for the un-initiated). It doesn't hold up as a survival game as it's comically easy to become self sufficient and there is very little variety, surprises and depth to the building/mining side of things. If you're looking for a diamond in the rough, this isn't it. Could it be good some day? Yes, maybe - but at the current rate of improvement it won't be during anyone here's lifetime.			"

								Gnomoria appears to be a perfect game in every way. Upon downloading and launching up however, it is a different story. This game looks absolutely amazing, and I have no doubt its fun, but for someone like me, (someone who is new to these kinds of games), tutorials are great. And Gnomoria lacks one completely. Though there is a control config, and you can figure out most of the buttons (kind of), its a hassle to be sitting there confused and without any direction. On top of that, if you assign workers to do something they may or may not do it. Even if they do, itll only usually be one or two of them, even if you assign them all to do it. My opinion of the game? The game itself could be terrible or fun, but no matter what, don't get this game if you are not familiar with these controls. It's that simple.			"

								To be honest Gnomoria is not very good, even when compared with other ""Dwarf-likes"" like Towns. Gnomoria's gameplay is both slow and painful, some design decisions are not very well thought out, and there doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to play this game when compared to Dwarf Fortress. There are also many infuriating mechanics: all my soldiers, while training, managed to die by bleeding to death.It's also hard to understand why production is always murderously slow -- the result is that many existing issues make the game infuriating or annoying.

								A simple and better-looking Dwarf Fortress. What a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ First of all, the simplicity isn't exactly a selling point, so you'd mostly be trading for the latter. Is this a better looking game than Dwarf Fortress? Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing not. This game looks plain ugly. I suppose the other reason to consider this other DF is the fact that i's sort of 3D - once again, not a good thing. Most of the time you'll be struggling to see whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it is you're doing. Also, the music dogshit. Yes, even worse than the endless loop of DF's two string tune. All of this could be forgivable if did anything particularly interesting, but it doesn't. It's literally just DF for babies. I suppose this isn't the most explicit review out there, but it doesn't really need to be. If you really feel like paying money to pay a ♥♥♥♥♥ier version of DF, then this is it. Otherwise, play the original game that inspired this atrocity, which is ♥♥♥♥ing free.			"

								Dear Consumer, This game is incredibly difficult to get into. You'll spend more time  on the internet trying to find out what to do, then actually spending time playing the game.

More like thrown to the wolves without any help... Cons:-It has the worst in-game music ever produced. You'll be muting it/turning it off within the first 5 minutes. - It has NO TUTORIAL- It has an insane amount of advanced options that won't make any sense to the ""new"" person. -Most Importantly  it's too confusing, and honestly it's not worth the amount of time it takes to read how to play the game, just to play the game.  Terraria is WAY more fun. I'm posting this to WARN OTHERS.  Do not buy. Unless you enjoy a suspended state of confusion.  "

								I got this game for one dollar, so I cant complain too much. Its worth that for sure, but I had played a game called Towns a long long time ago. When I started playing Gnomoria, it just made me want to go play Towns. Towns has heroes, you craft your own armor/weps, so many more options to choose from. In Towns you start on the surface of an underground dungeon, so monsters await you, getting harder as you delve deeper. Gnomoria only has raids, which Towns has too. So yah, there is almost zero reason to play this game over Towns.			"

								BRUTALLY BROKEN WITH NO TUTORIAL! I was able to figure out somewhat how to play the game. Sorta if you can call it that. I'm talking I had it on easy to try out and I get one of my guys killed by a monster that random spawns in my home 4 hours in. I have 4 guys attack and kill it. I have a Hospital room set up and plenty of bandages and people working as DR.s and SHAZAM he still bleeds out after a very short time. I see no real way to get more Gnomes. I had one show up totally random but lost 4 in the process of learning how to make bandages.That clearly don't seam to work. Then figure the hospital room aspect out and 3 dudes spent about 10 to 15 minutes in there with wounds that didn't kill them but were apparently enough to have all my other gnomes spend all this time taking care of them. They keep running off to do things they don't need to do verses tasks I'm telling them to. The combat isn't really even there. I know this is  ""In Bata"" But holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had higher hopes perhaps? But in it's current state first impression is very bad. I wanna be nice and be like this is fun. But just being honest. How can I build a defence when monsters randomly spawn in my walled in home ?

What happened? My gnomes died, and then the game automatically deleted my save game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Youd think that maybe the devs could add an option to disable unwanted game features.

								The game has promise in concept but the jerky movement, confusing interface, and lack of a smooth gameplay make me feel like going back to my old Commodore 64 instead. At least I get nice sprite animations that way. This game reminds me of those old 1990s games for Windows you would find on a Freeware CD. Old-looking graphics are fine but at least it would be nice if the characters would not pop around from tile to tile in a Japanese Seizure Robots way.  It's a chore to play, like a better version of the infamous ""Towns"".I come back to the game from time to time and check out the features. I am waiting for a really slick UI, a tutorial that makes sense, but I doubt I will see it.  There are no tips in the game and I should not have to watch a 20 minute YouTube video explaining how to play when I have played games for decades. Perhaps if I spent 3 hours learning how to play well I would be one of the positive reviewers, but this one does not inspire me to play at all. I click on the ground and it tells me what the terrain is with an annoying box that says ""grass"" I must close. Really?  Great idea, terrible execution.			"

								Essentially Dwarf Fortress-lite, and I mean that as a compliment rather than ""hurr durr lacking depth like acorn falling engine"". It's very enjoyable, even in this state. Updates are slow as one man alone is working on this, but progress has been moving along at a regular pace, if not a blistering one, which I find more refreshing than having major updates at unnanounced intervals that could be a long time apart. If you wanted to check out DF but like me was very intimdated with the, well, everything, check this out, it's well worth it, even at thi stage and especially for this price.			"

								Graphically, Gnomoria is somewhat inferior to the much-maligned and unsuccessful Towns - that being said, in every other way it is superior to that now-defunct game. Gnomoria is better designed, with an interface that gives you many more options for terraforming and production and allows you to keep better control of all aspects of your settlement (if you so desire). The citizen and soldier AI is much better, resulting in more production efficiency and fewer random casualties. Unlike Towns, Gnomoria provides a slew of pre-game customization options to fine-tune your game, and there are no 'unused' or 'useless' objects - everything you mine or forage can be crafted or re-purposed into something else. Gnomoria's audio - both in sound effects and music - also enjoys much better quality and diversity, providing alot of good atmosphere. Think of this game as a graphically-superior, 3D version of Dwarf Fortress, with the capacity to be made less utterly brutal. While it lacks the hero/dungeon crawling aspect of Towns, its sheer superiority in nearly every other category, combined with the clear dedication of this developer to keep working on it (unlike its now-completely unsupported genre step-sibling) makes Gnomoria the clear choice for anyone wanting a deep and engaging fantasy kingdom-building sim.

								I recommend this game based on the fun I have with it now - not in the beginning. At first Gnomoria felt not even broken, more like intentionally infuriating. The User Interface is clunky and feels way outdated and this game DESPERATELY NEEDS A TUTORIAL! When you start off not knowing what ""Designating Area"" does for you and you just assign gnomes to do tasks in a complicated menu, you'll find yourself just angry that tasks are taking so long and building seems impossible.Pre-Requisite workshops that build only one item are sort of a time waste. The only one of these that felt like it actually helped was the Sawmill. It took me several hours to realize what lead to what and I spent more time on Google than I did in game. Here's where I think Tooltips would help. Some sort of Hover-over text for the different workshops would be amazing and save tons of frustration.After doing the research, assigning positions, and learning the sort of ""Tech Tree"" of Gnomoria I have had tons of fun. Battles are rewarding, builds feel interesting, and this game sits in an interesting medium between The Sims, Farmville, and MineCraft. I have a weakspot for Isometric art and I love the sprite work for the game. I have fun now that I know what I'm doing but learning to do so was one of the worst times I've had as a hard core gamer.			"

								I grabbed this game off the Winter sale, and already love it. So far I've had gnomes beat goblins with chopped off limbs, yaks kicking goblins in the face, and gnomes that've died due to my incompetency (approaching 100 now). Something nice about this game is that it's only as complex as you want it to be (to a point). You can read play-by-plays of fights your gnomes are in, have dedicated jobs, or just a bunch of ""jack of all trades"". It's been a game I enjoyed losing in, without being difficult and not having ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics (Dwarf Fortress) or terrible/unwieldly controls (Dark Souls without a gamepad) while still being fun in a Civilization+Minecraft kind of way. I recommend this game to anyone looking to have some Minecraft ""Steves"" to boss around while still having an interesting learning curve and progression. The interface is easy to use, although multiple windows for assinging or changing jobs would be nice. The enemies are as difficult as you make them with the ability to change the frequency and strength of attacks or preventing them from managing your kingdom's worth. Battles are interesting, with smart enemies attacking areas where your gnomes aren't armored and wildlife doing great amounts of damage. It's a good game.			"

								This is essentially a (greatly reduced) Dwarf Fortress simplified and with a more accessible visual front end. Dwarf Fortress had TOO many choices and far too much chance for way too much ""fun"" (Dying is Fun!) early in the game. Lately on newer versions of DF I was hard pressed to survive the first year as more and more opponents were added. Gnomoria is a similar experience with a little more positive feedback. It's stll not an easy game and currently you'd better hit the Gmnomoria wiki if you want your gnomes not to have too much ""fun"". Even then if you attract nasty things you'll be having ""fun"" aplenty...Hopefully this will get extended and finally completed.			"

								It isn't Dwarf-Fortress. But it's the next best thing.Gnomoria is a city-building/kingdom management game directly influenced by the beloved dorf-fort; You and your small little group of gnomads are plonked into a procedurally generated map with nothing but a few basic supplies, and are expected to carve out a glorious mountainhome in the name of profit, prosperity, and beards. At it's core, the game is essentially DF boiled down to the basics; it doesn't contain the sheer depth of the older game, lacking world simulation, history, the in-depth tracking of every single personality trait, physical features and relationships of every living entity in the world, or any of the other features that makes DF as amazeballs as it is. In place of these things, however, Gnomoria has one vital feature that many dorflikes lack; Accessibility.  Half the challenge of DF is learning to navigate the convoluted, inconsestent, and ugly interface, with no mouse support. Not to mention learning to read the initially indecipherable code that makes up the world; first-time DF players may as well be seeing into the matrix, and while graphics packs are available, the game will still look fairly ugly and confusing to many people.Gnomoria, on the other hand, has a clean, simple interface that can be fully navigated via keyboard hotkeys, or using the mouse. All of the commands are in fairly intuitive and logical places, and you probably won't find yourself unable to find anything specific. The visuals are clearer too; Gnomoria plays from an isometric perspective, and while the character/creature sprites could use some work, the game has a nice, clean style that looks decent without making things look cluttered or confusing.The game also has some nice logistical improvements over DF; namely, the ability to set priorities and stocks on workshops. This allows you to automate production of goods, to an extent; when you select ""craft to X"", the gnomes with the appropriate skills, or the one assigned to the workship, will keep crafting that particular product until it reaches the desired quantity, then stop. If stocks ever fall below that value, they'll top it up again. Combined with some clever priority management, this allows individual gnomes to have multiple jobs while still maintaining a constant, efficient production line. For example, charcoal can be made from wood in a furnace, and can be used in a smelter with some ore to create bars. Crafting to, say, 10, on the charcoal production job, will insure that there's always enough fuel available to smelt the ore, but will make sure you don't use up all the wood, overfill the stockpiles, and constantly tie up gnomes in hauling/wood burning jobs. This feature also applies to resource gathering, to an extent; in addition to the farms that already exist in DF, Gnomoria features 'Groves', which allows trees to be planted, harvested and/or cut down in an area, without manually ordering mass deforestation whenever you run low. Pastures can also be automated; you can set a certain population threshold in a pasture, and excess animals will be butchered without any manual input from you. This keeps things from getting out of hand or annoying.The game doesn't quite contain as much Fun as DF; while there are plenty of things that can kill you, and you are almost guaranteed to fall into decline eventually, without the use of cheese tactics like walling in, the game is much more forgiving than DF, and doesn't include the bane of all forts, the tantrum spiral. Catocalpyse, seiges, demonic invasions, attack by megabeast, disease, vampire attacks, murders and magma, flooding and fey moods,  all of these things are missing right now, making the game less Fun, but still fun.In short, this is definitely worth looking at if you're interested in the genre, but don't have the patience for DF, but hardcore Dwarf-Fort players will probably find the lack of content, smaller scale and general fairness of the game a little unfulfilling.

								Basically a graphically improved Dwarf Fortress, from what I understand it's competitor, ""Towns"", has a bad developer, who doesn't update frequently at all. If you're unwilling to slog it out with Dwarf Fortress (understandibly), there really isn't a better choice out there. Though I would suggest ""Banished"" as another game along the same vein as this, it's not out quite yet at the time of this writing, but within a few days it will be released.			"

The game also starts very slow and probably stays slow for the first 10+ hours you play. Take a day off to start..However after I got playing for a bit and actually figured out what I was doing, I found that there's an immense amount of things you can craft, and even more things you need to craft before you can craft what you want to craft.... right?Also, I love the random generated names.

								The first thing I noticed about Gnomoria was that it feels alot like Dwarf Fortress, which is one of my long standing favorites. The nice part is that it adds a nice 3D feel to it with the isometric non-ASCII graphics. Considering it's still under development, I predict great things for this game. The basic controls are simplistic and the gamplay allows for months of fun. I highly recomend this game to anyone that is even considering this game.A tutorial might be helpful for new players of the genre, but otherwise, keep at it.10/10			"

								If you like building your own kingdom from scratch then this game does this very well and more. Gnomoria has a simple graphics style which is the beauty of it. It really compliments the game play and spending hours on it doesn't seem to be a problem. Even as an early access game, Gnomoria offers so many choice and feels as if it is already a complete game. Starting out may seem intimidating as no tutorial is provided. It may take time but give it time and patience and what you'll find is a very powerful game and not surprising much better than most games in its genre. I really recommend it and for its price, it really outdid itself. If you're still skeptible about it, wait for a sale. Even at 50% this game is magnificant.			"

You could attribute it to the narcotics, but it takes a great game to hold anyone's attention for that long, no matter how out of their minds.Plus, I love that it's still being updated.  I love opening up Steam and seeing ""Gnomoria update: new enemies."" It feels like the Minecraft alpha.Overall, what seems like a Dwarf Fortress clone actually improves on the mechanics started in that game. It makes the game more accessible while retaining the ""learn as you play"" mentality.			"

								It is Dwarf Fortress. Whether that's a bad thing or a good thing, is up to you. Where Towns takes some liberties on the formula, Gnomoria is a much more straight remake. They take ease of use pretty seriously, though, and the game is infinitely more playable than DF. The game gets patched on a weekly basis and the creator is continuously adding lots of new convenience features and more content. Compared to DF, it has much easier menu navigation (with full mouse support, obviously), greatly reduced micro management (issue an order to build a workshop, and orders to build the necessary components for it will automatically get sent to your other workshops!), much easier resident management, and so forth. It also has much less detail (no randomly generated descriptions based on your fortress's history for statues, for example), but they're adding more and more of that all the time. It's still not an easy game, mind you, and there's no tutorial so you will need either a wiki or a lot of patience to learn the general flow of things.Thing I like the most about it: General ease of play, it's super easy and relaxing to just lean back in your chair and watch the fortress go about its business as you just casually issue some orders every now and again. Thing I like the least: It's still pretty complex from a mechanics standpoint with a horrible lack of tooltips and no tutorial, making it not a simple task to learn. Thing I want patched in the most: Emotions. It's actually the one thing from DF I miss the most. Your Gnomes have no mood and always behave the same way no matter what.Overall, really fun game and is easily worth the price if you're willing to jump in early knowing that it's still an alpha/beta/whatever they're calling it.

								Gnomoria Reviewby DaniAngione----------------------------Art - 8 / 10Sound - 7.5 / 10Gameplay - 9 / 10Emotional - 10 / 10Community - 10 / 10----------------------------Overall - 8,9----------------------------** Check my profile to understand my scoring system**What looks like a simpleton cousin of Dwarf Fortress is actually a fantastic game of it's own, full of personality. Not as complex as the Bay 12 classic, at least not for now, but is certainly worthy hundreds of hours of fun, building your kingdom, training your troops, conducting crazy and useless super-constructions, mining greedly and dying miserably :)Gnomoria feels and plays like an alpha - because that's what it currently is. However it can only go straight up to the pantheon of divine sandbox games, since even as early as it is, the game is already brilliant. RoboBob, the mind behind Gnomoria, works to evolve the game weekly. Literally. Patches are out every tuesday and they're usually very tasty, tasty enough to make me start another kingdom every now and then.As the game fleshs out, there will probably be a lot more to do, more enemies, more resources and more FUN! - if you know what I mean - and that's exactly where Gnomoria beats me. I absolutely love sandboxes, playing with destiny and creating your own stories and legends. Who never heard the tale about the Fall of the Diamond Halls before the mighty Mant army? Well, probably no one because that happened to me and I never told anyone about it - but I certainly could. Gnomoria is that perfect kind of game where you create a story and every story is different, every story is your own and you have to live it until you get to the inevitable end.Sweet pixel graphics and a really enjoyable soundtrack (Seriously, the siege music is amazing.) completes this great game promising future.

However unlike towns, which is already ""out"" and barely functioning, Gnomoria is still in beta (alpha?) and already the interface works fairly well and there are a lot of options, things to build and so on. While the game does not have much depth beyond making your town and surviving the ocasional onslaught of enemies (that are extreemly deadly), it is a fun mix of minecraft and a city builder like so many others have tried to do. Worth 10$? Maybe, worth while on sale? Yes.			"

Early Access Review
								Amazing game. I never expected to put as much time in to it as I have, and I still want to play more. The game is a simplified and more user friendly version of Dwarf Fortress. Starting with just a few gnomads, you assign jobs and tasks for the gnomes to perform in order to build a kingdom and dig up riches. Fans of god games, city builders, or other management games will find lots to like. The game is mostly feature complete as it stands.My only real complaint is that there isn't much of an end game. Population is value based, and kind of peters out after a certain point so you can't expand endlessly. After a few game years there isn't much to do besides build interesting structures. However, the game worlds are random so each new game differs slightly.The graphics are rather simple, there is very little animation, and the sound effects are kind of annoying so the presentation isn't the greatest. So if those things are important you may want to pass.I've had this game since it was in alpha (it's currently in beta as of this writing). The lone developer, RoboB0b has done a great job getting significant releases out every 2 weeks or so. The game is stable with only a few crashes here and there. Hotfixes are released very fast when a new bug slips through in an update.Many people compare this game to Towns. Having played this first and then trying Towns, this game is superior in my opinion.Word of warning for pontential buyers. There is no tutorial currently, so bone up with a let's play or a Steam guide before diving in. For the price, this game is a steal.			"

								This game is essentially Dwarf Fortress for the masses. It's not as complex as DF, but it doesn't have to be. It's like Battlefield to Arma, where DF is Arma.If you have wanted to play DF but couldn't get into it for whatever reason, this game is a great alternative.			"

								Absolutely great game. Very deep and fun gameplay.If you were somehow able to control several players on minecraft and tell them what to harvest, build, kill, etc and added skills, and character growth then you'd basically have Gnomoria.If you're into games like Minecraft or Don't Starve then you'll likely enjoy this one.I highly recommend it and call it one of the top games I've ever played.

It's just Dwarf Fortress with gnomes.Gnomoria is clearly developed based on Dwarf Fortress, but it has a quicker release schedule and has a lot of features (you know, like sprites) that don't come natively with Dwarf Fortress. It takes a bit of time to get your settlement up and running, but the complexity of keeping your Gnomes alive from invaders and keeping your economy running before you reach a ""Golden Age"" is definitely something worth experiencing.

								I've not played this game for a while, but if you're after Dwarf Fortress-lite then this is pretty much the best of the bunch. It doesn't have many of the outlandish scenarios that DF has but it's still a great little management sim and they're updating at a fairly steady clip by the looks of things. The interface is almost entirely mouse controlled and it's responsive and sensible in layout, which is the main (and most valid) criticism against DF.But if you throw the DF comparison aside, this is a more than capable sim.

Though I would suggest ""Banished"" as another game along the same vein as this, it's not out quite yet at the time of this writing, but within a few days it will be released.			"

The game also starts very slow and probably stays slow for the first 10+ hours you play. Take a day off to start..However after I got playing for a bit and actually figured out what I was doing, I found that there's an immense amount of things you can craft, and even more things you need to craft before you can craft what you want to craft.... right?Also, I love the random generated names.

Really, watching gnomes work, fight, dig, farm, slaughter, build, craft, tinker, mine and harvest is all incredibly addicting.

								Hello,Long story short: The Dwarf Fortress ""Clone"" to rule them all. Including Dwarf Fortress itself; I admit that Gnomoria is behind on the sheer volume of content that Dwarf Fortress has, but give it time. With updates released weekly, almost religiously, Gnomoria will take Dwarf Fortress by storm.There is something inherently wrong with requiring people to deal with ASCII graphics for superb gameplay. It's a grave injustice to the innovations in graphical capabilities to dwell on nostalgic memories of impotent, and eye straining ugliness. I only wish Tarn and Zach Adams would consolodate their efforts with Robert West. Of course, I wouldn't wish any of them to give up their dreams for my own desires.I'm happy to say that I have everything I could want in this genre, from this game alone. Shelving DF with fond memories, but without regret.Cheers,Michael			"

								Gnomoria does not yet have the depth of Dwarf Fortress, but it more than makes up for it by eschewing the blatant contempt for usability that has ensured DF never rises beyond cult fame.			"

								This game is pretty good. It is basicly Dwarf Fortress simplified with actual graphics. Still quite glitchy but hey, its early access. If you aren't really interested in dwarf fortess type games, wait until it is fully finished. However, if you like the idea of a fairly complex game with a lot of depth, strategy, and creativity then go for it (especialy on a sale).			"

								Gnomoria is a well done empire management game even as it stand in early access.  It has a lot of similarities to DwarfFortress but without the steep learning curve.  The UI does a good job of pointing you in the right directions as you start for the first time.  Like most management games there are a few things you have to figure out for yourself which will probably cause you to restart a few times.  A lot of the mundane management tasks have ways to make them less tedious so you can focus on expanding/growing and not making sure there are always enough widgets available.   "

								Do you value your time outside? Do you enjoy activities other than being glued to your PC? Would your loved ones contact emergency services if you went without contacting anyone for 3-4 days?If you answered no to these questions, then this game is for you. I just can't stop sometimes... Really, watching gnomes work, fight, dig, farm, slaughter, build, craft, tinker, mine and harvest is all incredibly addicting. Add to that the minecraft like ability to shape the world and build giant fortresses, and this game is like crack.Worst part is, it's not even finished. But, I can't pull away. It scares me for that reason. It's just that addictive.			"

								The Short: By far the best Dwarf-Fortress clone/remake.  That being said, it still has some issues.  I still want better in a town simulation/survival or whatever this genre is, but it is worth $5-10 bucks and some of your time.  However, Stonehearth looks like it has the potential to displace this game as #1.  Both games are still in Beta/Alpha, but Gnomoria is the only playable oneBackground:  Skip if you know what Dwarf-Fortress clone means.  This game is basically a town simulation/survival game.  1 part simcity, 1 part the sims, 1 parts RPG, 2 parts Minecraft.  You get a couple handful of gnomes.  You assign a bunch of tasks and the dwarves automatically set themselves out on whatever tasks are available and that you greenlit that specific gnome to do.  The gnomes are essentially AI version of minecraft players in the same way that a starcraft marine is an AI version of any FPS shooter.  Your gnomes level up, and you get more of them.  Since you need materials instead of money to build stuff, the game is a large part a giant crafting system.  The game has a lot of indepth control that you tweak, as well.  Oh, and enemies try to wreak your world during all this.Pro: Towns, Castle Story, Timber and Stone, and DwarfCorp all either are ♥♥♥♥♥ier or look to be ♥♥♥♥♥ier than this game.  Extreme amount of depth compared to most game, yet fun even if you don't know what you are doing.If you are into this type of game, it is baller to create your own self sufficient fortress slaying all the enemies and trading/building your way to wealth.Con: The biggest by far being the fact that it is single threaded.  At 2+ gnomes, you will be railing a single thread.  It will affect your frame and you will get stuttering eventually. The game strongly encourages meta-game thinking.  You will die/screwup/lose if you do not know how the behind the scenes mechanics work, and you may have half a castle built by then.  There are a bunch of ""cheap"" ways of getting around any challenge in the game as far as enemies are concerned.Once you get far enough in the game, you can give your gnomes enough work that it will take them a long time to complete.  The game only has a small speedup amount meaning you may need to leave the game running for several minutes before you really have anythign to do.			"

I've only played for a few hours but I know this is a game I will drain hundreds of hours into. If you enjoy Dwarf Fortress at all, you need to atleast play the demo of this game.If you didn't enjoy Dwarf Fortress or never cared to play it, you need to atleast play the demo of this game.This is a masterpiece that is still being ever so gently ground away, hopefully soon to become a complete piece of perfection and, believe me, for fans of the genre, it's very close.

								Gnomoria is basically Dwarf Fortress Lite.  This is not a bad thing.  It sacrifices some of the depth of Dwarf Fortress in order to bring you a working UI and graphics, while still capturing the essence of it.  You start with a handfull of gnomes, a seasons worth of suplies, two beasts of burdon, and a full year to entrench yourself before winter rolls in and everything stops growing.  Build great big fortresses, labarynths of tunnels, great big absurd structures that server no purpose at all, or whatever the heck you feel like.  The only real down side I can say for it is that it doesn't have an Adventure mode, allowing you to take a single Gnome out into the world and forge his tale.If you've ever wanted to play Dwarf Fortress but were intimidated by the esoteric controls, or difficult to comprehend visuals, Gnomoria's got you covered.If you've played Dwarf Fortress but found it too intense or complicated, but still want to play something like it, Gnomoria's got you covered.If you're a Dwarf Fortress veteran who wants a break from the sheer difficulty of Dwarf Fortress, but still wants to play Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria's got you covered.

Early Access Review
								I've really had a lot of fun on this seemingly simple, but highly addictive game! The gameplay allows the player to be both creative and to manage production efficiently as they chose. Although there are no explicitly defined objectives, the player will need to set their own objective in order for their kingdom to thrivePROSThe game is fun to play and you have good control of the game settings.Allows you to be creative and make your kingdom look how you want with a wide range of cosmetic features, or alternatively make a crude factory that pours out weapons to destroy your enemies with.There is a huge amount of objects in  the game your gnomes can make, although many have seemingly little use as of yet.It's the sort of game you can keep playing, there's always something you can do in your kingdom. You may occaisionally find yourself watching your gnomes advance, but that's a great opportunity to tidy up your great hall or something!There is always motivation to increase your score in the game (called kingdom wealth) as the higher it is the more gnomes join your kingdom.Game is still under development so new features are released periodically.It has a slight personal feel as your gnomes each have their own name and attributes, and you can chose where they live and their job. I like watching them gradually get better at their job.CONSSome may find the game quite slow paced. You only start with 9 gnomes and it can take quite a while to get things done.You can only have one savegame per kingdom. this makes the game more challenging, but it's very fustrating if you save the game, then are defeated soon after, as you don't have enough time to change that outcome and your kindom is lost forever.There are a lot of objects that don't actually do anything but increase your score. It makes sense to have a few objects for this purpose but there are more than necessary.There's a whole section on cooking food to make better food, but from a stragetic point of view there is no reason to actually do this as the 'better' food is worth the same as the raw food and altough fills your gnomes up more, is no justification for the amount of labour it takes up.The graphics are very primitive - I tihnk it suits the game quite well but this may be a con for some.There is no way to 'win' the game, although there will become a point where all the ores have been mined (days and days of gameplay) and continuing on may seem dull. I feel like perhaps the developers could add in a story mode as there are assesable objectives.These are all minor setbacks, the worst problem is the lag. This is a pixley 2D sprite game, so why in god's name does it lag a reasonably alright i7 laptop? You have to be playing the game for quite a while for the lag to occur and there are things you can do to reduce it, but it's still a pain.So overall, would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the continuous stragety and is intersted in creativity and/or designing production systems. Really hope they fix the lag, but I will continue to enjoy the game nethertheless and look forward to any new features.			"

								Wow! This game is very addictive.  It's a fun, good-looking, clean Dwarf Fortress game.  It's much easier to get into than Dwarf Fortress, though the initial learning curve is still very steep.  After you've got the basic dynamics, though, it's impossible to stop crafting and exploring.  It's also a fantastic deal since it's nominally an ""early access"" game but is, by far and away, the most polished and complete such game in the Store.			"

								A medi-eval Minecraft with an addictive soundtrack and build-features.  You can either do a peaceful city free of invaders and master your gnomes learning legendary crafting skills or defend against goblins and large Mants.  The unchanging settings can be annoying, such as suddenly finding out skeletons are spawning without properly planning how to counter them, so carefully pick which Kingdom is your peaceful SimCity and which is your combat, trap-ready fortress.  Don't pick this up if you don't have time!  The level of depth and tactics is intense, and those with a love for detail (or OCD) will love the degree of customization.  But if you enjoy playing with pixelated blocks, you'll love gnoministering a kingdom.			"

								Please to the developers - You have a phenomenal game so far but I hate magic in the game, I always prefer it to have a more authentic builder/crafter feel to things and it's PERFECT as is right now, PLEASE don't add magic and spells into the game. I am all for more classes/builds with crafting and creating items but the spells will ruin the game for me and I will be end up dropping it and not playing any more if that stuff comes into the game!!

								Gnomoria is a sim/sandbox/survival game where you command a bunch of gnomes to do things. Honestly that about sums it up.Some quick good/bad/ugly breakdown!Good- Fun game! - Complete sandbox experience where you can do pretty much anything- You can disable the awful music :)- Lots and lots of options for how you want your game set up. Lots of mountains? No mountains? Hate golems? Turn em off. Etc. Gold star for custom games and difficulties.Bad- No tutorial. It's your standard indie game ""hey go read a wiki or something"" start up. Thankfully, there are a lot of good guides both here on Steam and elsewhere so I recommend checking them out before diving in.- Graphics are a bit dated. I know this is very qualitative but they just don't have any zing to them. They aren't bad, but they aren't great. If you dig the sprites and the retro look, no complaints. - Music is awful. There, I said it. Thankfully you can turn it off. Unless you're that one guy who just has to have the game music on no matter what, you'll be fine.Ugly- My gnomes were slaughtered by a Honey Badger. He gave no ♥♥♥♥s.Overall. Buy it! It's a fun game. It reminds me a lot of Dwarf Fortress but with graphics. :)			"

								Really addictive game. You can play passively if you like to just build, or you can fight all kinds of enemys from bears to ogres. I like to do both, so I start out passively to build up my army and then ramp up the difficulty to take on hoards of enemies. there is a bit of a learning curve to get through with out much help. I just went on youtube and within 20mins had a complete idea of what to do. This Game has so many layers to it and the more you play the more you learn. It just sucks your time away and is great value. Sometimes the game has a few minor running issues with freezing every now and then, but considering this game is still a beta in development, its pretty fantastic. I would say you cannot go wrong if you like this type of game, and even if you dont, give it a try, it's so charming you will love it!			"

It's just Dwarf Fortress with gnomes.Gnomoria is clearly developed based on Dwarf Fortress, but it has a quicker release schedule and has a lot of features (you know, like sprites) that don't come natively with Dwarf Fortress. It takes a bit of time to get your settlement up and running, but the complexity of keeping your Gnomes alive from invaders and keeping your economy running before you reach a ""Golden Age"" is definitely something worth experiencing.

								I've not played this game for a while, but if you're after Dwarf Fortress-lite then this is pretty much the best of the bunch. It doesn't have many of the outlandish scenarios that DF has but it's still a great little management sim and they're updating at a fairly steady clip by the looks of things. The interface is almost entirely mouse controlled and it's responsive and sensible in layout, which is the main (and most valid) criticism against DF.But if you throw the DF comparison aside, this is a more than capable sim.

								This game is a Dwarf Fortress clone but without the feeling you're reading the matrix. That being said it is much less complex than DF, but the learning curve is still massive. Detailed event logs and names give the game some nice immersion; I was crushed when one of my soldiers died to a lucky blow from an ogre. Non-peaceful games can easily last 60+ hours, all of which feeling like you're rushing agaisnt the clock to arm your gnomes before the next raid. It took me (and from what I hear most people) at least a couple 5-hour games that end with a massacre to grasp the mechanics and strategies necessary to survive. The various hostiles you encounter scale nicely to your progress, making sure you never really feel like you can relax. Updates are pretty regular (Monthly until recently, now it's unscheduled big updates). Modding community is pretty active and mod support is coming. Cons:- The AI is extremely frustrating until you understand how to priotize things. There is no ""do this now"" button.- I've read that games that go on for 8+ years (100+ hours) can become unplayable because of low FPS. "

								This game is super fun and addicting, but, only IF you like the type of genre that this is. If you liked Towns, or Dwarf Fortress, or anything similar to those, you will enjoy this. It's a bit difficult to figure out, but once you do learn all the mechanics, and know what to do, you will spend hours building your small group of gnomes into a thriving kingdom.			"

								This is an excellent Dwarf Fortress-like game (more like DF-lite), urging you to keep your gnomes alive through asigning them jobs and tasks.  A definite tech tree, combat simulation, and mechanics make this game compelling to keep playing.  Graphics and sounds may look and sound simple, but the depth of the game is considerably higher than its face value.For those who like to create structures, temples, and self sustaining villages, this one is for you!(Did you like Sim City 2000, Dwarf Fortress, Banished, Age of Empires, Rimworld? Add this to your list!)Also, many plus points to the developer for making this game LINUX compatable... feels like this game's true home!			"

								I bought Gnomoria a while ago and played it non-stop for the longest time, fully enjoying every aspect of the game. But then, when I decided to change operating systems to Ubuntu I unknowingly locked gnomoria away for seemingly ever. Today I opened up steam to see in my Library an item I hadn't seen for a long time: Gnomoria. Imagine my surprise to see that the creators had taken the time to patch Linux support for the game I knew and loved. I'm writing this review to thank Robert West for taking the time to include support for a relatively minor OS. Now, where was I? Oh yes, goblin sandwiches to make, legendary wine to drink... "

								80 hours in and still haven't fleshed out the whole complexities yet.This game is not for the masses, this game, no matter what all the DF fans said, is already tilting towards the hardcore side, the graphics and the UI are intentionally backwards compared to most mainstream games, the depth and complexities that this game entails means that if they are all renderred HD3D for your viewing pleasures, only a supercomputer would be able to run it.Gameplay-wise, if you like management games, and always complains about those other management games being way too simple and not too challenging, this game is for you. Not only it is already a challenge just to survive, there are hordes and hordes of invasion. I'm still in my first world and non-challantly ticked the enemies getting stronger tickbox in the worldgen mode, and boy oh boy, if not for me taking care to backup saves after significant improvements, I wouldn't be able to make it into a fortifiable position that I have now, 80 hours later, if you're a hardcore person and is interested in iron-manning this game, well prepare to restart and regenerate the gamefor a whole lot of times.10/10 will bleed to death due to mants and then starving to death again.

								I'll be honest, I know this is an Early Access game but if they released it as is right now I would hardly be disappointed. Other than a few bugs with the map generator when you mess with coordinates(Having to divide by 2 to actually get the map you saw if you go too far out) I've had very few issues with this game. The best part, the game is maddeningly difficult, and incredibly satisfying once you get it running properly.I'll say this to spite what I've seen predominantly on forums for the game. You can create a self sustaining base without walling off, on all default settings, and build it up slowly. You just have to learn what you're doing. For a long time this game has held a special place in my heart because besides me and one friend I knew in real life, everyone on the internet was crying that it was too hard. Meanwhile we were just throwing some Gnomes unarmed on Way of the Gnome and defending the hordes. He even made sandwiches to feed his people with the Goblin Flesh.The only negative to the game is that after a certain point, you pretty much have to stop developing so that the skill of your soldiers(especially new ones as you build your population) can grow to actually be strong enough to defend your kingdom. For me this leads to disabling autosave and running this while I go to work and praying the game wont crash before I come home(while I've never had a crash playing it, leaving it idle for hours at a time is another story) or my gnomes wont all critical fail so I can come home to a massacred gnome fortress.So perhaps with some scaling so that the endgame can be met easier and at a similar speed to early game progression, this game would be amazing all around the board. Reccommended if you enjoy wrangling stupid things to do jobs for you and then watching them do these jobs in horribly inefficient ways while you stare angrily at them.Or if you just have hours upon hours of time to waste. I'd suggest reading some guides, you'll need them.			"

								With over three-hundred hours on this game, I can safely say I enjoy it.  I have few problems with this game, and its developers continue to update it as they generate new content.  I bought this game while it wasn't on sale, and I'm not the least bit dissapointed when it does go on sale.  Because I got a great game that continues to get better.Pros:-The level of interaction you can have with your Gnomes is up to you.  You can micromanage them until they are doing tasks in the order you want them.  Or you can let them run around and try to survive on their own.-As your Gnomedom grows, you get access to better and better things.  Trade from other kingdoms, better materials, more Gnomes.  Your Gnomes also get better at their jobs, making more durable and more expensive items.-If you don't want to engage in combat with enemies, you can disable them.  If you want to leave enemies on and still not fight, you can have your Gnomes try to run, or buy off the Goblin Kingdoms to keep them from attacking you.-Automatons!Cons:-Early in the game, its pretty easy for a single bear, or goblin raid to destroy your whole kingdom.  Even equiping all your Gnomes with weapons might mean their doom.-The crafting is really slow in the begining because combat is so dangerous for your Gnomes.- The game has a tendancy to slow down if you have to much going on, i.e. water flowing, many enemies and Gnomes moving, lots of trees and crops growing all at the same time.  You can manage these things however, to reduce their impact on preformance.			"

								One of the most addictive games i have ever played. Granted it took me a few tries to master the basics of the game, this couldn't be done in under an hour,  but once I had figured out to make my Gnomes most effective in their duties. Everything just fell in to place.   If the gnomes are not doing their duties, there is usually a reason for this and it is up to you to work out why!   I found that in early game it is best to create two crude work benches and have 2 gnomes assigned to them,  set one up to just create planks and nothing else,  do not accept other jobs and the second to make a few workbenches and chairs.  This way you have a few items ready in your stores to create the workshops you need quickly further along in the game once you have your little indoor area set out.  After this the next bench i would make would be a stonecutter (i think?),  the one who makes stone blocks,  and just have him continually make blocks on repeat with all the raw stone.  This again speeds up your processes if that is all he he doing.  The blocks are ready then to create whatever you need. e.g Tables, floors, statues etc.I loved getting new Gnomads at the beggining of a new season and growing my colony, there is much to be getting on with and the is much deeper than it first appears.  With animals to gain and tend to and factions to fight with or against or zombie virusus!.  Its a great go to game when i want to have a strategy game to play.   Recommended for those who love basebuilders, so much potential.			"

								Absolutely recommended if you like Town-managing games. You control a small group of Gnomes at first and direct them to dig an underground-fortress to defend against the wild animals roaming the map or other evil creatures. You gather resrouces and process them into more refined buildingmaterials or commodities which can be traded with.The game can be boggling hard - but you can also finetune your worlds and disable any type of enemy down to a sandbox-type of game.The game features rather pixelated graphics and doesnt show any animations, safe for a bit of Flicker on the torches, but if you are looking for a simple time-waster in-between anything, this is your choice to run even on the oldest machines.Keep in mind though, that Gnomoria is not finished yet and games, for example, can start lagging. Save-Loading fixes temporarily fixes that, though. "

								Gnomoria is a charming procedually-generated town builder/managment game that is all the work of one guy, who has done an incredible job. Your town will die a horrible horrible death, but that's just a great excuse to start again and do better the next time!It's hard for me to put into words to describe how much I love this game, it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy games like Dwarf Fortress, Towns or RimWorld you'll feel right at home here!

								It was an island of death; one more ship of conscripted gnomes was heading to the large outcropping of rock to re-establish Roanoake.  What was it, the fifth...sixth failed colony?  The new colonists were grim faced indeed.Trading missions reported on the first three established outposts to find the fortress absent of life.  Known yak milk drinkers, it appeared that having comfortable beds created a shortage of fodder for the beasts, which died and caused the first brave gnomes to slowly die of thirst.  In each sucessive wave the town was  even more established, going as far as to inviting trading missions to barter for their fine lumber and trinkets.  Each time successively larger fields of grain waved in the fouled wind that carried the sweet scent of dried corpses.  The abundant grain harvests seemed to taunt the stilled gnomes as their stalks bent in the wind, chanting ""race with death, pray for grain crops to feed the yaks"".  How the colonists must have felt as one by one, over the course of a week, each gnome succumbed.  The last gnome died face down in the fields; the yaks long gone.  They had gambled against fate, and lost.The fourth expedition was led by a military gnome, well trained, and well aware that securing resources were imperitive.  His attempt at a permanent settlement looked almost perfect; vast fields flush with crops, giant groves of fruit trees, industry set in an organized manner.  It looked impossible to fail...but of course it did.  The walls outside the impressive entrance were splashed with crimson gore and visible trails of blood dragged within the hold.  Following along the proud halls, the scouts came upon a first aid station and a ring of corpses, almost as if they had been engaged in a card game.  Every body was bloodless and still.  Prominently displayed by the door was a box labelled ""bandages""...and it was empty except for a small paper IOU.  Sadly the gnomes didn't die from terrible injuries, but from the inability to staunch their minor wounds and they eventually succumbed.The next expedition, forcibly sent and comprised of convicts and heretics, fared no better.  The fields and hall were strewn with corpses that appeared to have died of thirst.  A trench had been dug from the nearby mountain lake to almost the front doors of the keep, and perched on it's end was a well in all but name;  it needed but one final piece of wood to hold together and dispense life-giving water...but there was no wood for the mill, the mill couldn't make planks, and the gnomes must have been too weak to chop wood.Naturally, the latest wave of gnomes had prayed copiously, and said goodbye to spouses and children with little expectation of seeing them again.........Two years later, three gnomes slowly gathered food stores and brewed beer in halls that had once been full of companions.  In the first year, the colony had been a victem of it's own success, and so many people rushed to make the town their home.  Sadly greed was on everyone's mind and most gnomes focussed on mining and making trade goods, with noone to notice that food and drink stores were nearly gone from all the extra mouths.  When the latest batch of hopeful candidates for the colony disembarked the all-too-farmiliar scene of bodies strewn about was heartrending.Inside the colony there was one survivor, and though the body was strong, the mind had snapped.  Having discovered that with the use of a still fruit could be made into nourishing wine, the lone gnome was able to eke out a lonely existance for nearly a year alone.  Noone made any mention of the goblins and hallf dozen gnome corpses in the cold storage pantry, or that some of them had been nibbled by rats, but there were no rats to be seen.With determination in their eyes, the newest batch of colonists took up the reins, re-started the industrial machinery, serviced the farms and started to dig a well.  But it was not to be.  Obsessed with a marble tile mosaic that the insane survivor was laying in the great hall, many gnomes stopped by and sat at the tables for hours, lost in thought as they contemplated the spiraling patterns in the stone.  Many forgot to eat, all forgot to drink.  The survivor, having finished the pattern in the floor, dropped dead in the exact center of the room.  He was ringed by a dozen corpses.These colonists were more determined though;  they had faced goblins, hell badgers, a strange beast that assembled from ore deposits in the deep mines, famine, and thirst...always thirst.  Yet this time there were three survivors, and they were determined to hold out as long as they could, hoping for reinforcements before more goblins found out the defenses were unmanned and took the keep for themselves.Gaunt, dark-eyed, swaying from weakness, they stirred cauldrens of mysterious meat and brewed beer to gradually restore the food stocks for the next group of foolhardy gnomes...if they ever came.  When not preparing substinance, they wandered outside like mobile scarecrows, snatching the random strawberry or apple from the ground and bringing it back inside to toss in the cauldren.Will they hold out for help?  Only the god of gnomes could say.>>>>>Love this game; everything above really happened.  Due to the complex interaction of buildings and no way in-game to know what makes what, there will be lots of trial and error until you break down and check out the wiki or forums.  That still would have saved more than half my failed colonies, and the other colony died almost literally just as straw ripened for feeding the yaks.  Keeping track of resources is important because once the economy gets going you can easilly strip an entire mountain range of foot and trees (it doesn't help when you make 40' timber walls to joint three mountains together into a giant fortress), and your crafting system will grind to a halt for want of a nail.I haven't played it very long yet but I have enjoyed the complexity of the economy and the ability to design your base however you want too.  If you like management sims, you can't go wrong.To be fair, there is still room for improvement, but being as this is an EA game it is still pretty polished for what it is.  I can't wait to have the finished product.			"

Only after the battle you can see the combat log (+ which is hilarious to read).- Late game the performance can sometimes hit your machine hard.- I wish the gnome/enemies sprites were animated.			"

								One of the finest games I have ever played. Never played Dwarf Fortress or anything that's at all like this before Gnomoria, though it's reminiscent of Minecraft and RTS games so I made sense of it quickly. The one thing that this game needs sorely, and that stops it from being perfect for me, is that I can't select a gnome and from there directly issue new commands that he has to do immediately and before any other available tasks. Like when a bear comes and it's early on, year 1 season 1-2, and you just wish everyone would rush inside and not engage, but some dumbass gnomes like to charge in. If I could click-drag to select everyone who's outside, then click inside and say ""go here NOW"" and then unpause and they just do that... ya, that'd be perfection.			"

It took me around 25 hours of game play just to have my gnomes not die of starvation, goblin attacks, mants, drink, and random causes of getting stuck in their own tunnels. Everytime I felt bad for my gnomes and how they would just die of unnatural causes. Game after game I would slowly get more efficient and become a little bit better, and now I have constructing my castle of many colors and rooms and awesomeness. I have traps built to catch goblins and kill them without loss of life.(unless the gnomes really want to go pick up a stone door for some reason) This game has truly taken my attention to a whole new level and I can't get enough of it. However, I still feel bad when a gnome loses a leg and he dies from not being able to get to food and water. Fun game though!			"

								To talk about this game corectly you need to be in a VERY dwarfy mind set, remember LOSING IS FUN and you will do that quite a bit. mainly because you can not actualy ""win"". compared to Dwarf Fortress this game has a simpler UI and is all round simpler to understand because it is not as complex.to put it in short, this is most likely the best example of a My First Fort game, primeing anyone for the Real deal.

								Gnomoria doesn't just take time. It gobbles it up in huge chunks :PThe game is awesome, though. You get to manage a small (and growing) settlement, battling your way through hordes of goblins, golems, mants (yes, it's a thing) and much much more. Or not, if you prefer it quiet-like. You can micromanage or you can just set all your workshops to craft missing ingridients and have everybody automagically do stuff for you while you worry about the big picture.New players should definitely check out the wiki tutorial[www.gnomoriawiki.com] to get a good start as the first year is really hard to get through without some kind of strategy. Not that it gets easier after that, the trouble just changes character ;)If you like building/ defense games, this is awesome ^^			"

								This game has an steep curve for learning it because the user interface provides very few information about what the options do. For example, you won't know what is exactly produced in each of the workshops until you create one of each and see it. Before that, you need to guess given the 'name tag' of that workshop.Even if the initial steps are rough, the game is really fun. You can create anything you want for your gnomes, it is like playing Minecraft in a different setting and better balanced for single player. The game is also being updated fairly often (an update per month) given that developer team is very small, so things are expected to improve even more.			"

								Gnomoria is a rather entertaining kingdom building sandbox game. Giving indirect commands through building instructions and management, you run a settlement of gnomes and eventually build it into a kingdom.This game's got quite a bit of potential, and shows it well. However, like any early access game, you should take it with a grain of salt, and expect problems to surface. Overall, though, the good outweighs the bad.Gnomoria's strengths come from it's crafting system and terrain editing. You can destroy, construct, or modify almost any block in the world, allowing you to build your kingdom however you want. Many choose to live underground, building multi-level dwarf-like caverns for the gnomes to live in. Others (myself included) build on the surface, building castles and walls. The gnomes are very good at managing jobs, where the ones that are dedicated (mining, farming, etc) will do their dedicated professions first, as there's fewer capable doing so. The resource management feels very fun and satisfying as well, stockpiling your goods in crates and barrels to conserve space. You start with only a few of these, and your gnomes sleeping on usually nothing but straw beds, eventually upgrading parts of your base to house your gnomes better.Gnomoria's downsides are like any early access game's. There's a few pathing bugs, where gnomes will essentially paint themselves into a corner when removing floors. Also, the game is rather hard to understand without reading through the information section for about an hour. It's very detailed, but the game lacks a tutorial or ""getting started"" play guide. Gnomoria's also a logistics game, and if you don't enjoy base/kingdom management, it's probably not going to offer something you want.However, Gnomoria is definitely worth picking up if you like games like Prison Architect or Dwarf Fortress. I bought it on a whim during the summer sale and after finally spending a few hours learning the ropes, it's loads of fun.			"

								I just played this game from 8 am till just past midnight... I have to be up at 7 am, and have crap to do... where did my day go? It went to challenging myself to building only above ground… fighting lizards, hoping the bears stay away, feeling pain when the one male yak bled to death only to celebrate when the remaining female gave birth to a male... Incest train full steam ahead baby!Can’t recommend this game enough, its as challenging as you want it to be and is still being worked on. Also unlike most the other games I have that have been developed after purchase, all the changes to this game have been nice and make sense.  I can’t think of one time a patch has hit that has made me think “well crap they just killed the game!” (cough cough hero siege cough cough)The ONLY reason I stay away from this game is… that first line… it grabs me and will NOT let me go.. and I have things to do.  I try to, but it’s like a virus or something... crack maybe? I normally have ok self control, but this game kills it… The game is not perfect there are minor issues, some bugs and such. Reported bugs are usually fixed via patches with time. You just have to wait it out as with any other game. It also has a moderate learning curve. Thankfully the wiki is there for all questions and help. As a final note things will be frustrating for the impatient, if you’re looking for quick play… instant satisfaction game this might not be a game suited to you.			"

								At first, I was very unconvinced. And after giving it a shot, I thought it was ""Dwarf Fortress Lite"", nothing else. But then I started immersing myself, and -even though the learning curve is steep though not as steep as DF's- discovered it has its own charm, complexity and distinct feel.I really recommend this game: if you love DF, this is an improvement as you'll get a cute graphic interface and view, a complex yet not overwhelming economy, and a very customizable report system. You can create your professions, your on-screen trackers and can customize the view.Overall, a great game :)			"

								If you like micro-managing and a developed resources planning game, where every choice can mean the end for your group/people this is the game for you.I've been holding off from doing a review of this game until the point where I felt like I could with confidence say: ""it has this and thoose perks"".Perks:+Easy learning curve+Alot of map customization to choose your prefered area+Great system to sort your resources+You can think it, you can possibly build itDowns:-Combat system feels made to always let you be the weaker power-Once you got a stable community running, not really much to do except hording resources-Game still feels abit unfinished, being able to send of military units to raid or merchants to foreign capitols to trade would be a nice touch-No real way of customize gnomes clothes, to make it easier to spot and control whats happening without giving them a military duty and armorConclussion: I really liked it, I've spent many hours on it and I do feel I have a couple of more to explore other possibilitys of the game and it's mechanics.

Early Access Review
								This is my first review so any constructive criticism and advice is welcome. Im also a fan of this game so this review is a bit biased.Gnomoria is a game where you (the ruler of a race of small ethanol fuelled Shroom addicts) must forge a new homeland for your band of merry drunkards in the plains and mountains (read hills) of a hostile world populated by malevolent entities such as gnome sized bears, Golems made of Pure stone and metal... and wheat, hordes of Subterranean insects, armies of goblins and ogres that have gained the ability to slowdown and stop time itself, and when these threats are dealt with/detained/have a picket fence in front of them new problems shall emerge, such as  The flawless timing of your gnomes when something can go horribly wrong, your own boundless greed and  all those moments when you dig to deep.But neither you nor your valiant dwarv... i mean gnomes need worry as when life gives you lemons you make lemonade, and when life gives you an honourable opponent who just wanted some pet rocks, you do the only sensible thing and make them into sausage.In all seriousness though Gnomoria is a procedurally generated village/kingdom/hovel management game in which you are given control of a band of gnomes and a plot of land for you to do with as you wish. The best thing to compare it to is the game Dwarf Fortress as Gnomoria takes some heavy inspiration from it. The essential goal of the game is to create a thriving kingdom where your gnomes arent the first meal of the day. After the point where survival, just food and water (read booze), is no longer an issue the game opens up and you can focus on building your own unique kingdom.One of Gnomoria's many strengths is the variety of ways the game can be played: do you want to make a castle? sure, do you want to make a subterreanean (sorta) Steampunk city? why not, do you literally want to make hobbition? be my guest, are Floating sky fortresses with gnomes who outright refuse technology your thing? you can do that. Despite the variety of ways to play the most common and effective way is to make a fortress with traps. The traps system of Gnomoria is another of it's best features it allows for insane amounts of customisation and experimentation. The system involves two types of traps the unpowered traps like spike and blade traps and the more end game focused room sized traps. The unpowered traps trigger when an enemy steps on one and require resetting after it has been triggered, whereas the large room sized traps (usually) involve you making an elaborate gauntlet designed to either let you capture enemies for use in an arena or target practice or you may go the straightforward route and build a crushing trap to kill invading goblins. Unfortunately a fortress becomes extremely difficult to maintain without an advanced trap system and people who dont research any technologies will have a hard time surviving the lategame. I would still recommend using the trap system no matter what though as elaborate mechanisms such as arenas, lava rooms, drowning traps, fall traps, crushing traps and many more unique configurations can be made.Among the other best features of the Game there is a building system which allows for complex structures and a combat log that allows you see how your Gnomes and Enemies are faring in battle. The combat itself is also quite indepth as injuries to certain body parts can injure or kill a gnome, with a possibility of gnomes losing limbs and dying of blood loss.Now for the things i dislike about Gnomoria which in my opinion are far outweighed by the positives. The Diplomacy system is very bare bones at the moment with it consisting of whether you want to host an ambassador to enable trading with other gnomish kingdoms and whether you send tribute to the goblins for decreased hostilities.On the more technical side the game doesn't have multithreading so unless you have a one core Cpu that is insanely good the game will at same stage start slowing down (This usually doesnt effect the gameplay to much as it is usually just a bit slower or there is a lag spike at the start of an invasion).Unfortunately the game also doesnt have an awefull lot of variety in regards to location, enemies,  and unique events as you are more than capable of experiencing everything in one fortress's(ss,sss...es?) lifetime (note however more features and locations are planned on the roadmap so there will likely be more added).Another of my Gripes with the game is that it will absorb your time, to the point where you will lose track of time if you are not careful, and with all the new features being added such as Prosthetic Limbs and Automatons i can only see the game getting better in the future.To end with i feel that i have more than gotten my $8.00 of fun from this game and it remains one of the most complete early access titles i have played and i would heavily recommend that you consider purchasing the game to support the developer. One final thing if you are considering buying the game id recommend watching a LP of it to help get your head around the basics and you should keep the wiki on when you first start work on traps and mechanisms.

I was working on bronze armor when a bunch of ""mantis"" showed up and destroyed my military, then killed everyone including my livestock.I realize this is ""beta"" but this is just stupid to have 17 hours of work go down the tubes in minutes.  Maybe Ill check the game out in a few years and hopefully the developer will have come to his senses.I really love this kind of game, a dwarf fortress with a real GUI.  I just hope others are working on this as well.  I just do not have it in me to start over.			"

								I just love this game. If I look at the info Steam provides me, I played over 122 hours of this game... and I still am NOT bored!!!Most games these days last maybe 20 hrs around cost often over 5 times the price of Gnomoria... so you sure get more than your money's worth with this game. What about the game itself: basically it is a ""Dwarf Fortress clone"" with very nice looking ""retro"" graphics intead of ASCII symbols. It is not as complex and ""deep"" as DF, but this game is also still in the early access stage. The developer seems to be intentioned to add many more features in the (hopefully near) future.In any case: AS IS the game is already huge fun!Actually I ma very thrilled to see what the developer will add next (I have read rumors of magic and more complex diplomacy coming into the gameplay and I am quite excited about that).One thing I like a lot is CUSTOMIZABLE DIFFICULTY: not only you can choose how hard the enemies are and how pentyful or scarce the raw materials are, but you can also select the mobs you want in the game. Want goblins and Mants to harrass you but you want to dig for metals in peace? Select only goblins and mants as enemies! Want hardcore gaming? You can have that too! Or, if you like the casual gameplay, you can have a relaxing peaceful game with no mobs at all. Although games like minecraft give some of these options, Gnomoria makes it much more tunable and customizable!As it is you can really customize your game as it suits your gaming needs.There are some minorr bugs and glitches here and there, but nothing really game breaking. The game is stable and smooth... although I am experiencing a bit of a slowdown (nothing major) if I have many gnomes or have dug really deep. I must mention my system is not top notch, hence better systems might not have this poblem.NOTE: I must say that from v.0.9.17 onward the problem mentioned above has certainly been improved a lot.In any case the game works great. As I have seen until now, the developer(s) are still working on it actively, interact with the gamers, hence it seems to me this is a game that will suffer death by abbandonment some early access games suffer.Also this game, in terms of development, reminds me of Minecraft: a fully playable fun game, with more content always on the way.CONCLUSION:I can only recommend this game!AS IS, it is already a great game and my 122+ hours of gameplay at this moment is a testament that this game does not bore easily, especially if you are into games like Dwarf Fortess and similar stategy games.

								This is one of my favorite games on here. I've had it since well before it came to Steam. One of the things i love, aside from the entirety of the game, is that the Dev is frequently releasing updates. Every Tuesday something is fixed and usually something is changed or added. If your into sims, building, survival or management type games get this game, you wont regret it.			"

								This game is a great sand-box for the first few years of the game. The AI is well-done, the graphics are serviceable. On the down-side, the UI can be challenging. If you are technical enough and stick to it, you'll find yourself having a lot of fun building your Gnome base. It is a great game for the first few years, where to goal is survival - past that, you will grow your base without much purpose other than esthetics. For the current price point, you'll get a great sand-box that you will return to!			"

								Gnomoria is a watered down version of Dwarf Fortress.  Unlike DF, it is designed from the start with a graphical (rather than ASCII) representation in mind.  It is much less complex than DF, but also much more readily accessible.  Although development seems to have slowed, it has not stopped.  For the price, Gnomoria can offer many hours of fun in curating one's very own gnome home.  For those who want a great deal more complexity with a much less user-friendly UI, Dwarf Fortress is free.			"

								Extremely addictive game.  I enjoy building up my base and my gnome's skills so was not a fan of random monsters wondering in and killing some of my precious few gnomes.  Fortunuately, you can reduce the monster's strength and occurrence to 50%.  Which is low enough to keep your gnomes alive without spending too much of their time training to be soliders.Sure there could a lot more done, and there is room for a lot more growth, but as it is I'd give this game a 10.Of you enjoy base building, farming, keeping animal pastures, and slowly building upon materials and exprties of your minions to be able to build better and better things, you'll love this game.  Nothing I've seen is remotely as good.ps.  There are a few things that you need to worry about in the first year:  Make sure you alter your gnome's professiosn so that some of them have the skill you want (crafting skills, so they will actually build thing, hauling, so they can take built stuff out of your workshops, and that you build a small wheat farm right away, and build a distillery asap so they will have liquids to drink.  ps2. Make sure of, just becase a gnome has a skill, doesn't mean he'll do it if he has a million other things setup ahead of it.  So go to the population/professions tab and make sure the stuff that you want done are setup in the correct priority on the right hand side.			"

								Got this a few months ago and played it to death and forsee even more time spent in it as it's updated nearly every week with new features and content that usually create a new experience. I'm glad it finally hit Steam as they promised. Dwarf Fortress Lite would be an ok description, but that doesn't mean this one is completely dumbed down. It doesn't have every tiny detail that DF has, but it has what matters. There's a lot to manage and consider. 8 bucks is an absolute bargin. Learning curve is a tad high until you understand the idea behind the game.This game gets a ton of props for it's chiptune soundtrack and it's naming. ""Tillin' in the Name Of"" is just plain legendary.			"

								If you've always wanted to try dwarf Fortress, but thought the UI was directly responsible for all the evils in the world then now is your chance! Gnomoria is an excellent isometric team management/survival game in style of Dwarf Fortress, Terraria and Minecraft. Guide your little folk to success by creating a stronghold and fending off goblin invaders, hungry picnic destroying mants and two headed ogres. The game plays smoothly and has a very logical crafting progression. Survival until you succeed, then build to glory, right up until you dig too deep.			"

								It is Dwarf Fortress. Whether that's a bad thing or a good thing, is up to you. Where Towns takes some liberties on the formula, Gnomoria is a much more straight remake. They take ease of use pretty seriously, though, and the game is infinitely more playable than DF. The game gets patched on a weekly basis and the creator is continuously adding lots of new convenience features and more content. Compared to DF, it has much easier menu navigation (with full mouse support, obviously), greatly reduced micro management (issue an order to build a workshop, and orders to build the necessary components for it will automatically get sent to your other workshops!), much easier resident management, and so forth. It also has much less detail (no randomly generated descriptions based on your fortress's history for statues, for example), but they're adding more and more of that all the time. It's still not an easy game, mind you, and there's no tutorial so you will need either a wiki or a lot of patience to learn the general flow of things.Thing I like the most about it: General ease of play, it's super easy and relaxing to just lean back in your chair and watch the fortress go about its business as you just casually issue some orders every now and again. Thing I like the least: It's still pretty complex from a mechanics standpoint with a horrible lack of tooltips and no tutorial, making it not a simple task to learn. Thing I want patched in the most: Emotions. It's actually the one thing from DF I miss the most. Your Gnomes have no mood and always behave the same way no matter what.Overall, really fun game and is easily worth the price if you're willing to jump in early knowing that it's still an alpha/beta/whatever they're calling it.

								Dwarf Fortress, but with Gnomes. And less features. And more graphics. Early Access means it's not done yet, and if you look at Dorf Fort (developement since 2002, first alpha release 2006, still in alpha 2015), you might just realize that it probably won't leave Early Access. Unless they decide it's close enough and then continuously update after release... ANYWAYS. It's got a learning curve, and it's pretty up there in difficulty, but it's a lot easier than DF. Like, a lot. But that's not to say it isn't hard. But not hard in the traditional sense. It's really very easy. Deceptively simple in design, but full of a bunch of stuff.Here's the deal: You like Dwarf Fortress, and you like games like Dungeon Keeper, but you want something a bit easier, then I'd reccomend you buy, and play, this game. Gnomoria. This game. This. Game. Gnomoria. Buy it. Play it. Live it. Buy. It. This game. Gnomoria. Go. Do it now.			"

								If you like micro-managing and a developed resources planning game, where every choice can mean the end for your group/people this is the game for you.I've been holding off from doing a review of this game until the point where I felt like I could with confidence say: ""it has this and thoose perks"".Perks:+Easy learning curve+Alot of map customization to choose your prefered area+Great system to sort your resources+You can think it, you can possibly build itDowns:-Combat system feels made to always let you be the weaker power-Once you got a stable community running, not really much to do except hording resources-Game still feels abit unfinished, being able to send of military units to raid or merchants to foreign capitols to trade would be a nice touch-No real way of customize gnomes clothes, to make it easier to spot and control whats happening without giving them a military duty and armorConclussion: I really liked it, I've spent many hours on it and I do feel I have a couple of more to explore other possibilitys of the game and it's mechanics.

There will also be gnomes coming to your fortress interested to your cause. Overall, this game is excellent.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my first review so any constructive criticism and advice is welcome. Im also a fan of this game so this review is a bit biased.Gnomoria is a game where you (the ruler of a race of small ethanol fuelled Shroom addicts) must forge a new homeland for your band of merry drunkards in the plains and mountains (read hills) of a hostile world populated by malevolent entities such as gnome sized bears, Golems made of Pure stone and metal... and wheat, hordes of Subterranean insects, armies of goblins and ogres that have gained the ability to slowdown and stop time itself, and when these threats are dealt with/detained/have a picket fence in front of them new problems shall emerge, such as  The flawless timing of your gnomes when something can go horribly wrong, your own boundless greed and  all those moments when you dig to deep.But neither you nor your valiant dwarv... i mean gnomes need worry as when life gives you lemons you make lemonade, and when life gives you an honourable opponent who just wanted some pet rocks, you do the only sensible thing and make them into sausage.In all seriousness though Gnomoria is a procedurally generated village/kingdom/hovel management game in which you are given control of a band of gnomes and a plot of land for you to do with as you wish. The best thing to compare it to is the game Dwarf Fortress as Gnomoria takes some heavy inspiration from it. The essential goal of the game is to create a thriving kingdom where your gnomes arent the first meal of the day. After the point where survival, just food and water (read booze), is no longer an issue the game opens up and you can focus on building your own unique kingdom.One of Gnomoria's many strengths is the variety of ways the game can be played: do you want to make a castle? sure, do you want to make a subterreanean (sorta) Steampunk city? why not, do you literally want to make hobbition? be my guest, are Floating sky fortresses with gnomes who outright refuse technology your thing? you can do that. Despite the variety of ways to play the most common and effective way is to make a fortress with traps. The traps system of Gnomoria is another of it's best features it allows for insane amounts of customisation and experimentation. The system involves two types of traps the unpowered traps like spike and blade traps and the more end game focused room sized traps. The unpowered traps trigger when an enemy steps on one and require resetting after it has been triggered, whereas the large room sized traps (usually) involve you making an elaborate gauntlet designed to either let you capture enemies for use in an arena or target practice or you may go the straightforward route and build a crushing trap to kill invading goblins. Unfortunately a fortress becomes extremely difficult to maintain without an advanced trap system and people who dont research any technologies will have a hard time surviving the lategame. I would still recommend using the trap system no matter what though as elaborate mechanisms such as arenas, lava rooms, drowning traps, fall traps, crushing traps and many more unique configurations can be made.Among the other best features of the Game there is a building system which allows for complex structures and a combat log that allows you see how your Gnomes and Enemies are faring in battle. The combat itself is also quite indepth as injuries to certain body parts can injure or kill a gnome, with a possibility of gnomes losing limbs and dying of blood loss.Now for the things i dislike about Gnomoria which in my opinion are far outweighed by the positives. The Diplomacy system is very bare bones at the moment with it consisting of whether you want to host an ambassador to enable trading with other gnomish kingdoms and whether you send tribute to the goblins for decreased hostilities.On the more technical side the game doesn't have multithreading so unless you have a one core Cpu that is insanely good the game will at same stage start slowing down (This usually doesnt effect the gameplay to much as it is usually just a bit slower or there is a lag spike at the start of an invasion).Unfortunately the game also doesnt have an awefull lot of variety in regards to location, enemies,  and unique events as you are more than capable of experiencing everything in one fortress's(ss,sss...es?) lifetime (note however more features and locations are planned on the roadmap so there will likely be more added).Another of my Gripes with the game is that it will absorb your time, to the point where you will lose track of time if you are not careful, and with all the new features being added such as Prosthetic Limbs and Automatons i can only see the game getting better in the future.To end with i feel that i have more than gotten my $8.00 of fun from this game and it remains one of the most complete early access titles i have played and i would heavily recommend that you consider purchasing the game to support the developer. One final thing if you are considering buying the game id recommend watching a LP of it to help get your head around the basics and you should keep the wiki on when you first start work on traps and mechanisms.

								The game is off to a good start.  The game is normally $8, I bought it when it went on sale.  At such a low price I felt that even if the developer had jumped ship the instant I bought it, I would be getting my money's worth.  The developer has a demo available on their website, and I tried an... ""extended demo"" before purchasing so I knew what I was getting.If you haven't played Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria is a sort of sandbox-y building game; it's like if you owned a Minecraft server and could tell all the players what to do and they had to do what you said.  There are enemies, but you have huge control over the difficulty between choosing what types of enemies can spawn in the world and how tough the enemies are in general.  I recommend checking out this game if you like building/sim games or 4X games.If you have played Dwarf Fortress, I also recommend giving this game a try.  It may be a clone, but the developer has his own ideas about where to take the game and it doesn't feel like he's just trying to take advantage of an established franchise.  The best thing about this game compared to DF is that the menus are intuitive and easy to navigate.  You won't need any third-party programs to assign jobs to your Gnomes, you won't tear out your hair trying to set-up the military.In short, although the game isn't finished and lacks extensive content, the pieces that are in place are high enough quality that anyone at all intruiged by the premise would be doing themselves a favor by giving it a chance.

								26NOV2014 - Ive owned it for roughly a week at the time of this review and Ive played 116hrs so I can officially really review it. Its basically a simple looking yet strangely addictive base building/ management game. Dont let the extremely simple graphics fool you, the game play and depth are definitely there. For a low cost, highly in depth game developed by a single programmer in mid stages of creation this game is a steal. Note: there are bugs and some crashes but you can set the game to auto save often to where you wont be hindered. One thing to note and I pray its fixed soon: when playing Im hitting this glitch where it lags uncontrollably and its killer. Once it starts your creation...your level is effectively ruined. I can never get it to stop once it starts. I believe it has to due with the gnome path finding. Other than this - this game is a ton of fun. Looking forward to future updates.			"

								As a casual scrub lord to dwarf fortress type games i have to say this feels really good. Getting pulled in for an hour or two of trying to make a kingdom work while hopping to a wiki to find out how progression and openings start to just survive is a bit annoying to some but it really just made me want to learn more about the game. After 5 kingdoms ending with me restarting cause my poor yaks deserted me due to straw bed production i have to say that once you finally get the hang of it you really can immerse yourself in managing and making things look the way you want. With differnt wood/stone types for differnt visuals you always have a cosmetic end goal on top of that survival min/maxing one.			"

								Great game, the first game ive ever played where i had to make it as easy as possible just to figure it out.100 hours in im still trying to figure it all out actually, some might say that makes me an idiot but oh well. its fun being a noob and learning a game cause when youve mastered it then it gets easy, and easy is boring.some tips...when you start, go to the advance options and turn off all the monsters,you willneed you cattle, so first thing first is start growing a wheat farm to keep your cattle alive.dont bother building a well, get a distillery and just forage for fruit when your low, it'll keep you going till you can find a better arrangment.i do have one complaint, often times my work orders come to a halt and recentley ive found out why, lack of resource or some sort of minuscle detail. is it possible to get some sort of tool tip or warning when something like that happens.also when i start getting about 40 entities (animal or gnome) walking around on the map, my game starts freezing up.all in all, this is a great game though, i HIGHLY recommend it.

								Gnomoria doesn't just take time. It gobbles it up in huge chunks :PThe game is awesome, though. You get to manage a small (and growing) settlement, battling your way through hordes of goblins, golems, mants (yes, it's a thing) and much much more. Or not, if you prefer it quiet-like. You can micromanage or you can just set all your workshops to craft missing ingridients and have everybody automagically do stuff for you while you worry about the big picture.New players should definitely check out the wiki tutorial[www.gnomoriawiki.com] to get a good start as the first year is really hard to get through without some kind of strategy. Not that it gets easier after that, the trouble just changes character ;)If you like building/ defense games, this is awesome ^^			"

								I tried it out a long time ago and was impressed enough to buy it, especially for the price.It was great and worth its price a long time ago and now its even better. Never had a problem with frames per second myself, but the game is probably a little more demanding than it looks.I like that he's added things to the game that I wouldn't have expected like making a  private room decked out enough to attract better diplomats and being able to smelt crappy goblin weapons into fresh bars.It's also fairly challenging as the attacks on your home keep escalating.My only regret is that for some reason I really want to know what my Gnomes dreams/goals are and what they like/dislike about their new home so far. I want to know who their favorite Gnome is and maybe he/she gets appointed Governor-General  maybe? I also want them to be able to get married and have kids.It would be also cool if your Town influenced the world around you in a more detailed way, like maybe the Goblins stop messing with you and make peace or ,maybe a friendly Kingdom offers protection in exchange for exclusive trade rights? You know like the Gnome world is just SO impressed with your Gnome town.By saying that what I mean is I like the game enough to want even more from it.I feel weird saying that but it's an active little world with lots of jobs and skills that make the  Gnomes seem like they have more 'personality' than they realy do. I think it's called immersion.			"

								A Great Game!  There is plenty of content and lots to discover.  I have over 240+ hours and there is still more to do!

The game already has an incredible amount of content and its still in early access, and on top of that there is much more RoboBOb (the developer) Plans to add, like magic! (Don’t believe, me just scroll down to the LINKS section and click on the Roadmap link)Now be warned, this is a micro management village sandbox game, or you might call it, a city builder, so if you don't like that style of game then this is not the game for you!If you want to see what I’ve done you can find that in the LINKS section!Also, for those of you who are looking at the update page and are detoured from getting the game because it seems updates for this game have halted, it is because RoboBOb has opened up a Beta Branch.  A page on how to opt-in to that can be found it the LINKS section.Now to help ease one into the game without to many fallen kingdoms, I would recommend doing some research on the gameplay (in other words, READ SOME GUIDES).

								This game has an steep curve for learning it because the user interface provides very few information about what the options do. For example, you won't know what is exactly produced in each of the workshops until you create one of each and see it. Before that, you need to guess given the 'name tag' of that workshop.Even if the initial steps are rough, the game is really fun. You can create anything you want for your gnomes, it is like playing Minecraft in a different setting and better balanced for single player. The game is also being updated fairly often (an update per month) given that developer team is very small, so things are expected to improve even more.			"

								One of the most addictive games i have ever played. Granted it took me a few tries to master the basics of the game, this couldn't be done in under an hour,  but once I had figured out to make my Gnomes most effective in their duties. Everything just fell in to place.   If the gnomes are not doing their duties, there is usually a reason for this and it is up to you to work out why!   I found that in early game it is best to create two crude work benches and have 2 gnomes assigned to them,  set one up to just create planks and nothing else,  do not accept other jobs and the second to make a few workbenches and chairs.  This way you have a few items ready in your stores to create the workshops you need quickly further along in the game once you have your little indoor area set out.  After this the next bench i would make would be a stonecutter (i think?),  the one who makes stone blocks,  and just have him continually make blocks on repeat with all the raw stone.  This again speeds up your processes if that is all he he doing.  The blocks are ready then to create whatever you need. e.g Tables, floors, statues etc.I loved getting new Gnomads at the beggining of a new season and growing my colony, there is much to be getting on with and the is much deeper than it first appears.  With animals to gain and tend to and factions to fight with or against or zombie virusus!.  Its a great go to game when i want to have a strategy game to play.   Recommended for those who love basebuilders, so much potential.			"

								Absolutely recommended if you like Town-managing games. You control a small group of Gnomes at first and direct them to dig an underground-fortress to defend against the wild animals roaming the map or other evil creatures. You gather resrouces and process them into more refined buildingmaterials or commodities which can be traded with.The game can be boggling hard - but you can also finetune your worlds and disable any type of enemy down to a sandbox-type of game.The game features rather pixelated graphics and doesnt show any animations, safe for a bit of Flicker on the torches, but if you are looking for a simple time-waster in-between anything, this is your choice to run even on the oldest machines.Keep in mind though, that Gnomoria is not finished yet and games, for example, can start lagging. Save-Loading fixes temporarily fixes that, though. "

								After having played this for a couple of hours I have to admit that it's much more accessable than Dwarf Fortress, however organizing the gnomes and getting them to listen was difficult at times, lacking in help as to how to get them to listen...Other than the hiccups that most gamers have with a game as such, lacking in a tutorial, and lacking an in depth guide, this game is pretty damn great. Theres clearly depth to it, and I've barely skid the surface of what I can do in the three hours I've logged into it.			"

								Another relaxing sandbox game with indirect controls in the spirit of Majesty and Sim City.  Although in Early Access for a couple of years now, I put it down for awhile and picked it back up recently to find many many improvements.  In terms of how I like to play these games, it may as well be a finished product.  I'll be curious as to what additional content will be added.			"

								I like this game, it is fun and quite addicting once you figure out what to do, what I do NOT like is the fact that gnomes will often be idle despite having abundant jobs available. But since this is an early access game, this will probably be fixed soon. All in all, this game is fun and enjoyable, even if you do wonder why a lizard takes a day and a half of in game time to beat to death.			"

								Gnomoria is a really fun game. It doesn't take too long to figure out the controls or how to play the game. There are lots of dangers your gnomes will face. Such as bears mauling your woodcutters, armored goblins attacking your gates or skeletons and spiders in your mines. There are lots of different materials your can build your base with. Like bones, stone, metal, wood and even dirt. There are lots of different colors aswell!Gnomoria still has quite a few bugs, which is to be expected since it's an early access game. Content is still being added to the game along with the bug fixes. Last updates added prosthetics (in case one of your gnomes loses an arm or leg) and golems (robotic slaves that do your bidding while fueled by coal).Pros+ Easy interface/controls to use and understand+ Lots of various materials to build with+ Several different types of hostile creatures+ Resource trading with foreign kingdoms+ Mods supportedCons- Bugs- End game demands a lot of resources from your pc (disabling beetle spawning helps)- Some aspects of the game might seems a bit simplistic compared to other sandbox gamesWith all that being said I still think Gnomoria was well worth the money I spent on it. I've had many hours of fun with it while watching my gnomes struggle to survive.			"

								I'm loving this game. I was a big fan of Dwarf Fortress and obviously so are the people who made this. Plays very intuitively, with a little trial and error I was able to pick up the basics very quickly. The characters are quirky and fun, the music fits the game perfectly. Lots options for building and crafting without getting overwhelming. The game doesn't punish you for design errors, as you are able to rebuild walls, etc. I've only logged about 10 hours, so I'm far from seeing all this game has to offer, but it's been challenging and a lot of fun so far.

								This game is great, and makes ease of killing time.I haven't played Dwarf Fortress, and sadly it doesn't please me, I watched enough to say it's not worth my time.Onto the real part:Despite not having a tutorial, the game is still forgiving enough for you to keep trying. Once you got to a point where you got the jist of the game, expand by making a castle and making weapons from mining or trading with another city (Found in Kingdom Tab).Just the only thing that will hit you is Kingdom Worth, for starters, try to get Bronze armor and iron or so weapons before 15,000 (15k) worth and make sure they are trained.

								Gnomoria is one of my favorite sandbox simulation gnome city builder. Since its release a lot of people have found great ways to tweak a city so it will survive attacks from goblins, mants, ogres and so on. The best part for me was when I found out I could make mechanical traps and wind powered machines. This gave the game an even better feeling to it. When you think it has no more content you get this to play with! Fantastic. Also, the art style is really likeable and clear. Plus: if you are a fan of Dwarf Fortress but cannot get used to the art style, try this. Its not the same gameplay wise at all (DF is much more complicated) but the basics are there.			"

								Well at first my only goal was to have my gnomes survive the golem apocalypse for I did not know that leaving things laying around is what spawned the beasts. It took me around 25 hours of game play just to have my gnomes not die of starvation, goblin attacks, mants, drink, and random causes of getting stuck in their own tunnels. Everytime I felt bad for my gnomes and how they would just die of unnatural causes. Game after game I would slowly get more efficient and become a little bit better, and now I have constructing my castle of many colors and rooms and awesomeness. I have traps built to catch goblins and kill them without loss of life.(unless the gnomes really want to go pick up a stone door for some reason) This game has truly taken my attention to a whole new level and I can't get enough of it. However, I still feel bad when a gnome loses a leg and he dies from not being able to get to food and water. Fun game though!			"

								Have played the every lovin' meow out of this game.  If you enjoy city / empire building with low difficulty economy (more design and flow rather than micro-transaction), then this is a real pleasure.There are some game breaking memory issues that can absolutely be worked around (don't build huge stockpiles, don't store huge amounts of things typically, keep ramps and paths simple so alot of AI isn't bogging down the PC).Some very important strategies that are already well covered in Youtube and on the boards that you will need to learn in order to make it past year 1.Developer still giving love to this game, for which we are all grateful.Just remember, your gnomes are idiots, but they need your love.

								Very fun and high replay value. Iv spent hundred of hours this week alone in it (though i admit 24 of those was me giving my gnomes a long list of things to do and then walking away with auto save resume mod on ) Still I love the over all feel of this. The digging, the inventing, the traps, the mobs. If I had any complaint, its with the lack of ""realms"" there are mods that allow you to change the look but It would be even better if there where gnomes and skills and such that could only be gotten by the building/discovery of portals to new generated worlds based off of your current game mode and kingdome size. Even a ""adventurer gnome"" would be nice. I do hole hope this will come one day as it is updated on a regular basis. I hope this game keeps getting new thinsg for years to come.			"

								This game has an steep curve for learning it because the user interface provides very few information about what the options do. For example, you won't know what is exactly produced in each of the workshops until you create one of each and see it. Before that, you need to guess given the 'name tag' of that workshop.Even if the initial steps are rough, the game is really fun. You can create anything you want for your gnomes, it is like playing Minecraft in a different setting and better balanced for single player. The game is also being updated fairly often (an update per month) given that developer team is very small, so things are expected to improve even more.			"

								26NOV2014 - Ive owned it for roughly a week at the time of this review and Ive played 116hrs so I can officially really review it. Its basically a simple looking yet strangely addictive base building/ management game. Dont let the extremely simple graphics fool you, the game play and depth are definitely there. For a low cost, highly in depth game developed by a single programmer in mid stages of creation this game is a steal. Note: there are bugs and some crashes but you can set the game to auto save often to where you wont be hindered. One thing to note and I pray its fixed soon: when playing Im hitting this glitch where it lags uncontrollably and its killer. Once it starts your creation...your level is effectively ruined. I can never get it to stop once it starts. I believe it has to due with the gnome path finding. Other than this - this game is a ton of fun. Looking forward to future updates.			"

								An amazingly addicting game. I have sunk many hours into this game and am regularly tempted to pick it back up for another 20-30 hours. I don't normally like sandbox survival games but the combination of game play elements in Gnomoria has me hooked and wanting more. While this game is currently in early access it's a fully functional game and could easily be in full release at this point. The Dev is regularly updating, now working on larger less-frequent updates with bigger changes compared to regular small updates, with the option to play the in development versions if you want to keep your fix of new content regularly. The only drawback in the game at current is a lack of tutorial / instructions to get you started meaning reliance on the wiki until you work things out, and maybe the limited content once you have built up your town and economy...but that's when the survival kicks in.

								Gnomoria doesn't just take time. It gobbles it up in huge chunks :PThe game is awesome, though. You get to manage a small (and growing) settlement, battling your way through hordes of goblins, golems, mants (yes, it's a thing) and much much more. Or not, if you prefer it quiet-like. You can micromanage or you can just set all your workshops to craft missing ingridients and have everybody automagically do stuff for you while you worry about the big picture.New players should definitely check out the wiki tutorial[www.gnomoriawiki.com] to get a good start as the first year is really hard to get through without some kind of strategy. Not that it gets easier after that, the trouble just changes character ;)If you like building/ defense games, this is awesome ^^			"

								I tried it out a long time ago and was impressed enough to buy it, especially for the price.It was great and worth its price a long time ago and now its even better. Never had a problem with frames per second myself, but the game is probably a little more demanding than it looks.I like that he's added things to the game that I wouldn't have expected like making a  private room decked out enough to attract better diplomats and being able to smelt crappy goblin weapons into fresh bars.It's also fairly challenging as the attacks on your home keep escalating.My only regret is that for some reason I really want to know what my Gnomes dreams/goals are and what they like/dislike about their new home so far. I want to know who their favorite Gnome is and maybe he/she gets appointed Governor-General  maybe? I also want them to be able to get married and have kids.It would be also cool if your Town influenced the world around you in a more detailed way, like maybe the Goblins stop messing with you and make peace or ,maybe a friendly Kingdom offers protection in exchange for exclusive trade rights? You know like the Gnome world is just SO impressed with your Gnome town.By saying that what I mean is I like the game enough to want even more from it.I feel weird saying that but it's an active little world with lots of jobs and skills that make the  Gnomes seem like they have more 'personality' than they realy do. I think it's called immersion.			"
