												This game concept, character models, and sound effects are all what I'd call ""cute"". The gameplay, however, falls short of anything appealing. It may have been decent had the campaign missions been a bit shorter and if your powers had more variety, but when the game tasked me to drop rocks on workers' heads for 10 minutes straight, the novelty of the goofy death screams quickly wore off. In short, Babel Rising is a towering example of a game that's simplistic and repetitive to a fault. Pass over it.			"

												Babel Rising is a game where you play the role of a god that doesn't want people to build a tower of Babel. So, what if he broaden a plague? No, that would be too easy, let's throw rocks and fireballs at people!Does it sound fun? If you think so, I have a bad message for you - it's only for the first minute. The gameplay of the game is grindy, as you only throw elemental spells at people (just need a mouse for playing). That still would be not so bad, but let's explain it with level objectives:- Level 1: Kill 40 workers,- Level 2: Survive 20 waves of enemies (and each wave has ~5 workers), - Level 3: Kill 40 priests (and a priest usually comes with a each wave),- Level 4: Survive 8 minutes,- Level 5: Kill 450 workers.I hope that's enough to explain you how repetitive it is, thus boring. The game has few bugs worth mentioning, like local multiplayer that crashes the game, or a skill that crashes the game if you have an NVidia GPU (check discussions).While Babel Rising has a nice idea for a gameplay mechanics, it isn't fun at all, and nicer graphics can't help it. Don't even think about buying that.			"

												A simple game easy to understand and awesome to relax by unleashing your destructive powers.The only downside is that it was obviously created to be played on a smartphone and not with a mouse which makes the games controls just really hard to use. The consequence is that you don't feel 'in control"" as you should.Otherwise graphics are great, music simple but effective and you will learn the hard way that being an angry god is quite difficult (too difficult perhaps...)So I recommend this game if you intend to offer it to a friend as a simple gift or if you want to spend 5 minutes on it when you have nothing else to do. Do not expect anything more than raw mindless destruction and do not imagine you will spend hours on it.			"

												Babel Rising is a wonderful game, and a great idea.You play 'God', who must stop humans from building the tower of babel at all costs. Within your arsenal you have a host of powers, and tricks to stop the humans from building the tower.I got this game when I saw how good it looked. History has always interested me, and the tales, and myths of an era gone by leaves me wanting to learn more. I don't know much about the history, or tower of babel, but History tells us that it once existed.To put it simply - This game is a great idea that the developers nailed. I love the powers you receive, and the game reminds me of 'lemmings', as the villagers/slaves building the tower look like lemmings.The game itself Isn't long, but It's a nice way to burn a few hours. The game is aimed at the casual gamer, and someone who likes to game on a phone, or tablet rather than a PC. It's not a game that wants to be taken seriously, but something you can laugh at, and enjoy in small doses.I have nothing bad to say about this game. I liked it, and I'm sure you will too. If you like history, and historical based games, then you will like this 100%.			"

Seems like someone thought 'hey towerdefence plus god game while building the tower of babel! awesome!"" but never expanded beyond that one sentence. I can see it now all the meetings simply being everyone crowded into a room the leads repeating that one sentence then everyone sighing and fileing back to thier desks.     Dont buy this.			"

												If you have an NVidia card don't get this.The enjoyability of the game is up to the player, but in this case the game breaking bug is what stops it.There is a bug in the Wind power of the game, which is unlocked and required to be used for the third level, but completely breaks the game on many NVidia cards. After pestering the support staff with a ticket, I found out that they have been aware of this bug since launch, and have no intention of fixing it.			"

												I thought this would be a cool physics game where you could destroy the tower.  Boy was I in for a disappointment.You basically just shoot little people over and over, sometimes with different sequences of powers.  It's dull, repetitive gameplay.  So dull.Not a god game, not a physics game.  Just something that plays like one of those early 80's video games but with nicer graphics. "

												Babel Rising is a tower defense game developed by Mando and published by Ubisoft. I have no experience with other Mando games, but I've generally enjoyed games released by Ubisoft. Babel Rising goes against this trend.It starts off with an interesting enough premise. There isn't really much of a story going on, but it's not hard to ascertain that the little people are trying to make a tower like Babel and as a god you have to stop them. There are 4 elemental powers at your disposal, and each power give you two abilities, a local and an area of effect. Use your elemental power enough to unleash a super attack over time.The problem really arises after you get past the main idea of the game. It's a good start, but there is not enough to justify spending more than a couple minutes with it. Little people rush the tower, you attack them. There is a little variety to the enemy types, but it does not affect the gameplay much. Little people rush the tower, you attack them. When I found that the third mission would require me to defeat 40 of the priest type enemies, and they came at a rate of about 2 per minute, I couldn't stomach the idea of playing the round for 20 minutes. In addition, although you can mix it up a little with your attacks, there really isn't much difference between the various local and area powers.The graphics are cartoonish and passable, but there are no advanced video options. You cannot change the resolution. I played with a 360 controller as I tend to whenever given the option, but there was a huge glitch with the controls. After completing a mission, there was no way to continue. It just locked on to the mission complete screen. While looking at the support forum I see this has been a problem since its release, so that's not changing anytime soon. If you want to play with a controller, prepare to ALT-Tab and quit the game in between missions. The controls may be better suited to keyboard and mouse anyway....There isn't enough in Babel Rising to justify the price tag ($10 at this time). I could see this being a bundle purchase you might spend a few minutes in, but it will have trouble holding your attention for longer than that. This game might have been better as a iOS or Andriod mobile game if they weren't willing to flesh it out more.Grade: D-			"

												Ok, I like the Bible, I like the Old Testament, I like games and stories that are borderline sacriligous. I really don't care for this game. The premise is you have powers, like lightning bolts, or fireballs, or whatever, and you are going to throw them at people to stop them from building a tower. It's a little fun to hear the high pitched screams, but I found myself fighting with the controls and not enjoying it.			"

												Babel Rising gives us a tower defense game where you play the role of a God. You have 4 powers, earth, water, wind and fire and they all come with 3 powers. Left-clicking executes the most basic spell, and it's mostly used for small groups. Right-clicking allows you to take out multiple enemies and finally holding the middle mouse button will grant you the most powerful spell, like a flood or a rolling boulder. With these powers your goal is to stop the villagers from building a tower. If they complete it, it's game over. You have no other abilities or towers (except for your powers) to stop them so it's a bit primitive for a tower defense game. So far I wouldn't recommend it. No, you're better off with TD games like Orcs Must Die or Anomaly.[Rating: 56/100]			"

												Babel Rising is a pleasing casual game that feeds off of ancient mythology about the great Gods in the sky. The objective is simple: prevent the mortal humans from building a tower to the heavens. Your weapons vary such as lightning zaps, floods, falling meteors, etc. While simple, Babel Rising presents a fun challenge for casual players who enjoy variety and a change of pace.			"

												Fun God game. Taking out the people below with the typical 4 elements: Fire, Water, Earth and Wind. You are only aloud to choose two per round so try to figure out some cool combinations of attacks you can do with certain elements and also take into consideration if the people are resistant to a certain element. I also love how you have this stronger super attack that you can pull off with each element, really adds to the ""I'm over powered"" feeling. Another nice time killing game.			"

												This is a pretty fun game. It's not amazing,  but it definetly has good strong points that kept me playing and coming back. The tower of babel is one of the more interesting events recounted in the bible, and this game makes it very entertaining. Playing god, you summon various elements to attack the building of such towers. It takes a nicely humorous look at it with the various power combinations allowing you to perform a variety of attacks and miracle level events, like floods and meteor showers. It's a fun game to spend time on.			"

												At the begining it's quite nice small game where you as God Almighty, cast down all plagues on egiptians. However, after 2-3 levels it's a repetetive hell, where you must quickly click with your mouse and fight against terrible, worst and broken camera to do anything. Game could easily be iOS / Android port if someone would not told me that it's a PC title. It's worth no more than 1$ and only if you are really, really bored and want to get bored even more.			"
