												Have you been looking for a new real time strategy game lately to scratch that strategy itch you've been having? Well look elsewhere, because Citadels is a dreadful and incomplete mess. The game was created by an unknown and inexperienced development studio called Games Distillery. Currently a different studio called Big Moon was hired to add further playability and stability to the game. In the future, at best you can only hope for a polished yet dreadful entertainment product (without the entertainment value). Citadels attempts to accomplish what so many other strategy games have already done before, and it accomplishes those things poorly. Citadels most closely resembles a stripped down Age of Empires title. Everything from base building, combat, and resource gathering are implemented poorly. There is no strategy involved at all because combat boils down to spamming units. You can literally spam the most basic miliary unit available and win every time. The utter lack of military units available leaves no room for strategy, tactics, or planning at all. The game has a boring campaign that currently can't even be finished entirely, and a few lacklusted skirmish modes with terrible AI. There is only one map available per skirmish mode and no matter the difficulty you choose you cannot lose due to the incompetent AI. Citadels is only a singleplayer game so these are your only options. There is no map or scenario editor or multiplayer of any kind. The poor quality of this title combined with the utterlack of content at a $40 price point is downright theivery. Avoid at all costs.I only put 3 hours into this game but that was rather generous of me. The boring gameplay, poor design, and lack of content leave little reason for me to play any further.			"

												This game is terrible. The videos and screenshots made the game look very great and detailed, but this game is actually terrible quality and was very poorly made. Here are the reasons not to get this game:1. It's $40, when it's really worth $5.2. The graphics are terrible. The screenshots may look fine, but they actually suck.3. The game looks like it was made by people with very little experience in programming. The menu goes off the screen, and the minimap does not even show the correct positions of things. The map could say that it is directly in the center of the screen but it could not even be on the screen.4. There was no tutorial, and I can't even get past the first level because I have no idea what to do. It says to gather 100 of each resource but whenever I try to build stone pits and ore pits it says that it could not be gathered at this location and no matter where I put it it always says that.I only paid $10 for this game, but it was still a complete rip-off :(			"

												This is horrendous, I keep coming back to this game every few weeks (now months, less and less) hoping some of the main bugs have been fixed. I really enjoy playing it although the wall-building bugs can be enough to drive you insane, I somewhat got used to play around the bugs and limitations.What really drives me away from this game every time however are the crashing bugs, I have been stuck on that one mission for about half of the time I've played this game (the one where you have a couple villages to help and a big enemy citadel to take down - I think it's the 3rd mission or so). Why? Having to restart it over and over and over, all for the same result: game crash. And don't count on using save games either, loading them will also crash the game.I enjoy the game concept and can look past the many UI issues and quirks, but the crashes and corrupted saved games just plain and simple ruin it completely. Apparently there is no traction on even fixing issues as critical as constant game crashes. Although I still hope someone gives it some TLC and fixes the crashes, I have to say I would not buy it again. A definitive don't buy. :(			"

												GREAT CONCEPT! There is a lot of vairty in just one class of soilder, in most games of this nature you might just have crossbow men and archers, you have other type of bow type of soilders so you have to vairty of soilders.Besides that, the game falls flat and is simply broken. Yes the dreaded broken game my friends. I played and played level 3 a several times, and can't beat it because the game doesn't want me to, it's not due to lack of trying or being defeated....It just  freezes on the level after a half hour or so.In any game, buidling your castle is one of the most fun parts, it's a freak'en nightmare. Nothing lines up, even when you think your walls are together they aren't, for some odd reason. When you finally do get your castle walls straight it seems like you only need a handful of bowmen to fend off any baddies. The AI took the short bus to school,  they charge your castle in small groups sort of like they are hazing you and testing you out but they end up accomplishing nothing.It does have an interesting system  when it comes to getting resources, you just don't chop down word, you have to make them into planks with a special production house. I like the mirco mangement, and you can switch workers from job to job. I like RTS games where it takes time to raise an army and it's not just about who can build the fastest army first like starcraft. I would have finished the game dispite it's flaws but at the end of the day when a game is broken and can't play you can't give it a thumbs up.			"

												So this game had the potential to be great, but everything they tried to do was simply implemented horribly. I tried to see the positives in this game to no avail. My rant/review shall now commence.You'd imagine that the wall and citadel construction would have been done right since it's the bloody title of the game.. well guess again, it's horrendous and inexplicably complicated and bugy. (also for some reason, the further away you place your wall, the less fps you have, I don't understand how that could be an actual correlation in this day and age)Another thing is the menus and extremely unfriendly interface. There are many icons which supposedly show different resources.. the only thing is they're basically all the same. Adding to the horrible interface is the crappy layout of buildings and options. There's just a bunch of fancy pop-out menus with NOTHING in them. You will literally see a huge menu with only one option and no tooltips or anything. Oh and remember all those lovely hotkeys that every relatively new rts has? That's right you guessed it, this game has none.As I'm sure you've noticed, this is quite an angry review and has turned into a rant rather than an objective review. BUT, after having played a few skirmishes against the so called 'a.i.' I felt compelled to try and save you from the dreadful experience that lies ahead.I somehow managed to get it for 6 euros and I still feel cheated. This game is so pre-alpha that no one should ever be able to buy it until they at least remove all the bugs and arrange the ai and interface.Save yourself and your wallet, do not waste money on this.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I'm out.

Unfortunately, every single bug remains from when I first bought it when it first became avaialble to now. Peasants will suddenly bug out and stop what they should be doing, buildings will be halted in mid-construction with no way of demolishing them or completing them, and various other issues crop up on a regular basis with no workarounds that I could find.

												Patch Update: Patch 4.0.4 has really done wonders. Villager AI is much improved. The cap for skirmish maps is now 499 (unfortunately, still just the one map :( ), Units make much more ""order recieved"" noise (however it does seem to be location based, if you don't have your screen near your units you still don't hear anything) and it seems most of the outstanding bugs have been squashed.   At 75% off this game is a steal.Patch Update: As of patch 3.9.2 the game has really begun to take a good form. You can increase the unit count in Skirmish maps (max was 99, now is 149), the campaign (which is almost bug free as far as completion goes) is easy enough with the current 99 cap imo. The tooltips in both the UI and unit feedback is much improved. You can finally set your hotkeys to what you want. (units are still a bit too silent for my liking, not gamebreaking though) There are still some things that aren't explained fully during gameplay, (the upgrade button comes to mind) but most of those are easy enough to figure out on your own.The graphics, combat, and physics are cleaner/smoother making for a much better experience. And there are more updates on the way.Not to say its bug free yet. But this game is getting much improved as the patches go along. If you haven't looked at this game for a while, I would urge you to do so, you just might be suprised.Now if they would add more skirmish maps!....Or randomise them.Original Review:To start, yes, there are bugs, (Booo....UI can be a hard one to get a hold of, and tooltips aren't really tippy...) but so far nothing game breaking (knock on wood). But I am amazed on how the game works. Building is phenominal. Gather the resource, and once the resource building is full, bring it to your town center. Want to build a building? The builder needs to grab the materials, then go to the build site. Don't like the building there? Can't hit delete. You need to deconstruct buildings, which takes time, so place carefully. Walls are finally a laborious task to build, no more destroy a wall and build it 2 seconds later.Train your units? Tell them to go to the training center, not just pop out of thin air.Want better stuff? Refine your mats.My only beef is how moats work (almost pointless) and walls, to be effective, need to be ended with a tower, and gates can only be placed on towers (but i guess when you see how they are built, its understandable)The combat is a bit iffy, so if your looking for a deep combat game like the early strongholds, its not quite that refined, but its still a blast.Given the game isn't MP at all, and it still has some wrinkles to iron out, it may not be worth 40 to most people, but if your able to get it on sale (got mine for 32 at GMG and couldn't be happier) please go for it. This is one of those games that has gotten much better because of patches. It's just a shame that critic reviews and most gamer reviews won't account for it.			"

												Okay, just don't... the game is buggy and will leave you terribly frustrated with its imcomplete arcitecture and game play.It was a great idea that gets horribly ruined.  From bugs that wont allow you to finish campaing missions, buildings that wont work together spacially so you have a gap that lets enemys through that you cant see, to AI controlled units that you have no good way of finding or tracking what you have them doing or if they have even completed a task. I have waited 3 yrs for a good update on this game because if they would fix these things it would be a decent game, upon further research i found out that there will never be and update for this game.  The dev teams ceo took the profit made from the poor castle loving sods like me and just dipped, leaving the the rest of the employees pockets empty along with the hope for futher developements.  I don't normally write reviews but I felt that others should be warrned. Please do not waste your time or money on this game, even if it on sale or free. Just save your self the frustration, because I know If I had read this review before buying, I would be $40 richer.BTW my total game time is about 20 hours....hours I will never get back.			"

												A slow moving RTS that encourages digging in.   It is fun but the walls will often not want to attach to your towers.  Then you have to leave a hole, which is unacceptable, or build another tower between and hope it works next time.  This can force you to making arcing walls that you just wanted to have straight, pulling your walls away from your defenses.  A game based on building walls shouldn't have this issue.  Worse than that is the fact that the game crashes for me.  Usually after playing a mission for about an hour.  Hard to play a game that can scew you at any moment and force you to restart the mission.  Not restarting the mission.			"

												I bought this game on a whim, since it was only $10 at the time. I was expecting a clone of the Stronghold series, with perhaps some embelishments or improvements. This game provides neither. In fact, it can't even provide the basic expectations of an RTS game. After playing it for about an hour I was surprised to see this wasn't an 'Early Access' game, but instead claims to be 'complete.'  The game most lacks in its user interface (UI), which if improved, would bring it at least on par to other RTSes.Areas for improvement: 1. Double-clicking a control group (0-9) doesn't center on units. And there is no additional key to do so. This is unforgivable.2. The game helpfully informs you that you are under attack. Hope you noticed that one minimap ping, because otherwise you're clicking through controls groups trying to find the one taking damage, and then remembering where that group is (see 1 above). There needs to be a 'zoom to last alert' key or equivalent. 3. Speaking of minimap. When you have a unit selected, the unit info covers half of the minimap. You can hide the minimap, and the unit info. But maybe they should just make the unit info smaller... Or make the minimap movable?4. Trees block building. And I didn't find a way to manually dfestroy a tree. I looked in the keybinds, and found what can be best called a 'minimalist' interface. You have WASD camera controls (not my cup of tea for an RTS, but whatever), control groups (0-9), and then a couple keys for peasant (resource gatherer) management. No attack-move, manual attack, zoom-to-unit, etc.This game might have potential, if like I said, it was not billed as complete. There's much more I would want, but those listed I think are some bare-minimums needed to make it playable.  To be honest, I haven't played long, but I found myself fighting the game controls and 'lost' for most of it. Pick up Stronghold to fill your midievil RTS needs.			"

												Just couldn't get into it. Old school castle building but isn't. You get to build walls and a small town inside but i found the interface and resource collection to be clunky. The battle's were ok but perhaps something to do with the way the maps worked. Couldn't really get in on the storyline and i found the replayability (even in the storymode) to be a tad under-developped. The game had potential but just couldn't quite cut it. And I'd personally love to be able to make a middle-age castle/citadel.. At least the original castles game (from the 80's) would give you interesting events and show you on your throne making decisions and truly let you build up your castle. Some may like it. Could only recommend though to those who are dying for a medieval 'citadel' building game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I think it's a beautiful game with much potential in it but at the current point(09.08.15) it just unplayable. I needed five attempts to fully finish one round because the game always crashed. And there is no autosave actually so always manually saving. The possibility shown in the trailer where the fortress-walls are build in and onto the concrete stone is just not existing, what actually is very annoying because your building units stuck from time to time behind the fortress wall they are building and u have no other choice as to keep them there or deconstruct the whole wall. What also leads to the next problem the unit limit that is caped at 99 units. I understand that units are objects and they take space in your RAM so they can't just put 9k unit-limit but 99 looks so small and unimportant in a actual battle that I got just bored after the first round. And that are just a few of the bugs I experienced in just 3h of play. So as for me I will stop playing the game right now and maybe I will retry it in about a year again what I would suggest also for you guys. If a dev reads this keep doin but be faster. And as said... Much potential but so far not worth its money and I just payed 5 Euro...			"

												Very basic. Has a poor AI, units do not follow a ""common sense"" and will attack the nearest enemy. This includes buildings, even if they are being attacked by a ranged unit. Gathering units do not retain orders, and thus, if asked to clear a specific area of trees to build, they will immediately default to the resourses closest to the building after dropping off their load.Buildings can be built anywhere on the map, that includes next to enemy buildings. In fact, on the second map of the Arthur campaign, the enemy likes to constantly build resourse buildings next to your own. There is no way of destroying these until they are built. Graphics are poor. Game play is mediocre at best. Not worth the money nor the time to download and install.			"

Also needs to be mouse control not key board, Very unfriendly to user. Not a game I would tell any one to play or purchase. This game needs a rework to it so that it is user friendly to gamers. As of right now I have purchased a game that I cann't play and I wouldn't want this to happen to another player out there. Vedio of this game looks realy good but game play isn't.

												Buggy and glitchy as hell and what language are the peasants speaking?! Without researching it I would say it is a language hailing from the scandanavian region of europe, perhaps even deeper into eastern europe. Walls don't build properly and the game atmosphere is dull and un-moving, not offering much excitement or motivation to continue playing. The build system is a good idea and designed well but doesn't work so well when put into effect. Building a wall section will leave parts onbuilt and peasants cannot complete the unfinished section. Overall looks good from afar (trailers etc.) but terrible up colse (actually playing it). Feels like another Total War: Rome II failure guys, so look forward to indefinate patches and broken promises to fix the game and make it what was expected upon release. ""We've put alot of effort into this game, it's our biggest budget yet!""......... broken on release just like Total War: Rome II. That was not a direct quote from the developers of the Citadels game but similar to something similar to what a developer from 'Creative Assembly' said about during development of Total War: Rome IIOverall a disappointment not worth buying. 3/10- Sexy Vorta			"

												Well I chose to ignore everyones comments about this game and now I'm paying the price for that decision:(   I strongly recomend that the makers and or steam not sell this game to anyone else till they fix it completely or till the disc comes out!! Not only does it get glichy were the screen goes blue and lots of other crazy things! But it also freezes up on me every10 mins or so after you get to the 3rd level :(  It's at the point now that I can only play the frist two levels and it's getting BORING... Stop selling this game for money!   Reimburse everyone that has bot this game in the last few months since the last patch and move on!  If I buy another game and this happens to me again!  I will stop using steam to buy games and you'll loose that much more money!!			"

												Citadels has potential but it isn't worthy it's current cost.  There are many older castle/siege games available on the market that are better in content and gameplay.  Citadels gameplay was okay.  My main complaints were the ackwardness of some building upgrades and the low population cap.  Considering the amount of population required to maintain your economy, a cap of 99 people was maddening when trying to manage an army.  At first I assumed the population limit would increase as the campaign progressed but before I knew it the campaign was over and the cap never changed.  I played a couple skirmish/sandbox games.  The castle defense one was boring on normal difficulty.  I then tried a duel map and found it more fun.  Both maps had ackward terrain to build on.  Steep terrain is a pain to build walls on.  It usually requires building towers close together.  However, if you build towers to close together, you may be prevented from building walls between them too.Overall, the game wasn't very fun to play and recommend playing other games out there.			"

												I see a ton of bad reviews for this, had to even click ""see positive"" to see any of those.  I wish i didn't have to pick whether or not i would recommend it, and i'll tell you why.  When i saw this come rolling in, i guess i took the description the wrong way, as i assumed it would be more of a base-builder/town managment deal.  The kind where you focus more on building walls and planning your town than training troops and sending them to attack other groups on the map.  Unfortunately, i was wrong, this plays like a plethora of other RTS games, all already established with their fans.  Much like the Age of Empires 2 HD i bought sometime back around the november-december sales.  You cna build walls and turrets, but the focus was more on just holding your base until you'd trained troops to go attack other bases.  I can't recommend it because this wasn't even what i was looking for, nor is it any better than other RTS games already available new or old.It's not a bad game, some collision detection with your own units acts weird and the cursor doesn't seem to like being where it is at times, but it's nothing that won't likely be patched up by the time it's at an actual release version.  If you like these kinds of games and want something slightly different feeling but still familiar, sure try it out, but it's no better than what you probably already have.tl;dr, not too bad, not too good, disappointly average.  Wasn't what i thought it was.			"

												Not worth the $10. Look I like me some RTS and usually have a fair amount of leancy on games. This one though just made me mad. The controls are bad. So bad. Its a perspective problem. So when you scroll out to see the whole map the devs didn't compensate for this and you have to move you curser behind what you want to select. Thats ok till you start trying to click the small people on a large map, forget it. I honestly just got past the first level and wanted to never play it again. I'm not usually so annoied by poorly made games, I think its the price tag that bothers me. There are many games that aren't as polished and they take that and compensate the price. This one jumps out at $40 and then makes you feel like your getting a steal at 75% off. No. This game should be a $19.99 game, or $5 on sale. Sure its not a great review of the game but read some more of the other reviews. I did and though dropping the $10 on a buggy game wouldn't be so bad. I was wrong			"

												Wish I could call this a decent game, first 30 minutes were good fun. HOWEVER the nightmare started after when it crashed constantly like no other game that I have previously played, and I run pretty high spec games on my pc, and this one is by far not one of them. Compared to other games of the same genre I would say it ranks around 30/100, due to how much it crashes I found myself loosing a lot of things done because I didn't save every freaking minute. There is no auto save option and no short key for saving either, which makes it pretty easy to forget to save when you're in the middle of building a decent city and a powerful army. I had to leave the game several times before having to reattempt a mission because I forgot to save and it just decided to crash on me, so trust me it can lead you to a rage quit :/Building and Unit quality/content is quite poor, there is very little to do and explore.The AI is completly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they cannot carry out simple tasks like cutting a tree which you tell them to, instead they go off and cut down another tree miles away from where you told them to go.The AI will very commonly forget where the resources are located despite their assigned work place being right next to it... In other words the AI behaves like a 3 year old for most of the time, which is my opinion is appaling for a game of this price.The graphics aren't amazing, however in a strategy game I consider that to be the least important thing and having played strategy games for over 10 years I can still have fun in a game that reminds me of old experiences through its graphics.Personally I really didn't like it, I really don't think it is worth £30 when it lacks so much and the quality is really not the best, many other games of the kind would be a better option if you're interested...All in all, quite disapointed, as having payed full price I had really high hopes for it...

												I do not usually write reviews, but I felt the need to warn people about this game. This is a fun concept if you enjoy strategy games or like whole castle/fortess theme. The problem is the game is designed as though the last 10 years of game developement never happened. There are no tool tips for the majority of the interfaces. You are left to guess what upgrades actually do. There are three game types in skirmish mode, but you are not told any of the information until you launch them. The settings section has you clicking through options one at a time instead of having a drop down menu. The game has a 99 population limit, which would make sense if it was a game with a lot of micro managing of individual units - it is not. Most of the challenge in the game is figuring out how to deal with the tiny population limits and figuring out how to get a wall that is glitched built before the next attack. Essentially if this game came out in 2004 it would have been amazing, but it plays like a game from then with some updated graphics and plenty of bugs with walls and structures. I do not recommend it. I feel sorry for the people that worked really hard on this, because it just didn't come together.			"

												Honestly, most of the reviews are negative. But in my opinion the game is really good even with its cons.This game is definently comparable to Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2.The gameplay is mostly the same, but you can control each warrior, you have more choise in building, more ressources to gather, etc.There are obviously some cons if there are mostly negative reviews. - Typically, I have a GTX 980 + i7 4790 and i run it at 90-100 FPS, which is not so good for an RTS with medium typed graphics quality. (The graphics are like in LOTR BFMO2).- Second point, is that building walls is very specific, and you will need some time to understand how it is to be placed.- The worst part I have found in the game, is that selecting units by holding the right click is problematic.And thats it. Honestly, I don't know how people could write a negative review about this game. Of course the game has to be a bit more polished, but overall it IS GOOD.If you are an RTS fan, but it for maybe 10$, or wait sales, because I would even buy it for 20.UPD : - The AI is stupid, there is no skirmish, and no voice acting in campaign.

												Unplayable piece of garbage. From the very first second, you have no mouse cursor. I check all the forums and it seems that this has been an issue since launch. (Jul of 2013) It is curently 3-19-2014. Looking at the history of this game, it seems that they have shopped around for multiple dev teams to ""help them patch"" and improve the game. It's been a year since launch almost. Time to put a fork in it. You made broken garbage, and you're trying to pass it off as a ""work in progress"". Shame on you. I advise everyone to take this piece of crap off their wish list NOW and go play stronghold. Sad as that may sound, its actually leaps and bounds better than this unplayable piece of crap. * note, the user has to put the game into windowed mode to get a usable cursor*			"

												I don't recommend this game because although it's an RTS war game, there are still glitches where your workers just stand around after giving them commands, they're hard to click because you can't even pinpoint where you are trying to click.I click my worker, and it does not select him...i have to move the mouse about nearly an inch away from where i want to click for it to click the target, which made it extremely hard for me to click things and build my base, not to mention it takes about 45 minutes at least to establish enough of a base to start fighting. Thats too long for an RTS to build a base in my opinion.I play warcraft 3, starcraft 2, age of empires, max it takes is 15-20 minutes to build a base and normally you already have units to fight by then as well....where as in citadels, it takes nearly 45 minutes to an hour to get there.Other negative things i've found:-Everytime you have a worker build something, no matter where it is, or what it is...one of them have to go all the way back to the town hall to get a sack of supplies, now if you build a decent size base, like most RTS players do, you end up waiting 30+ seconds for your worker to run there and back to the building you ordered them to build, which is really stupid in my opinion, it's suppose to be a real time strategy, not a peace treaty of 45+ minutes to build a base and an army of 149 (cap).-Also, i noticed there seems to only be one map you can play skirmish on...big down fall.-There are no playable customization/Races of any kind. Like warcraft 3 had Orcs, Humans, Night elf, and undead....where as this game has nothing but the same exact units for both you and your enemy. Very disappointing to me as an RTS player.-The workers sometimes just stop building your buildings, i had one worker build me a moat, and i came back to see how it looks, and he just decided to never build it and stand there. What good are the workers if they don't work?-For experienced RTS users like myself, we like to use hotkeys to build and command things, it makes it quicker and more efficient for us....there are NO hot keys in this game. You have to manually click each building you want, and wait.-Very disappointed i spent money on this game....even after they supposely did a lot of updates...1/5/2014 review			"

												Seriously, I want to give this game 0, but I decided to give it one, because of the developers' skill of making quick money and then hiding in the shadow. I bought this game because I was so stupid, and because I am a big fan of stronghold games, and was hoping for any castle building RTS to replace Stronghold since the big disappointment of SH 3, but again SH 3 looks so perfect comparing to this garbage that they call it Citadels, its buggy, ugly, doesn't work, unoriginal, even things they copied it from other game they made it worse. Bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can make a better game than this, please avoid it at all cost, and if you already have it, please uninstall it and don't play cause it may gives you AIDS			"

												The steam page for this game makes it look WAY better then it really is.  It's not really that good looking, the mechanics are like monkeys ♥♥♥♥ing a football, there's no intro or tutorial level and the Ui is about as comprehendable as three♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and a squirrel.  Unless they update how the mechanics work, and how the game works actually understandable, this game is not worth.2 towers out of 10.			"

												This game looks really good when you see the trailers. The problem is playing it. There is zero advice or tips for how to use the units.  Building walls is rather difficult in regards to positioning them. There isn't a ""Help"" menu to get you through the basics of the first level. There is no Tutorial. The game does not function fully right now. Got to the point where I should have been able to make units (Swordsman, Archers) wasn't able too with 0 game reference. (You require more Pylons sort of message). DIfficult to play, little to no support. They need to polish this and I think it would be a lot of fun.			"

												8/10 worth $10 while still on sale. the original price seems way too much to ask. This is the type of game that gets better as you get the hang of it. The UI needs a little work (lack of quick keys), need option to change keyboard key binds. Don't expect this to look like starcraft II but the gameplay is smooth and unique.			"

												After reading through the majority of the reviews of this game I can't say I agree with the majority of them. True the game takes a little time to get into but it's worth having the patience for. Maybe not worth the full ticket price but be sure to pick this one up in the sales.80% Fun time strategy, 20% been there done that before			"

												This is quiet possibly the and I quote myself ""DA BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED."" For example, the campaign is completely enthralling. The story is way too good, it's like mixing Call of Duty with The notebook. The gameplay is flawless, with it's unique way of mixing completely broken mechanics with a near unplayable controls that makes it some how makes it perferct. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!			"
