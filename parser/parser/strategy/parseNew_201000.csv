												I love spiderweb's games. This one does not disapoint. Its a great rpg, it calls for strategy not just hack and slash your way through masses of enemies. The story line is great, it is understandable without miles of dialogue to read.the quests are pretty much up to you which ones you will take or refuse. there is a lot of ability to create your character your way. Lots of skills, able to choose what stats to up, and good variety of classes to choose from. The world is pretty big. The graphics are classic swiderweb style. You dont have to have played previous games in the series to know what is going on. Its a great stand alone game. there is no lag, crashes, freezes, glitches or sound errors, that i have found. The combat is turn based. you also can choose which side you wish to be on, you are not stuck with just one side ... this has multiple endings and alot of easter eggs, hidden goodies and well worth the price of the game.

												previous Geneforge 3 reviewGeneforge 4Graphics: Almost the same as previous games.Control: Nice and clear tutorial, fixed key binding.Replayability: Almost none to meAnd now we are playing for the Rebels! See the other team perspective cliche. No. Just no. I NEVER wanted to be a Rebel. So this game pointed a sword at me and tried its best to made a turncoat out of me. It failed. I ended becoming a turncoat Rebel. A sworn enemy of the Rebellion.I feel this game is linear, that is not necessarily wrong. We are back at the continent but the free roaming options are painfully limited and to gain access to other areas you have to check plot points. In order. What I love in Geneforge 1&2 is the freedom to go almost everywhere when you feel like getting there. Climbing the mountains to chat with Trajkov, crossing the desert to chat with Barzahl and random Drakons, looting everything not nailed down. Those were the days.Things I learned:-Rebels are mad, really, really mad.-The Rebellion must be crushed asap.continued in Geneforge 5 review			"

												This episode of the Geneforge series leaves an amazing first impression.  I imagine it will be more of the same as previous installments, but so far : * You can play as a servile, or one of four other character classes (combat, stealth, shaping, magic).* You get to use the geneforge during the tutorial. * Light sources exist, so if something's too dim to see you can actually do something about it.* New graphics sprinkled in here and there!  Not only items, but for people too -- making NPC's easier to tell apart!* Some new creations entirely -- one per type.  Also, there are skills for shaping Drakons and Eyebeasts.  How cool is that?The first three games were a bit cookie-cutter at times, although the level design and writing always saved it -- but this installment is going out of its way to differentiate itself, right off the bat.  I'm psyched.			"

												If you're looing for the most recent ♥♥♥♥♥ glisten renderers, then this is most certainly not the game for you.  If you're looking for a compelling story well told with a gameworld so deep you need to bring a canary and spelunking equipment however, Geneforge 4 is for you.			"

												You will want this game.I loved the politics behind everything. I slowly made my way through the rebellion only to figure out that the rebellion wasn't all it was cracked up to be. I'm sure if I played as the shappers, I would have felt the exact same way.When you get about 3/4ths done with the game, you start feeling a serious amount of dread because you know there are no good guys in this plot. I loved it.			"

												The first Geneforge game I played, and still by far my most favourite.  This is an excellent game, and one of the best top down, turn based RPGs I have ever played.  If you like games such as Baldurs Gate, then you have to play this.			"

												Geneforge 4 is truly a masterpiece. I've spent 51 hours on this game at the time of review and i've only gotten 1 of the 7 endings as 1 of the 5 classes. The story of the game takes place in Terrestia, a land in the middle of a war between the rebels, and the shapers. The shapers have the power to create life, and use magic in helpful ways, but also in unhelpful ways as well. They made creations and serviles for slavery purposes, to do their work for them. After hundreds of years of slavery and mistreatment, the creations and serviles finally had enough and decided to rebel against the shapers. At the height of the war, you are called in to fight by Greta, a rebel. You take a boat to Southforge Citadel and use the Geneforge, a hidden rebel way of making someone capable of shaping and magic. You then decide what side to fight for as you make your way through Terrestia aiding the shapers, rebels, or another sect hated by both rebels and shapers alike. The end is flexible and can change, and the gameplay can change as well with the classes you can pick from. Even though the graphics are primitive, it is an indie game, so it is actually very good for just a few people. Text in-game also adds to the game by providing a description of the land that you are in, as to help with imagining it better. The sound does get a bit repetitive, but it still fits the mood of wherever you happen to be, whether it be a town, cave, or the woods. Overall, this game is an indie masterpiece, as well as my favorite RPG of all time, and i've played quite a few. A hidden gem in gaming for sure.			"

												I have never written a review on here, but considering this is one of the best games and one of the most underated games ive ever played, ive decided to try my hand at it. Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay. Pro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.          Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike.            LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri  have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.          Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.          Can easily engulf you in for weeks.          Lots and Lots of TextCon's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination            Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.           Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.Overall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing. Heres to you, Spiderweb Software.			"
