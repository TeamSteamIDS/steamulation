												How to play this lovely user-friendly gem:1) Install DRM client - Steam2) Download the game3) Stay in online mode / run it for the first time. You thought small little game like that would be ok just to use one DRM protection steam is? Think again...4) First screen - enter serial number... Done? Not quite yet...5) Second screen - activate your product or register you product online... What? Really after having it already protected by steam and serial number... Ok, let me try to use the registration button..6) Third screen - Register. It says: ""Please fill in the boxes below. All marked boxes must be filled in: First name, Last name, Address, Postcode, City Country, Birth Date, Gender, Email. Also the form takes technical info about your pc specs."".. What the fff!!!??? My bank didn't ask me for as many personal details when I was setting up my personal banking account... Thankfully there is an option to go back and have this cancelled.. Still I am asked to activate...7) Fourth screen - Activate. On the next screen I am welcomed with this message: ""It won't happen often, but you may need to provide your Internet connection information. To do this, just press the 'Connection settings' button.. At this stage I do not really believe.. What a piece of cra... DRM protection, serial key, activation and now this? This seriously must be a joke... But curiosity wins. That must have been the last screen.. I click through.. and..8) Fifth screen - ""Thank you! Battle vs. Chess product activation has been completed successfully."" But.. but.. What is this... ""Your access code is: 1234-5678-9012-3456. Please write down this access code for the future use"". What access code? What future use? Have I already not used an external DRM protecion? Have I not given you a serial key? Have I not been asked to register and activate this piece of annoying yoke and asked for my personal infomation (that I declined to do) and my Internet connection? What is that bloody access code needed for? Seriously lads? What is wrong with you...I would delete that piece of s by now but I am actually desperate to go through only so I can write this review... (and get steam cards maybe). I click OK. 9) Finally, It looks like I can run the game.. can I? Yes, it looks like I can...10) ""Funny"" fact - Even if i refused to provide any of my personal info on the registration page and I skipped that screen, the game somehow knows my first name and logs me in with it without my permission. Nope, not the steam login/username, but my real name that is not publically provided. How and based on what information. You guess...Avoid. 0/10 "

												For chess enthusiasts who only want to try playing the game in a different way this game would be a good buy. However, for chess players everywhere who wants a game to compete in then please stay away from this game, stay farrrrrr away.Newbies in the game will have a fairly challenging time playing against the AI but for veterans in the art the AI will look like the ultimate morron you don't wat to play with. The game will be decepting initially as dozens of openings have been loaded in the program to make it look like the game actually knows how to play. Indeed if chess simply consisted of knowing how to move each piece and a set of opening move lists then it's a good game but sadly chess is not such a simple game. After the opening sequences the AI just fumbles about and you will later realize that the only real good thing in this game is its graphics.No multiplayer in this game. I'm sure someone would defend it and say that there is but let's face the fact that without a lobby and a working matchmaking feature it might as well not have any. For something that's so dependent on multiplayer it's outstanding that the team that created this game greatly neglected the multiplayer interface. The only way you can connect with someone is by knowing their IP which means you can only play with friends and the truth is if you're here on steam playing chess, it pretty much means you're alone in that circle of friends with that same taste in board games. This means for most of the game you will be playing alone and you will get bored... a lot.While playing alone there are mini games you can play. The classic chess, and other challenges like giving a checkmate with only a king and a rook. This is good practice for beginners while a good laugh for seasoned players. However, other than that, the other minigames are just bad. Other than the challenges I suggest you stay far away from the other minigames cause it will not help you get better at the game called chess and instead help you get better at mashing your head with your keyboard.So for who can I recommend this game? If you liked the brutal chess matches shown in Harry Potter Sorcerer's Stone then you might want to try this one. If not, and you're just looking for a program to hook up with friends and strangers and play the game then please do yourself a favor and close this page because this game is not for you.			"

												There are 300 layers of DRMs and registrations before you can actually play the game. At one point after I re-entered my serial key (copy and paste didn't work) they even wanted me to confirm my registration by giving them my phone number. I can't see how my gender, address and birthday are relevant to a chess game.This game is secured under so many layers of register confirmations that I doubt you'll even be able to find people playing this game online.If you want to play chess online just check chess.com or something.PS: I only have 5.8 hours on this game because I got it on a bundle and idled it for cards. Avoid at all costs.			"

												Positive points (DLC's within):- Nice looking maps- Much and nice gamemodes- Not bad looking graphics- Beautiful animations- All in all a very nice game to play and for learningNegative points:- Server are down- DARK KING IS TOOOOOOOOOO OVERPOWERED IN THE GAMEMODE ""SLASHER""Neutral points:- Music is pretty nice but after a long time (normal by difficult matches) it sucks- Sounds are nice but the dark pawn sucks if you plan something and mark him- Campaign is long and challanging- Campaign is on a few times to difficultFinally review:It is definitely a nice game with all this points. But if you want to play with your friend, you have to play on one PC or on a LAN-Party or you find ""external"" server like ""Hamachi"". But if you don't need it so, you can play with the Bots.The game is for ~20€ to expensive, maximum for ~10€ it would be a good game. The DLCs are a bit to expensive to for ~7€.Sorry for my ""german-english"" language! :)			"

												The game looked like fun, so I bought it for a few bucks some time ago. Now I wanted to play it after the install and steam prompted me to put in a serial number. Okay, while I always find it more than a tad annoying for a game to have an (unneeded) extra layer on top of the steam drm cake, I know that procedure from other games, and hence followed suit. But hey the registration fun doesn't end here, not by far. Next step is activation via internet/phone/messenger pigeon/whatever, which doesn't work in 99% of the cases. And if you are ""lucky"" enough to get through this screen with success, there is ANOTHER one waiting for you, where you have to put in your name, address, gender, birthday, Internet connection information, AND pc specs to pass on to the next one. After giving away all your data (and possibly your soul) for free, don't forget to write down the 569358 parts of the access code you are now seeing-- you might need it in the future to be able to play/reinstall this perfectly user-friendly game.  And all that to play some (mediocre) chess. Joys of joys, amiright?! Tl;dr: Avoid this craptastic drm-simulator at all cost. Play some free chess on the internet instead.			"

												If you are looking at this game for multiplayer: Avoid. No reasonable multiplayer whatsoever. The only way to connect to another player is by direct IP address. There is no lobby, nothing.For singleplayer, it's mediocre at best. Sure it looks great and battlechessy, but it gets boring quickly. Buy it on a 75-90% off sale only.This game won't entertain you for long.			"

												A poor remake of the classic Battle Chess... The graphics were already very outdated when it was made, the animations are dull and ugly, the ""kills"" aren't funny, the camera interface isn't very interactive and it moves in a rough way and the CPU thinking is very slow. To make it even worse, the game is pricy and the multiplayer doesn't work at all. I'd recommend any free chess games you could run into...It made me want to run Battle Chess on DOSBox or on the NES emulator... Those were the days... How I loved the Queen ""kills""!			"

												I never played chess before, but this game makes a lot of fun. There is a nice tutorial who explain you how you can play and let you do a few exercise. Also there are a lot of different play modes.i can`t say that the game is realy easy, since I´m realy bad. I lose often but yeah, I`m just a beginner. I like the game mode where you have to fight before you or your enemy can take the place. So there is a little change to win but controlls are often realy fast and you cant press the right button at this time.Level Design is realy nice, beauty colors and backgrounds. Music is realy calm and suits with the background. Chess looks realy good too, you have a few Charackters, not like the real chess. Your horse looks like a horse and jumps, they have good animations.From me as beginner a 8 of 10. Good game to learn it a bit and have fun for a while.			"

												Review ENG/ITAIn this moment i don't recommend this game, it costs too much for what it offers. It has several problems during the start, it hasn't multiplayer and CPU at max level ( 9 ) will take about 4 hours to think 1 single move. It's graphically beautiful and it has several game modalities very nice ( campaign for example ). But for its price i expected more.Gioco sconsigliato in questo momento, costa troppo per quello che offre. Dà seri problemi durante l'avvio a numerose persone, è privo di un vero multiplayer e combattere contro la CPU di massimo livello ( 9 ) in schermaglia vi costerà 4 ore reali di tempo per singola mossa ( è il tempo dato alla CPU per pensare con una profondità di 15 mosse ). Per il resto è carino, sia graficamente che le modalità di gioco che offre ( come la modalità campagna ). Ma per il suo prezzo, e considerando che è un gioco un pochettino datato, mi aspettavo di più.Vote/Voto: 5/10			"

												What is Battle vs. Chess?The game is an adaptation of the more or less ancient board game chess. The modern rules of chess were invented quite recently, as you will know.Battle vs. Chess offers two campaigns, some minigames, 20 or so puzzles of which some are actual chess problems.Battle vs. Chess does NOT offer a good AI. It is merely intended to be a compilation of some more or less funny or even unfair chess variations where you have to think unorthodox to win.  It offers a good value, if you can grab it on a sale, but the DLC are even more overpriced than the main game. Now I do understand that some work went into this, and it is fun to play while it lasts, but it does not last very long. With all the basic framework already done, it would have needed only more chess variants, maybe including some popular ones to play against the AI, or maybe even against each other, other than the five that are already there.Yes, the game has multiplayer but does not use the full potention by offering only a small part of what we find in the campaign. Sure, some campaign variations have hidden objects or fog on the board where hot-seat would be difficult to play. But even that bit of more variety for local multiplayer would greatly enhance the game.The multiplayer - with five variants including losing chess - can be played on Hot Seat or WAN/LAN. I did not find an online multiplayer button, but maybe I overlooked something (please comment below!).As it stands, it is a fun chess game to not be taken too seriously. Getting all the king medals in all levels was fun and sometimes luckbased, and for that it was worth receiving it as a birthday gift. :-)Recommended? For chess fans, when it is on sale for under 5 Euro.As of writing this review, it is 86 percent off, for which I recommend getting the game!-----A small summary in case you don't know chess:Chess is a board game for two players on an 8x8 grid board. Each player has 16 pieces, divided into six kinds: One king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, eight pawns. The pieces have different movesets, including the ability to do special moves under very restricted circumstances. One of those rules, for example, forces pawns to promote to another piece when entering the opponent's back rank.The game is highly strategical and tactical, currently there are (as of 2015) over 200,000 registered players worldwide. It is estimated many more play it as a hobby without ever having joined a club or tournament.			"

												Introduction The ancient game of chess has many forms. It was one of the first board games in the world and almost everyone is familiar with it's rules. Because of the game's fame, it would come to no surprise that there has been many chessgames since the existence of the game industry. In 1998 the first Battle Chess appeared, a game in which chess pieces were brought to life and fought fiercefully against each other. Now the developer TopWare Interactive brings us Battle vs. Chess, which takes this principle of alive slaughtering pieces to a whole new level by delivering better animations, tons of game modes and online gameplay.StorylineYou might not think it would, but Battle vs. Chess has indeed a storyline. The campagin tells the story of the eternal battle between good and evil. The white pieces are members of 'Order' alias Heaven and the black pieces are members of 'Chaos' alias Hell. Both sides have their own campaign which is explained by means of voice acting and occasionally some animations. Let me also add that you shouldn't expect any thought-through cutscenes.Each mission starts the same. After a brief intro is shown, which for example tells you that your troops are being attacked in the middle of the night, the chess game can begin. Every time you'll get a limited number of pieces to work with, for example, a king and five pawns. With these pieces you will have to defeat the opponent's pieces, which vary as well. The variation of chess pieces and win conditions will challenge even the most insightful. So a warning seems to be in place. The difficulty is in fact pretty high.Learning ChessDespite it's high difficulty newcomers to chess should not worry. There is a surprisingly comprehensive tutorial available that explains all the rules of the game. Through all kinds of diagrams and illustrations you can find out how each chess piece moves on the board. There are also some mini games that will help you with understanding the rules of chess. There is for example a game where you only control one horse and the goal is to get to a certain point on the board in as few moves as possible. After learning how each seperate chess piece behaves it's recommended to start using the whole set of pieces. You will again be faced with certain situations you need to solve in just one or more rounds. This whole setup is ideal beginners to understand the game on a different level. Let me also add that experencied players will surely benefit from this  interactive way of learning, because after a while you will be confronted with some tremendously tricky puzzles. Game Modes In all modes, you will see a brief fight animation between the conflicting chess pieces. The camera will zoom in on the violence that is taking place and it will trigger the start of a short minigame. In this mini game you will see a real battle between the two pieces in question, but how you win it can vary greatly. It all depends on which fighting style you picked.In the beginning of a game of Battleground you get to pick which type of fighting style you prefer. It can either be Duel or Slasher.The Duel fighting style is similar to Guitar Hero, where you'll have to push the buttons that appear on your screen. The course of the fight animation is completely dependent on the number of correct buttons that you press. If you go on the attack and win, the other pieces disappears. If you lose, both pieces remain standing.The Slasher fighting style is without a doubt one of the most elaborate modes. If you or your opponent hits a piece, a war breaks out on your board. For example, if a pawn hits a horse, five pawns and horses appear. All of them will now enter a battle in a hack-and-slash style. In this mode you have a lot of freedom when it comes down to how and who you want to attack. You can pick the heavier attack where you will hit several pieces at once. Every chesspiece has a healthbar, which will force you to think about a strategy. The reason why you need a strategy is quite clear, because after the battle is won and the losing pieces disappear, the winners will continue with a health bar that is narrowed.SettingGraphically there's very little to criticize in Battle vs. Chess. The game is beatiful and it's, especially in the beginning, pretty cool how the fights are animated. There are several options when it comes down to the board itself. There are levels where the skies are cheerfully green and some where everything is ablaze. Sometimes the beautiful animations and scenery takes your attention away from the game. You'll see lava flowing, rocks crumbling beneath the board, skies filled with birds and all of that is being supported by smooth and easy going instrumental music which really compliments the whole setting in itself.ConclusionAll in all, it's a magnificent game. Battle vs. Chess is probably the most comprehensive chess game you'll find anywhere. There are plenty of modes that will entertain you. Either alone or with a friend. The animations of the fighting chess pieces are keeping the whole game alive and interesting. Although I do have to admit that there's one small problem. The camera. It's far away and even when you zoom in you still can not distinguish some pieces quickly. Despite this easily ignorable problem, this is probably the best chess game you will ever play and certainly a must-have for both novice and experienced players chess players.			"

												Multiplayer does work. It doesn't have an interface and the host will get a message that they're connecting until the person they're trying to play with enters their IP address via direct connection.Multiplayer steps over the internet!Host needs to find their wan ip by typing ""What is my ip address!"" into google. They then have to give that IP to the person they want to play. Once the host has Create a LAN/WAN game and setup the game they want they will get a ""Connecting/Waiting msg!""Their opponent has to choose direct connection and enter the IP address while the host is on the loading screen! BOOM it works!This game works fine. I played my friend who kicked my butt every game. I hosted a game here in the UK and was playing my friend in the US. The setup might be a little awkward at first but its easy once you know how. I suspect local multiplayer would just be a case of finding out your lan ip by typing ""ipconfig"" in the command promptAnd having the opponent use that instead of WAN(Internet)IP!This game does what it was supposed to. Don't let comments put you off.			"

												Battle vs Chess is basically a chess game.  There are several playing modes as well as mini games. What I love about this game is that each piece is intricately animated and as players move them around the board they spring into life, ready to wage war and when you attack a piece they engaged in a bloody combat before it is removed.  Each individual chess piece has been designed beautifully and really add to the whole experience of this title.  It is probably the most innovative chess game out there however ther is no multiplayer mode and that is a big draw back.  You can play local co-op however.

												The game looks really awesome. I wanted it for all the wrong reasons though. I expected the multiplayer to be Online multiplayer. It's local lan/wan or same pc only, with options for X-Box controller or Keyboard use.That aside, the game is great, except that the AI takes ages to move when they are losing. I mean ages. Hour per turn isn't really exciting, and being a steam game means you can't play something else in the mean time if you're running it through steam. There is no setting to play classic as a speed match that I saw.AI needs a boost, online play would be awesome. Pretty good game... but the key parts are missing for me.5/10 - 8/10 if you want to play with someone at your residence.			"

												Battle vs. Chess is probably the most extensive chess game out there. It is full of superb modes that give the classic game a ""twist"", and an A.I. based on the Fritz engine that will give a good challenge to new and experienced gamers alike.Technically neat, but the problem lies within the nature of 3D chess games: It's confusing at times, and the mini games pretty much alienate the original game. Chess fans, however, will find long lasting appeal and a lot of challenges to take on.Do you want to play chess with action-elements? Then Battle vs. Chess is your game.			"

												The game is rather simple... after a few moves you understand the way it takes decisions and can find a way to fool the AI to do what you want... Minigames are fun at first, but get tiresome fast...Decent game to have in your library for a dull day, but otherwise, I'd recommend quite a few other games...There are problems starting the game if you have 2 graphic cards (in my case HD4000 + GT 565M), you have to go to where you have installed the game (<steam_game_collection>\steamapps\common\Battle vs Chess) and use NVidia's contextual menu (if you don't have it, enable it in NVidia's Control Panel) and choose for both battlevschess.exe and Activation.exe to run using the dedicated card (NVidia).

												A chess game that offers a choice in ways to play chess based games, from 2d top down classic chess through to detailed and fluid animated 3d fantasy figures bashing each other in duels which you control through the use of QT button presses.From the perspective of a casual chess player BvC is a good chess game which offers so much more in ways to play a game of chess with modes that inlcude chess themed mini games, like chess mixed with bejewelled or chess duels where, your piece batttles ( through the use of QT button pressing ) an opponent piece attacking and defending their health until one wins.There are two single player campaigns with games that start with various starting content and format, these require the achievement of certain objectives, such as converting one pawn to a queen, in order progress on through the story.There is also stand alone single games, which can be played with animated battling pieces or the classic 3d chess peices like Staunton, these can be played against ai or onther player sharing the PC.BvC also includes a tutorial section that covers each piece on the board. In the mini games section there are games which encourage learning e.g. you are given a board with a piece for you to use to take the one undefended piece amongst several laid out, this has to be done in one move, after completion further scenarios are presented continuing until a timer runs out.I took a small chance buying this as I was unsettled by the mixed reviews and this won't run posts on the forum, well for me it installed and ran fine first time I use the xbox360 controller which is fully supported and I have not experienced any of the issues or problems that have popped up in the forum and I am enjoying playing the varied modes this title offers.

												This is one of the few chess games where you have animated people instead of usual pieces. Well, not exactly people, these are rather Forces of Light against Demons, that sort of things. No need to tell you which side stands for black pieces, I guess. Each time a piece is taken, a brief battle is played between the figurines. (Hint: you can turn on a mode in which the result of the battle depends on how fiercely you fight, not on the rules of chess game.)It happened so, that back in 1990s one of my very first computer games was Battle Chess. In this game, I found a new and refined version of it. Name similarity is not a coincidence, be sure.Back to business, though. There are several reasons why you might like this game, in addition to the ones I've just mentioned.- It has fine graphics. Pieces and their fights look good and bright. You can also choose the way your board and its surroundings would look like. There are several variations of it, starting deep in the hell itself and ending with heavenly castle. Classical board and pieces are available too, in case you're not a fan of animation.- It's not all about fancy exterior: there's a solid chess-playing algorithm behind it. It's called Fritz, I think, and it's a rather known award-winning chess AI with loads of matches and combinations in its memory. You'll certainly like it if you are tired of chess applications which always try to play one and the same matchgame with you. AI mastery level is adjustable.- It can serve as a training simulator. There is a bunch of chess lessons inside, as well as challenges to solve. You can either learn the basics of chess or improve your skills. (I believe it even has chess-themed minigames.)- There are several non-standard game modes. One of such is mentioned in the first paragraph. They can offer considerable change to traditional gameplay, if you seek for some new experience.- You can play with a friend on the Internet or LAN. I should mention, though, that establishing connection might sometimes be tricky. When I tried to make a match with some of my friends, we could only play after telling each other exact IP addresses of our machines.So this is it. To sum it all up - it is a nice game, and it has my support; I recommend it to your attention. With a proper discount, it's even nicer.			"

												A poorly adapted version of Battle Chess. What made Battle Chess great was the humour involved with taking pieces. In this its just boring and slow. The animation for moving a king is about 8 seconds, he spins in circles on the square zzz. The campaign is weak and provides little entertainment. The game was most likely designed for console therefore making the controls a complete mess and painful to use. Definitly a regretable perchase.			"

Doesn't matter as this uses 3rd party DRM that requires you to manually type the CD key into an activator, then phone home to an external server which then gives you some activation number. No idea how many activations you're allowed or whatever. I find this DRM on top of Steam completely unacceptable and therefore cannot recommend this.			"

												Don't waste your money. The game probably won't launch. The steam forums and teh developer's forums are full of threads about the problem but no one seems to care. Contacted steam for a refund and was given a runaround and finally gave up. This is the first time I've actually been disappointed in Steam itself but with the numerous complaints about this game they should be ashamed of themselves for keeping it available for sale.			"

												Its nice, because its chess in a very creative way. Music and animations are enjoyable.You can play in two different mods, solve tasks or just play regular chess vs. the engine.The tasks are constructive. I enjoyed solving these problems, while watching animations.In addition, there are two campaigns playable.But, there are some cons.Playing regular chess vs the engine is very easy (9 levels, Lvl. 1 - 6 not countable)Additionally, the thinking time at level 7 is enormous and you cant play online vs humans.

												7/10Great chess game for PC. Didn't fulfill my hopes of a new 'Battle Chess' but has many good features to make up for it. What's lacking in this game, all evolves around the graphics.Pros:- Decent release. Had some graphical issues on and a bit after release, but the developers put effort in and fixed them. As of the current state it appears to be bug-free and working well.- Has a good campaign. (And an evil one too. lol)- Imaginative gameplay and variety in ways to play without departing from chess.- Has animated pieces.- Has a 'Combat' type gameplay which is fun to try out, but it is seperate, so you can still enjoy proper chess without loss to strategy from poor fighting.Cons:- The interface is a little slow despite lacking depth.- Animated pieces lack character. This game could be SO much better in that regard. A rook that teleport slams every single unit just doesn't give the fun or enjoyment of a rook that pancakes a pawn and the eats the queen.Would be nice if something similar could be done with this game. would buy copies for friends and promote it as the long sought next gen battle chess if it did...- The combat mode is a refreshing addition to the game, however it lacks depth.

												    You can ignore this evaluation if you don't mind,then +1.    Admittedly the graphic is well,you can play your game not only on a traditonal chessboard but also sundry battlefields,that makes the game lively and interesting,as the game's name,you are playing a battle of chess,not normal chess game.what's more,there is a particular play that beside usual game playing,every piece can do a fight with enemy's piece,attack or counter.your chessman has a chance to kill the chessman who want to kill him,equally enemy's chessman could wipe put your chessman when you want to do a capture.It reminds me of Harry Potter I.In additon,campaign and mini game have many endgames,I don't like endgame personally.An obvious drawback is that the pieces have only one appearance,hope it will be some DLC or MOD to provide more pieces' mode.    Single play is roughly decent,but the multiplayer is bad,you can't match another player to play an online game.The game provide another kind multi play game,LAN game...so,if you wanna play a multiplayer game,you must ensure you have a friend in your room or in a same local network with you.Of course it is ridiculous but the truth is players are scarce.    If you don't want to play any multi game and interested in single game,the game is just fit you,but no one can make sure how long you can keep your interest fresh.    If you are looking for a chess game which can find many friends to play with.The game is not fit you,but I have a better recommend,the QQ game is excellent,absolutely.★☆http://qqgame.qq.com/☆★ "

You will be given the activation code - write it down in case you want to reinstall the game later on - that*s it. Game: Classic Chess game with nice scenarios and animations - great for casual play. As a nice add on it offers a campaign mode, different minigames, different starting set ups and some variations of the classic rules to spice it up in case you like.			"

												First off All Game-Rating 10/10.The ""copy cd key to display"" like other games is for the first start to check you owned the fullversion cause steam can not verify through the chess game server. Just start - copy key - the game ask for key - paste it and hit enter - done. No info entering needed or else like other people got issues with..i cant confirm those statements. Its just like the outdated down-server of GFWL.Now about the Game..it has all in it. Classic chess, battle chess , puzzel , challenges and muliplayer online / local. U can switch the pices layout everytime live with a single button. Classic-wood , topdown symbol and animated-action-fighting-moving-chars :) .. Puzzles/Challenges sooo many of them..no kiddn, many many of them. Alot of Board-world layouts form a simple wooden board to an epic looking animated location with integrated board.Next for the fun is battle-mode where you must fight by your selfe eyerytime a fight encouters at the board. ...overall this is chess in every single way. Graphics r amazing , controller support and so many game-modes will guarantee tons of hours business and joy-filled fun....rdgs mcpcosmo			"

												The battles are determined by DDR-style ""press the arrow key when it gets to the end"" sequences, and whoever fails first loses a bit of health. Pawns do less damage to pieces in battles than other pieces, so if you're fighting, say, a knight vs a pawn, the knight only has to win 2 or 3 times vs the pawn's 4 times. If the captor wins, he captures the piece, otherwise they ""retreat"" and both pieces sustain some damage. Basically unless your skill levels in the duel battles are even, and you enjoy that kind of thing, the whole chess game doesn't work. Online multiplayer does work, you just have to make sure both sides forward the two ports; it worked for us on the first try. Go to ""LAN/WAN"" to play online multiplayer. I paid for this at an 85% off sale, for which I'm very glad I didn't pay more. There are a lot of other game modes, but that seemed to be the most interesting, and it wasn't much fun. Single player might have been better, I guess?			"

												I didn't find this game as bad as many others. Maybe because I got it cheap on sale... It has nice graphics as well as smooth moving animations and piece movement. As far as 3D boards go, it's better than any others I've used.The alternative chess rules this game uses can be very frustrating, such as building a mating net only to lose the fight to checkmate the king and then have your mating piece removed. There as several different modes of play so if this upsets you too much you can always play 'normal' rules. "

												TL;DR: Awful Chess Game, Weird Controls, Weird Perspective, Weird Opponent. Stay away.The game is essentially a chess game with fighting animations, so in my opinion the main question is, how good a chess game it really is, as the graphics are essentially only nice the first times you see them. As a chess game, I think it is a rather bad one.It is  a console port that does not support normal mouse controls, ie picking up a figure by clicking on it using  a pointer. Instead you need to move the cursor through the squares of the board. (edit: This apparently has changed and it is possible to move the cursor in a normal way).The angle and way the board is presented makes it very hard to properly see things, and this cannot be changed if you want to keep the animations.The AI is soso and the game does not give you an ELO rating to select, just some ambiguous lvl of the opponent.There are plenty of free chess games available on the internet, and I think it's hard to find a worse one than this! Clearly, don't buy!			"

												Only buy this game if you adore chess. If you're expecting an introduction to the game, look elsewhere.This game is extremly fun, it offers many unique twists to the normal chess formula, and it's actually quite difficult. Don't listen to the reviews, all of them complain about the lack of multiplayer, but if you really play this game, you'll realize that it is a single player.If you want a chess game, this is the way to go.

												I highly recommnd this game to all who likes strategies and chess as a deep thinking game. Very beatiful realisation of the classic game in fantasy world, including storyline and diffreren minigames. As an alternative you could switch to classic view of the board. As for the chess, the famoys Fritz is used for this game, so a lot of challenges await you. As a summary I think this game has really good value for its price.			"

Battle Vs ChessOverall Score: 5/10Graphics & Sounds In terms of graphics & sounds this game delivers. I liked how the black force have that demonish look & white force look like some heaven guardians.You also have variety of maps to play on.Chilling sound on the menus & overall sound effects are well done.Game Modes: This game offers you many ways to play a chess game (see below) so if you're THAT intrested in chess games (or to play against your friends in Lan) I recommend this game to you.1) Classic matches against the A.I (skirmish) & other minigames. 2) Battlegrounds - A whole different vibe to each battle. I recommend trying this game mode I just didn't try it because I quitted on this game early so don't make the same stupid move as I did. 3) The Campaign itself (2 campaigns actually for white & dark forces).4) Multiplayer (which has none but if you fancy you can play with your friends via Lan).Gameplay: 1) Controls are basic & easy to use.2) Guides - Explains about the basics of a chess game. So if you are dumb like me who never really playing or got into chess games, this guide will help you to get used to this game.3) Gameplay itself - Now this part is tricky because personally I tried to really like this game but it got on my nerves because it is challenging (even on easy difficulty).I can't simply play a single chess game that will take around half a hour of my time.For some reason I thought it would be more easy to win a chess game.. I mean what could possibly go wrong by making moves & defeating the enemy units. But no, it's not.So after around 3 hours of game time (1 hour is me learning how to play) I decided to give up on this game.Conclusion: So as you see I'm neutral on this game. I would recommend it only to those who played chess games before and liked it, or those who willing to pay few bucks to get a computer beat-down. Otherwise, skip it.If you think about ever playing a chess game.. You can start with this but don't say I didn't warn you.Overall Score: 5/10* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale (Wouldn't buy it more than 5-10$)****** Recommended On Full Price.

												The really fun part of this game for me is the Battleground Mode. It has been designed such that winning is dependent on the player skill in terms of dexterity and not entirely on your knowledge of chess. The puzzle section under minigames could be quite fun too. I definitely recommend this shi!. :)			"

Cognac - 1 tbsp. l. Shelled walnuts - glass sequence of preparation: dough defrost naturally at room temperature (defrost time indicated on the package). Cook the custard: grind the egg yolks with a mixer or a whisk to a conventional incandescent and vanilla sugar, flour and brandy to enter the mix. The mixture pour a trickle of milk, stir and cook, stirring constantly. Divide the dough into the desired number of pieces that will later Korzh. Roll out each piece on a board sprinkled with flour. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes until golden color on a dry baking temperature of 200 degrees. Fluff the cooled cream cakes. If desired, each layer sprinkled with chopped nuts. On top of the cake lightly press smeared with cream and sprinkle all sides crumbs. Add layer cake in a cool place overnight.			"

												Love this game; it is a cool representation of chess as a 3D animated battlefield. It more than holds it own against other games such as Battle Chess and Lego Chess. It really brings chess to the mainstream, rather than just to geeks. I would really recommend this game to anyone of any age and level, because it's especially great for story-mode/campaigns and for multi-player mode (LAN, direction connection - can use a VPN - and local).The campaigns (Order/White + Chaos/Black) give you a lot of surprises, either in formations, restrictions and other twists (I have yet to finish both campaigns). It's got tutorials, skirmishes and ""battlegrounds"" (an added variation where you can literally fight pieces).You can't save, and at least on a Mac OS X you can't see hints, but that's ok because it forces you to learn and play better. The animations are fun, but sometimes I got too distracted and lost important pieces, so I changed to 2D or standard 3D pieces.As of yet, the Mac OS X version isn't quite optimised for the keyboard because I don't have a PAGE UP nor a PAGE DOWN button, and the CTRL button doesn't work - for potential purchasers, don't worry, but it would be great if we could customise the keys so we can get just that little bit extra out of the game. The only other thing I can suggest is allow players to increase or decrease the AI difficulty level in campaigns.Thanks for developing this game!PS. Please can you fix the limited activations for Steam, because I regularly change my laptop every year or two.			"

												As I'm not really a much of a chess player I really can't comment on how good the AI is at playing chess.  What I can say is that if you're a chess master this probably isn't your game.If you know how to play and don't get upset by someone moving the goal posts this is probably the chess game for you.  The duel and slasher modes are a lot of fun, and honestly what I play most.  Doing this you actually fight one on one and you can throw the chess rule book out the window.  So in short, if you want chess with a difference and some animated fighting this is a great choice.  If you plan on being the next chess grand master, probably not for you.			"

												Battle vs Chess was a surprisingly good chess game for me. The game tries to innovate with 2 modes where you fight during captures, and while these modes were OK, i prefered the classic game. The pieces are well animated, but i was confused by them and switched to the classical flat pieces. But they're nice additions. In addition to the classic game with 10 levels of difficulty (and some alternate piece placements), the game also has 30 campaign missions with various objectives and different rules. Beating them requires skill, but beating them with a gold medal (in a set amount of turns) is frustrating at times because you need to be lucky that the AI helps you. And there's also some nice chess puzzles. In the end, this game will satisfy your chess needs, whether you want to try new stuff or just want to play the good old-fashioned way. What i didn't like was the amount of extra DRM that this game has. Using Steam should've been enough.			"

												This game is beautiful. One of the best or maybe the best chess game for none chess players or perhaps even pro chess players. It has so many game modes and it's graphics is excellent. They even now just supported Linux.			"

												Dreadful interpretation of chess. Better of on chess.com or just getting a checkered board. Waste of money at any priceEdit 25/11/16: This game is still awful and the above statement holds true. Voted for ""Worst interpretation of an existing game"" award 2016.			"

												You remember your time in the chess club?You remeber all the training and learned to solve ""board situations""?If not, it´s time to dust off your memories, because solving ""chess board situations/challenges"" is excactly what this game is about, at least in the campaign mode.It´s not Fritz, but the AI is decent to give an < 2000 ELO player a challenge and something to think about, combined with a nice visual representation. So if you don´t want to try hard, and become a chess master, this is a nice educational chess game. Nothing more, nothign less. "

												Issues have been set straight regarding the registration key. I enjoy this game a lot so far! :) Review might change as I continue playing but it's a pretty sweet game if you're interested in playing chess or interested in learning how to play it.			"

												O jogo é bom, mas pra quem quiser jogar em pvp no próprio pc com alguém presencialmente ou contra o computador (tem 9 níveis). Não funciona online (exceto em Lan). É um jogo de Xadrez comum...Só custa muito caro, talvez se fosse mais barato seria melhor.			"
