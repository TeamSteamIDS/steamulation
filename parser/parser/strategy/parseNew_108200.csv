												I recommend staying away from this game and this company.The game was available for Linux and they decided to drop support for it, leaving PAYING users like me without a game.I can't even install the game anymore, not even the old versions.Shady business practices and lack of respect for customers.The worst part is that at the time of this review, they didn't even update the game description It still says: "" True cross-platform: players can challenge on other platforms including Steam PC and Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone and iPad"".

												Ticket to Ride is a great game with plenty of replayability.  There's no one set strategy to playing, which makes online play fun and engaging.  Most of the players online are speedy and will play through the entire game, even if they're losing.The addition of achievements has added some of the fun into playing with bots back into the game, even for long time players like me.Unfortunately, the lastest update has virtually broken the game.  Not because they changed the design or moved where things are, but because the client won't manage to stay connected for more than a single game, if you can manage to get the server to stay connected that long.I can't, in good concious, reccomend this game until a massive patch is pushed through.  Pick this game up, with a few map packs, while it's on sale, but have patience.			"

												I cannot unfortunately recommend the latest update of this beloved game.Put quite simply, the AI has changed from somewhat rational and predictable humanlike AI into completely braindead train-layers who will overlay multiple routes to get from A to B.  Further, the layout of the game screen and buttons has changed, making gameplay confusing.  The prior iterations of this game were sublime; this one is a drag.			"

												The last update is a disaster. Instead of normal online game you now get something with ""notifications"" that spam your inbox (sound effects notifying your turn were obviously found not useful and are now used when you end your turn), graphics wants to bite your eyes out and whoever did the design forgot to play the game at least once to see how it works (adding new ticket always showed you where the towns you need are, now you can't see it because there's random stuff flashlighted on the map)Don't fix something that ain't broken?

												The PC adaption (and iPad/iPhone versions too, for that matter) of Ticket to Ride is a very faithful recreation of the classic board game, where the only gameplay differences between it and the physical version are fast and accurate scoring and the fact that enraged board-flipping is no longer a possibility. (Not to mention the bonus of the game + DLC being cheaper than their physical counterparts, and is significantly easier to play with people on the other side of the world!) So, for people who have played the board game before, I think this should be a no-brainer.However, I wrote this review for those who aren't aware of the greatness that is Ticket to Ride and are seeing this from a bystander's point of view. You might be thinking that this is just some boring train game played only by weird people who smell funny, as a diversion from their regular riveting pastime of watching grass grow. However, I can assure you that this is most certainly the opposite of the truth.Ticket to Ride is, in actual fact, quite a tense game that can quite easily take you from absolute confidence in your position to having all your hopes and dreams shattered, as you realise that you didn't take that vital Los Angeles > Las Vegas track yet due to over-confidence, that you had multiple 20+ point routes hinging on! Not to mention the level of back-stabbing and collaboration that can come into play (especially with the Steam overlay making this oh so easy), that can easily create bitter feuds between two rival rail barons, which can last across a series of games.Overall, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable, classic example of a game that's easy to learn, but difficult to master. It's always a good game to play with friends, strangers or alone with bots, especially as each game tends to only go for 45 minutes at most. (Although you can quite easily find that time has flown, as you wind up having rematch after rematch, without noticing the time passing by!)			"

												Does not work anymore. Platform: Windows 10. Although I do not miss it terribly since the computer players got weird logic at some update, I am quite unhappy that I have now no game at all. The minimum requirement should be to keep the games at least playable even if all development has been stopped. This kind of behaviour does not encourage to make new purchases lightly.			"

												Great adaptation from board game, but if you were a Windows or MAC gamer and bought this title, and suddenly it stops working with no warning or notification, you would get furious.

												This is a great board game with lots of replayability, especially if you have all the expansions. Prior to the latest update, I played this game for well over a hundred hours both against strangers online and people on my buddy list. However, since the latest update (both here on Steam and on the Android phone app... yes, I own both) the game is extremely unstable. Crashes are so frequent that the game is nearly unplayable. If the game manages to stay open long enough to play, there are often numerous server disconnections during a match. Play is frequently plagued with audio bugs (sound effects that are supposed to play once, but instead play endlessly on a loop until the match ends) or animations freezing.Until a patch is issued to fix these problems, I can't recommend this game.

												Outstanding PC adaptation of a classic board game.Each turn a player takes a couple of train cards or spends those cards in order to place trains on pre-defined routes.  Completing some objectives like a continuous route between two particular cities earns the player more points.So the game is both about strategy of choosing what routes to use and how to achieve that, while also denying your opponents from achieving their targets.The game is well balanced and the DLC additions while far from necessary certainly add to the longevity of the game if you find yourself enjoying the mechanics.  Surprisingly for a game like this, the AI is decent.  However in most cases it is not difficult to win if you have even a modicum of strategy.If you've always wanted to try a board game on PC then this is a good place to start.			"

												Ticket to Ride is a faithful reproduction of the Alan Moon board game of the same name. Unlike most other modern board games that are being ported to tablets and Steam, Ticket to Ride (video game) was developed in-house by the same company that publishes the board game, Age of Wonder.Age of Wonder is a well-respected game company; their board games are polished and attractive, with lots of ""fiddly bits"", as board gamers call the detailed pieces of the game. Their attention to detail that is displayed in their board games carries over to the video game versions, as well. The sound, the controls, the in-game tutorials... everything about this game sets you up for success. Ticket to Ride is very much a game that is well-suited for a video-game version. There are many things to keep track of - cards and pieces on the board - and it plays much faster with a computer doing all the arranging. A game that takes about 45 minutes to play around a table takes about 10 minutes to play in this online version, and is equally satisfying. The video game version also lends itself better to expansions and DLC versions (alternate rules, really). Expansions that cost $25 for the board game because of production and distribution are just a few bucks here. The video game is a great way to try out the expansions before you buy the board game equivalent.My one  complaint is that it is a bit complicated setting up an (optional) online account with their servers to track your online matches, but if you do, you can track your gameplay on Steam, iOS, Android, wherever. This is a very nice feature, if you are an active player.I recommend Ticket to Ride if you have and enjoy the board game, or if you enjoy board games in general. Not recommended if this isn't your thing ... if you aren't a board gamer, you probably won't like this much. "

												This was a good game. However, they have updated it a couple of times and each time the game got worse. The game itself is good, though it would be nice if you could change the diffulculty settings (it's fairly easy). The artstyle was better in previous versions, but the worst part is that the settings don't work anymore (for example the fast speed button is broken). And worst of all is the increasing amount of banners, pop-ups and other commercial in-game activity that cannot be shut down.Verdict: good game, but increasingly annoying interface.

The artwork went from rich to drab, everything is smaller and harder to read, and they've moved virtually every visual element for no apparent reason.The AI has been lobotomised. I just beat it 173 to 38 while not paying attention.I can't stay connected to the servers.This new version looks and plays like crap. I can't fathom what prompted them to invest time and money in such a significant overhaul of such an old game. But if they were going to do it, you'd think at the very least they'd make sure it was an improvement.I had a game I was perfectly happy with, and paid good money for, and now it's gone. I don't see myself continuing to play this unless I can figure out a way to roll back the update.			"

												I really wonder what DoW were thinking.This is a perfectly working, cross platform game. Cross-Platform multiplayer, DLC support, good stand in the community.Actually, Ticket to Ride was one of the very first games to get linux support, at all. Way before the SteamOS initiative. Hundreds of linux gamers probably own multiple licenses and DLC thanks to Humble Bundles (Just checked, and I own 4 base licenses and 3 DLC licenses). And then they decide to secretly stop support, mess up the distribution and ignore those who have problems.Had they actually announced this in time and given a working no-DRM solution for our archives - no one would blame them. But this is very, very bad behaviour and the only way out of this mess is to announce full support yet again and do something for the customers that have problems.			"

												Ticket To Ride is probably one of the most enjoyable board games I've played in a long time. The rules are rather uncomplicated and have a very low learning curve, taking only one game session to pick up. I quickly found myself putting hours into TTR, wanting to play just one more round. It's an incredibly well-balanced game, with fantastic elements of risk and reward that encourage you to change up how you play.As for the DLC, I'd reccomend Legendary Asia and 1910 at most. LA adds some new rules that up the ante, and the maps in 1910, especially Big Cities, changes up the base map so it's not the same thing all the time.			"

												Ticket to Ride is another great board game that has made the transition to a digital platform.The adaptation has been done well and remains true to the original board game.The background music can get a little tedious and get on your nerves after a while, but that can easily be turned down or off.There are many options for gameplay, including single player v’s AI, online multiplayer, local multiplayer (providing all players are on the same network/wifi) and even a pass and play.  You can play against people across different platforms (PC, Android, & iOS) but with recent updates Linux support has been withdrawn which has contributed to a multitude of negative reviews from understandably annoyed players.Overall the game itself is quick and simple to learn, yet varied and challenging enough to keep you coming back to play more.  It is easy enough to understand the game mechanics and the game achieves a good balance between skill and luck.  The UI is simple and easy to understand, allowing you to follow everything happening in the game.  With the various DLC’s now available, they allow you to keep the game fresh and pose new challenges to maintain interest.Overall this was a great a board game that is arguably just as good as a digital version (providing you are running it on a platform that is still supported)Pros: Well executed adaptation of the much loved original board game. Multiple ways to play (single player, online multiplayer, local network multiplayer and pass & play). Quick and easy to learn. Well laid out UI.Cons: Linux support has been withdrawn. OSX users having problems after recent update. Background music can be annoying. "

												This pains me to have to not recommend this game. It used to be awesome. I played it for many hundreds of hours on ipad before getting it here. I played this game once here before the updates, and it was great other than not being able to use my ipad account to play here. It's understandable though, so not a huge deal. Just really didn't like having to start over in karma.I can't even get into a game to play anymore because nobody wants to play with low karma players. I know how to play, I just don't look like it before I even start to play. This is only an issue NOW because before it didn't matter what your karma was, they couldn't kick you out for it. I get why people would want that feature added, so it's great for those who don't have to start from the beginning.I tried starting my own game. The new game making system was just tacked in there, and there are loads of new options which aren't very clearly explained. The UI is horribly messy. On the old system, you could make a game for 5 people and start it before you get that many people with the push of a button if you changed your mind or didn't want to wait for that many people. You can't do that anymore. You just have to wait for the board to fill up with the specific amount, or go back and change the settings and then wait for people to show up again as doing that removes the game you had already created.I never got the chance to experience what the online game itself was like after the update though as the game forever said it was waiting for new players. There was no button to start the game. I was just left waiting for something to happen. 10 minutes waiting for something to happen when you have your game seats filled is rediculous. I couldn't even tell them what was going on as the chat wasn't working. It's very broken. I don't know if this is just the mac version of the game that experiences these play glitches, but it wasn't very enjoyable.So, here's to hoping they fix this once brilliant game. There was no need to retrofit new gameplay options in. If it aint broke, don't fix it.			"

												Ticket To Ride has been my favourite board game for about ten years now, and this addaptation is totally worth getting!For those unfamiliar with the board game; the game has a perfect mix of luck and strategy, making each game challenging yet fun. Your goal is to finish destination tickets (e.g. New York to Los Angeles) by claiming routes on the board that eventually let you have a path going from one city to the other city on your ticket. To claim routes you need to collect train cards in the colours needed, picking your choice from the face up cards or the face down deck if no colours are available you could use. It's pretty straight forward and you get the hang of it very fast.Then each map (in this case DLC) has it's own extra rules to add a little challenge and to make no two boards play the same way, making them also worth getting!This game addaptation has its flaws, yes. The online games can be hit or miss, though most of the time I have no problems at all playing against others, and the devs are constantly working on fixing issues. The single player games against the bots can get boring and repetitive, as each bot has their own way of playing the game and you get accustomed to it very fast. The bots are definitely good for new players though, not too tough but still challenging. And I still have fun playing against them to see how high of a score I can get or just to mess with them.And for those who want just a little extra challenge, the achievements can be quite tricky to get. 100% hunters should be aware that one achievement will take forever to get (play 20,000 games) and that each DLC adds their own achievements. (base game has 25 achievements, each DLC adds an extra 5, Europe+1912 adds 10)			"

I only wish there were more maps  available (e.g. Nordic Countries). Note: an option for limiting the time one can spend in a round would be useful, because quite often you are forced to wait long  seconds for other players.			"

												The Gameboard.It's the perfect option if you like to play with friends and have a good time talking about stuff. The gameply translate well from the actual game, the sounds are good enough, the online play works perfect. The only downside are the graphics, but it adds compatibility so you can play it on a toaster.Oh, and the DLC's sums variety and hours of fun to the base game.Edit: The game changed a lot and now it has a bug that crash the game at launch. Beware.			"

												Steam shows I have 7 hours played. All were on Linux. Now Ticket to Ride has disappeared from my list of SteamOS and Linux games and I'm unable to play.Just like that—a product which I paid for has been removed from my steam library. Poof! It's gone. Days of Wonder has my money, I have nothing.Amazing that Valve permits developers to just disappear items from people's libraries for which they've paid money.			"

												A new Version is out. Sadly, now it's very buggy and feels unpolished.Furthermore, the DLC prices are very expensive. The new board India costs currently just as much all the other boards together. I can't really understand it, because I bought the complete pack and now it's not complete anymore and I will never pay so much for a single board.I change this review, when the bugs are fixed. This game needs a Patch for all these little problems.Because, I like this game and the loading times are now extremly improved.If this game is on sale you can already buy it. :)But not for the regular price for the actual status! :(There are sound bugs, cursor bugs (invisible mouse), (high score bugs?), crashes and more and still not patched.

												This is a fun game to play with friends, I have many more hours playing the actual board game.Draw cards, place trains, complete routes for continental domination.HOWEVER, the online playerbase is not big... at all. And a fair number of players will only accept you in game if you have a certain rating or higher.I do enjoy the game itself so I bought the DLC.. have not yet played on any DLC maps. Most players just play on the classic map.It would be nice if there was a reward or achievement system to make the game a bit more gratifying.. but there is not.If you have friends that like it and want to play, I sure won't stop you. But for the price of this game, I would say invest elsewere.5/10			"

												I've been enjoying Ticket To Ride for so long on my mobile device I've decided it's time to write a few impressions here as well.First of all, what is TTR? It's digital version of fun, strategic board game that lets you build your railways between the cities on the map. The goal of the game is to build as many railroads and 'clear' as many tickets as possible by combining train cards of different colors. It is one of those easy to learn, hard to master games which eventually turns out to be the main cause of complete mental breakdowns of its players while they scrape their last cards trying to clean their goals. It's a great board game and the rules are well balanced between luck and strategy, meaning you might be getting a great hands and still get completely destroyed by other players and their tactics.Digital version of the game is pretty much polished. Lately, I've been encountering this 'authenticating' pop-up which ends with 'server error' message, but you can cancel it and go on playing. TTR offers solo, online, local and 'pass'n'play' options for up to five players, so no matter if you're able to sit down through the game or can spend only a few minutes each day - there's a mod for you.Additional maps (boards) and rulesets are available as DLCs and currently you can get complete DLC pack for less than five bucks which is super cheap.Where I live, base version of Ticket to Ride board game costs around 35 €. Expansions are either equally bloody expensive or unavailable. If you want to avoid mess and/or don't want to support greedy local stores, be sure to get digital version of Ticket to Ride and enjoy this fine, cross-platform mind boggling lunacy.***If you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews "

												For those who have never played Ticket to Ride: it's a fantastic entry into the world of board games. The rules are simple enough that anyone can understand them in a few turns: draw colored train cards to save up enough of them to claim routes between cities on the board and make longer connections using multiple routes between destinations to score more points. Turns happen quickly and competition for routes is fierce, making for an exciting experience.While the best way to enjoy the game is to pick up a non-digital copy and invite some friends over to play, sometimes a quick game is preferable (or the thought of spending $50 on a board game sounds a bit risky). That's where the digital version comes into play.For this game to not earn a recommendation, Days of Wonder would have had to totally drop the ball. While this isn't a perfect adaptation, the PC port available on Steam is a pretty good one. The game menus are ideal for newcomers, but a little less direct for veteran players. The graphics and sound are appealing, the interface inside the game is intuitive, and online play is a breeze (well, except for the occasional player who takes way too long to take a turn - and sorry if that ends up being me). While I did run into a bug that prevented me from making a valid move once, that is out of dozens of games. Several of the expansions and maps are also available for purchase at a lesser price than the physical versions, making it an ideal way of trying out new ways of playing Ticket to Ride before investing in them.The only legitimate knock on this version is the lack of local multiplayer. While the PC might not be the most popular platform for this feature, it is a bit puzzling given that it exists on other platforms, such as the Xbox 360 and iPad.Overall, Ticket to Ride is a great board game and this is an above-average implementation of it recommended for fans of the game and anyone curious about board games in general.

												Ticket to Ride does not want you to leave.  Ticket to Ride wants you to stay... forever.Okay, a little overdramatic.  But I've had this game since the original version, and while the original version had its issues, the new one is just awful.First, I do like the timer idea.  It keeps one person from holding up the game.  It's great... when it works.When it doesn't work, one player accidentally gets disconnected from the game, does not get replaced with a bot, and then forces the entire board to wait as their would-be time slowly ticks down.  Want to leave?  Sure... provided you don't want to reflect negatively on your karma score.  If you want to keep your karma (or, heaven forbid, keep playing), you have to stay there until the bot comes in.  Woe if this happens at the beginning of a game and the timer is set to fifteen minutes.  Hope you have other things you can do.I have also had the timer count down when it wasn't my turn.  I have twice had one player accidentally get disconnected from the game, causing a massive chain where everyone got kicked out.  Just when I'd gotten some decent tickets, too, dammit.Graphically, the game will continue to highlight the cities of tickets I didn't keep.  After I complete a route, the board remains darkened.  The time continues to count down while it shows me what routes I finished.  Little stuff that, while not game breaking, is very irritating and shouldn't be happening for a game that's been around this long.There is no report bug option in the settings for individual games, nor one I can find to report players while in a game.  Report after the game?  The forum button for Days of Wonder doesn't work.Oh, and the kicker?  Neither does the exit game button.  You are here... forever.  And if you do manage to leave, it sends you a message that you have a turn waiting.  Even if you have clearly finished all of your games.If these issues are fixed, I would happily and heartily recommend this game... it's a one of my all-time favorites.  But while this buggy, time-wasting version is active, I think I'll just have to break out my tabletop copy of the game.ETA: As of March 19th, I can exit the game.  Sweet escape!  Unfortunately, others are still having the problem, and the rest of the gameplay issues are still broken.  Sigh...EETA: April 24th, after the newest update: still having graphical glitches and Steam notifying me I had an unfinished game after it was clearly over.  At least I didn't get kicked out the online game this time.EEETA: After the June update... nope.  Still having graphical bugs and just got kicked out of the game due to sync issues.  Again. Keep trying, Days of Wonder.			"

I'm not into having to study rules etc but this game was pretty easy to pick up and learn with minimul fuss.  You can multi with friends, strangers or bots (or a mix) and the play time is pretty quick (20 mins or so per game on average).  Picking it up dirt cheap was a bonus but after playing this game I'd have happily paid full price for the base game although I will wait until the dlc's are on discount before I get those.  Very addictive, easy to play, fun way to pass time but be warned, you're likely to play and play and play and time will fly by :D			"

												Ticket to Ride is a casual train based card game where you have to complete routes to destination cities. This is accomplished by drawing color coded train cards and placing those cards on the map. You score points based on the train length and completion of train routes. Game ends when a player runs out of train cars and the player with the most points wins. Pretty simple gameplay, but there is some strategy underneath it all. If you find yourself struggling to find something else to play, I suppose this can fill the gap.			"

												Did you like the board game of the same name? If so, you'll love this, as it replicates its mechanics precisely. As an added bonus, it also keeps track of the fiddly bits so you don't have to do so.If you've never played the boardgame, this is a rail baron simulation. You are dealt 5 destination cards, and must keep at least three. Each turn, you can select train cards (which are colored; some lines require a specific color, though there is a more difficult to find wild card), lay track or draw new destinations. If you complete a line between the two destinations indicate on a card, then you receive the value posted on the card. Longer routes, if completed, generate more points. Additionally, laying track also gets you points, even if it doesn't complete a line. Holding destination cards in your hand when the game ends means you lose the point value on those cards.I've only played this with the AI. So while it isn't as fun as playing with your friends, the AI is more available (but only has an option for three AIs; the board game allows for six players IIRC).Anyway, a nifty game. The DLC replicates the maps found in the variety of versions sold by the boardgame's owner.If you want to be robber baron, this is your ticket.			"

												Excellent translation of the tabletop game.  I've been playing this on a kindle for about 2 years and just recently added the Steam version to my account.  I agree with many of the other posters, that the AI players have been ""dumbed down"" in the more recent updates.  However, the online and LAN play allows interaction with other humans so that you can generally get some more intellegent play :)  I actually like the UI changes that have been made, as the original UI was limiting to ""landscape"" oriented maps, which kept the India and Nordic expansions from happening (my biggest gripe about the kindle version).  I own the tabletop copy of the Africa map, and look forward to that being ported as well.			"

												This game was okay.. Never great, never horrible but okay.. Was worth getting when on sale... Was not quite stable when it was new, but it was forgiving in crashes, you were able to rejoin games, sometimes without missing even 1 turn to the computer in online games, and as they worked on it, it got more and more stable.. It's an occasional, few games every month or two type passtime, but not anymore. The latest update not only totally revamped the interface, but it broke the game worse than ever before.. Now, any error, disconnect or glitch in the game and it's over... Might as well throw in the towel because you won't be able to finish the game you started and glitches will happen a lot.... Since the last update, out of about 10 games attempted, I been able to finish 2.  At the time of this review, this game is in the worst condition it has EVER been in, years after it's release, and I've not only given up on the game, but I'm giving up on anything Days of Wonder puts out in the future, because it takes a truly incredible level of fail to completely break something this late in it's life cycle.

												Lots of people are not reccomending the game for port reasons and the fact that linux support has been removed seemingly without warning. Not a good move, IMO.That being said, for Windows machines, this version of Ticket to Ride seems to work just fine. I haven't encounted any frustrating or game-breaking bugs, but then again I only really ever play it in the singleplayer mode. It's certainly faster than playing the analog version of the game. The Europe map plays better than the standard one and can be found at a pretty reasonable price during sales. I'd say the strongest point of this version is to act as a singleplayer variant and to help learn and/or teach the game. It took me forever to understand the tunneling mechanic and the ferries system on the Europe board, but having an interactive version helps a lot.			"

												Ticket To Ride has always been one of my favourite board games, so I decided to get the PC version, too (including all DLCs). As a player, you have to build railways between different cities, according to the route tickets that you drew at the start of the game. It's a great game that, at its core, has a lot of replay value thanks to all the different routes you can play and the different maps and other game mechanics it offers. As a bonus, the art is great too, giving you that awesome industrial/steampunkish vibe that goes so well with... well, with the whole train theme.Pros+ It takes less time to set up than the board game and plays pretty fast+ You can play solo, with Steam friends, or even just with online strangers+ You still get to enjoy the art+ It's a fun, strategic game+ It's a lot cheaper than the actual board gameCons- Absolutely horrendous AI. I won a game where the AI had a score of -1...- It's a buggy and unstable game, especially in multiplayer- The UI is messy and it's difficult to find what you need- The DLCs are kind of expensive, especially compared to the main game- No inclusion of my personal favourite DLC for Europe, 1912- The background music and the ambient noises are terrible and tend to ignore the fact that you put them on low volumeI really wanted to recommend this, mainly because I love the actual board game so much. However, this is a buggy and unstable game; even as someone who loves playing solo, the AI is just not smart or strong enough to offer me an actual, somewhat intelligent challenge (instead of juist randomly building railways wherever it can). I only play it for brief periods of time when I'm a little bored or looking to pass the time with something really simple.So nope. You're probably better off playing an older Ticket to Ride version, or just setting up the actual board game.			"

And you can almost always find someone online to play with, wich is great. But even if you don't you can always practice with the offline version against the cpu.If you are new to the world of ticket to ride, give it a go and you will not regred it. It is really easy to learn and you can have fun for hours. Suddenly you'll find yourself trying to persuade some of your friends to tag along. If you still not sure, go rent from your local library and try it, then you'll definatelly get it.What are you waiting for? Do it...			"

All Aboard!A friend grabbed this for me and got me addicted to this wonderful gem. Ticket To Ride is based off of a board game of the same name which is equally fantastic and you should pick it up.The rules are simple: you wanna connect Point A to Point B—locations in which you are assigned pre-game. You've got colors to a designated road that correlates to cards you must collect before completing a segment of the train. The game ends when a player has only a few rail pieces left. I haven't played against other players yet but just playing against the NPC and solo-ing it is fun and relaxing. There's a variety of maps to explore with different sets of rules making the game more challenging. It's all strategy and some luck. I recommend this for anyone who needs a quick board game fix.8/10			"

												In principle I can recommend this game to everybody who enjoys the original board game, as it is a very good digital realization of a very good analog original.Enough has been said about the game mechanics etc. in other posts, and just as most I do enjoy a nice round of planing, scheming and backstabbing against/with other real players.But there's another aspect which forced me to give a negative rating:Under Ubuntu 14.04 (as well as all other Linuxes according to the TTR steam forum), the DLCs do not work any more after the last update, meaning I cannot play on the additional maps I paid for! The publisher is aware of the problem, yet a solution is not in sight.As soon as this problem is resolved, I will change my review as the game itself is fine. But as nothing has changed over the last two months, I can't help do feel deceived so far.			"

												This *was* a B- game, and one of the games I played most on Steam.  Replayability is endless with all of the expansions one can purchase for reasonable in-app purchase fees.  Problems include annoying notifications in-game that NEVER shut up, information you need being covered up during game play, and the point breakdown takes forever at the end of the game (you can bypass this, but then you never get the stats, just the final tally).  Most annoyingly, perhaps, is that even though you paid for the app and even though you paid for new expansions...THEY NEVER STOP GIVING YOU ADS.  Constant ads for their other games and non-digital games NEVER stop.But the reason a B- game turns into an F (i.e., not recommended)?  It STOPPED WORKING.  It can't be opened all of a sudden, and Days of Wonder (maker of the game) have not responded to customer service requests.This is a broken game.  Do NOT buy.			"

												The PC version stays true to the formula and offers both single and online play. Online play comes with your standard chat room where you can create games and invite friends (or strangers) to test your mettle. If you’re the anti-social sort, like me, you can play against the AI. There are also other maps available for purchase via DLC in case you get tired of seeing the USA map.  There’s not much else to say besides that the PC version works well and is easy on the eyes. The electronic version is nice to play for when you don’t have a lot of time to set up and clean up the board game version. If you’re a fan of light strategy games or “Ticket to Ride” in general, then I highly recommend picking this up.

												Ticket to Ride is a great game, and worked fine for a long time.Unfortunately a recent update (November 2015) has made everything so much worse, and it's honestly one of the worse updates to a game I've ever seen with tons of bugs. Now there are graphical glitches, buttons don't work, there's multiplayer connectivity problems, the AI is worse, unnecessary route completion animations are present, the end-game score count is slow, and so on.  Until these are fixed I cannot recommend the game in its current state.There was nothing to warrant this update, so I don't understand why the producers would trash a game that was working extremely well. Seems like a waste of time and effort. Don't fix that which isn't broken!			"

												The latest update of this game is a real let down.  It worked wonderfully before.  As many folks have indicated, the AI is horrid.  Previous AI was more human like.  All it does is lay down tracks.  I don't think I've seen the AI pick additional destination tickets aside from the first ones it picks.  I wish there was a setting for choosing the AI's pattern/thought.  Why did they feel the need to update?As it is, I can't recommend it.  The board game itself is great, but I don't enjoy it like I did before the update.			"

												While the game itself is good, the singleplayer AI is extremely stupid, and you cannot adjust its difficulty. Even when you make it blatantly obvious what you're trying to do, the AI will never intentionally block you. Beginner players with no strategy at all aside from just trying to connect their cities have a high chance of winning. Players who are actually good at the game will almost always win.			"

												A pretty straight forward board game that is easy to learn but impossible to master.  The best thing about this game is that their is no perfect strategy to win and most of the time it all comes down to the tickets you start with or hope you end up getting.  Much easier to play with other people on PC than it is to pay 50 bucks for one map and have people come over.  The setup is done for you and everyone can play at the convenience of their computer and it isn't too bad finding opponents to play with.  It has a rating system so that is kind of neat to see how you stack against other players.  I think the additional maps are worth the investment since they all play differently, better than paying over 200 bucks for the physical board games.  Not too many fancy features and sometimes the online play can be glitchy but it's a fun game to play with friends when you want to play something but also be able to relax at the same time.  Once you start you'll probably be hooked.8.7/10			"

												Tickt to Ride is a RISK Sim that plays as well and can grow to become just as intense. Get yourself a few friends and grab a boxset of this game and have a load of fun. Games last around 1hr per game and i wouldn't reccomend the add-on packs, they are pricey and unless you have a fetish for different names places it really won't change the game at all. save your pennys and wait for them to go on sale. A fun game for 2-5 players. and a very easy to use and stylish interface. :)			"

												I've been playing Ticket to Ride quite a bit lately. Essentially its a bit like a fast version of Monopoly, with trains, except that instead of building hotels and collecting rents you're using train carriages to claim routes between cities. You start out with a choice of cards depicting routes to aim for. On each turn you can draw two coloured carriages, one loco (which you may use in place of a carriage of any colour), or another route to complete. You cannot discard any route cards - if you don't manage to claim them all, unfinished ones count against you. To claim a route between two cities all the carriages you place must be the same colour as each other, and often need to match a particular colour (or one of two alternatives) shown on the route itself. There can be many ways to complete a long-distance route - but other players may be looking to claim segments you require. You can really spoil someone's day by blocking them at an opportune moment.Single player mode vs the game's AI is not great (though it does allow you to learn the game at your own pace), but playing online against one or more human competitors can get quite tense and challenging. The game is simple to learn, quick to play, but is well constructed and has an interesting balance of conflicting strategies. Its absorbing entertainment and good value considering that the boxed game costs £40.The DLC isn't essential. The base USA game is the most balanced of the boards available, but the alternatives do provide some variety - if you can find other people to play against, which isn't always easy on the non-US boards. If there's a bundled offer to pick up all the DLC's for cheap I'd recommend you go for it, otherwise check out just the main game first.			"

												My group of friends is very into board games, however we live hundreds of miles away from each other. Therefore, Ticket to Ride seemed like a good idea (and it was). I will say that interface-wise, what you see is what you get: it is a true-as-can-be replication of the board game with a little bit of sound. After some initial futzing around, the game client is relatively easy to operate. Joining games can be a little odd, and because the game was designed for mobile devices, clicking can be a bit off at times (CTRL acts as a drag or double click or something). Given these minor bugs, being able to play a board game with friends faraway is a win in my book, even if the controls lag out once in a while. At the end of the day, the game is solid and does what it should. Plus, it has a wistful harmonica melody that will haunt your dreams while adding atmosphere to your game about railroads!PROS: stays true to it's physical counterpart, online play, no sorting of little plastic trains!CONS: wonky controls, more misclicks than I would like			"

												Well, Ticket to Ride.It's originally a board game that soon transferred to online play, and it has been controlling my gaming life ever since I have gotten it. Its one of those games you can play when you are bored, and then become immediately joyful and (for a lack of a better word) un-bored. The aim of the game is simple: play trains, connect cities, farm points. The way you play it is entirely up to you. This is how good the game actually is: I was torn between recommending this to those who don't have it, or actually boot up the game and enjoy it all to myself. Unfortunately for me, I chose to recommend it. And now, you should get it for making me waste my precious TTR time writing this.(NOTE: This game is infinitely more enjoyable with a friend playing with you, and I assure you that there is at least one person who can play with you. But just get the damn game. I'll be waiting in the Lobby.)			"

												The Perfect game for the holidays or anytime. With Ticket to Ride you will race against your friends in a frantic race across America. If you are tired of playing the same map there are several more to choose from thanks to some fantastic DLC. Beware however this game is quite addictive and it may cause you to keep bothering your friends every night to play with you. Ticket To Ride it's like Risk but with trains!			"

												It is exactly like the board game. In some ways it is better than the board game, it goes a lot faster and it highlights your ticket routes saving a lot of time. I was pleasantly suprised when ALL the versions of the board game were available in this. Lots of fun, although, the game is kind of buggy somtimes.			"

												Classic table top game. It's a great adaptation of the original board game, but I must say there's one thing it can't do - multiplayer. It's one of the great things that we all love about the board game (at least those who know it). My opinion is that if you're unsure of the game, try the digital one by yourself first and then consider buying the actual board game to play with your mates.			"

												A great virtual adaption of the board game with a big mess to clean up.  Online works well. I almost always play online with my husband.  Single player mode works great too.  Ticket to Ride is a great strategy game.  The player who scores the most wins... lots of ways to score: completing routes, placing trains on the board, making the longest train, and more.  Simple to pick up and get started, but with enough depth and complexity to keep you coming back for more. :)			"

												Wonderful adaptation of the board game. In this game, you are a railroad tycoon, racing to connect the country with your own railroad company before your opponents do the same. The rules are fairly straightforward, and although scoring is one of the more difficult elements to track in the physical game fortunately this version takes care of all of the score tracking for you. It's a wonderful strategy game that's great for people who enjoy screwing over their friends, because that will happen a lot.The interface is intuitive and easy to understand and it is a wonderful translation of the physical board into a digital enviroment. Highly recommended for people who like strategy games, but you definitely want to pick up a few friends to play this one with- it's best in multiplayer.Edit: The main menu has gone through some changes that make creating and finding games nuch more frustrating than in the past- unclear symbols denote most settings and finding individual settings can be quite difficult. The main play interface is still fine, but I hope an update to the main menu is coming to help usability a bit.			"

												Ticket to Ride is an adaptation of a popular board game, with the ability to play against AI, or local or online opponents. The board game has a pretty simple rule set that's easy to learn, and it has some good strategic complexity. I haven't been playing it for all that long, but I've definitely enjoyed what I've played so far.I found the voice acting obnoxious and turned it off immediately. The music grates after a little while, but you can turn that off too. The game controls pretty well and shows a lot of useful information on screen. The menus are a bit clunky, and this actually makes it a little difficult to get in to the online game lobby.But really, what matters is the gameplay, and Ticket to Ride has great gameplay. I had fun playing against AI and against humans, and there's tons of replay value. This game will definitely be worth it for board game enthusiasts at full price. I'd still recommend it to anyone that can appreciate a strategic, turn-based game. As for the DLC, it allows you to play on different maps, sometimes with different rules. If you like the base game, the expansions will add quite a bit.			"

All the standard features you could want are in the latest version, including bot matches, hotseat mode, and online play with optional ranking and bots.The account system is separate from Steam, but it creates the account for you with the same name; the only quirk is that it doesn't add your Steam friends to your Days of Wonder friends list, which would be technically challenging to implement.The Legendary Asia map is strictly that side of the expansion board; Team Asia is not available as of this writing.

												This is an excellent implementation of a well-known board game. All the standard features you could want are in the latest version, including bot matches, hotseat mode, and online play with optional ranking and bots.The account system is separate from Steam, but it creates the account for you with the same name; the only quirk is that it doesn't add your Steam friends to your Days of Wonder friends list, which would be technically challenging to implement.The Legendary Asia map is strictly that side of the expansion board; Team Asia is not available as of this writing.

												There's really no way you can go wrong with Ticket to Ride.Firstly, the game is brilliant in it's simplicity. There's only three types of moves you can make (alright, a couple others in additional maps, but the point is pretty much the same) and yet it's endlessly fun to play. It's a brilliant adaptation of the board game that, for once, does the original justice. Multiplayer adds great depth and infinite replayability. While the lobby and game set up could use some polishing, it doesn't /need/ it. They work! Plus, you can use the pass-and-play to practice against yourself from as many players as you add to the game. You can play bots. Still so much replayability, just as always the AI will never live up to the fun of playing other people, most likely. I found something oddly dulling about it, even before I tried multiplayer, and I'm usually not a multiplayer person.This is one board game you do not want to pass up, and this rendition of it is just as worthwhile, plus cheaper and easier to get a game going!

												I bought this game two years ago and it was sitting in my pile of games to play. A recent update saw me click on it to see what it was about. That was two days ago. I am really enjoying this game. It doesn't tale long to pick up the game play although I've got to admit I was still a bit lost after the tutorial game. The game is quite challenging against multiple computer players. I've only tried the solo game as I've yet to play online, I will give this a go once I feel a bit more competent. I've player the Asia, Europe and American maps. I keep coming back to the American map for the qucik games as I found the Asian map confusing with lines disappearing and then being replaced. The Europe map is quite good and more difficult than the American maps with the need for tunnels and ferries.The current update has a few issues on the Linux version . Detailed below which I hope get fixed soon and will update this review accordingly.1)  DLC maps are not recognised. You need to start the game on a windows computer and then they appear in the Linux version.2) Steam Achievements are not working at all for me. I can ony get them when playing on a Windows computer. But even on the Windows computer quite often achievements are not being passed to steam. They appear in game but not on steam. A recent example for me was the pressure gauge 200 achievement which didn't show after scoring over 200 points.3) Crashes often. The game will quite often simply quit mid-game. This is not as bad as it seems as the game loads quickly and you can carry on from where you left off. Also when quitting a game to go to the main menu the game will sometimes simply quit the game.Overall the game is a highly enjoyable game and highly recommended despite the few teething problems with this update, which appears to have been quite a large update to the game.

												Ticket to Ride is a fun, easy-to-learn, fast-playing board game where players compete for points, which they primarily earn by connecting cities via railroad.  The game is about equal parts luck and skill.  I had not previously played the board game, but I have played a very similar game, which was probably its pirmary inspiration: Empire Builder.  The game is much simpler than Empire Builder and its variants, and the maps are smaller, so games tend to finish a lot faster.			"

I play this with my dad and brother, who live half way across the country, and we have a great time. There are quite a few maps and each map has different rules, scoring, music, bonuses, and the look of train cards. The AI can also be quite challenging to play against. I can't wait to see what new maps are introduced. DLC is affordable and different in several ways from any previous map. Just look at the new Pennsylvania map to see why.9.5/10			"

												I love Ticket to Ride as a board game, and I enjoy the iPhone app, but this is a terrible PC port.The settings screen is tricky to find, and even after clicking on it, it takes a while to load and the buttons aren't labeled. There are icons with no indication what changes will be made by clicking on the icon. And the changes can't be made in game. For example, I wish I could've found a way to speed up the animations, but I was unable to do so. The game moves at a snail's pace. As I was trying to get to the settings sceen to look for the options, an annoying voice kept talking to me about the settings. Every time you switch which map you're considering using, a new voice starts up. There must be a way to disable these in the settings, but again, since nothing was labeled, I don't know where it is. This is a good game, but a terrible PC port.			"

												Very fun digital board game.At first it might seem a bit crazy when you just look at it,but playing the game is quite simple.Become quite easy to beat the A.I. but thats about its only weakness. Playing against human players is where this game shines if you want to enjoy that board game experience. TBH this the sorta game that if tweaked a bit could make for a fantastic learning game for kids since it could teach colors,numbers and shapes. The game can be fun for a very short period of time or for at least a 30min play session. Multiplayer seems to be always active when I went online (a day before this review) there were at least 10-15 games up and I was on during early morning on a weekday.Did not go into the details of the gameplay mechanics because the store page and trailer explains it all.If you want a simple game to enjoy for 5-30min solo or 10-30min multiplayer try the game out its  a wonderful game.If you are looking for a more complicated board game you might want to skip this. This game is a great one if you have kids though I think they would enjoy it. I might not of clocked a lot of hours into this,but I played it enough to enjoy my time with it so it gets my thumbs if for casual + board game play.			"

I have a good pc, I can run that crappy game that presumes itself to be Fallout 4.I prefered the interface of the old one.This version is lots of eyecandy that you cannot disable.

												If you have every played the board game then you will know how fun this game really is. This game is very well done with its style of play. When you win a game it is very satisfying and gives you the sense of a job well done. It is alot of fun to play online with others. You can get some really intense games in. The singleplayer is also challenging with the computer AI. You can choose to play up with 5 people real people or have just the AI play with you. Ether way its a great time. I have really enjoyed this game and I know you will too if you have ever played the board game.			"

												Wow.  In terms of replayability, this game is incredible.  Just enough luck to make it interesting.In the board game, it's considered bad form to block your opponents for the sake of blocking, and the AI doesn't do it.  I assume that doing so would win you more games, but is a sort of cheating.			"

I also don't understand why such a small game can be so heavy on the pc. I have a good pc, I can run that crappy game that presumes itself to be Fallout 4.I prefered the interface of the old one.This version is lots of eyecandy that you cannot disable. So everything takes forever to do.I wish you could disable the animations, they are really irritating.It is a good buy for 5$ or less, no more... 10$ for the complete version. It's a really annoying way to play Ticket to Ride.			"

US, US Big Cities, US 1919 (or something like that), Europe, Legendary Asia, Swiss, and I think one other.The only one that I've noticed isn't there is the German one with the travelers. Otherwise, this board game is the whole package.If you're a fan of this board game, or even board games in general, pick it up. I'm more than happy with my purchase.			"

												Been playing the physical game here and there with my friends over the past couple of years. This is a well made port of the popular board game. The game runs crisp and cleanly, and it's simple enough to play with your steam friends or randomers around the world.It loses some of the fun being computerised and games are reletively quick, and the atmosphere is non-existant as a result. No tention etc.The music is exactly the same for every single game, so i wouldn't listen to it too much unless you really want to kill yourself any time soon.It is enjoyable though, don't let this put you off, it has a ranking system so you can play against people who are at your level, and obviously it's generally a really fun game to play.

												Do not play this game with a sneaky, mischievous mother like mine. Instead of completing her route, she blocked all mine and won with that strategy of hers.In general, this is a game based on a really good casual board game. It is extremely simple to understand all the rules and even a rookie can win a match in this game.Usually a player's destination tickets are hidden to other players in the actual board game but if you play the hot seat mode on one computer (I believe it is called Pass and Play), you can be aware of the routes others are trying to make which can slightly decrease the quality and the element of surprise of the game (at the beginning of a game, always block someone who has the Vancouver-Montreal card!)...what dafuq Steam, no rating?! Well I give this game 8.5/10 with a seal of approval from the Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good.			"

												I've not played Ticket to Ride much, but I feel like I have a grasp of it. Like the description says, you can learn how to play in a matter of minutes but it will take a lifetime to master. The basic idea of the game is to build more train lines than your opponents, this is done by matching the colour of the line with the colour of a train cart. You get different coloured train carts out of a deck of cards. The game has a very good built in turtorial video and lessons which explains this all in an easy to understand way. It can look very daunting at first but it soon becomes apparent that it is a very simple idea behind it all. Sadly from my 3 hours playing, I haven't once been able to find a match online against anyone, mainly because I get an ingame error message when ever I try and find or start an online game, so my review is based purely on the single-player aspect, and while I haven't actually won a game of Ticket to Ride, I did enjoy my time playing. I'm not sure who this game is aimed at, but since there is a physical board game for Ticket to Ride, I'd say only pick this up if you enjoy the board game, but I can't really recommend this game for anyone else, £6,99 is a bit much for this, and £14,99 for the complete pack is utterly silly.

												The game plays exactly like you'd expect. The game works, the AI has mutiple ""styles"" of play (altthough they are all VERY easy to beat, but I doubt you expected much from the AI of a 10 buck title). Multiplayer works most of the time, which is more than I can say about most ported mobile titles.Basically, it's a functional, not awful, direct, working digital version of one of the better board games on the market. It's easily worth the MSRP and MORE than worth the price if you can catch it on a sale. As I write this, during the Steam Winter Sale, the game plus ALL the DLC is a whopping 19 bucks. Easily worth that and then some.So yeah, if you like Ticket to Ride IRL and you want to play it on your computer either against mediocre AI or strangers on the internet (it does have totally functional pass and play if you don't have the physical game on hand and want to play IRL too), this is for you.

												Ticket to Ride is a competent enough adaptation of the classic board game.  Game play is quick and smooth, as is to be expected.  The style of the game is fair, if a bit cluttered.  However this is all based on the player being able to get past the god-awful menus.  Every menu has voice overs describing what options are available.  Often each menu has but two or three options.  Switching maps, more voices overs describing each map, often with horribly caricature ethnic voices.  There is simply no way to turn the voice overs off and has been off putting enough that I've only been able to stomach playing two games.  A pity as I really wanted to purchase gift copies for family and friends for online play.			"

												If you like board games in real life then get this one. Ticket To Ride is a very simple game to learn, but is a challenge against the online players. Ticket to ride is one of the top games wich can hold up with games like Carcasonne, Setlers of Catan, El Grande etc. Get your creditcard ready and buy the game, i mean the bundle. All versions for a cheap price.			"

												Great game to pass the time, recommended to all lovers of board games.Basically it's like the board game - you pick up cards to create destinations, lay down trains and hope for the best. AI is a bit stupid if you're quick, but don't expect to win all games.I've spent like 30 hours as of this review, all in tiny 30 min sessions to pass the time. That's how much I like this game.			"

												Great game. Easy to learn. Simple rules. Quick rounds, so easy to play on limited time. A full game can be played in 10-15 minutes versus the AI. Nice variety of maps through DLC. Originally the AI seemed balanced, maybe a little on the easy side. I would win most, lose a few (usually because I gamble on extra tickets). A recent update increased the AI difficulty. It's still not hard to win, but it's much closer now. The AI will stop you from trying to collect too many routes by ending the game as quickly as possible. They also try new strategies. One round, the AI didn't bother with routes and just went for the high-value 5- or 6-piece tracks. They also have a higher tendency now to lay down random 1- or 2-piece tracks early on to block some paths (even if they don't have a corresponding route sometimes). Online gameplay is easy and smooth. I haven't played many online matches, but it seems like a solid system for those interested in that. I have played hot seat on Windows 8 laptop with a friend. Touch screen worked perfecctly. There is nothing negative to say about this game.			"

												This game is a very good port of the board game version, and works very well. The game is very simple, since the cards are random, it will end up forcing you to make up a unique strategy every time you play to get the most points according to the situation. After many playthroughs the most useful tactics end up being a bit obvious and the strategies get built around it, becoming a bit repetitive. It is VERY fun to play with a lot of different people.

												The classic board game brought to Steam as a video game... awesome sauce.  In truth, though I do enjoy the game immensely here on Steam, the computer version does seem to have its share of minor annoyances (like not being able to choose your color/avatar for each game).  But all in all, I love Ticket To Ride and this is a wonderful adaptation of the board game.  So if you liked the table top version as much as I did, pick this up for $20 (or less if its on sale) for the full game and all its downloadable content! ALL ABOARD!			"

												Plays just like the board game (which I love).  The first time through it wants to walk you through a game and it keeps telling you to draw cards when that is not what you would normally do if you were doing your own playing but it doesn't force you to follow its suggestion for what to do each turn, you can choose to do something else.  You can also choose to turn off the tutorial before you start the first game (if you already know how to play and have a strategy you will definitely want to skip the tutorial).  Great game!  Good luck!			"

The map DLC is also still cheaper than buying actual tabletop Ticket to Ride expansions, so unless you would be making your own new boards (which I don't think can happen in this version) you're still probably saving a bit of scratch.I like the pink train the best.

												A faithful representation of the classic board game. For those that don't know what that means, you compete against other players to complete pre-set routes across the board, either picking a new train car each turn or laying down ones that you already have in order to match the colours on the board. The strategy comes in the route cards which focus you on copmleting specific routes, the longer the route the more points you get but the more likely that someone else will block it before you complete.

												The good news is that it's literally an electronic version of the board game. Everything works how it should, for the most part. The tutorial is fairly well done and a decent way to teach people how to play the game if you're sick of explaining it, and the AI is passable but not great if you just want to play casually by yourself. More importantly, it supports cross-platform multiplayer between the PC, Mac, web, and iPad versions. It does NOT support playing with the Pocket (read: iPhone) version, which for some reason is the only one which allows asynchronous play, which is kind of lame. It also has no hotseat mode. By far the specialest thing about it is that it installs its own private  (probably non-updated) JVM, which is kind of counter to one of the main points of using something like Java in the first place. It's otherwise functional, even if there are a few weird design decisions.			"

Nordic Countries? TEAM Asia? Europe 1912 variants? Africa? Pull your finger out, Days of Wonder.			"

												 I was recently introduced to the board game.  The computer version is even better because it is much cheaper than the board game, there is almost no setup/clean up, and you can play with random people (or friends) at times when you have a free 30-60 mins.  Great translation from physical to digital!			"

												Works great for me on Windows 10, with all DLC.  I loved the game on Xbox 360, but it only had the 1910 and Europe editions, and no discounts on DLC.  Steam has all the DLC, and the package price was good.  I was hesitant to at first because of all the negative reviews about the cross-platform consistent interface, crashes, and DLC recognition issues.  But I gave in and bought the base game first, and it worked great (on my Alienware Alpha with Windows 10).  Then I bought the complete DLC pack, which installed on its own, and was recognized just fine when I checked.  The shop doesn't offer to sell me them, and they all can be selected and will allow the button to say ""Play"".The new interface works good for me (on my 47"" TV).  I was very used to the Xbox 360 version, which I am guessing was the same as the old interface people refer to on Steam.  But I did find the interface to work well, intuitively, and more quickly.  Anyone who knows how to play should be just fine.  In fact, the play flows faster than the Xbox 360 version, which was a surprise to me because I expected the worst after all the negative comments about the new UI.  The text might be a little small in some cases if viewing on a small screen, but it is the same on tablets and is perfectly fine on a large TV.  The words don't really matter anyway, you can get the gist from the large graphics and colors.I only wish it had controller support.  The mouse works fine and intuitively.  I had just expected it to work with a controller like the Xbox 360 version.  It would be easier for multiple local players if each have their own controller (like the 360).  But it works just fine.  I ended up getting a 2nd copy for someone else to play with me via Online, and that solved that problem :) .			"

												Ticket to ride on steam gives the player the great convenience of not having to clean up and put away a physical copy of the game.   It is flawless transition of the board game to pc.  The AI seems competent but not brutal.  The audio help or conductor’s voice track that comments when a player mouses over an object got annoying fast though and I had to turn it off.  Overall if you are a fan of ticket to ride you will find a lot of value in this game.  If you are on the fence about Ticket to Ride, buy it.			"

												If you enjoyed the classic board game then this is a servicable digital version. There are some issues I wish would have been addressed. Some minor bugs and lack of polish... As of this writing, it's been several months since the achivements were added to the game, and they all remain frustratingly unobtainable.In any case, the game mechanic is sound and so far there's been no game breaking issues with it. The online lobby nearly always has a few games going and matchmaking is surprisingly quick.if you enjoy board games and want to jump into a quick match with strangers, then you could do worse than Ticket to Ride.

At a glance you can also see the trains of player in the corner who normally covers up how many trains they have left.

												A faithful adaptation of the board game, but like most board games, you lose some of the magic if you're not at a table with a bunch of other people. Also, this game is not designed for the color blind in mind. In theory you can match the symbols instead of colors, but they're tiny on the screen so it's really not a viable option. It can also be impossible to distinguish the routes owned by players.If they could fix the issues for the 10% of the population that is colorblind, this would be a great purchase.			"

												Very well done board game, it has the perfect combination of being easy to learn while having room for strategy. Graphics could be better and you will want to turn off the voice overs on the menu as soon as you load it up, but the actual gameplay is very well done.You can play against the AI but it makes poor decisions at times and you will probably win a fair amount of the time, online play is where this game really shines. Also, I did not see an option (possible I missed it) to change gameplay options (ie, give each player more or less trains, set a round limit instead of train limit, etc.) which could have made games more interesting and allowed for variants, although I certainly understand you can't really program an AI to handle all the options.The games don't take very long to complete (I usually get 15-20 mins / game offline), a perfect amount of time for a board game, although online play obviously runs longer as people are making decisions, but typically they don't go much longer.If you've played the board game you know what it's about, nothing has changed apart from new map variants. If you've never played ticket to ride I do recommend it if you enjoy other board games.			"

												!!Ticket to Ride!!Well what is there to say about this game?This game is a digital version of the classic board game with the same name.All that you have to do in this game is to build train tracs by collecting ""cart-cards"" of a specific colour to build a train of the tracs. For example, if i want to build a train between Copenhagen and Stockholm and there is 3 squares with a purple colour you need 3 purple cards to build on it.To win you need the most points in the game,1  cart=1 point2 carts=2 points3 carts=4 points4 carts=7 points5 carts=10 points6 carts=15 points.But you can also get points by completing routes like Copenhagen to Rome. There's two kinds of routes, short distance (normaly worth 5-10 points) and long distance (worth up to 21 points).In the end you can also get bonus points by either building the longest route, completing the most routes or by doing both.I've been playing the table version of this game some times and i've found myself very amused by it. Then we were playing it with 4-5 people and it was pretty hard to get to where you wanted without getting blocked by some one else, sometimes the others wanted to block your route just to keep you from completing it and getting those extra points.The same things can happen in the digital version.The digital version has alot of different game types, Solo with AI'sLocal (so you can play with other pc's on you'r networkOnline (so you can play with your friends)Pass and play (a group can play on the same pc by passing it around)Note that this just like monopoly can destroy relationships and friendships easy. But if they are broken by a game then mayby it wasn't so good to begin with. And hey now you can't throw the board when you'r♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and loosing.... now you can throw you'r expensive PC and since when isn't that a better option?I started playing this game at a friend and it was so good and fun that I had to buy it so i can play it by myself with bots to train (get it, like train on a track... yea i know my jokes suck..... let's say my jokes started to de-rail! haha i'm so lonley)The bots in this game is hard to beat in the beginning but you can quickly learn to beat them by starting with one bot and then adding more when you feel ready.This is a great game to have when you don't have any internet connection avaible. One of the reasons why i bought it was so i would be able to play it while riding the train, taking the buss and feel less lonley since i've got more options than a train.I've been playing this on my PC for a couple of hours and i find it realy fun and it's real easy to kill time with this game.I would give this game an 9/10 since i find it easy to learn but still hard to master, fun to play and it's a game that i will be coming back to play alot.This might not be the best review but i hope you find it helpfull!

I have gotten stuck on the score screen after a game with no way to advance outside of exiting to the menu (where I am told my current game will be saved even though it is complete), changing the number of players seems obnoxiously complex (I kept changing my own player instead of removing the CPU player I wanted to remove) and I can't understand why anyone would need a zoom ability on the game screen (it adds no benefit since everything on the map is spaced apart enough to be clear).Recomended but sometimes you need to just leave a game alone and not ""update"" it.

												My room mate owns the board game and we play all the time. I like online better than in person mostly because it's faster. Both ways are fun except when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s decided to block. Your goal is to get from point A to point B via the Ticket cards that tell you where point A and point B is. You have to pick some before the game even starts and can have your pick of more throughout the game. Bonus points if you make the longest connecting route. There are face up colored train cards that you pick from to help you build your track. If you don't like any of them, you can pick from the face down deck and hope you get the colors you need. The DLC feature different maps with different things like for instance, India gives you bonus points if you make a round trip while China will ♥♥♥♥ you over by breaking your track and making you place more trains or Europe with its tunnels you might have to pay extra cards for just to build a track! It's simple to pick up and hard to put down. A+			"

												Ticket to Ride is significantly more fun to play online than as a physical board game easily ruined by somebody slamming the table. About the only downside to this port, other than the glitchy Achievement pseudo-implementation, is having to play through the tutorial and having moves suggested that I feel are less than optimal, purely for the sake of showing you how to play it. Maybe the interface is a bit bogged down trying to tell how to play which map, but otherwise super fun once you learn where everything is.			"

												This is an updated review.First of all, if you are looking for a quality, multiplayer (over the internet) board game with easy to understand concepts, this is it. It's a game witha great reputation as a traditional board game, but it really does well as a PC game. And incidentally, I also own this title and all the DLC for my iPad as well (and it's even a more perfect fit as an electronic game on that platform).It's easy to understand how to play this game and the interface works perfectly as an electronic game.Ticket to Ride relies a lot on skill and critical thinking and some on chance. A more advanced player definitely has the capability to make the game more complex for the opponent.  The single player vs one AI is not very challenging, but that's OK. It's still a fun diversion.I did have an issue a while back that had me giving this game a thumbs down. It was because my game was broken and nothing I did would fix it (for a while). Support tried to help me, but they were slow between communications, and never came up with an answer. Frankly, I'm not sure how they ever would, considering the weird nature of the issue.Finally I was able to resolve the issue, by accident.The issue was I could not get a single player versus one AI to load the game board so the game would not start. I solved it accidentally by loading up a single player versus TWO AI, then I backed out, tried with one AI, and it loaded. I have repeated this solution several times.  If you are having that issue, might want to give that a try. /shrugsAnyway, with the issue solved and enjoying many games with my friend - online - and as a single player against AI (once again), I do not regret this purchase, and thereby change my review to a resounding ""Yes!""

												This is a fun and addicting strategy game. It takes a little time to learn, but a long time to master. The games are pretty short and are family friendly, so it's a good game if you want to introduce strategic gaming to children (maybe 8+).For players familiar with the original game there are some advantages the steam game has over the table version. One advantage is that it takes much less time to set up and clean up (virtually none) compared to the table game. Another plus is that the game highlights your destination points clearly. Adding up your points quickly during and after the game helps as well.			"

												I really enjoy railroad strategy games, so this game is very enjoyable for me. Unfortunately I only play solo, I imagine the game is even better multi-player. Only a couple of minor issues. The game isn't as flexible as it should be when playing off-line. You should be able to mix human and AI opponents, for example 2 of each, but you can't. You can only have one human and then the rest AI. Also, as a solo player I'm going for high scores, but the high score table only holds about ten entries and apparently you can't clear it. Worse, there is only one high score table for all the different maps (I've bought all the DLC). So I've stopped playing despite not playing the DLC maps much because I can't seem to get new high scores.			"

												Great game! heard a lot of hype for the boardgame, from in my local games store and on ""thedicetower"" and saw this on the summer sale, and thought why not, much cheaper then the board game, and its got online mode. and i was pleasantly surprised!the game does have some issues, namely the clunky menu UI fyi to fullscreen the game you need to click the middle button under the sliders and reload the game, i needed to look it up to find it. but when you get into the game for the first time, it holds your hand well and walks you through your first solo game. i did find the tutorial AI to be a fairly poor player and was giving me bad advice some of the time, but even if its a tutorial you have full control of your turns, it merely makes a suggestion. i will most likely at some point invest in a physical copy of the board game thanks to this and i will have a lot of fun playing!

												A great adaptation of a fun board game to computer, and which comes with the added benefit of being decent fun when you don't have anyone to play it with.Most of the pluses of course come from the well designed nature of the underlying board game it is based off. Essentially each turn you get to do one of a few different actions - draw a couple of carriage cards which come in various different colours (or an engine that effectively works as a joker) - either face up ones (so both you and your opponents know what you are getting) or from the face down pile. If you have enough carrriages in a single colour you can use them to build a section of track, or you can pull out three extra route cards (each having two cities you have to connect up, and how many extra points it is worth if you do so - also the penalty if you don't connect them by the end of the game) each of which you can keep or not.From this relatively simple seeming set of options, the strategic options get very deep and complicated if you want to take the time to study what is going on, or the game can just be played as a fun family game, it works either way. Should you try to get more route cards early so you know everywhere you need to connect up from the start, or should you wait until the ones you start with are completed routes and then see if you can get some quick and easy expansions near the end of the game? Should you play your carriages early to avoid being blocked on that section of track, or risk waiting to avoid giving clues to where you are planning to move next? Should you block that opponents obvious route attempt knowing that might decide to retaliate and make one of your route cards difficult or impossible to complete? Should you pick up a couple of same colour face up cards that you don't really at the need all that much to make it look like you are planning to go down a different route than you really need to head?

												My girlfriend and I played this game in it's board version with friends and decided to buy it ourselves because we liked it so much. We play it a lot and bought some of the expansions as well.Liking it so much I also bought the Steam version one day when it was on sale just to see what it was. I played it a little in single player vs a computer, it was fun but I forgot about the game after a while.When we were on a holiday together and she (okay it was not her, it was me..), forgot to pack Ticket to Ride the board game I remembered having the game on Steam. Since I brought my Windows hybrid tablet that could run steam I installed it, took the keyboard dock off and played the game with the touch screen together passing the tablet every time. Although it is different than having to fiddle with the trains etc. since it is all there on the screen it was a lot of fun! Passing the tablet every time was a bit of a hassle but we had the same fun blocking each others routers etc. We laughed and had the same competition we would normally have had with the board game. The downside is that you can not see the playing board all the time so it is a bit harder to think ahead.All in all I loved having this installed on my tablet. It's convenient to take with you compared to the box with the game if you are low on space for a trip. Still I prefer the board game whenever I can with more players or when I do have the space to take the full board game with me. I just love to have this as a backup and for a fast game of (single player) Ticket to Ride.			"

												My room mate owns the board game and we play all the time. I like online better than in person mostly because it's faster. Both ways are fun except when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s decided to block. Your goal is to get from point A to point B via the Ticket cards that tell you where point A and point B is. You have to pick some before the game even starts and can have your pick of more throughout the game. Bonus points if you make the longest connecting route. There are face up colored train cards that you pick from to help you build your track. If you don't like any of them, you can pick from the face down deck and hope you get the colors you need. The DLC feature different maps with different things like for instance, India gives you bonus points if you make a round trip while China will ♥♥♥♥ you over by breaking your track and making you place more trains or Europe with its tunnels you might have to pay extra cards for just to build a track! It's simple to pick up and hard to put down. A+			"

												This game is  a lot of fun. The computer players aer hard, but not impossible by any means. It can be tricky to figure out the ranking system and sometimes the timer is off in online games. however, it seems to be getting better every time I play it, and it is a lot of fun!!!			"

Nordic Countries? TEAM Asia? Europe 1912 variants? Africa? Pull your finger out, Days of Wonder.			"

												My girlfriend and I played this game in it's board version with friends and decided to buy it ourselves because we liked it so much. We play it a lot and bought some of the expansions as well.Liking it so much I also bought the Steam version one day when it was on sale just to see what it was. I played it a little in single player vs a computer, it was fun but I forgot about the game after a while.When we were on a holiday together and she (okay it was not her, it was me..), forgot to pack Ticket to Ride the board game I remembered having the game on Steam. Since I brought my Windows hybrid tablet that could run steam I installed it, took the keyboard dock off and played the game with the touch screen together passing the tablet every time. Although it is different than having to fiddle with the trains etc. since it is all there on the screen it was a lot of fun! Passing the tablet every time was a bit of a hassle but we had the same fun blocking each others routers etc. We laughed and had the same competition we would normally have had with the board game. The downside is that you can not see the playing board all the time so it is a bit harder to think ahead.All in all I loved having this installed on my tablet. It's convenient to take with you compared to the box with the game if you are low on space for a trip. Still I prefer the board game whenever I can with more players or when I do have the space to take the full board game with me. I just love to have this as a backup and for a fast game of (single player) Ticket to Ride.			"

												Thanks to Will Wheaton's ""Tabletop"" I found out about this game about a month before it was available online. It looked like fun but I was a bit skeptical at first. Turns out this little thing is oodles of fun and then some! All the twists and turns, risking taking on new destinations or playing it safe and just trying for the longest route. It's a great game to play with friends, even more so, I think, onlne, because you can scream at the screen, make faces, and nobody will really know how♥♥♥♥♥♥your hand is or if you're plotting to block somebody's way :)			"

												Fans of the board game will definitely love this computerized version of it. One thing any boardgamer will appreciate is that with with cards shuffled, the board laid out and everything set up, games are very efficient and more time is available for more sessions. Also, the ability to play online will mean you will never be without someone willing to play with you (another thing boardgamers will appreaciate).			"

												I really enjoy railroad strategy games, so this game is very enjoyable for me. Unfortunately I only play solo, I imagine the game is even better multi-player. Only a couple of minor issues. The game isn't as flexible as it should be when playing off-line. You should be able to mix human and AI opponents, for example 2 of each, but you can't. You can only have one human and then the rest AI. Also, as a solo player I'm going for high scores, but the high score table only holds about ten entries and apparently you can't clear it. Worse, there is only one high score table for all the different maps (I've bought all the DLC). So I've stopped playing despite not playing the DLC maps much because I can't seem to get new high scores.			"

												TTR is one of my favourite board games, and I have in on my iPhone, iPad, Steam (obviously), and the physical version of the game. It's easy o get into, and relatively hard to become a real pro at, and playing online gives you a chance to go up against all different levels of players. It's also nice to have a quiet game against the AI. If I had a complaint? The PC version can get a little clunky. Still solid.			"

The interface is, well, not the best, but it's a pretty good take on the board game.  The Ai doesn't work very well -- they have these weird behaviors that cause them to not finish tickets, or to just keep taking trains without stopping -- but the game is functional, the sound effects and music are entertaining.  I consider this a good port.			"

												I don't really understand why this game is available as just the original Ticket to Ride board and then the expansion pack with all of the other boards and the original game included for the same price - surely you would just offer the bigger pack? I foolishly didn't look closer at the options available - I already have the expansion pack on Android and wanted it on my laptop and was already annoyed that I'd have to pay twice so just bought the original thinking I'd get the extra boards later. Then realised that the expansion pack includes the original so I now have to pay double if I want more than just the original board on OS X, which is pretty frustrating. The gameplay is pretty good, unless you end up with online opponents who don't want to play fairly and just try and ruin your game to no advantage for themselves.			"

The interface is, well, not the best, but it's a pretty good take on the board game.  The Ai doesn't work very well -- they have these weird behaviors that cause them to not finish tickets, or to just keep taking trains without stopping -- but the game is functional, the sound effects and music are entertaining.  I consider this a good port.			"

												An extremely accurate version of the real thing, Ticket to Ride in general is such an easy game to learn and a fantastic game to (try to) master. There are a few kinks that do, at times, prevent you from getting right into games, usually to do with the log-in system, but they never occur during gameplay and are often resolved with restarting Steam. A nuisance, I admit, that I hope Days of Wonder can resolve somehow.If you're up for learning a board game that's been very well presented, give this a go. My advice? Get the DLC's (at least Ticket to Ride: Europe) and find a friend or a few to play this with. Yes, you CAN jump into random games, but if you're on voice-chat with a few friends in your own game, the reactions are wonderful if you manage to block your opponent. The DLC's offer more variety and a few nifty gameplay additions, whether it's Europe with stations and mountain-routes, or the different styles of tickets offered by different versions.Currently my favourite board game adapted for PC... though that's likely 'cause there aren't many others available, and certainly not many more that offer as satisfying a board-gaming experience as this one. Enjoy!			"

												Plays just like the board game (which I love).  The first time through it wants to walk you through a game and it keeps telling you to draw cards when that is not what you would normally do if you were doing your own playing but it doesn't force you to follow its suggestion for what to do each turn, you can choose to do something else.  You can also choose to turn off the tutorial before you start the first game (if you already know how to play and have a strategy you will definitely want to skip the tutorial).  Great game!  Good luck!			"

												This is a very good little game and true to the board game, with the added bonus of being able to play alone and play all the different versions (the other maps can be quite different!). I tend to stick to the main US map, but like to mix it up sometimes. Never found the AIs particularly hard and always win with a decent score, but it's still an enjoyable game. Tends to be much faster than the actual board game - but I guess that's no surprise.			"

												Do you like the board game? Do you want to be able to play it when there is on one else around to play against? If you answered yes to both of these then buy this game. As to whether I would recommend this to someone who is not familiar with the game, that is a more difficult question. I do think it is a good game but it is very much a computerised board game so it does not have the fast paced action you would get from a normal video game. I would play the board game first as I think it would be easier to learn the rules that way. Then if you like it buy this as well.			"

I have gotten stuck on the score screen after a game with no way to advance outside of exiting to the menu (where I am told my current game will be saved even though it is complete), changing the number of players seems obnoxiously complex (I kept changing my own player instead of removing the CPU player I wanted to remove) and I can't understand why anyone would need a zoom ability on the game screen (it adds no benefit since everything on the map is spaced apart enough to be clear).Recomended but sometimes you need to just leave a game alone and not ""update"" it.

												My room mate owns the board game and we play all the time. I like online better than in person mostly because it's faster. Both ways are fun except when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s decided to block. Your goal is to get from point A to point B via the Ticket cards that tell you where point A and point B is. You have to pick some before the game even starts and can have your pick of more throughout the game. Bonus points if you make the longest connecting route. There are face up colored train cards that you pick from to help you build your track. If you don't like any of them, you can pick from the face down deck and hope you get the colors you need. The DLC feature different maps with different things like for instance, India gives you bonus points if you make a round trip while China will ♥♥♥♥ you over by breaking your track and making you place more trains or Europe with its tunnels you might have to pay extra cards for just to build a track! It's simple to pick up and hard to put down. A+			"

												Works great for me on Windows 10, with all DLC.  I loved the game on Xbox 360, but it only had the 1910 and Europe editions, and no discounts on DLC.  Steam has all the DLC, and the package price was good.  I was hesitant to at first because of all the negative reviews about the cross-platform consistent interface, crashes, and DLC recognition issues.  But I gave in and bought the base game first, and it worked great (on my Alienware Alpha with Windows 10).  Then I bought the complete DLC pack, which installed on its own, and was recognized just fine when I checked.  The shop doesn't offer to sell me them, and they all can be selected and will allow the button to say ""Play"".The new interface works good for me (on my 47"" TV).  I was very used to the Xbox 360 version, which I am guessing was the same as the old interface people refer to on Steam.  But I did find the interface to work well, intuitively, and more quickly.  Anyone who knows how to play should be just fine.  In fact, the play flows faster than the Xbox 360 version, which was a surprise to me because I expected the worst after all the negative comments about the new UI.  The text might be a little small in some cases if viewing on a small screen, but it is the same on tablets and is perfectly fine on a large TV.  The words don't really matter anyway, you can get the gist from the large graphics and colors.I only wish it had controller support.  The mouse works fine and intuitively.  I had just expected it to work with a controller like the Xbox 360 version.  It would be easier for multiple local players if each have their own controller (like the 360).  But it works just fine.  I ended up getting a 2nd copy for someone else to play with me via Online, and that solved that problem :) .			"

												Update 2016-02-09:Below is my original review of the game, now that there has been a ""patch"" I feel the need to change my original review from ""recommended"" to ""don't buy"". Unfortunately the latest update has not only changed the main controls and the layout of the board, but simply broke the game.Now it takes about 5 minutes to simply load the game, it just starts with a blank map where you can't do anything and the music and sound effects are blaring. When it finally loads the process of selecting a map is anything but comfortable, where before you could simply switch through the maps, looking at the different layouts with a click, now you have to enter a submenu to rotate through (not a deal breaker on its own, but remember, I've just been exposed to 5 minutes of waiting for things to react at all).Now within the game itself the board layout has also change, for newcomers probably intuitive enough, for those who have already spent quite a lot of time in the game a nuisance.All of the things I've mentioned above are not the reason I can't recommend this game though.The reason you should stay away until they patch this game: after you've finished a round the game just hangs with a white screen, no reaction at all, nothing. Couldn't even close it properly and had to kill it through the taskmanager. I'm definitely not willing to spend 5 minutes waiting for the game to load, navigate through submenus to pick a map and then have the game crash after one round.Original review:After finally being able to start the game, I have to admit I almost forgot the trouble it gave me when I first installed it... or well, rather when I installed it for the first 7 times. But only almost. If you have an AMD graphics card be prepared for trouble, this thing is a b* to get to run on new machines.It's certainly not a fan of up-to-date graphic drivers, nope, this game shows its age while installing (not while playing, mind you)In case anyone is reading this after having tried and failed to install and actually start this game on a windows 7 machine, here is a rather usefull link, just scroll to the end of the page an follow those instructions, all but step 4. DO NOT COPY THE FILE, just leave it where it is and skip ahead to step 5.http://steamcommunity.com/app/108200/discussions/0/846943418815498457/#p2In case it still won't start, just try running it in compatiblity mode for windows XP, that's what did the trick for me. Now all is fine.But back to the game itself.It's fun to play and way too easy to waste an enourmous amount of time with it. The campaigns are fairly short and one little campaign won't cost you days or hours of your life, but if you are like me and can't stop after a loss... or a win, well a short campaign of 10 minutes can turn into 2 hours.Some of the maps are rather confusing at first (yeah, well, who reads or acutally listens to instructions, right? yep, neither did I), especially since the DLCs seem to have other rules when it comes to train placement. If you're not interested in the DLC anyway (it's hit an miss btw.), than it's rather straighforward. The video on steam pretty much covers all the rules and the gameplay.Would I recommend this?Yeah, I guess I still would, but only to those who know how to open a command shell, 'cause if things go wrong, that's pretty much the only way to get to enjoy this game.

												Imperfect but adequate translation of a great board game.The board game is so clever and fun that this digital version is okay too, even though it's awkwardly designed. The menus and navigation start out clumsy, but once you actually get to the game board, you can figure out the slightly odd layout and get on with the game. The core game itself is an addictive strategy game, and it's definitely worth navigating the quirks of the digital version to play it.			"

												Just played a few hours because i was curious how this game would be on the computer instead of the board game,the rules are same and the tutorial is easy to pickup but....the bad:the game is full of advertisement for other/new games.the complete settingsscreen isnt working, i can't login change colours nor sound settings etc.because there isnt any progress saved and i have to change my username every game, the game feels very unfinnished.I guess it could have been a good game when everything is working properly, this game will go into the bin for me I'll stick to the real boardgame.

												It doesn't *always* have to be about shooting things, blowing stuff up, or bashing people into a pulp. This is a very good conversion of a great board game into a digital format. Solid solo play to practice with, and a ridiculously huge amount of online players means you can always find a game when you want. The slow pace may not be for everyone, but *I* really like it.			"

												“Ticket to Ride” is a strategic boardgame which can be played in a short stretch but which offers infinite replayability. It offers enough of a challenge to make the game timeless, one which will be just as enjoyable today or even years from now. If you enjoy strategy games such as “Risk,” “Carcassonne,” “Catan,” “bridge,” etc., then you will most likely enjoy “Ticket to Ride.”			"

												Update (2017-03-28): The developer suddenly, and without warning, ceased Linux support. I cannot support a game that does not support my OS. VERY disappointed in the developer. A word of warning beforehand would have been 1000 times better than silently dropping support like this.Old review:The games mechanics are good, and the music score complements it nicely. The voices are horrible, though, and my first step after installing the game is to turn them off.The singleplayer games are challenging, especially if you increase the number of computer players, and the variety in playstyles found in the different (DLC) boards are enough to keep you busy for a while.Hot Seat multiplayer is easy enough to set up, and runs about as fast as singleplayer.The multiplayer lobby sometimes has a hard time logging you in, even with your login credentials saved, and may at times even kick players offline while they are in a game, replacing them by bots. This costs these players ""karma"", but it happens fairly infrequently.One-on-one multiplayer with a friend goes through the same multiplayer lobby as all the other games, and setting up a successful game with a password lock will not always work.Game lag is a problem with multiplayer games, no matter the amount of players. At times the game just doesn't recognize you clicked a card, or suddenly thinks you clicked the card stack twice when you only clicked it once, promptly ending your turn.While it has its bugs, it is still an enjoyable game, and a decent digital version of the boardgame. I would recommend buying it if you enjoy playing digital boardgames with, or without, friends.			"

												For players used to the tabletop version, this is a no-brainer. At a fraction of the cost of the hard copies, this PC version of the game cuts out a lot of the time investment of the actual board game  (MOAR T2R/hr!!!). For the player that has never played T2R, this is a wonderful game. The mechanic is simple to learn (in the base game, at least): the goal of the game is to gain points by completing routes between the cities on your ""Tickets,"" or goal cards, that you get at the beginning of the game (you have some liberty in selecting which tickets you get, but this is fairly ""luck of the draw""). In a turn you can draw cards or use them to complete routes. If you complete all your goals, you can draw more and complete those until someone runs out of trains. The game has decent replay value, but you should check out the expansions if you want to play this one regularly. HOWEVER, I definitely recommend that you start on the original map (US). Each different map in the expansions has different ""gimmick"" features, like buying stations (Europe), mountain routes (Asia), Country Tickets (Switzerland), etc.Some negatives: if it is your first time playing the game, beware. The rule book in this PC version is kind of crappy. I would HIGHLY recommend you look up the actual T2R rules on gameboardgeek, read them there, and then play the game. Additionally, I'm not too thrilled about the private PvP setup (I only play private games, so...). It's a little jank. Overall, these factors don't actually affect gameplay, and I would still recommend you give it a shot.			"

												My husband introduced this game to me sometime last year and it has kept us interested since then. The game looks exactly like the board game equivalent: graphics, ambiance and style. Only problem we ran into is that sometimes when one of us try adding the other to the multiplayer game via invite, for some reason, it doesn't recognize the invitation and we have to invite the other person again. The choo choo sound can get on one's nerves after the 1000th time. Fortunately, you can customize the settings so it doesn't get annoying. One other thing I wish we could do is pick the avatar and stick with it regardless of who or what we're playing against. Maybe even allow us to change the colour of that avatar.			"

												Works great for me on Windows 10, with all DLC.  I loved the game on Xbox 360, but it only had the 1910 and Europe editions, and no discounts on DLC.  Steam has all the DLC, and the package price was good.  I was hesitant to at first because of all the negative reviews about the cross-platform consistent interface, crashes, and DLC recognition issues.  But I gave in and bought the base game first, and it worked great (on my Alienware Alpha with Windows 10).  Then I bought the complete DLC pack, which installed on its own, and was recognized just fine when I checked.  The shop doesn't offer to sell me them, and they all can be selected and will allow the button to say ""Play"".The new interface works good for me (on my 47"" TV).  I was very used to the Xbox 360 version, which I am guessing was the same as the old interface people refer to on Steam.  But I did find the interface to work well, intuitively, and more quickly.  Anyone who knows how to play should be just fine.  In fact, the play flows faster than the Xbox 360 version, which was a surprise to me because I expected the worst after all the negative comments about the new UI.  The text might be a little small in some cases if viewing on a small screen, but it is the same on tablets and is perfectly fine on a large TV.  The words don't really matter anyway, you can get the gist from the large graphics and colors.I only wish it had controller support.  The mouse works fine and intuitively.  I had just expected it to work with a controller like the Xbox 360 version.  It would be easier for multiple local players if each have their own controller (like the 360).  But it works just fine.  I ended up getting a 2nd copy for someone else to play with me via Online, and that solved that problem :) .			"

												!!Ticket to Ride!!Well what is there to say about this game?This game is a digital version of the classic board game with the same name.All that you have to do in this game is to build train tracs by collecting ""cart-cards"" of a specific colour to build a train of the tracs. For example, if i want to build a train between Copenhagen and Stockholm and there is 3 squares with a purple colour you need 3 purple cards to build on it.To win you need the most points in the game,1  cart=1 point2 carts=2 points3 carts=4 points4 carts=7 points5 carts=10 points6 carts=15 points.But you can also get points by completing routes like Copenhagen to Rome. There's two kinds of routes, short distance (normaly worth 5-10 points) and long distance (worth up to 21 points).In the end you can also get bonus points by either building the longest route, completing the most routes or by doing both.I've been playing the table version of this game some times and i've found myself very amused by it. Then we were playing it with 4-5 people and it was pretty hard to get to where you wanted without getting blocked by some one else, sometimes the others wanted to block your route just to keep you from completing it and getting those extra points.The same things can happen in the digital version.The digital version has alot of different game types, Solo with AI'sLocal (so you can play with other pc's on you'r networkOnline (so you can play with your friends)Pass and play (a group can play on the same pc by passing it around)Note that this just like monopoly can destroy relationships and friendships easy. But if they are broken by a game then mayby it wasn't so good to begin with. And hey now you can't throw the board when you'r♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and loosing.... now you can throw you'r expensive PC and since when isn't that a better option?I started playing this game at a friend and it was so good and fun that I had to buy it so i can play it by myself with bots to train (get it, like train on a track... yea i know my jokes suck..... let's say my jokes started to de-rail! haha i'm so lonley)The bots in this game is hard to beat in the beginning but you can quickly learn to beat them by starting with one bot and then adding more when you feel ready.This is a great game to have when you don't have any internet connection avaible. One of the reasons why i bought it was so i would be able to play it while riding the train, taking the buss and feel less lonley since i've got more options than a train.I've been playing this on my PC for a couple of hours and i find it realy fun and it's real easy to kill time with this game.I would give this game an 9/10 since i find it easy to learn but still hard to master, fun to play and it's a game that i will be coming back to play alot.This might not be the best review but i hope you find it helpfull!

I can play an entire game in 10-15 minutes.There is only one AI for computer players, and I can beat it about 60% of the time. As I get better, will I get annoyed that there isn't a ""Harder"" AI... sure, that's possible. But for now, the game is really well implemented and a lot of fun. My hat's off to DoW and I hope to see more.			"

												As a fan of the board game, I knew what to expect from this version.  I already have it on tablet format for casual play, but picked this version up in a Humble Bundle earlier this year.  Suffice to say, the game plays well, although some of the fun of the physical board game is lost.Ticket To Ride is one of those board games that has a perfect blanace of skill and luck, making it easy to pick up the mechanics of for newcomers, and full of tactical play style for dab hands.  Do you play to complete your destinations, or to sabotage others from achieving theirs?  The choice is yours.  The varied expansions take the basic game and add new elements, and maps, to offer a different experience.  When played against other human opponents, games can be unpredictable, and immense fun.As a substitute to the board game, for casual play when no friends around to play with, the game does the trick.  The interface is clear and well laid out, and the rules are easy to access.  Whilst a physical copy will always be enjoyed more, this digital version is ideal for diversions when sat in front of the keyboard.			"

The different maps keep it interesting. And Ticket to Ride is a proven, fun game that's not so trivial that gamers won't enjoy it but not so hardcore that those new to or very casual about gaming can't get into it.			"

												Long ago I used to play a board game called Rail Baron, based on the buying of train routes and getting paid for destinations.  So it was easy getting into Ticket To Ride, a far simpler and less agressive game that's also much faster and relaxed.  This game is simply fun, and quick enough to play during a break in most cases.  At the start of the game, you choose up to three destinations (more depending on DLC), and spend your turn either building routes, drawing cards, or choosing new destinations.  The goal is to score the most points in the end by having the most completed destinations, the most trains on the board, and the longest routes.  There are several DLC packs for the game, and I have several of them.  I especially enjoy the Europe DLC, and these provide alternate ways to play the game.  These include new maps and rule variants for use in the game.  These are not essential, but can enhance the game if the classic USA map and rules aren't interesting anymore.  The Steam version of this game also runs very well on Ubuntu.			"

Especially the india map that was portrait which did not display well on a horizontal monitor. Although, i must add, i have never played online multiplayer for this game.			"

												I have always been a massive board game fan, and Ticket To Ride is simple but fun to play. Now it is so easy for me to play with friends even if they are on the other side of the world. So much like the board game, you can play agressively or not. The only issue I have is that for some reason it crashes every time I try to load the tutorial. Have fun playing.			"

												Update 2016-02-09:Below is my original review of the game, now that there has been a ""patch"" I feel the need to change my original review from ""recommended"" to ""don't buy"". Unfortunately the latest update has not only changed the main controls and the layout of the board, but simply broke the game.Now it takes about 5 minutes to simply load the game, it just starts with a blank map where you can't do anything and the music and sound effects are blaring. When it finally loads the process of selecting a map is anything but comfortable, where before you could simply switch through the maps, looking at the different layouts with a click, now you have to enter a submenu to rotate through (not a deal breaker on its own, but remember, I've just been exposed to 5 minutes of waiting for things to react at all).Now within the game itself the board layout has also change, for newcomers probably intuitive enough, for those who have already spent quite a lot of time in the game a nuisance.All of the things I've mentioned above are not the reason I can't recommend this game though.The reason you should stay away until they patch this game: after you've finished a round the game just hangs with a white screen, no reaction at all, nothing. Couldn't even close it properly and had to kill it through the taskmanager. I'm definitely not willing to spend 5 minutes waiting for the game to load, navigate through submenus to pick a map and then have the game crash after one round.Original review:After finally being able to start the game, I have to admit I almost forgot the trouble it gave me when I first installed it... or well, rather when I installed it for the first 7 times. But only almost. If you have an AMD graphics card be prepared for trouble, this thing is a b* to get to run on new machines.It's certainly not a fan of up-to-date graphic drivers, nope, this game shows its age while installing (not while playing, mind you)In case anyone is reading this after having tried and failed to install and actually start this game on a windows 7 machine, here is a rather usefull link, just scroll to the end of the page an follow those instructions, all but step 4. DO NOT COPY THE FILE, just leave it where it is and skip ahead to step 5.http://steamcommunity.com/app/108200/discussions/0/846943418815498457/#p2In case it still won't start, just try running it in compatiblity mode for windows XP, that's what did the trick for me. Now all is fine.But back to the game itself.It's fun to play and way too easy to waste an enourmous amount of time with it. The campaigns are fairly short and one little campaign won't cost you days or hours of your life, but if you are like me and can't stop after a loss... or a win, well a short campaign of 10 minutes can turn into 2 hours.Some of the maps are rather confusing at first (yeah, well, who reads or acutally listens to instructions, right? yep, neither did I), especially since the DLCs seem to have other rules when it comes to train placement. If you're not interested in the DLC anyway (it's hit an miss btw.), than it's rather straighforward. The video on steam pretty much covers all the rules and the gameplay.Would I recommend this?Yeah, I guess I still would, but only to those who know how to open a command shell, 'cause if things go wrong, that's pretty much the only way to get to enjoy this game.

												This just gem of a game very fun fast and stragity. You only have so many cars to place , and must choose wheather to draw cards , draw destination cards ,or play cars on map. How and what is done can make the game last longer or end it very quickly. Blocking players in game can be quite interesting outcome sometimes . All the maps offerd have vareied ways to play ,tunnles ,ferrys ,stations,stocks, also the most citys conected on one line, exctra.  Never a dull moment on how to play game and there seems to be quit a large online player waiting someone to play a game!   Great family or friends game with -pass and play mode- can play with more than one player on one pc or laptop...   Also ez to learn!!			"

												‘Ticket to Ride’ can be a little intimidating at first, especially for people who haven’t played any tabletop game before. I’ve tried the traditional edition as well and I definitely prefer the digital one, let alone for the fact you have the board right in front of you every time, not having to look at it from the upside down nor any other angle.There’s a nice selection of maps, though mostly sold as DLCs. Thankfully, prices are reasonable, even more so while on sale. Game runs smoothly and has a decent tutorial. After getting to know all the rules and a little bit of practice you will find yourself beating bots with moderate effort from your side. Getting achievements is completely different story, though.Haven’t competed against real people in online modes much but from what I gather the game ran smoothly then as well and was even more enjoyable. If you want to start your adventure with tabletop games, I think digital version of ‘Ticket to Ride’ is a great one to help you with that. 7/10			"

												It’s a good/fun e-board game overall, especially since I got it for $2.50 on a Steam sale. Got a 2nd copy so the spouse and I can play each other from Surface tablets on the couch at night. We don’t have a lot of time at night so this is easier to setup and play quickly than the physical game. The game is pretty touch friendly and there are even control settings to help. The interface is a little corny and the music gets old but you can turn it off.My biggest gripe is that I could not get the LAN play to work so we had to create 3rd party accounts to play online. I wish it just worked with the Steam accounts.If you find it on sale you can’t go wrong. Plus there are tons of other maps to play. "

												This just gem of a game very fun fast and stragity. You only have so many cars to place , and must choose wheather to draw cards , draw destination cards ,or play cars on map. How and what is done can make the game last longer or end it very quickly. Blocking players in game can be quite interesting outcome sometimes . All the maps offerd have vareied ways to play ,tunnles ,ferrys ,stations,stocks, also the most citys conected on one line, exctra.  Never a dull moment on how to play game and there seems to be quit a large online player waiting someone to play a game!   Great family or friends game with -pass and play mode- can play with more than one player on one pc or laptop...   Also ez to learn!!			"

												Its the board game with decent music and the AI makes good choices.  The multiplayer has lots of players and its fun.  Really recommend it if you like board games.			"

												Absolutely Love It Every Map has its own carisma and challenges.  Love the real Board Game the Best but the computer version is just as good just a computer experience in its stead			"

												Stay away from this game. I doesn't work and the developer is completely ignoring all the issues that have been addressed to them regarding this game. Spend your money somewhere else			"

												This is a great conversion of the Ticket to Ride board game to a computerized platform.  I've had no trouble finding a game online with people, and the decks seem to be shuffled fairly well.  If you like the board game, you'll most likely like this too.This game is great to play solo, online, or pass and play.  I even have the Ticket to Ride mobile app to play as well.  Fun game that doesn't require too much thought, but is still really enjoyable.  I would highly recommend adding it to your multiplayer collection.			"

												I bought this (and ALL the DLC) to play on Linux. Suddenly, it's not listed as being supported by Steam, but Linux still appears in the app description - TWICE. I'm very unhappy about this and look forward to an update that brings back the game I've paid for.The game appears to actually still run on Linux. I'm not sure if support will be provided should the need arise.As long as the game continues to run on the platform I purchased it for, I will continue to recommend it.			"
