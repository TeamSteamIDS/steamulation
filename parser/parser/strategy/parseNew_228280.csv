												The original Baldur's Gate is one of my favourite games, second only to its successor and is a game any rpg fan must play. Due to its art style for a game that came out in 1998 it still holds up well today. Graphically this game still looks beautiful due to 2d painting-esque backdrops and thirdperson isometric viewpoint.The gameplay also has an incredible amount of depth to it and the combat is very tactical and varied depending on the class you play and the party setup you choose. The game is also from an era when games were unforgiving and actually provided the player with a challenge. The combat is similar to Dragon Age: Origins where it can be free-flowing and action oriented but it is highly recommended that players take it slowly and utilise pausing to setup properly between rounds during combat.The game being built upon the ruleset of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons has a lot of depth to classes and the classes will all playout and feel very different which offers a lot of replayability ontop of just choosing and adhering to different alignments.Also due to the game being built upon AD&D and being set in a D&D realm the game has an incredible amount of history and backstory in there that the world feels real and is incredibly dark and gritty which ties in great with the dark tones of the main story.Without spoiling too much of the story it starts with very humble beginning and quickly thrusts the player into a world descending into turmoil with bandits and bad guys wanting to kill you at every turn you must uncover the sinister plot that is unfolding and discover your own dark heritage in the process.I would wholeheartedly recommend this game although I will warn that there is a lot of reading involved and that the combat is designed to played slowly (unlike diablo and games of its ilk) and very tactically but for those that love a game with a great story this game is undoubtedly one you should play.

												I am posting this on both the review for this game, and the first in the series, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced edition.I absolutely LOVE this game, and everything about it, and the other game in the series. I loved the combat, the UI was tight, everything was well-polished when Beamdog re-released the game. I was actually in the middle of a run through the entire game on the hardest difficulty with only the main character...Before IT happened.The update to Siege of Dragonspear affected both games, and it's been nothing but negative for me so far. I can no longer access the Command Console (used for fixing the many glitches that can happen here and there), the UI is buggy and, when it does work, is clunky and, frankly, ugly as sin itself. My saves have all disappeared into the wind, and my character's data has become ridiculously bugged (Level 34 at the tail end of Throne of Bhaal suddenly turning into a level 17 with all of the items from her run through BG1 and 2? What?) and more. Before now, I would have recommended this series in a heartbeat. This game, nearly two decades ago, defined and revived a dying RPG era. But now? Now it's nearly impossible to play. And, unfortunately, it was the fault of the people who brought it back in the first place.--HOW BEAMDOG CAN FIX THIS---Implementation of the old character and save game formatting-Option to use the old UI-Option to turn the Console Command on and off IN GAME. The steps to do this in the first place were a nightmare in and of itself.--Things that COULD help--- Scale the difficulty levels back down a little. Insane difficulty jumped from enemies doing 50% more damage to 100%, and Legacy of Bhaal makes the game nearly unplayable.As it stands right now? DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. It pains me to say that (as you can no doubt see from my time in this game), but as it is right now, it's not worth any money.			"

												Baldur's Gate - A 16 year old game stands up to the test of time, and it's co-op!So during the steam summer sale, a friend of mine bought me Baldur's Gate 1(Enhanced Edition) so we could play together(the 4 pack was 20 bucks). 6 months later, we had never played together once so I finally decided that I wanted to play, so I played it solo.Now there's a few things you should know about Baldur's Gate. The game was originally released in 1998. I played it while I was in high school my senior year. It introduced a LOT of new people to Dungeons & Dragons. It's a 3rd person isometric RPG in which you control all members of your party. It's paused based(instead of turn based), which means that when combat starts, you pause, issue commands, unpause, wait for something to happen, pause again, issue commands, etc, etc. There are lots of games with that type of system now, but as far as I know, BG was the first.So the way you're -supposed- to play it solo is to create one character and go along recruiting AI NPCs to join your party of up to six. Well you can get around all that by playing in multiplayer mode by yourself. Multiplayer mode lets you create all six party members and tweak them to your desire. You can also export/import different characters at any time. You can easily get away with this from an RP(roleplaying) perspective by saving your game in an inn and swapping party members in and out saying ""Oh I met this guy at this inn"". So to start with, I created my own party of 3: Human Fighter(me), Paladin, and Cleric, then I pick up NPCs along the way. Not completely satisfied with the NPCs in game, I finished the game with 5/6 party members self generated, and only one in-game NPC(Yeslick the Dwarven Fighter/Cleric). If you enjoy character creation and tweaking things and micromanaging party members, gear, stats, and other RPG elements, this game is definately for you.Lets talk about the story. This is where the game really drew a lot of people in. For those of you that have already played, you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone that may play the game in the future(even if it IS 16 years old), but it's a great, great story that lets you choose your own path. Of course my path is that of the good soldier fighting for... well... good. But if you enjoy the darker side of things, it's always allowed, which a lot of games give you trouble doing. You can lie, cheat, steal, and murder and still complete the game.Oftentimes now that I'm in my 3rd decade of life, I've gone back and tried to play games from my childhood that I remember really enjoying, and graphically none of them have stood up to the test of time(X-Com, Doom, etc). Since all of the assets in BG are more or less hand drawn and the enhanced edition lets you play at your native resolution, the game still looks pretty damn good, especially amidst the recent indy dev 8 bit gaming boom. So graphically, it passes the test. The environments are pretty freakin cool too. A whole lot of unique, hand drawn areas that I had forgotten about since I first played a long time ago that made me say ""huh, cool"" when I came across them recently.And now let's talk difficulty. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game hard. It's been so long since I've played a game that didn't just blatantly hold my hand and coddle me the whole way through I'd forgotten what it's like to play a game that punishes you. AD&D 2.0 core rules are a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ and completely unforgiving. There are 5 difficulty levels in the game:-Easy - Everything does half damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.- Normal - Everything does 75% damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.- Core Rules - Everything does 100% damage, hit point gains are randomized(so you can get as little as 1 hp/level on your badass front-line fighter that needs ~10 hp/level), and characters can permanently die.- Hard - Everything does 150% damage- Insane - Everything does 200% damage and you are a satan worshipping masochistI may have added that last little part on the insane bit.So being the badass gaming veteran I am, I of course choose Core Rules. I understand what THAC0 is, I know what the different classes are, I know how to D&D. I'm good.Or so I thought.I'm actually not as good as I had thought. I had to do a LOT of fights multiple times because Jesus Christ, this game can be hard. Mostly with the crowd control abilities the enemies get(note - If you fight against a group that has a mage, KEEP YOUR PARTY SPREAD OUT just like in ArmA). A lot of times I'd get hit with an AoE fear or confuse or stun, etc, etc, etc. It could be infuriating, but I kept re-loading and going at the fights in different manners from different angles, and analyzing my party and their abilities and switching things around until finally, at the end of the game, I had SOME sort of idea of what I was doing... I thought... until the final battle.Let's just say that the final battle in Baldur's Gate had me curled up in a fetal position in the corner of my room praying to Torm asking him what I had done so poorly to have been punished so badly.So somewhere between 20 and 50 attempts later, I managed to defeat the final boss and win the game. I even had to google strategies for the final boss. I actually felt a sense of accomplishment like I haven't felt in a game in a long, long time. The funny part is, 17 year old me beat the game in 1998 without the internet for guidance. I have NO CLUE how I managed that feat.So I immediately went to steam and bought Baldur's Gate 2 enhanced edition, even though it's not on sale, and started a new game. This time, however, I'm playing on normal mode. It seems to be a much better balance of playability vs difficulty. I've still lost some fights, but I've learned a whole damn lot and built my party around the strengths needed.I have a Cavalier paladin because he: 1. Can't be feared, charmed, mind controller, or poisoned; and 2. He can make the entire party immune to fear pretty much all the time. He's also a badass tank alongside my main character which is a frontline fully maximized fighter with sword and shield. I also have a pure Dwarven Cleric, Fighter/Thief, Fighter/Mage, and Dragon Disciple Sorcerer. I dual classed the Thief and Mage with Fighter bases so they could use longbows for good DPS instead of being relegated to a shortbow and a sling. The nice side to that is that they get fighter HP for their first 7 levels so they're pretty beefy on top of it all.I just pretend(roleplay) that my entire group is a squad of trained military soldiers that have been sent on a mission, so they almost all have that base fighter class from their military training.So I have 2 tanks(FIghter/Cavalier Paladin), a pure healing Cleric, and 3 pure DPS(Thief/Mage/Sorcerer). But don't be fooled, that fighter and paladin can put out some melee hurt too. The cleric is really the only non-dps class. Oh... Make sure you -always- have a thief in your party with the script that makes him passively detect traps. Trust me on this. You don't necessarily need a thief/rogue that can stealth, but you damn sure need one that can detect/disarm traps and pick locks.And on that note, there are pre-set scripts that you can use for each character. There are about 20 for all the different classes in the game to mess around with. I pretty much have my whole group on the standard ""I see an enemy and attack with my equipped weapon"", except for my rogue, who is set to always passively detect traps when not in combat, and my cleric who is set to dynamically run around and heal. I micromanage everything else(mage spells mostly).Read the rest of this review here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Jester814/discussions/0/648817377413793428/ "

												Not much enhanced here - if anything the game is dehanced because of hamfisted changes to the UI which remove a lot of the fantastical charm the original Baldur's Gate had and replace it with an ugly, mostly black one (no more stylized dropcaps at the beginning of item/book/weapon/gem descriptions, tacky black backgrounds behind tooltips (instead of the charming scroll that used to appear), popup speeches during action scenes, and journal entries, ability to scroll off the maps and see blackness which cuts off the on-map scenery, etc etc etc). They have also decided to not include their own version of a detailed, colored map seen here from the TuTu mod 


YouTube™ Video: Let's Play Baldur's Gate Part 10 

			Views: 16,255		

			Baldur's Gate, released in 1998 by Bioware and Interplay. I'm playing this game modded. I'm using the TuTu mod to enable me to play the game with the Baldur's Gate 2 engine.		

 Instead, they used the original bland, tan parchment paper map with the added feature of immersion-breaking font!Feels much more like a fan-mod with mediocre (and sometimes anti-intellectual sjw) writing (or removal of writing *cough* Safana's dialogue has been erased in favor of vacuous, humdrum scribbling *cough*) instead of work on the same level of greatness that was the original Baldur's Gate.I'm still going to play it so I can transfer my character to Siege of Dragonspear and play through the rest of the series, but if this is the team that will be making Baldur's Gate 3 if they get enough funding for it, my expectations will definitely not be high. I wish there was a one thumb up and one thumb down mixed option for steam games. If there was I'd choose that instead of a thumb down. The game is still good, but many of the changes push it away from being great.			"

												I had just gotten back into Baldurs Gate and was loving the experience. I had never beated BG1 upon its release many years ago, and I was enjoying going through the world before BG2. Right as I got into the swing of things they released the update today 3/31/16. The character models look chartoonish, the journal now pops up, items now obscenly flash their stats if you even pick them up in your inventory for a second. It seems dumbed down and thats unfortunate. If there was a option as a previous reviewer mentioned, of reverting back to the old format, I have no doubt I would again enjoy this game and look forward to completing the saga. As it stands now I own't be playing until that's an option. And as I paid for both games, and the product has vastly changed, I feel slightly cheated.			"

												Bought for Siege of Dragonspear. Game is unplayably buggy in Multiplayer. Over an hour to manage to even open a game in way that every player actually has gear instead of an empty inventory. Game crashes every time I save in multiplayer. Switching hosts the game now refuses to unpause for me. So everytime the game is saved or otherwise paused, I can not unpause until another player talks to an NPC which unpauses the game. Restarting the game fixed it. Continued playing only to discover that the key ring is buggy and any keys added to it just disappear....Don´t buy this broken mess if you have any intention of playing with friends. Singleplayer seems to work so far.			"

It will crush the game and you won't load it anymore.What to do if you already bought the game and caused the crash: write to the support and wait... Wait... Wait...			"

												Great game...when it works.  I currently have 24 hours ""played"" and of that 24, approximately 5-7 are actually playing the game with a friend.  It's currently a mess when trying to play co-op, which is the only reason I purchased the enhanced edition.  2+ hours attempting to get ONE GAME working.  This isn't a one off either, each time we try to play it takes 30+ minutes just to get the game functioning for both of us.  Either one of us crash or he's kicked out of the game (""multiplayer session terminated"") for no apparent reason.  We both left the game paused when not playing just to avoid having to go through this again, and guess what happened?  Yup, we left the area and the game tried to autosave...he got kicked right out of the game with the beloved ""multiplayer session terminated"" message.  We tried again, leaving the game open after it worked (our longest play-session so far has been 2 or 3 hours before a problem), and it crashed when auto-saving.  This is over a LAN network as well...If/When these multiplayers problems are fixed, I will definitely change my review to positive.  Until then, I can't recommend this game, especially if you're looking to play with friends.Edit: Been playing some more. Encountered a bug that prevented my co-op partner from moving. Seems to have occurred after I interacted with an npc. His screen goes gray and he can't move until I talk to an npc.  Occurs (e.g. his screen goes gray and he can't move even after unpausing etc.) when transitioning to a new area, pausing for battle, and saving the game.We had to exit out of the Baldur's Gate and start the reconnect game again to fix it.Edit 4/16/16:Game was patched and now connecting and staying connected is no longer a problem.  Looks like they broke something else though.  Can't play co-op AT ALL without the save game being corrupted.  This is with cloud saves off.  I tried hosting and my game now crashes when entering a new area after the update...no matter what save I use.  I tried joining a co-op game with my friend and we were able to play up until beregost, then every time he tried to save the game crashed ME, not the host.  Started a new game.  Played until Beregost.  Game randomly corrupted all the save files (quick saves, manual saves, etc.)... except the save at the very beginning.  I'm done with this broken game.  Wish I could request a refund, but unfortunately I'm stubborn and tried to actually have fun and play the game...of the approximately 40 hours on record now, I believe 15-20 were actually playing the game.  The rest was idle time or trying to fix the myriad of problems.			"

												October 2016 I have worked with Beamdog on several occasions on trying to get this game to work properly and have gotten frustrated and will not be trying anymore on getting it to work. I give up on my beloved game!!! Nothing they had me try worked properly unless I created characters excatly the way they wanted them created. If I created one the way I wanted it I still could not use weopons for a fighter etc. This is very dissappointing. I still have many crashes and still am not able to get out our candle keep.I will be seaking other games to play.May 23 2016 Gave beamdog files to look at and find out what is going wrong with the game still no word on why my game will not work. I was informed they are looking into it. Although they could not recreate the issues I was having so I had to send them my files.New Edit  May 18 2016: just downloaded the update, still broken, still not fixed, do not waste your money on this game, nothing is fixed..... As far as people telling me how to fix my game that do not have info showing they are developer by their Icon Badge or do not have any level of play time for BG EE, I am not sure If I should trust someone like this telling me how to change setting on my computer etc. If others choose to do this that is your choice.New Edit May 2016: BG EE Still Broke!!!! So Disappointed  After Illydth comments I did a unistall of steam and reinstall of steam and a complete reinstall of game and verified the game files and still cannot play the game it still crashes. None of the bugs below are fixed and Fighters still cannot use weopons. What good is a fighter if they cannot use any weopons but a quarterstaff or a club! Also I cannot even make it out of Candle Keep when starting a new game. I have posted screenshots on this in the community hub for all that think this is a bluff.New Edit: I have still not seen any fixes for the problems I am experiencing with Playing my game BG EE since the update. I am so sad. Fighters cannot use any weopons this makes it hard to fight if you cannot have any weopons..........I really Love This Game BG EE, and would play it for hours on a PC. I am in a delema I want to play and cannot enjoy it anymore. Since the update that was installed on April 1, 2016, which I could not stop. Here are just a few of the problems I have noticed.- Game Crashes more times than I can throw a stick at it.- Characters are cartoonish -  Beta version Fighters cannot use any weopons -  I Get achievements for things I have not even done in Lands I have not even been to. And my old Achievements are all gone being replaced by things I have not done.-  Map scroll is all messed up- Multiplayer games on steam cloud network are unable to access for all the hours worked on.- Multiplayer join does not work- Many more issues, too many to remember- It appears that the updates were more for people using handheld devices than real pc gamers like myself according to Beamdog's website.   Quote from their site on update: “Enjoy text and dialogue selection features optimized for smaller screens, as well as numerous other improvements.”I really wish there was an option to roll back my game to the original without this update until they get the bugs worked out so I would have lost all my hard work and over 300 hours of game play.  I understand there is a need to fix the bugs and update at times, but this one caused me more problems than I can count.  I want my Loved Game Back. Please hurry with the fixes so I can get back to playing my game.			"

												This remake/remix is actually worse then original: - Crashed on me more times during single play session than oryginal during whole playthrough.- Interface worse than oryginal- Black pits -new adventure that is not the part of the main game A.K.A ultra easy mode where you can bump a character to level 9-10, equip it with very powerfull items  and then import to main game starting with uber character- Costs twice as much as original saga.+Only upside in my opinion is the possibility to play in high resolution and added graphic zoom in/out functionality.Was expecting stable remake with some graphic enhancement but got unstable game in which I have to quick save every 5 minutes to have any miningfull progress.

												I'll keep this short and sweet.  This is no longer the Baldur's Gate that we remember and love.  If you want to play something that is not the vanilla version of BG1 or BG2, then use some of the many, FREE, STABLE, mods that have been available for years.Sorry to advertise for someone else on here, but go to GOG.com... it's cheaper, and better, and then grab EasyTuTu and something like the Gibberlings3 Tweaks (just don't go too nuts with all the tweak options)The only reason I have this version that I have tried is from a friend losing the original copy of the game after I had loaned it to him, so he paid for this to replace it.

												Baldur's Gate was the first RPG that could capture the essence of table top roleplaying experience. The Enhanced Edition allowed me to relive the original expirience with enough new material te keep things interesting. It is based on the AD&D rules and thus can be a bit confusing to new platers. Overall very entertaining both for new and experienced players.			"

												Baldur's Gate is truly a masterpiece. Despite it's beauty, tactical depth and great story, the game does not take itself too seriously. This cannot be said of many other leading RPG titles, which I soon begin to find rather corny. If you like RPGs and have not played Baldur's Gate, then this is an absolute must, you do not even need to waste your time reading this review but of course you are welcome to. If you have played the original BG and are curious about Beamdog's boob job, I share with you my opinion.The original game's two main lackings are native widescreen support and Linux support (I use Ubuntu/Mint). Interestingly, the Steam store lists BGEE as a Windows/Mac title, while BG2EE is listed as Windows/Mac/Linux. Both titles run perfectly on Linux since the latest patches.The reason for me to buy Beamdog's re-release was simply curiosity. Where would anyone find the guts to mess with this classic work of art? What would they change about it?First looks and User InterfaceMy first impression of BGEE was honestly not that great. It was still before Linux support was added. The aesthetics just turned me off. The changed logo, the sword with the text ""Enhanced Edition"", the user interface which had it's old-skool goldish buttons replaced with red ""open-missile-silo-doors""-buttons. It all just took away some of the original game's magic. Perhaps mostly nostalgic feelings on my part.Once hours inside the game the UI didn't really bother me anymore. Since recent updates, I was pleasantly surprised by the ""Quick loot""-button that was added to the bottom panel. This made looting a whole lot easier, since it is no longer necessary to check all the corpses individually for good loot, potions, scrolls, etc.More aestheticsNot only the UI has had a makeover. The movies are also replaced. The new ones are not 3d-animated like the old ones. The new movies are built from nice artistic drawings. The drawings look really good and are accompanied by the trusty old sounds of the original game.The character models have also been updated, though they are still not 'HD'. The pre-rendered environments are still the same as in the original BG. These were already stunningly beautiful anyway, no need to make changes there.GameplayThere are some major changes to the gameplay. Characters are now created in the same fashion as in BG2. This means that not only can one choose from various classes, but many classes have kits to choose from, with each its own abilities and restrictions. Also, the Half-Orc is now a playable race as in BG2. Weapon proficiencies are also updated to the BG2 standard, which means that the points are no longer put into groups of weapons (for example there used to be one group of large swords, containing two-handed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and long swords and another group of blunt weapons, containing staves, maces, clubs and hammers). The new system forces you to choose specific weapons, thus making switching between various weapons in the same group impossible if you have not spent any points on the other weapon. Because of the relatively low level cap in BG1, you will find each character using one or two types of weapons throughout the whole game. This is not a problem, but it is a significant deviation from the original. The weapon styles from BG2 have also been added. This new proficiency system works really well at the higher character levels achieved in BG2, but has minor shortcomings in a game where characters reach level 8-10 and thus do not have too many points to spend.Two-Weapon FightingAs mentioned before, the weapon styles from BG2 have been imported. Two-Weapon Fighting is now also possible, which adds lots of fun to the game. You are now able to shred your opponents in seconds, sacrificing the protection of a shield. While shields in BG are not too powerful and one can easily manage without, dual-wielding is somewhat (if not more) overpowered. My Half-Orc berserker has 3 attacks per round wielding dual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords. With 19 strenght, 3 points in two-weapon fighting, 3 in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword and berserker rage (granting protection against hold, fear and other hazards, plus combat bonuses) he is an insanely strong melee fighter, one you would never encounter in the original game.Special abilitiesI mentioned the berserker rage, but many of the class kit abilities are very powerful. Some good examples are the priest of Helm's Seeking Sword (3 attacks per round with huge THAC0 bonus) and True Sight. The newly added ""Shadowdancer"" kit with its hide-in-plain-sight ability is also quite powerful, being able to backstab, hide and backstab again. There are many more new abilities that will aid you in your fight against (or for your own) evil.BalanceThe battles in BG1 often used to be insanely difficult, but they were not designed for all these newly added features. This makes the enhanced edition somewhat less challenging than the original, but still very challenging. Only the greatest tactical geniuses would complain that the game has become easy. You should consider putting the difficulty slider one notch to the right compared to what you were used to in the original. Because of all the new additions, you will be well equipped for some tougher beasties.New adventuresFor me, not too interesting. They are not of the same quality as the original storyline. Then again, that quality is extremely rare. If you do not like the new quests then you can always just skip them.ConclusionThe enhanced edition is a welcome re-release of a brilliant game. It offers some great improvements while leaving just minor scars.+Native support for widescreen and higher resolutions+Native support for Mac and Linux (no more messing around with Wine)+Zoom function (though when zoomed in the game looks a bit crude)+Quick loot function eliminates the hassle of searching every corpse individually+New kits and abilities add fun+Bug fixes+Beamdog still provides updates, they have shown their love for this game and do not seem to have done all this for some easy cash (unlike some others).-Aesthetics (mainly logo and user interface) could have been better/more faithful to the original-The balance and difficulty of the game are slightly compromised by addition of the new kits, abilities and two-weapon fighting.

												Multiplayer has been, and continues to become even more broken. With the latest patch my friends can no longer connect to my server despite multiple troubleshooting attempts. This game has always had multiplayer issues and it is not getting any better.With the latest review from Kotaku its clear that this isn't a professional company concerened with taking the old Baldur's Gate and bringing into a new era. Its a cheap port with barely any new enhancements except for Social Justice! (tm)If you want to playt this game to relive Baldur's Gate - Stay AwayIf you want to play this game to relive Baldur's Gate and do it with your online friends - Stay far away.Amber Scott - Writer for Beamdog:“If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say like, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade. If people don’t like that, then too bad.”			"

												One Word.... TERRIBLE.While I have an exstensive experience with Neverwinter Nights, This game is completely confusing. I never even made it all the way through the Tutorial. It started getting confusing when the first npc you talk to kept interupting me while I was trying to do what he said. ""open the map"" he would say, so I did and in the middle of opening the map he would interupt me and keep telling me to open the map, This was constant with every new thing the npc wanted you to do. The next headache is when the the combat trainer wanted you to cast a spell and constantly told me I hadnt cast a spell yet even though I had emptied my spells. It appears he wanted me to cast his spells, now why would I cast someone elses spells? Then the jerk wanted me to rest so I could memorize my new spells... For the life of me I couldnt find the rest button in any of the screens (inventory etc...) he told me the rest button was in... I gave up after that. While I commend the devs for making this game available on Linux, I also curse them for that because if it hadnt been made available for Linux I wouldnt have wasted an hour finding out this game SUCKS....

												Nicely improved version of Baldur's Gate.At first I was sceptic because of existence of free module BGT, but the longer I played, the more I enjoyed it. I shall focus on the differences between this and original version.Pros:+ Improved graphics with the possibility of zoom+ Additional 6 specialized classes+ New NPCs - I really felt that there should be monk and half-orc NPC recruitable. BG:EE adds them both+ A few new quests and locations+ Much clearer character/inventory screen. I found it extremely handy.Cons:- The new content doesn't add much of a gameplay. Two-three hours tops - which is very different from the description of the game.- The Black Pits are completely separate from the main game. Which caused that I didn't even care to play them - if I can't use the new experience earned and items found in the main quest then what's the purpose? Just some random battle simulator in the BG rules. "

												One of the greatest games of all time. The Enhanced Edition is still the same great game but with a few new companions and quality of life improvements, such as loot/item, chest/container, and character name highlighting when pressing tab, as well as a zoom function. The new companions are pretty nice. I played a lot with Dorn Il-Khan, the Half-Orc Blackguard, which is an evil and twisted reflection of the lawful good paladin, and I really like him a lot. He is an interesting character with a cool personality, and has an awesome class kit. He really adds a lot to an Evil party. The improvements and companions are not essential by any means, but they are nice. A lot of people complained about bugs when the EE was first released, but I'm happy to say that with the 1.3 patch, this has been eliminated. I played through the whole game and did not encounter any noticeable bugs. If you have never played Baldur's Gate, this is definitely the definitive version of the game, and the one to get. It's a 150+ hour game, so even at the full price of $20 you get your moneys worth for sure. If you have played Baldur's Gate, buy it on sale and enjoy a great excuse to replay a fantastic game.Update 2015: I have completed my playthrough and review of Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced edition.

Posted: April 4, 2016
												It is very disappointing but I have to give this game a thumbs down for now. Not because it's a bad game within itself, but because at it's current state it is unplayable. The multiplayer aspect of it at least. Singleplayer still has plenty of bugs, but nothing that prohibits you from playing the game.This is a classic. Baldur's Gate set the standard for western RPGs and introduced a lot of people to the world of Forgotten Realms and Dungeons and Dragons. I didn't have the pleasure of playing the game when it was first released but I saw a couple of friends play it and become sort of obsessed with it. They would praise the game, it's characters, it's story, it's dialogue, get sort of frustrated with its mechanics, not because they were inherently bad but because they were angry at a party wipe or character death which would force them to reload a save.They were frustrated but they wanted to play more. They wanted to finish that hard fight, they want to get the best possible outcome, they wanted to do everything.Several years later I decided to get this game for myself. Wanted to try it and see what it really was. Truth be told it hasn't aged well but the new patch 2.0 did slightly improved it (more on the patch later). It's still feels old and outdated, you'll find almost no QoL gameplay mechanics, it will feel very slow paced for someone used to a subgenre of RPG games, but the game has qualities which make it a classic.The story is pretty good (albeit I think BG:II is a lot better but this one is still nice), the characters are rich and interact with the world, you and between themselves, the dialogue is superb, serious when it needs to be, funny when it needs to be and even when it shouldn't. An important part when judging the storyline of the game is not only the story itself but how is represented to the player and how the player chooses to progress through it and BG:EE does that pretty well (again BG:EE II has dramatically improved on said aspect).The combat might feel slow and sluggish at times, since it is technically a turn based RPG without actually waiting for the NPCs to finish their turn. This pseudo-turnbased combat works well at times and feels awkward at others but I believe it's not something to take away from the fun of the experience.Sometime ago, beamdog (developing company) announce an expansion for the game called Siege of Dragonspear, 17 years after the original was released (contender for longest time for expansion release along with AoE2). Naturally we were excited to await a continuation of the story and an extra chapter into this game which would also bridge the gap between BG:EE and BG:EE II.Nonetheless in order to accomodate for the release of the patch, they released a patch 2.0 for the game and the sequel.The patch did a lot of thing which I will not mention here but it significantly altered the game. There was an outcry but many people who considered this a pointless and detrimental patch for the ""old-school"" players.I didn't really mind the ui changes, the game felt more responsive in our multiplayer sessions however it did the one thing that forced to not recommend this game.It broke multiplayer. As in it really made multiplayer unplayable. Constant crashes, save files gone (tooks a while but we fixed that), grey-scale pauses, difficulty settings which are always reduced to the previous tier whenever you start your client, you name it.BG:EE has a lot of bugs. I mean a lot. In multiplayer those bugs are enhanced since they will translate to frustration for multiple people. However me and my friends were so enamored with the rest of the game that we managed to power through the buggy/unresponsive mess that the multiplayer was and we managed to finish the game just in time for the release of the expansion.However at this moment we cannot play the game. It is literally unplayable and you're at the mercy of Tymora if you want to get it working. Most of the times it doesn't. Which is a damn shame. Did nobody playtest this in multiplayer? Did nobody else got the game-breaking bugs which many a people report of forums/reviews/discussions about the game.Most important of all, we were seriously planning to get the Siege of Dragonspear expansion, but we decided not to. Because we want to play the game together as friends but the game won't let us.Until the multiplayer game get fixed, until the bugs are fixed, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game and it's expansion to anyone. Seriously, it's a damn shame cause the game itself is a classic. But if you cannot play it, then it's not really a game now is it.I won't even discuss the ""rage"" about trans clerics who have offended some people. This is irrelevant. The multiplayer is unplayable. Fix it and then we can discuss everything else that might be wrong within the game. For shame beamdog, for shame.			"

												Special thanks to a good friend who proof-read this review; they said they wanted to remain anonymous, but thanks nonetheless.**Steam has finally allowed me to update this review! Now you can read the complete assessment here instead of venturing to the comments.Unlike many of the individuals who have purchased this title, I had not previously been exposed to Baldur’s Gate before this variance made its way onto the Steam store; I can, however, say that I anxiously awaited its rerelease on Steam, and even purchased it at a much higher price-point than I ever had and would with any other title. Baldur’s Gate is a game that deserves its praise as a classic open-world roleplaying adventure game based on the Second Edition (2e) of the Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) tabletop d20 game developed by the late Gary Gygax; Baldur’s Gate, followed by the Neverwinter and Dragon Age series, supports the DnD 2e core roleplaying game mechanics. As an avid player of DnD 3.5 and 3.75e (the Pathfinder system), I had not experienced much prior exposure to 2e other than that which I researched online and from my older Dungeon Mastering books, and, therefore, was able to view Baldur’s Gate as an original concept instead of ‘just another DnD adventure path.'Here are some things that I found particularly enjoyable about Baldur’s Gate:Connectivity to Dungeons & Dragons  - Right down to the equipment, combat tactics, roleplaying capabilities, and intriguing characters, Baldur’s Gate provides the sheer thrill of roleplaying that is offered by the tabletop renditions of the Dungeons & Dragons games. The game utilizes a simultaneous real-time and turn-based approach to combat, which will be described under the Gameplay portion of this review. Included in this title are six playable core races, a multitude of classes that influence each character’s style of play, the ability to multiclass, and the capability to interact with party members, which further enhances (no pun intended) the roleplaying experience. Since it utilizes the same mechanics as those in the tabletop roleplaying system, concepts such as THACO scores, Initiative modifiers, and alignments make an appearance; to those that are not familiar with the concepts, they are very simple to grasp and there are online guides dedicate to both Baldur’s Gate and Dungeons & Dragons that aide newer players in learning the roleplaying system.Gameplay - As stated previously, Baldur’s Gate utilizes a combat system that is both turn-based and real-time in that actions rotate between characters within a confrontation as a sequence depending on each character’s Initiative score; basically, whoever’s quicker will end up going first in the rotation. The game also employs a simulated d20-or 20-sided die-roll to resolve the degree of success pertaining to given actions such as lockpicking and attack actions. Outside of combat, players can speak with other characters, both in and out of their own party, which may alter a given character’s alignment status. Some characters also have the ability to perform certain actions such as picking locks as a Rogue archetype (pressing V while out of combat), or casting passive Charm spells on non-player characters for specific gains. In all, the system is so intricate and open that you can practically do whatever you want, within the game’s limitations, of course. There is also a multiplayer component to Baldur’s Gate in which you can import characters you have created and play with friends throughout the game.Truly Open World - At the beginning of Baldur’s Gate , you are given a background story, a sufficient reason to proceed through the main campaign’s questline, and the chance of receiving your first companion character. That’s it. From there, you are free to explore the massive map however you wish while obtaining side quests, battling formidable foes, and gaining companionship with other notable non-playable characters. There are also game modifications (mods) to expand the map and the game’s story. How much more ‘open’ can you get?The Black Pits - If you are searching for a different pacing outside of the massive world within the main campaign, then the Black Pits game mode is for you. This story is primarily driven by combat, in which your created party of six must fend off waves of enemies who utilize various tactics and themes in order to liberate your team from the Black Pits fighting arena. As straightforward as this may seem, it is extremely fun in a tactical manner, and permits the player to enjoy the core combat mechanics of the game without having to worry about the text and speech components; of course, there are secretes to be found within the Black Pits proving grounds.TL:DR - Like the person I would like to dedicate this review to, this game is an ‘original’ soul with intricate mechanics that will either make or break you. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world, roleplaying, or strategy titles, and would highly urge Baldur’s Gate to those who play tabletop roleplaying games, especially Dungeons & Dragons .

												I've heard great things about this game and when I started playing and saw the gameplay, the ideas behind it and the story I was instantly hooked but... with the recent updates happening to it and the bug ridden mess it is I simply cannot recommend it. No matter how good this game is the developers managed to break something that was pretty much perfect for 2 decades. The problem I had with it is that I simply couldn't progress. It's not allowing me to, getting stuck on doors and the edges of the map. Completely broken, I tried all the fixes listed online, none worked.Clunky UI compared to the original one and they pretty much removed a lot of options like the console the game had. Game is a mess. If you can go find the original version on retail. You'll probably enjoy it more.			"

												I had never played it when it came out, I'm sure it was groundbreaking back in the day, but this game is not fun at all. All the rich elements of dungeons and dragons are there, but none of it is at reach because of all those restrictions. all those spells don't matter when  you can only memorize 3 at a time, and all those weapons mean nothing when anything kills in one blow but everyone keeps missing their attacks. I played with the core rules and I regret it, permadeath is stupid, and even a little kobold can kill you in one shot. It takes an eternity to level up and fights have no need of input from the player: you just wait and pray nobody dies. A mage could do spells, so there are decisions to make; but they die too easily, or their spells are used, so they are out of the picture. it doesn't feel rewarding at all. I didn't have fun.It's at this point that I realise that I just don't like D&D, the philosophy behind all the characters is very thin and doesn't fit reality. I hated that two party members left me because they thought I was too evil... after killing a bounty hunter that attacked me first. I hated the bard that made fart jokes; the guy literally says ''PFFFT, hooh, that was a sharp one'' when you click on him. There's also the necromancer that says creppy things, but whines like a baby 50% of the time; what's up with that? It's wierd, juvenile and unappealing to the point of disgust. There is no way, absolutely no way, to think that the characters are interesting or developed. But, I do appreciate the fact that there is close to no hand-holding. I really did. No pointer, no arrow, just you and the world.			"

												Classics are often thought to be timeless for future generations to enjoy, but the same cannot be said for Baldur's Gate—and it's not because CRPGs are uncommon. To go blind into BG in 2016 is practically impossible because how modern expectations are at odds with the brutal accessibility of '90s computer games.Baldur's Gate, simply put, is an sarcophagus; it is a coffin of a bygone time of design philosophies and of late '90s player expectations, immersed in the counter-culture of D&D and of fantasy-fiction that is written in its code like hieroglyphics to modern eyes.  The game's reverence is both a nostalgic call-back as well as an appreciation of BG's systems as a traditional role-playing experience. As someone who has started with modern CRPGs (Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin), it is difficult to recommend this game as others are more forgiving, even with BeamDog's inclusion of Story-Mode. However, if you can adjust your expectations and give the game some time it may prove to be as enriching of an experience for newcomers. We're THAC0, and AC-0 and--What?Perhaps what many might find hard to believe is that Baldur's Gate is not a difficult game; it's a game that lacks the conveyance to understand it. (Although this comparison is often misused, it's like Dark Souls in how you have to know things before you play.) This is because the greatest hurdle of mastering BG is to understand its language, Advanced D&D.  The game literally brings the rule-set of AD&D that only that '80s to '90s tabletop fans would understand. The tutorial goes only so far to explain the UI and controls; it doesn't explain how combat is tallied nor what key factors will improve your odds. (The key three reminders: THAC0, your chance to hit; AC, your chance to deflect/dodge; and you want BOTH to be low or negative values.) Another issue is the dialogue box doesn't list the calculations to show what you're doing wrong nor is there an in-game codex to explain it, so you will need the manual or a Wiki page on hand. All of this is said from someone who has played Pillars of Eternity for 110+ hours on hard mode without a guide. I had to play Baldur's Gate on Novice with Wikis and video tutorials. (Even then, I still often died for all the various status effects.) This highlights that the game's coherency is the issue, not the difficulty, although the game can be feel frustrating because of its systems' unclearness. (Ex. How do you know what is an Evil spell that you can protect against?)BeamDog has somewhat addressed the difficulty with the inclusion of Story-Mode (only v2.2). If you want to play in its original form Novice and Normal is as hard you should play. Story-mode removes the permadeaths and offer a lax experience to enjoy the narrative. Unfortunately, BG lacks a sweet-spot for people who are not familiar with AD&D; you either make the combat too repetitive or too brutal. In several cases, neutering the difficulty will rob you of the enjoyment of BG, especially in the most D&D areas such as Durlag's Tower. The plot, the ""non-linear nature"", and systems revolve around how brutal of a game it can be and how BG can be forgiving in its own ways. I would like to think one day I would tackle the game on its own terms, but the time required to invest into one series feels too much to ask. The BioWare RenaissanceNostalgia is often reserved only for fans, so it must say something when I felt it having never played BG before. The reason for that feeling is because many of Bioware's core ideas are found in BG. (Some for the better—and some habits are hard to break.)The companion system is the first relatable aspect for Dragon Age fans. Although there are twenty-eight companions, they are often caricatures to establish their personality and stick to their tropes. It works because you are meant to exchange companions whenever they die as they're irrelevant to the plot. The result is that it's not their personalities that establish their character but what happens during gameplay that fosters  your attachments. Characters' deaths are quests; interruptions to the storyline that shape how you get through with the lives you can save—or reload from a quicksave.As someone used to modern BioWare titles, it's hard to let companions die for good because I've been accustomed to the characters being part of the experience. It's a change I personally can't agree with, but it isn't a flaw; it's an interesting deviation. Another similar aspect is the cliché storyline coupled with subversions that make for some interesting moments. The story was a D&D taboo for its time because of how the storyline revolves solely one player, not the party, and the formula of ""One person must stand against a great evil"" has ever since been applied to BioWare's games.In terms of its world building, it's great for fans who know the references to D&D. However, it remains interesting for non-fans who are clueless because you cannot ask random NPCs for information about the game's world, factions or beliefs. It forces your attention on the smallest of details and to read the lore. For example, the moral alignment system is only one aspect that handles the complexities of the lore and game mechanics just fine in this adaptation. (For the most part...)The game's biggest issue of its moral alliances is how numerically rigid it is. Towards the final chapter, you cannot kill too many guards before your good party members leave you because your reputation points were lost. The result is playing the final act to the Benly Hill theme. The greater problem is how mechanically restraining it is to develop a party of various alignments when the variety helps to keep the party feeling lively. It's a great idea on paper, and with a Dungeon Master to give it some leeway, but as a videogame it feels too gamey.Unforunately, that issue is not the only story-related problem. What can also be taken from BG is BioWare's problem of having endings made into cliff-hangers or being in media res at the end. BG1 ends after one small hurdle has been accomplished, shortly after a major revelation, before foreshadowing that the experience isn't over. Then it knocks you back to the title-screen with a save file for BG2. The conflicts of the main plot with Amm and Baldur's Gate are not even addressed in an epilogue.It's quite telling how Mass Effect and Dragon Age have carried on this  tradition of having issues to resolve each game's narratives with a fulfilling climax. In BG1, the problem is taken even to a further extreme. Your level cap isn't 1/4th of the level cap of BG2, and chances are if you are not a completionist you will stay at Lv 7/8. The end game will feel as though you are just establishing your character, getting into the world-building conflicts, and then it ends.Whatever Greatnesses Arise are Destined to Beneath the EarthCivilizations are doomed to fade with time, and the same can be said for Baldur's Gate. Its legacy lives on in modern BioWare titles trying to recapture the same feelings, with various levels of success, and other games have adapted its ideas for modern audiences. In some way, however, the classic of Baldur's Gate cannot be repeated in modern times as it's a vestige of games long since forgotten.If anything killed the late '90s CRPG craze it was the games themselves. Their inaccessible barrier for entry, among many other issues, isolated them into obscurity and further made whatever wonders they created lost to modern eyes. If Baldur's Gate isn't for you, then know that it probably wasn't meant for you. Baldur's Gate Reloaded may be more accessible as it uses Neverwinter to recreate the experience as best as it can be done. However faithful it may be it won't recapture all that makes BG what it is.That is the magic of Baldur's Gate.			"

												I do recommend playing Baldur's Gate! Just not really the Enhanced Edition.Albeit EE doesn't differ from the original much, it does in some significant ways. First of all, it allows running the game in high resolution. You can do it with the old BG too, but that requires a mod, and it's a nice thing to have it without doing anything. EE adds some magical weapons and other items to the game too. Not too many, which is very good, and they are balanced and fit in the game. Moreover, unlike vanilla BG, EE is not limited to Windows only, and can be run on other operating systems. A great thing is also the fact that BG EE has many languages to choose from (albeit no dubbings) so it might be a good way to practice one's language skills. Unfortunately these are the only positive things I can say about EE. When EE was released it was full of bugs, even gamebreaking ones, but they were fixed by now. Most of them at least, because some things remain broken. For example I couldn't join Alora to my team, because her encounter was broken. Moreover, the quality of the writing when it comes to the new dialogues (and NPCs) is low, and it stands out from the rest of the game, definitely not in a positive way. Hence, it's better to play vanilla game without it. Moreover, for replayability there are many interesting modifications for Baldur's Gate, but they do not work with EE.Play Baldur's Gate if you haven't already. To decide whether to choose BG:EE or BG you should consider quite a few things. Why choose BG over BG:EE?- no bugs- quality of the game is the same all-through- modificationsWhy choose BG:EE over BG?- multiple language versions (but no dubbings)- multiple operating systems supported (albeit Wine runs BG just fine)			"

												Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition started off its life under great duress, due to bugs and other technical mishaps.It has now, however, come through these difficulties and is an amazing (and faithful) recreation of an old classic that many consider to be one of the best games ever made.Baldur's Gate is the grandfather of the modern RPG, and is a must-play for someone who hankers to know how Skyrim and Dragon Age came to be in the first place. It is fun to play, but note that there is some micromanagement involved with controlling party members - the built in AI scripts aren't perfect and can be a pain at times.			"

The attemtp at putting in a patch to allow us to revert back to the old layout failed, and the game constantly crashes.  Just terrible.			"

												I love this game...Baldur's Gate is probably my favorite game of all time, and I say this as someone who never played the original when it first came out. In fact, I never experienced BG until around 2012, when the enhanced edition was released. Since that time, all of my MMORPG subscriptions have long since expired and no other RPG has even come close to blowing my mind the way this one has. Now keep in mind that when I first played this game I was used to games like Skyrim and Mass Effect, and here we're talking about a game in which the original was released in 1998. None the less, I really took to this game and it has easily become my most played game on Steam. This is probably the greatest compliment I can give the game: the fact that I have over 350 games on Steam, and yet all they do is sit in my steam library while an enhancement for an old game (that I don't even possess nostalgia for) completely dominates my attention. I'm telling you...it's that good.As for specifics, it's very hard for me to put into words just what it is about this game that is so special. For me, it's so many things, such as the D&D license, setting, and lore. I love the classic AD&D ruleset and the way it was implemented. I enjoy the rich and diverse NPCs, their unique personalities and abilities, and how they mesh together and make every playthrough unique, depending on which ones you choose for your party. I enjoy the fact that your character can be imported to BG2EE (which I also purchased, but from Beamdog) and leveled all the way to 8M XP. It provided something to plan for, and look forward to...and watching your character slowly come together and gain the power you imagined for it is a uniquely satisfying experience. It doesn't come instantly - it takes patience. No instant gratification...there are plenty of RPGs out there that cater to such. But to learn this game, and stick with it, and really involve yourself with it, I promise you, you'll be glad you did. To call it rewarding would be an understatement. I can almost promise you that you'll enjoy it.This is a super, super game. No doubt. For me, it's the computer gaming experience of a lifetime. I simply cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												An AD&D adventure set in the Forgotten Realms. The Grandaddy of all isometric (top down) open world RPGs. The Gold Standard from 1998 by which all others of its type continue to be weighed, measured and found wanting. And while it's nice to see a resurgence of newer titles embracing this classic genre, Baldur's Gate is still yet to be dethroned as far as I'm concerned by anything that has come along since in terms of gameplay, story and immersion. Although the graphics were revolutionary for its time, they're obviously well dated by today's standards. But once you get drawn into its story, colorful NPCs and atmosphere its technical limitations just fade away and it still holds up just fine.Kudos to Beamdog for bringing this classic into the modern era of PC gaming.Play it again.......for the very first time			"

												10/10 would go for the eyes again.For first time players I would caution: this game is an 2nd-edition D&D pencil & paper game made into a computer game. If you are expection lots of cutting edge graphics, sfx, Michael-Bay style action, CoD-style instant-gratification, and easy gameplay with little thought involved, this game is not for you.On the other hand, if you enjoy good narrative, compelling story arcs and excellent gameplay, look no further.I played the original back in 1998 and i'm already a huge fan. If you are too, then you will be pleased to know that Beamdog have left alone eveything that made BG great, while making small subtle improvements to things like the User Interface and the graphics (resolution, zoom feature). Trent said it well himself, to paraphrase ""BG has not aged well, so they've make improvements to make the game to match what we all see through our rose tintend glasses"".Extra content and NPCs are all good too. The NPC's all fit very well with the lore and don't tread on the toes of the existing characters, who all still have their place. The extra areas are very in keeping with the atmosphere and in some cases the humour of the original.			"

												Now this here is some old-school RPG goodness brought back to modern systems in a quick and easy package in the Enhanced Edition. Adding widescreen support, new characters and locations, it still remains the classic adventure as it ever was.If you haven't noticed yet, this game, it's old, don't expect any shiny graphics or groundbreaking gameplay. Give it a chance though, it has tons of content, it retains its charm and the challenge that a lot of mainstream games nowadays simply do not provide. Many characters with their own alignments can be found to form wildly different parties, giving it replayability, and the multitude of sidequests and locations pretty much make it guaranteed that you won't get to see it all in one go. The plot itself is alright, but maybe that's because I played the sequel first so I was already aware of the plot twists. I strongly recommend you start with this game before moving on to BG2, if you've never touched them, you're in for a treat. Especially since you can import your BG1 character into BG2, giving it a sense of continuity. You don't get to experience the sequel differently like the Mass Effect series kind of does if you do import your character, but the stats, name, etc, do carry over.It's amongst my favorites due to the link it shares with BG2. I like BG1, but BG2 just blows it out of the water, making the original a mandatory playthrough. Get it.			"

												Go for the eyes Boo, GO FOR THE EYES!! RrraaaAAGHGHH!!!Ever dreamed of taking your typical D&D session with your friends out of the pen & paper setting to a PC screen?+ Timeless classic of the D&D universe+ Excellent character NPCs of all variety+ Charismatic companions: Minsc the Ranger (and Boo!), Jaheira, Viconia, Xzar, Sarevok…+ Game length (both games combined are well over 100 hours of gameplay)+ Immersive story+ Replayability+ Voice acting+ Late game stays true to the D&D aspect that there isn’t just one way to complete a quest+ Random Easter eggs and parodies+ Every action you make affects the game world,+ Controls were pretty straightforward, felt like a RTS with a pause button+ Can export your character to use in Baldur’s Gate II+ The (new) developers are supporting the game with patches and fixes, and they actually listen to the community- Since I can't find any cons let me here tell you something about Boo. Boo was the pet and companion of the Rashemi ranger Minsc, having joined him shortly after he sustained an injury to his head.While there was skepticism regarding the claim, Minsc insisted that Boo was, in fact, a miniature giant space hamster who was intelligent and could converse coherently with him. However, as Minsc was quite addled, it was unclear whether or not his claims were true.2d5+1/2d5★★★★★			"

												Edit: Everyone's getting very up in arms about this new 2.0 update that came along with SoD.Yes this update has made things very buggy, not good.But I'll just mention there's an option in the Beta profile settings for the game, that lets youopt back down to version 1.3. And play the game before the update. However it appears to be just as broken - Not everything but, very specific things. Good luck getting past the Gorion part early on.Pros:+ Hard, grueling, Adventerous; true to the D&D format of adventure.+ Expandable and immersive; you morph your being and will+ Atmosphere works well, you'll feel accomplished+ Incredible meta possibilites for those with a sick twisted mind (game's deep)Cons:- Below-average controls and AI issues, it'll be hard to simply open a door- Uninformative at times, you'll get hit by a trap but, it might not make sense how it didOverall: 9.0Baldur's Gate was known to be one of the single best adventure RPG's out there, and is revered by plenty who play it, it is however very daunting and scary for those with little to no experience in anything similar to it. The closest thing you'd probably ever play next to this would be something like NWN or maybe other games using the same engine like Icewind Dale or Planescape. The game is handled through dice rolls, just like D&D so if it seems like you just keep losing fights and chances because of luck, well, that might just be the factor. The controls that weren't improved and the AI-pathing issues etc. don't ultimately kill the game, it handles as well as the first versions did. This is a game for those who want to test their mettle in almost every way, and if you ever do beat the game, you can probably consider yourself to be one of the most baller people out there. Many would say NOT to get this version of the game compared to getting the older ones, but I personally don't see any fault in it. If you were gonna get the game either way, you wouldn't lose anything by getting this.(I had not tried the extra content all the way through yet, so I might continue the review if I ever do, that stuff was extra in this version so I don't fully count it as factoring into the score)			"

The developer, Beamdog, recently created the expansion DLC ""Siege of Dragonspear"", which, among other problems, includes real-world social issues like Gamergate, which obviously make no sense within the context of Faerun, in the dialogue.  Worse, when people try to point out these problems in the forums, Beamdog bans them and/or accuses them of bigotry.  Not only are they abusing the intellectual property of one of the most-loved CRPGs of all time, but they are also engaging in unethical conduct when dealing with dissatisfied customers.

												While I would love to give this game a thumbs up - The story is interesting and well-written(as far as I have been able to get, at least), it's fun to play, the dialogue by characters is entertaining(again, as far as I have gotten thus far), it has amazing roleplaying potential, and the character customization(skills, skill points -not aesthetically) is really deep-But I play this game online with a friend and the online is beyond broken. The game will crash randomly, not once, or twice in a blue moon. No, it crashes INCESSANTLY back-to-back-to-back. At this point I can't even play with my friend, as everytime he joins and I try to save the game, it crashes. Not to mention that we are playing on a LAN connection. A LAN. And still the multiplayer is horrifyingly broken.In fact, I can't even play my save game without him, as regardless of whether he is in the game or not, whenever I try to save - it crashes. It also tends to corrupt your saves, if you're trying to play multiplayer, without rhyme or reason. We also had to roll back multiple saves, losing hours of progress, because the game decided it no longer liked X number of saves. We've started up 4 new games, after hours of play, simply because we could not continue on a save game we had invested time in, as it became corrupted or the game decided it was done allowing us to play that save game. So if you're looking to play with someone, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Don't let my hours fool you, I have mutiple copies of the games physical disk.(Some of these referances may be of BG 2  and IWD 1 / 2, but while the details may differ slightly the point is the same.)Baldurs' Gate is everything a game should be. It's hard, but has a scalable difficulty so if things are too hard or too easy you can change that. However XP gained is also lowered with the difficulty so while you can make it easier, it gives you a good reason not to lower it.It's long, but can be SO much longer. By following the main story you can miss a huge portion of the game but it'd still take a lot longer to complete than just about any other game out today. If you decide to do everything then you have got a friend for life, it's very simaliar to The Elder Scrolls / Fallout series in the sense that if you want to max' it out, you REALLY have to put the work into it, but in a FAR more varied way. (Black Isle were involed with the production of Fallout 1 and 2 and to this day Fallout and The Elder Scrolls still share similarities with  The Forgotten Realms, but that's another story......)It has a very good story that unfolds based on your choices. There are so many ways to do everything, if you need a certain item try convincing the owner to part with it. With a high enough charisma you can make him think it's cursed, you could have a thief try to pick pocket him, you could buy it from him, maybe he wants to give it to you because of all the good things you have done, maybe he won't EVER give it to you because of all of the bad things you have done, you could earn it from him or just flat out kill him and take it. The story is the world itself, what is happening in it and what you will chose to do when you are given the chance.It's very well written and acted. The people who came up with the dialog covered everything, you would think trying to talk a guy out of committing sucide would have easy choices and results right? Wrong. Every option you chose could rely on many different factors, some of which can be random. You can never be sure of what will happen as a result of what you do, regardless of your intentions. You'll find yourself saving and loading everytime you are given a choice, simply succeding in a task doesn't mean you couldn't have done better. Voice acting is what they ment it to be, if you are talking to someone who is trying to be serious, you're not laughing at them. (Like you did during the intro' to Resident Evil 1 ""Stop...... Don't open.... That door!"")It treats you like an adult. It won't give you a gray marker that is on-screen 100% of the time telling you were to go, if you don't know, open your journel and find the entry that refers to your current objective (or maybe pay attention next time).It won't let you retry something that you messed up, you messed it up, next time pay attention (or just load.... It's easier).It has a lot of in-game mechanics that you are expected to learn and understand, this isn't CoD you don't just run around untill you see someone and then jam both triggers. 1 Small enemy can be infintly more deadly that 10 large ones, why? Maybe he's attacking a mage in a much lower armor class than a fighter, why isn't the fighter intervening? Maybe he got stunned by the small enemy, maybe the small enemy has a high magic resistance and can't be put down with magic so you need your fighter and you can't heal him because your healer is healing your ranger who is holding another front. It won't hold your hand and tell you you're pretty (even if you are), if you get beat it's your own fault for not prepairing properly.It's class / ability vareity is huge, you could have 4 mages all with different spells, one for summoning, one for buffing, one for AoE and one for direct attacks. 2 Rangers can work differently from each other, one could be a make-shift fighter holding a choke point while another attacks from range or sneaks past. You can change party formations, give individual orders to you party members and pause / unpause at any time (apart from during cut-scenes) so if you find yourself up against some tough enemies (I'm thinking of the Yuan-Ti invasion of Kuldahar in IWD 2) you can pause and look closely at your options.Will you take out the archers raining heavy damage on your mage(s) from range? Will you focus on the infantry crashing into your tank(s)? What about thier mage behind the front lines casting AoE on you? Can you healer(s) keep your tank(s) alive? Should you retreat? You'll spend more time looking at paused battlefields than fighting on them, I know that might not sound like a good thing but when 1 bad guy can kill you and you kill 30+ because you assesed the complex situation properly....... That makes you feel pretty cool..... /Epic Face.As if that weren't enough, they have updated it on Steam! Now with new charecters, including the expansion, a new ""adventure"" presummable meaning a new area that (like all other areas) has many ""inner-areas"". Improved multiplayer support for cross-platform connectivity, over (and I quote) ""400 improvements to the original game"". It now has a tutorial mode, support for high resolution widescreen displays and even new charecter voice options.There is simply too much to say and all of it is good. If you are going to buy it I will say this, graphics don't make a game, gameplay does. If you need good graphics to enjoy a game this is (your loss) not the game for you.			"

												I like this game so much I still have my original CD's, I also have the Infinity Engine collectors edition, with all of the IE games, I bought the enhanced edition via GoG, and then when SoD was released I bought it via Steam as well, with the intent of playing through for the umpteenth time, and then buying and playing SoD.Don't do it.  Don't buy the new 2.0 ""enhanced"" edition.  It is even uglier than the original version, multiple parts of the game that worked fine are now broken, and even worse you can't uninstall the absolutely terrible 2.0 patch and go back to the way it was.  I'm seriously mad, and may be looking for a refund, unless Beamdog comes out and says they are working to allow us to opt to play with the terrible 2.0 update or not.If Beamdog will reverse all the changes they made with 2.0, or at least allow us to back to the previous patch, then EE Baldur's Gate was a very good game, and yes, it was enhanced.  Now it isn't, unless ""enhanced"" suddenly means broken, ugly, and worse than before.			"

												The new update has completely removed Mac OS capability on versions older than 10.8.2. The game previously supported versions 10.6.8 and newer.  When launching the game on a version older than 10.8.2 a prompt will say that Baldur's gate no longer supports versions older than 10.8.2 and will not launch. Now the only way to run Baldur's gate on these previously supported versions of Mac OS is to pirate a vanilla version of the game, or run the windows version in Wine.As of April 8th, 2016 the store page still lists 10.6.8 as the minimum Mac OS requirement.-June 13th, 2016 the store still lists 10.6.8 as the minimum Mac OS requirement.

												“If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade. If people don’t like that, then too bad.”Do not support this company, by Bhaal I sincerely hope they do not get enough cash to make an official sequel to this once incredible franchise, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥izing it even further than they have already with their pathetic and uninspired writing.""Was actually banned from their forum, permanently, for posting a link to tweet in which one of their devs, also a forum moderator, was basically begging Jezebel and Anita for ""protection"".

												Alongside the original Fallout, Baldur's Gate to me represents the first true modern cRPG, and one of the first RPGs to me that made its blend of storytelling and gameplay seem almost effortless.The game takes place in the Forgotten Realms along the Sword Coast. You're open to make any sort of character you want to go on your adventure. From an honest noble Paladin, to a deceitful Assassin. What is great about this is how it meshes perfectly with the storytelling. Most of Baldur's Gate is spent wandering and doing quests, and there isn't really an overarching ""save the world"" plot to keep you grounded. There's a very colorful cast of characters who can join your party too. From a cleric frozen in stone, to an evil greedy mage, to an overly enthusiastic Ranger who talks to a hamster. More than any other game, Baldur's Gate really captures the feeling of playing D&D near perfectly. I have never played an RPG that captures the essance of being ""sublime"" more than this game.This would be all well and good on it's own, but Baldur's Gate's gameplay was done very well too. Combat is very brutal and punishing, especially at the start of the game. It runs on a very finely adapted variant of the AD&D system, so a lot of very old RPG conventions are present. Stuff like races are restricted to specific classes and mages are restricted to a single spell per day at level 1. What's more is that the classes aren't balanced against each other like in a modern day RPG, so the strategy to the game comes from building a balanced party of adventures. This is all great stuff and it makes the game extremely replayable.Adding to that Baldur's Gate is essentially a trilogy of games. Starting with Baldur's Gate, continuing with Baldur's Gate 2 and ending with it's expansion Throne of Bhaal. All featuring much of the same cast of characters. So you get the most out of the experience by playing through all three. Unfortunately the original has been removed off GOG. I recommend for this version to pick up a mod called BG1 NPC project since it adds things like party banter and romances.			"

												This is review commendary on Dragonspear expansion, made by person with light sensitive eyes.Original baldursgate saga, specificly shadows of amn was and is my all time favorite rpg series.Everything was so well thought out the music, ui, combot, text, everything was so well designed you could play the game hours and hours to an end without any problems at all, it was overally really pleasant journey.So when they made enchanted editions for modern machines I were happy, I could play my favorite game once more without extensive fine tuning I had to do on originals.And it was fun, for while.Then came siege on dragonspear.They changed the well thought ui coloring and theme of old baldursgate to dark obsidian hue "" volcanic"" style, that looks good in paper.But in game it's health hazard.The black ui causes all color contrasts to be so strong, you will literally get sick  and your eyes start hurting if you play the game for longer than few minutes.That's right, they made coloring so horrible, it causes me to get physical pain in my eyes.I want to play the expansion but I can't, it just hurts me.If you want to get bg 1& 2 ee, don't get Siege on Dragonspear.It  makes the game unplayable for people with even slight eye sensitivities.

												This used to be one of the greatest RPGs of all time, but the new developer Beamdog has been a terrible steward of this iconic franchise. Beamdog has made numerous unnecessary updates to the user interface and has introduced so many new bugs that the game is almost unplayable. I bought the Steam copy of this game for a nostalgic RPG we had played almost two decades ago. Instead we have struggled through numerous crashes, terrible input lag, UI bugs, items duplicating and disappearing among other issues. There are more patches coming out, but so far they have done nothing to alleviate the major issues we've encountered. Reviewing the bug report forums it seems most of these bugs are well known and have persisted for a long time.In it's current state the game is no longer worth buying from Steam. Do yourself a favor and find a copy of the game that is prior to version 2.0.			"

												I quite liked the original that came in the bulky 5 CD format. With EE I can play the game the way it was meant to exist if technology was more advanced in 1998 and if the team had a few more hours to polish it.Even though the improvements are small the game feels very different in my experience (for the better). Transparent UI makes it so much less intrusive. The ability to zoom makes it possible for me to run the game in a widescreen resolution without everything being too small. Plus, I quite like to reduce zoom outdoors and increase it in dungeons. I never knew how much I missed this before I had the chance to try it.Because they implemented several convenience changes I am able to play this game without installing any convenience tweaks. For example, the standard 40 ammo stack was a bit of an annoyance for me, so I always installed tweaks just to increase stacking if nothing else. Because EE stacks up to 80 that's enough for me and I can just play the game as it is.My biggest gripe with BG was always that I had to spend what seemed like forever just installing and configuring it (TuTu this, TuTu that, mod, tweak, blah blah). Finally I can just install it, increase FPS in options to 40 (to speed up walking) and PLAY. I'm sure that fundamentalists will argue that EE is the devil because you can get the same or better experience by taking BG1 and run it using BG2's engine with widescreen mods etc. But in my opinion the result is not as polished as EE and there is just SO much painful hassle that way.I approve of this release!P.S. (spoilers below!)I am also very happy that they included new NPC's - even though the original had a lot of them to begin with. I am one of those individuals who think that the 'canon' party sucks (i.e. that they are incredibly annoying). I love Imoen, but I cannot stand Minsc (calling him a degenerate idiot would be a compliment), Jaheira (Look! It's Miss Personality herself!) or Khalid (he's just a dog without testicles that Jaheira keeps on a leash). Dynaheir I could care less about. The problem is that these people come in pairs, so there go 4 of your 5 slots. Having three new characters in EE makes it easier to fill them with people that do not annoy you.			"

												Baldur's Gate is one of the greatest games of all time. Unfortunately, nothing Beamdog included in the Enhanced Edition really added anything meaningful to the game. They made a number of convenience changes, such as raising the ammunition and gem stack limit, but such features and many more were already made available for the original game by the wonderful modding community that came first. Many mods that made wonderful improvements on the game (such as the ability to hide the ridiculous character helmets) are unavailable with this version.The Enhanced Edition seems to improve pathing a bit, but if you play on a higher-than-base framerate like I do, it doesn't matter too much.The writing for the new companions is weak- I didn't spend much time with them because their voices and character portraits didn't match the aesthetic of the original characters closely enough.The new replacement cinematics - which mostly consist of a single image and the original background music - are some of the worst aspects of this version. I understand they were working with a budget, but they really should have included the option to turn them off and have the original experience. Some of them straight-up remove story from the game: the old Nashkel cinematic did an excellent job of tipping you off to what was going on the town, and the new one is just a uninformative still of one of the town's structures.Rather than adding new companions, I would have preferred they added more to the originals: one of the big improvements in BG2 is that the companions are all really fleshed out and have their own personal quests. I would have liked to see Beamdog take more queues from the people who already made a better game out of the original. Beamdog made a decent effort, but if you want to play the best version of Baldur's Gate, this isn't it. The best version of Baldur's Gate is still the original title with a handful of mods. I've looked over the list of fixes, and I'd take all those bugs and inconsistencies back if I could have the original cinematics and UI again. Since I can only rate this game on the basis of the changes the developer made, I can't recommend it.			"

												Baldur's Gate is a RPG that was originally released back in 1998. Since then it has inspired a tidal wave of RPG games and reinkindled a belived to be dead genre. So it was just a matter of time before this classic game got an overhaul which resulted in Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.The game tells a rather intriguing story about two rivaling nations that are on the brink of war. But not all is what it seems to be and the true reasons behind the potential outbreak of war lie hidden in a double and triple layered web of treason and lust for power. In addition to that the player is also concered with his own heritage and what this could have to do with the events that are laid out in the game. Before starting the game, the player has to create his character, which will be of course, the main character of the game. In addition to the main character the player can control a group of up to six characters (including the main character) which can be recruited over the course of the game.  There are quite a lot of companions available to recruit for your party which differ a lot in terms of personality. This is a key factor the game, because it adss a lot of replayablity to it. Also this allows you to play the game in different ways. You can be the shining hero, that is beloved by the inhabitans of the Sword Coast, or you can be the dark villain that only thrives to satiate his own lust for conquest. Due to the alignment system in Dungeons & Dragons (the pen & paper system which Baldur's gate is based upon), you will find good and evil companions which support the correspondet playstyle. So it would be a bad idea to recruid only evil characters and then play the shining hero because there is a possibilty that those companions would leave the party if your reputation which the inhabitants of the Sword Coast gets to good. The same thing goes for recruiting only good aligned characters and accomplishing evil deeds.The gameplay itself is based upon a pausable real time combat system. So your orders to your party members will be executed in real time and you can pause and any time to get a overview of whats going on. Does someone need a heal? Can you stun a certain enemy? Which opponent should you attack next? Should you focus your attacks on one enemey or split up to keep certain enemies occupied? The Combat system evolvers a lot around tactical choices, which makes it fun and challenging. While melee and ranged combat is pretty straight foward and self explanatory, some players might find the spell system weird, because you have no casting resource such as mana or other form of energy. Instead you have a spellbook with a limited number of spells per page that you can write into your spellbook. Now you can choose a few spells that you would like to memorize. Spells get memorized after you rest at an inn or via the rest function in the wilderness. You can only use spells that you have memorized. There are some exceptions to this, for instance the sorcerer class does not need to memorize spells. So the player to equip his mages with a good mixture of utility and damage spells in order to maximize their potential. Beside the main story there are a lot of side quests that reach from the simple ""go there, bring me back this"" to rather complex and story rich side quests. The game does no handholding with quests. You sometimes get a vague direction (or none at all) where to go for a certain quest. But in general you have to explore the areas that you go to. Because often you will stumble upon your quests targets in the wilderness. Talking about side quests Beamdog added 3 new companions to the game and each of them brings a new quest with them.Also you have to read a lot. There is a lot of text in this game. And you have to read carefully, otherwise you might lose your direction. There are nor questmarkers or markings on the map. The developers from Beamdog made a few changes to the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset that the game uses. Also they introcued some class and race options which were only available in the original Baldur's Gate 2. But in general these are good changes because they add some more variety to the game.The not so good changes are some to the UI. I Personally liked the old quest journal a bit more than the new one. And they changed the character sprites a lot. The old ones looked better. Gladfully this can turned off in the options menu.All in all the Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a worthy overhaul, it runs smoothly on new systems and still works fine. Sure it is not a remake. But it brings a classic game to modern era pc gaming and despite the changes that are not liked by everyone, the game itself is still fun and intruiging ans the original from 1998. So I totally reccommend this game for anyone who is interested in old-school party based RPGs. "

												I want more than anything to love this game as I have all the others. However, I cannot excuse the complete laziness of the writing.   For example *spoiler* when you go through the underground passage to the end and find Hephernaan, he retreats from the battle and you find an imprisoned Daeros Dragonspear. After speaking with Daeros you learn of Hephernaan's plan to use your Bhaalspawn blood to open a gate to hell for nepharious purposes all the while manipulating Caelar.   Caelar calls for a parley and demands you surrender yourself and instead of telling your ally's the truth of their ploy, all you can do as options for dialogue is ""duhhhh I have no clue what they could POSSIBLY want with me"". Something along the lines of this anyway.   Absolutely lazy writing and it makes me desire for those writers to be strung up from a tree by their fingers for defiling this games' amazing legacy with their incompetant witlessness.			"

												First things first: take a look at my playtime. Number of times the game crashed in over 188h? ZERO.Baldur's Gate is an old favourite for its great story, engaging mechanics and fun gameplay. The enhanced edition isn't really that different from the original for someone that only played it out of the box, like me. If anything, it's improved, since it now runs smoothly (I remember making coffee while I waited for the city of Bauldur's Gate to load).Don't buy into the haters' speech. If you're new to the game, get it. It's awesome and has so much variety to its locations and monsters, that it feels better than a lot of more recent games (just remember, it's based on AD&D, so the rules are sometimes strange for people raised playing 4th or 5th edition DnD). If, like me, you played it a long time ago and would like to replay it for nostalgia's sake (and also because it's awesome), go right ahead and remember you can mod the hell out of this game if you feel something's missing.

												Dear Beamdog,I appreciate how you brought back a classic game and made it so that I could play it on my modern system.  I do not appreciate how you changed my game that I purchased, and also, a game that is my favorite RPG ever.   I want to play my original game the way Black Isle intended.  Not a game that you think I need to play. Changing my characters to look cartoony is so off putting that I can't play the game.  If I was in charge, I'd fire your art department.			"

												Multiplayer is a horrible buggy mess!Ever since they released the Seige of Dragonspear expansion, it's been one awful bug-fest after another.I don't even own that particular expansion, and it's completely crippled multiplayer.At first we were completely unable to host a game without the use of third party software.  After a week, they finally patched it, but now the save system is broke.   Apparently if you set your party AI to ""None"" the saves stop working and crash your game.  We've lost several save files to this bug.I simply cannot recommend this game in its current state.  It makes me want to reinstall my old 5 Disc set.  The one from 18 years ago works perfectly fine, whereas this one is nothing but frustration.			"

												I was an invincible demi-god, and then I met petrification.  PROS:+Timeless classic of the D&D universe+Excellent character NPCs of all variety+Game length was not too long or too short+Immersive story+Voice acting was pretty good+Late game stays true to the D&D aspect that there isn’t just one way to complete a quest+Random Easter eggs and parodies+Controls were pretty straightforward, felt like a RTS with a pause button+Can export your character to use in Baldur’s Gate IICONS:-AI was incredibly derpy at times; especially pathing and combat-Some available party members would just up and leave despite actively working on their personal quest line. Be wary of who you deck out in good gear.-Some personal quests won’t complete if certain party members die during the last part of their quest line.-Some spells are unclear if they hurt your party or not.  If it doesn’t specify ENEMIES, it more than likely will affect everybody.-Story was a bit slow up front, but stick with it.			"

												Love the original game and the enhanced edition.  This has brought back many memories of my D&D groups and the times we had slinging the dice around. What I have to give a negative review for is the Siege of Dragonspear Expansion. Those of us who love the game were looking forward to more of the same. What we received was hack writing and forced SJW themes that I do not want in my video games. Are there no longer game publishers who offer what their fans want or do they all have to cater to PC thinking? I can understand this company has the rights to produce what they want but shouldn't they at least be honest with the community and tell us they are changing the themes of the game/character backgrounds/etc?I played admittedly very little of the expansion before disappointment set in.....also STEAM will not refund my money even though I played less than 30 minutes of the expansion. They count the time you spend playing the main game the same as time spent playing the expansion. So if you were like me and wanted to start a new party to run though BGEE before the expansion understand you will not be eligible for a refund if you do not like the expansion.  "

												This is my first review so bear with me. It's Baldur's Gate 1 without the annoying UI and with some extra content.  If you like Baldur's Gate and aren't familiar with modding then this game is for you. But if you never played Baldur's Gate then allow me to go over some of the details.Story- It's is rather interesting if you do not mind reading a lot. Altough the start is rather slow, once you get midway into the game it begins to pick up a lot.Gameplay- Difficult, but once you understand the basics then it can be rather fun. However the combat is not for everyone, it's very tactical and can be slow in the start.Charcters- Other than the extra characters added in by Beamdog, the orginal charcters have little personality. The extras have conversations with you and offer extra areas and items. They serve their purpose as party members.Overall, if you are willing to surive the lower levels and keep going forward then this game is for you. If you lack patience and dislike older games then just forget about it. There is a huge learning curve and unless you are willing to learn then I would advise against purchasing this game.I personally love this game and love Baldur's Gate 2 even more. If I had to give the game a numerical value it would be 85/100. Beamdog did a good job with optimization and a lot more accessable to the public than it used to be.			"

												This review will also be discussing Siege of Dragonspear as wellBaldur's Gate is a game that when it came out, was revolutionary for it's time. I actually owned (and still have) the orignal five disk game that came out back in 1998. Put out by Black Isle (under the developmental eye of the three original founders of Bioware), it is a game that takes place set in the Forgotten Realms. In this game, you're basically playing Dungeons and Dragons, but for those of you out there that are familiar with nothing older than 3rd Edition, you may find the mechanics for the classes a bit odd. Baldur's Gate uses the old AD&D 2nd Edition rules set and it is still quick to pick up.Character generation is rather straightforward, allowing you to roll and re-roll your stats as much as you'd like until you're happy with them. Compared to the original, the Enhanced Edition shows you the total point number that your stats total to. This is helpful when trying to shoot for a total number. You are able to store a rolled set that you like, but can only store one set at a time. Regarding character creation, you have a variety of races to pick from, but only humans can be any class. The trade-off to this is that non-human races can go above an 18 during character creation, and in AD&D, that is rather huge, since unlike later versions of D&D, your stats will not improve. Beamdog brought the kits from Shadows of Amn (the sequel) to the base game, allowing you to get a feel for the kit right away. This is something I wish the original game had when it was released. They also added a couple of new ones from 3rd Edition, such as the Shadowdancer for Rogues and the Dwarven Defender for dwarf Fighters. Due to the nature of the game engine, there is an experience cap for classes, which is 169,000 XP (most classes will hit level 8, wizards will hit 9, and rogues will hit 10).The story is rather intriguing, and keeps you wondering what is going on in true, classic D&D style right up until the 5th chapter, when you finally see the whole picture. Then it becomes a “race against the clock” (not literally) to save the day. Unlike it's sequel, Baldur's Gate assumes by default that you are playing the hero, or at least an anti-hero (not a villain). You can be evil, but if you become too evil, you won't be able to ever complete the game, since you won't be allowed to enter cities (the guards will literally come, tell you there's no entry for you, and attack you). There is also two optional missions, thanks to the game's original expansion – Tales of the Sword Coast – Durlag's Tower and Balduran's Isle. It also added a new area called Ulgoth's Beard, a small village with some new items for sale and some missions. These have been included in the base game from Beamdog. Durlag's Tower is a classic dungeon crawl, with deathtraps and monsters, as well as rewards and a climatic battle at the end of the quest line. Balduran's Isle is a tale that has you follow the final voyage of the great hero Balduran (whom the city Baldur's Gate is named after). While the tower is difficult, it is still much more enjoyable than Balduran's Isle is. This was one area I felt that Black Isle fell short on, and quickly jumps up in difficulty.Speaking of difficulty, Beamdog has added an option for “Story Mode”, for those that just want to play through the story. Think of it as “super easy mode”, where you can't die, and nothing harmful can affect you. While I think this is not a bad idea for those that are not fond of the old school AD&D rules, I didn't like using it. I experimented with it a little, and never went back after trying it. The game has been mostly untouched, which is smart by Beamdog – it has just been tweaked, bringing back a lot of things they added in Shadows of Amn. As for the new NPCs that have been added, I have already heard from many how they feel “forced”. But my only argument against this is this – this game is nearly 20 years old. How else are new characters supposed to feel like without feeling like they're mod NPCs? I think they are a nice addition, each with a voice actor that did a great job on them (Rasaad is actually voiced by Mark Meer – Male Shepard from Mass Effect).Siege of Dragonspear was the massively new expansion put out by Beamdog for this game. They managed to bring back just about everyone from the first game that had a character in it, such as Jennifer Hale, Jim Cummings, and Melissa Disney. The expansion is very well done! While at times, it felt a bit rushed in sections (going through a underground cavern to Dragonspear Castle), the expansion is still very well made, and does an excellent job covering the massive gap between Baldur's Gate and Shadows of Amn. Those that played Shadows of Amn back in the day will easily recognize who the hooded man is. Siege of Dragonspear increases the XP cap, letting you get a little higher (I believe I ended at level 10 or 11 with my mage). This is handy because you're that much higher when porting over your character to Shadows of Amn.While I'm sure there are reasons for all the poor reviews by “the old guard” about Siege of Dragonspear, they do not speak for all of us. I only speak for me, and being part of that “old guard”, I absolutely loved this expansion, and consider it to be part of the entire game experience now. While I was a bit sad at who they brought over from the first game (Safana? Garric? REALLY?) they still managed to bring over a few fan favorites. Hats off to Beamdog for Glint, the gnome cleric/rogue; a very well written character, and a likable personality. He slid right into the slot of both cleric and rogue in my good party, and part of me wishes Beamdog would have added him into the base game. M'Khiin (goblin shaman) is a neat idea and something I actually thought was creative to do for this series. There's also an optional battle pit called the Black Pits (but I have not experimented with that much, so forgive me if I don't feel knowledgeable enough to discuss it in this review). If you are looking for a D&D game that has a great story and good characters, I do recommend checking it out.			"

												As others have posted before me, there have been two major patches to the game recently. The first claims to have over 300 ""improvements"" to the game such as: you now have to confirm you want to travel somewhere instead of just clicking the zone, you have to confirm you want to memorize a spell, rather than just clicking on the spell. The inventory flashes an obnoxious stat change box with EVERYTHING a character can use, even potions.  The graphics got a hit of cartoonishness as they added a way to smooth the outlines (luckily you can turn it off and it looks more like the original format.) There is a ""journal updated"" box that now appears when you do a quest objective. This can be especially annoying when you're turning in a lot of items in. A good example: I just killed the Tanar'ri up near Baldur's Gate itself, I went back down to Nashkell because I had around a dozen winter wolf pelts to turn in to the merchant there; the journal updated for every single turn in.I came back to the game after a while because I had given up on the demon fight originally, but after some time I was ready for it again. Coming back to all this frivilous BS is rather angering. I don't mind bug fixes, as long as they improve the game, but breaking the wheel while its functioning just fine is a waste of the programmers' time and talent. Honestly, until they enable a way to revert back to the original format, I refuse to play this game anymore. Good job Beamdog, you screwed up a perfectly good game, I imagine in the name of hubris.

												I'll be writing this review mainly directed to people who don't really know much about Dungeons & Dragons or old-school cRPG's.One of the first games to have branching story paths that actually worked and meant something. Lots of consequence, lots of choices, lots of endings. The story of the game is very well written and also interesting. If you're willing to read up on the background information a little to get a grasp of what the D&D world is like, particuarly this one, then you'll understand the games story better. Even if you don't read any background information you'll still pick up on it as you play, and you'll still be able to enjoy it.The first few hours of the game are a little slow and sort of random. During these few hours (about 2-3 hours or so), lots of random things will be thrown at you just to let you practice on how the game works. You'll meet random companions, random attacks, and have some pretty pointless but rewarding side quests. Like I said, these are just to warm you up on the rest of the game.One of the main points of the game is maintaining a party. You'll meet many companions along your adventure which you can either allow into your party or not. You must watch each players health, weapons, stats, and so on. It sounds complicated when you first read about it, but it's pretty easy once you get used to it. Your companions will get tired, get wounded or their weapons will break. You have to watch out for all of these things and help them out as much as you can. Fortunately for people who have a hard time making characters, you will only have to make your own character (which is the leader of the party) as all other companions will have their own stats and abilities. With that being said, you must know how to use and level up their stats and abilities.The combat can be a bit tricky at first, especially once your party gets pretty large. You are able to pause the game, point out each individual party member who to attack, then unpause. Having your whole party attack the same enemy at once works on lower level enemies, but as you start to face larger groups of monster and/or more challenging enemies, you have to use strategy to determine how not to get your party instantly killed.The character creation is quite big for this game. You can chose between a few races, pick between many classes which have their own sub-classes (Such has Cleric/Ranger or Cleric/Thief, etc.) and have quite a bit of stats to level up. You won't be leveling up as easily or quickly as many of todays RPGs. I didn't upgrade my main character until about 2 hours into the game while doing a bunch of side-quests and killing lots of enemies. Leveling up is meant to feel rewarding and having an actual impact when adding points to stats and gaining new abilites.The world is nicely drawn in this game too. The graphics on the Enhanced Version doesn't look much better than when I played this game years ago, but at least it's in widescreen.Exploring the world is also a huge point in this game. The world isn't all one seamless level, but instead it's broken up into large sections which usually have other sections within them, such as caves and castles. Most of the places you're allowed to freely enter, but others are restricted.I guess there's also multiplayer, but I guess i'm the only one in my friends list that owns this game haha.Overall, I think this game is very good, and the Enchanced Edition brings some changes that will ease in newcomers to the classing cRPG genre. This is considered by many to be one of the best RPG games to date, as well as the other D&D cRPG's that came out around the same time. I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPGs and are willing to overcome a slight learning curve if they haven't played a classic cRPG such as this before.			"

Pretty much everything else you'd want in an RPG is thereDefinite reccomend for all RPG fans			"

												I loved the original B♥♥♥♥nd bought BG1:EE to experience the first game, and while it worked about a year ago when I first installed it, now the game no longer functions for me. I imagine that--like other players--the latest update ruined my ability to play the game I paid for. Even after working with tech support, the best I could do was to get the game to turn on, at which point it would be so slow and glitchy I couldn't even move past the first screen. Tech support has been unable to fix this for me yet, and their only advice was to wait for a revised patch. My machine can handle Skyrim, AC4, Far Cry 3 and other big games just fine, but apparently this remake of an ancient RPG kills my computer's ability to handle things.Until they fix the bugs that make BG:EE unplayable, I cannot recommend it.

Perhaps you manage to play for a time but we cannot save, everytime we try the game crashes, and than a day you discover the that save does not work anymore or that in a map you cannot enter some building because the game crashes. Than you load the same save in single palyer mode, that you can do but not the other way around, and discover that in single player it works fine. So if you want to play single try it, but it have bugs anyway. If want it for the multiplayer forget it. This is crap.			"

The developers have frequently and actively insulted ""Gamers"" as a whole through their terribly unprofessional and immature responses to the complaints about this, going so far as to label anyone who disagrees with them as ""Gamergaters""(portraying that as clear and complete evidence of their utter subhumanity and evil nature) or ""mysoginists"" and so forth.If I could get a refund, I would. Certainly removing it from my steam library either way.Oh, and the new DLC is going to be forcibly packaged into the game soon on multiple distribution packages, so don't even buy the base game or support Beamdog in any way, these developers are not friends of the gaming community.

												Bugs. This is Baldur's Gate: Bug Edition.Some of these bugs are: Corrupted Saves. Pretty much every save game is corrupted. eg. the difficulty see-sawing up and down when you reload a game. Custom Portraits not working properly. Some portraits are working, some aren't. No idea why. The UI is just plain bad. A.I. is incomprehensible. The maps have a black border? when you near the side of the town map instead of the edge of the map being at the edge of your monitor. Multiplayer doesn't work.Enhanced edition? This enhanced edition is indescribably bad. So bad that it can be used as a stunning example of how to take a great concept and totally and utterly destroy it.Stay well away from this.			"

												The game is trash, Beamdog has outed themselves as SJWs who hate white males. The ""expansion"" is not only a buggy mess that corrupts saves, but the update to BG1EE and BG2EE has also introduced many game and save breaking bugs into the other games. This is how a company goes bankrupt, as they should. They wanted to cash in on the BG name, preach to the white men who might play it, and cash in on the fleeting SJW crowd. Not a good business model. You just exchanged your main audience for a group that might (MIGHT) buy one of your games. GOOD JOB #DERP			"

												Beamdog managed to completely ruin the best cRPG ever made with their new expansion full of PC and SJ content. Ignoring the D&D ambientation and immersion, they just added a bunch of dialogues and changes to the original characters personalities to force feminism and other such ideologies down the player's throat. Do not support this kind of thing, don't even buy the base game and, if you already did, ask for a refund if you still can.On their words:“If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade. If people don’t like that, then too bad.” (http://kotaku.com/the-struggle-to-bring-back-baldur-s-gate-after-17-years-1768303595)So they think they can just do whatever they want, grotesquely modify characters that had unique personalities and ""If people don't like that, then too bad"". On top of all, it's badly written:http://techraptor.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Baldurs-Gate-Dragonspear-Mizhena.jpgAnd you can't even give a negative response like the freedom of the original game would allow. Beamdog, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and its new expansion are the perfect example of why masterpieces are better left crystallized on the past for contemplation only.			"

Steam should also ""retire"" games that do not work any more, or test the compatibility, and remove the OS as being supported.

There are any number of ways to play the campaign, solo, or with a party of up to six of probably fifty distinctly different character builds.

												What is baldur's gate? One of the best story driven role playing games i've ever experienced on the pc platform. I own the original 5cd retail version from the original black isle/interplay/bioware with the separate tales of the sword coast expansion cd. One of the most respected forgotten realms games ever made by bioware.So, you want to know why i rate THIS negative?Because these arrogant houlier than thou♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with a SJW complex think they are better than the *whole gaming community* just for making an amateurish fanfic ( with lots of bugs/glitches ) that sports a clear b a s t a r d i z a t i o n of beloved characters from the original story just to forcibly shove down their politically correct bs in gamers throats. And also because i can't even play the god damned game now with the broken legacy of bhaal mode difficulty reverting issues.I mean, the damned thing messes up creature stats after reloading different areas.The game has a plethora of new issues after the 2.0 update and Beamdog's choice for the UI design was poor.You want something positive? FIX THE *RELEVANT* GAME ISSUES FASTWhy should i praise you for releasing broken products or breaking your actual working releases  time and again?I may not care about the multiplayer as much as others but that is also not working correctly  as many have already pointed out.

												The developer, Beamdog, unfortunately is a company who's milking legacy titles. They are not able to make their games so they are trying to sell some extra copies of these old gems like Baldur's Gate by adding expansions. Yes, maybe couple of hundred people will buy the game because it's 'bumped' by the recent update, but the forced expansion made the entire legacy player community upset. And Beamdoggie is so much disconnected with reality that they're posting self-celebrating announcements describing how epicly they destroyed the game while the forums are flowing with outrage even though they're trying to lock threads around the clock.We have one of those ""bad developers"" here guys, all the symptoms are there. Lack of communication, greed, heavily moderated forums, forced and sudden updates etc. Stay away from this title until the last expansion is made optional.  Note for Beamdoggie: Go make your own games.			"

You should be ashamed of yourselves for what you have done to such a work of art which was this game. What a crying shame. Thinking of buying this hot mess? Don't. Go buy Pillars of Eternity.

												Baldur's Gate is one of the best RPG experiences created to this day. Originally released in 1998, BioWare struck gold with this great D&D-licensed RPG. Now, over a decade later, Overhaul Games/Beamdog have appropriately overhauled the game in this Enhanced Edition, but is it worth getting? Definitely! The massive scale of the game, the sheer amount of quests with excellent dialogue and the huge sense of freedom makes this a fantastic RPG experience to this very day. The Enhanced Edition comes with the original, the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion and offers even more content with the addition of three new companions, each of which offer an excellent experience, in addition to the new ""The Black Pits"" campaign which focused on arena-style combat. The Enhanced Edition additionally contains all the improvements that Baldur's Gate 2 had, meaning you can now play every single race/kit that BG2 contained plus the Enhanced Edition adds a bunch of new options and possibilities. But the game is old and the Enhanced Edition does little to change this fact. Although there have been visual improvements, most notably a better user interface, it still looks like an incredibly old game and as the Enhanced Edition comes with a shocking lack of options this becomes a problem. Furthermore, the game does no effort or attempt to guide you. Especially fans of modern RPGs will run into this quickly, as the game is not even remotely user friendly. You will find no quest waypoints and very little in the way of statistic or spell explanations, meaning you will have to have patience learning and understanding the obviously outdated mechanics. If however you can deal with these issues, then Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is definitely worth getting. If you've played these games to death in the past, and have dabbled in the numerous mods at the time, then this may not be for you though the new content might just offer you enough. It is a much more convenient game with some great additions that makes playing this fantastic classic an amazing experience any RPG fan should play. Full review (Includes BG2: Enhanced Edition):

												Bladur's Gate II was one of the first RPG games I ever played. Introduced to it around 2004, probably no older than 12 or 13, picked up a battered copy along with Throne of Bhall in some bargin bin for old PC games. Remains one of my favourite gaming experinces ever. Until now, I have never actually played the first game in the series. I'm writing this review as someone who never played the non-Enchanced Edition version of this game, I can't say for sure what has been ""enchanced"", nor is it clear to me which quests/areas are from the original base game, and which are from the add-on pack (Tales of Sword Coast). I have now beaten the game from start to finish with my Cavalier in about ~40 hours, completed most of the sidequests. Single player only. Didn't find the Black Pits mode appealing enough to try beyond a few minutes.Longer version: Baldur's Gate is a party-based RPG, you create your own character (race, class, alignment, etc) and recruit up to five other followers. The rules are based off the AD&D 2nd Edition, which compared to later editions used in games like Neverwinter Nights or Icewind Dale II, is quite restrictive (non-human races are much more limited to what classes they can pick, and less freedom in multi or dual classing) and perhaps not as intuitive. Combat is real-time with pause, you can leave your party whacking away at low level mobs to clear them faster, or pause the game to issue orders and manage combat for the harder fights. 13 base classes to pick from, Paladins, Fighters, Mages, Clerics, etc. All but a few will offer you different ""spins"" to try out, these are called ""Class Kits"". For example, Bards have more melee orientated counterparts called Blades and Skalds. Blades sacrifices pickpocketing, lore and songs for greater proficiency in two-weapon fighting styles. Skalds improve their companions ability to hit with their singing, but at the expense of pickpocketing.  The main plot itself is extremely easy to follow: for a RPG there are relatively few characters central to the plot, you are given clear instructions on where to go next, and the storyline generally follows itself quite logically. I have been playing this game inbetween other games, and have taken breaks from playing it. I never felt lost or had to reorientate myself when coming back to the game, unlike most other RPGs. The sidequests, of which there are many, do however require you to pay attention to dialogue, clues, and journal entries. Keeping information on paper, pins on maps or going through your quest log really does help. The lack of handholding is quite refreshing, particularly true with the sidequests in the city of Baldur's Gate itself, many of them requires actually exploring the city and keeping notes on the many taverns and houses with important NPCs. Clues can also be found by talking to NPCs, drinking in pubs, and breaking in on some seemingly unimportant houses. Such as the time I murdered a priestess for an evil sea Goddess, simply because she♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off with her haughty talk, finding that she was carrying the body of a dead child on her. Spent a good hour finding the dead kid's parents. Plenty of quests can be discovered in many ways, unique objects you find in the game you won't realise the importance until much later.Worth noting for new players is that most non-magical metal weapons will break often. This is due to the iron crisis that you have to investigate. It makes sense for melee characters to invest and drop a proficiency point into weapons like clubs or staves, until you finally get your mitts on a decent +1 weapon. Your endgame character level should be around 7 or 8, you will spend an lot of time in the lower character levels. Fighting early on, especially if you choose weapons your character isn't proficiencent in, will involve both you and your enemies just facing off each other and missing nearly every attack. Combat gets more exciting around level 3 onwards, when spellcasters have access to more spells, and your attacks will connect with your enemies more.One thing I absolutely loved about BGII, which is unfortunatly an little lacking here, is the variety of areas you can visit. Many of the areas in this game are variations of outdoor woodlands - some with hills, some with mountains, some with a coast, but most of are generally similar. There are also many taverns, inns and houses which seem the same and most don't serve a purpose in the plot or any sidemissions. But, on the otherhand, they do add a sense of scale and size to the game, an actual sense of adventure. And it does feel good to accidentally stumble onto an intresting sidequest or story: I had my rogue unlock a generic looking house by the docks in the city, only to find it's occupied by a sea-nymph who escaped from the sea, captured by a fisherman who took her to his home, she seduced and murdered her capturers, and attempted to do the same to me. There are many, many characters that can join you in this game. Unlike in more modern RPGs, lots of them will leave the game for good if you reject their offer to join. I will have to say, that compared to BGII, and with Bioware's games since then, this is to me Baldur's Gate biggest weakness lies. With that many companions, it does feel like they're spread very thin. There isn't an lot of intercompany banter, you will hear the same lines over and over, and there is generally very little interaction with them. I had Imoen in my party almost all the way through, I don't recall any more new lines after her consolation for Gorion's death at the start. I don't recall Xzar and Montaron having more to say after you solved the issue of the poor quality iron from the Nashkel mines. I understand the reason for this may be perhaps due how dangerous the world is, a follower can die and you may not be able to resurrect them. That said, I still prefer Baldur's Gate II's approach to NPCs, fewer and more detailed, with interesting and involving personal missions.  On the technical side, in my ~40 hour playthrough from start to end, I've encountered at least two or three crash to desktop bugs. There is one very annoying bug with the map - you can place ""pins"" on the map as notes for areas and NPCs you might need to come back to at an later date. For example, a woman in Nashkel wants you to find out what happened to her miner husband Jospeh. You might want to ""pin"" her house so you know which one it is when you return. Unfortunatly the pin and the name you gave it will sometimes appear in maps other than Nashkel. FPS is limited to 30, I understand that you can increase the limit in the .ini file. I understand some people have encountered bugs that prevented the completion of certain sidequests, I personally have not run into any of these. I played the game with the Core Rules on, aside from two or three unavoidable fights, I never felt particularly challenged by the combat, nor had to reload a fight that went south. That said, there are harder game modes to try, as well as the Solo challenge.  In conclusion: Loved the sense of adventure, the variety of classes/kits on offer, and the game respects your ability to pay attention and not required to be guided throughout the experince. I personally found Baldur's Gate II epic size and variety closer to my liking, but I still appreciated Baldur's Gate's more down to earth approach to high fantasy. I would reccomend this game even for those who have cut their teeth on more modern RPGs (such as Dragon Age, The Witcher or Pillars of Eternity), and won't mind overlooking some dated graphics for a rewarding RPG experince.The Good: simple but effective story, sense of scale and adventure.The Bad: combat, especially early in the game, is a bit dull. Even core-difficulty might be an the easy side for some.The Ugly: aside from the very few instances in my 100 hours playing crashed to desktop, none really.			"

												if your looking for a review about multiplayer its not my review.wow never thought i would do this. spesficly a negitve one for my FAVORITE game. The game is great, it was what it was back in the 1990s and i love that there is a steap learning curve and when you create your character if you dont know what your doing with your stats you can get screwed over or if you do make the game more chaligen on any difficulty.This is a slow game if your going into the exspecting something like skyrim you will be disaponted.It is a party based rpg you can have up too 5 other people with you each with there own class, wepon prefrences and alignmentsSo why am i giveing it a negitive reviwe beamdog. its the technical issues that i can't get by, with there update that came with the release of the sige of dradonspear they have messed with the character modles, they now look like they belong in a bad cellshaded game and with some of the grafic setings turned on they actualy look worse. The new character sheet is a jumbled mess all your information is broken into new tabs some of witch only have two lines of text. plus this update deleveled my characters 2 levels each and dont change the text and font size at least for me doing so caused the game to look like im playing it ten feet away from my computer. So dont buy this in its currant state. If you want to play this (witch i highly recomend you do) do it in its original form go to gog.com and get it.			"

The new content is extremely buggy, very poorly written, and with an extremely hamfisted and overt political agenda. Characters from the original games have been completely changed, and for the worse.Whatsmore, in their effort to prove how LGBQT friendly they were, they added a token trans character who exists for no other reason than to be trans, giving, basically, the video game making equivalent of ""see, I'm not racist, I know several black people.""In addition, once they had♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off an enourmous cross section of their fans, they then took to their forums to beg for positive reviews, which is pretty bad form.Apparently updates to the token character are in the works, as are bug fixes. I will give it another shot at that point, but given how linear the game is, and how poor the rest of the writing also is, I'm not holding out much hope.			"

												You'll notice all of the positive reviews were posted before the Siege of Dragonspear update. You think there might be a reason for that? /sarcasmI see a lot of people here complaining about how the multiplayer no longer works. I don't even play the multiplayer, but even the single player is totally unplayable now due to various unnecessary aesthetic changes, as well as the fact that they've also managed to riddle the game with bugs, AGAIN. Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, Beamdog. An expansion launch that breaks the base game is nothing short of unforgivable.			"

												Its a great game....muffed up by a terrible update....Yes the game is still fun.No, it does not feel quite like the classic anymore.If you want the classic game, get it on GoG....nuff said.-Cinematics are poor compaired to the classic cinematics-Graphics are much like classic BG II-Gameplay itself has still retained classic style-SOME of the tweeks, are genuinly helpfull-MOST of the tweeks, are pointless.-New party members feel (To someone that played to ♥♥♥♥ and loved the classic) Slightly odd. Frankly makes the game feel more like BG II and less like BG 1If you've never played BG before.....Yes i recommend this.If youve played BG before and want nostalga and THE original BG game....No I dont recommend.On a whole I'm rating this down but seriously beleive its just a matter of what you expect.

												An RPG classic, updated with lots of ease of use and convenience tweaks, customization options, and improved modding support. (Yeah, I'm not a fan of the new 2.0 character sheet, either, but now the interface is very easily moddable, so you can change it if you want!) Story-wise it's not as developed as BG2; there's a lot of just wandering around having random encounters in the wilderness, and there's not much interaction with your party members. However, I actually prefer low-level 2nd edition D&D combat to high-level ""mage chess,"" and there's an active modding community with plenty of ways to add NPC interaction and other enhancements to your game.The biggest downside is that Steam makes you install updates before playing, which will break any mods you have installed and wreak havoc with your savegames using those mods. You have to backup your old modded game and launch it outside of Steam in order to keep playing. I don't know if this will get fixed in the future, but it's an important consideration if you're thinking about whether to buy BGEE from Steam or GOG.			"

												If only steam would allow an ""iffy"" review. Because this is a mixed bag. The game used to be perfect. I say *used* to be perfect until the 2.0 update rolled around which dinged it up a bit. The actions of the beamdog team didn't help it either.Okay so here's the good: the graphics have been updated for new machines and three new companions have been added. A mage named Neera who accidentally blows stuff up, a monk named Rassaad, and Dorn Il-khan an orc blackguard (and certified motherf***er) on a mission of revenge. Class kits and high level spells are also in this game adding a ton of flexibility to it.The bad: As of 4/14/2016 there are random CTDs and this one rage inducing bug that literally changes the game's difficulty slider (randomly turning on story mode when you want hard difficulty) a handful of graphical bugs. Edit: They released a patch recently to fix these bugs. To the best of my knowledge, the difficulty sliding bug is no more.Now this part is just me, and also a few others, but I feel this should be brought up: The people that ""enhanced"" this game have no respect what so ever for the original game or it's fanbase (calling the original sexist, calling critics misogynists and transphobes) When they were called out on it, they made a backhanded statement, anyone who called out their bad writing, or the writers themselves for their lack of repsect, were labelled ""Gamergaters"" and just hand waved the complaints.So here's what I think... MAYBE buy this. DON'T buy at full price if you do (wait until it goes to, like, %75 of on a sale or something.) MAYBE pick up the original off amazon just in case they break it more.And whatever you do, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE DLC! Unless you like broken quests, annoying characters, high-school tier writing, mary sues, and railroading.			"

												Baldur's Gate is the type of game that once you learn all the rules and DnD Dice rolling maddness it will become an obsession. Intill then this game with wip you like catholic nun and it is not forgiving to anybody new DnD rpgs. That said is why this game is worth your time and effort. The joy comes in learning rules(4th edition DnD) and becoming the master of something that seemed impossible when you first started. I reccomend this game to anybody who is new to CRPGS and DnD games and is willing to actaully read guides on the internet and endure many deaths and game restartes intill they get the hang of it( it will grow some hair on your face) also long time DnD fans and those who have read any books that take place in the forgotten realms-(game setting).

												A great game with an amazing story, lore, and diversity. Although the story starts out slow, it greatly picks up the pace later on.  Pretty much any special enchanted item has an interesting back story behind it. The amount of classes, items, and spells in this game is gigantic. Another thing, some of the dialog choices are pretty funny.However, there are problems with this game.1) It's a game that focuses on strategic combat. So some fights can be ridiculously hard. This might even be harder if you're someone who isn't familiar with knights of the old republic style of combat. It can also become tedious and tiresome. 2) Yes, the graphics are dated. If you're the type of person that can't play older style of rpg's, it might be hard to get into. 3) Because they put baldur's gate into the baldur's gate 2 engine, there are some nasty bugs which may have to do with the scripting. Examples being->everlasting battle music, certain quest items becoming unusable, and some bosses just despawning. 4) They didn't fix the pathfinding in this enhanced edition. So you have to baby sit your characters to make sure they go to the right place. 5) Most of the time you have a choice on what happens, but not in some instances. I won't make a spoiler, but some choices severely punish you. As in you're suppose to make a certain choice or you die. If you can get over these flaws, you will find that Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition is well worth a playthrough.			"

												I bought this game when it was first enhanced, but haven't reviewed it until the 2.0 release.  The 2.0 release is trouble.  Beamdog has taken upon themselves to modify a classic game to their liking, in a hodgepodge, buggy and non-canonical sort of way, rather than make their own game.If I could go back to the 1.x enhanced edition I would, since it's approach was more conservative, but now, since there is no ""classic mode"" of BG enhanced, there is no way to play simply a modernized version of BG without Beamdog's new take on how the game should be.  Instead, I'll have to install the old version from GOG.Beamdog should really consider offering a vanilla BG enhanced.  I have to rate their additions as not recommended because new fans will think the new chars and new interface they've added is BG and simply not play the original.  The enhanced edition started as a celebration of the classic, and now is a frankenstein based on beamdog's bottom line and inability to make their own retro rpg.			"

The only question is whether to get Baldur's Game: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition or to pick up the originals on GOG.com and use mods to combine them and play them at their best with lots of user created content optionally added as well.  The Enchanced Editions win on ease of use but if you are planning to seriously get into these games then playing the originals modded currently offers the most options.  This may change as people mod the Enhanced Editions more.			"

												I hate writing negative review about anything ,especially when a game is your beloved one.This comment will be an exception.I played this 'enchanted' edition for half an hour and I must say that everything,every detail about this edition seems wrong.I loved the art style of the old game but they killed that ambiance in new edition.I started with Shaman and I think it doesn't fit into the storyline.I will update after I play significantly long but until that day I doubt that this impression will change.We will see.They could have at least learned something from the creators of the Monkey Island (The special edition also has its drawback but the at least  player can switch between editions).I know that they introduced new things into game but they could have managed something better.Anyway, it is better to stick with old edition.

												I would not recommend buying this from Beamdog.  Just buy the original version and mod it, you won't miss much.   This game series has always been a favorite of mine.  I bought the original version when it first came out and have played it many times through-out the years.  Most people would assume that an ""enhanced version"" would be a better version.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  I struggle to see any actual enhancements which make this game worth buying and the numerous bugs overshadow any actual features that were added.The hours I've logged so far to this game have all been multiplayer, so my experience is written from that point of view only.  I remain impressed at how this company took an original game which ran great and introduced numerous frustrating, sometimes game breaking, bugs.  More than once now, I've had to use cheats to fix my game so that its playable again for things like disappearing items and entering required game zones which crash the game every time.  At one point all of my saves would no longer run.  I had to wait for an update which took a month to fix the saves so that I could play again without starting over.  To make it worse, it seems like every update introduces ""exciting"" new bugs.  There really isn't much worthwhile in terms of enhancements. It has been a test of patience to continue playing this game with a friend.  We have quit playing before because the crashes and freezes became too frustrating.  I wonder how much of my logged play time is actually just from restarting the game because of a game crash or bug.  My faith in Beamdog hit a new low when I read about what they did with their DragonSpear expansion.  Hiring a developer who has an admitted agenda of forcing her politically correct views into games is not okay.  She changed established character backgrounds from BG1 in the expansion just to meet her view of how characters in this fantasy world should be.  I won't be buying anything further from a company that is so disrespectful to such a legendary game series.  Here is a list of some of the bugs that I've encountered in multiplayer.- Game freezes for multiplayer friends if the main character dies.  All players must completely exit and restart game to fix.- Can no longer enter the Friendly Arm Inn without crashing- Items have disappeared from inventory more than once- Saved games won't load, forcing you to use an older save- Friends in multiplayer are VERY frequently randomly booted- UI sometimes randomly disappears altogether- Many random crashes to desktop which don't appear to have a repeatable cause			"

												At first, I was happy I could finish this game, after some 13 years of stopping at Nashkel Mines and never going through with it. The graphical update is well-made, and I appreciate Linux-compatibility, even though AI path-finding is still a mess. With all that said, I did not miss much since 1998, I'm afraid. Mechanically, this game didn't age well. Might not have been that good at the time either, but such was the zeitgeist. Design had come a long way since then, and has improved upon much of the formulae of these rpgs. The breaking steel weapons, while integral to the main story, are quite irritating early on, as they represent no challenge besides managing the inventory of several party members. All of whom are limited in carry-capacity by their strength. While it does make sense that your wizard would not be able to carry four sets of metal armour on their back, neither does it for Minsc, nor my Dwarven defender main character. Money is all around the place, and after some time, you only look potions and arrows. Magic items available in shops are not all that good, and I have only spent money on purchasing the party's first +1 weapons, which are magical and do not break. I was sitting on over 50 thousand gold by the end, not even bothering with selling things after some time.Outside of these early purchases, the way of progression is generally looting and pillaging, which made me feel like we were a party of murder-hobos masquerading as heroes (renown maxed with good deeds and not killing town guards). The game world feels static, many models are standing around the town of Baldur's Gate, yet people are pushing their own unconnected agendas with you playing the henchmen or merry matchmaker. Boring. I did go into length to do as many side-quests as possible, but it made little difference. The world did not come more alive for all my troubles. The story was bland if anything, and conversational choices mostly boiled down to 1, being nice, 2, wanting money for being nice and 3, acting rude, stabbing people and generally not being very nice. There was no opportunity in changing the flow of conversations or saving face once you lost it, which is not fun. Many of the characters feel out of place, thrown into the setting as “that dude in front of a house who gives you a quest that takes you to the next location”. Companion characters not connected strictly to the main story come at you seemingly random, many in the middle of the wilderness or a road, and you most probably already have a full party of capable individuals and cannot be bothered to dismiss someone just to check out what this new random bloke could bring to the party. I simply went with an early-game group of lawful neutral and good individuals, as boring that might sound. I did get Khalid killed early on though, as he was not bringing anything to the party, however, Jaheira, our druid would have left if the fighter got dismissed. Game-play wise, AD&D is really bad, and I wish they had gone with a better system. Then again, such was the time. In this game it is perfectly justifiable to make a bard character who then sits out all fights, singing and thus bringing +2 attack value to the rest of the party, because bonuses could mean that much. Then again, I made a steel wall made out of dwarf, a true craftsmanship of his kind I must say, who walked up to people and hit them for damage beyond the baseline health of most spell-casters. Exploding corpses were a triviality during our adventures. That said, fights are challenging and can be frustrating at times due to the nature of saving throws in the d20 system. Memorizing spells was a bother, and I never liked it in D&D and its variants. It's not good design, and I am glad video game creators put these kind of player-limiting stupidity behind us. As for the content added by Beamdog, the creators of this Enhanced Edition, well, I wish they didn't force so much their impossibly irritating, edgy female character, Neera. The encounter triggers a fight whether you like it or not, and ends in an offer to recruit the mage, whether you like it or not. Well, I just slit her throat. Good riddance! Her voice-acting was worse than that of Imoen's, and that is compliment I never thought I would give that character. All in all, Beamdog failed to improve on the mediocre writing already present in the game.As a closing thought, I think I would have enjoyed Baldur's Gate more if the system was based on GURPS.			"

It's the character modification/arrangements you can make, you make your own party of friends/adventurers and your only problem is that you will have a hard time deciding which ones you want in your team because they are all likeable and diverse.The forgotten realms lore, all witty comments, all the dialogue, the dnd charm -- beg on these bonuses and buy this motherfu- right now.

												I'm currently in college and have next to no time on my hands. I played Baldur's Gate during winter break in 2015 with a couple of friends and had a great time, though we never got close to beating the game. I hadn't played it since until today. I saw the huge controversy surrounding the new expansion as well as the overhaul that it brought, which was implemented into even the base game. Furthermore, I saw many of the negative reviews it was getting on Steam. I had to get back into the game. I had to check it out. Oh. My. God. What have they done?

												Baldurs's Gate I is a great game and I've loved it since its first release. I expected this version to be polished and running without any problems (no need to install mods etc.). Yes, it is extremely easy to install and start this version. But it's also extremely annoying to play it because it can freeze (crash) 30times in one hour... And even if it runs, it lags when you move something in the inventory - it's not doing this all the time, sometimes everything is fine, but in like 2/3 of the time each move of an item requires you to wait for 2 seconds.I searched the internet for days, found multiple fixes (turn off antivir, start as admin, use compatibility with XP/Vista/Whatever, run windowed/fullscreen, increase/decrease framerate, countless number of workarounds), some of them seemed to be working, but all the problems were back in few minutes. I even copied the game files to a different folder (simpler path) and played it without Steam, which also didn't help. But I have more hours in the game than Steam shows for me.I was leveling Imoen 10times before I finaly could distribute all thief skill points without the game crashing (freezing, forcing me to restart it). I was trying to get an item identified at a shop 15times before I gave up and dropped the item. I have been trying to sell my loot from the Durlag's Tower at a shop so many times now that I stopped playing the game. I'm not having fun anymore.From the new features I noticed only the quick loot dialog, which is quite fine. And of course the fact the the game looks and works like BGII now, which is really great (no sarcasm).New content is tied to new characters and if you don't want them in your party (I didn't), you get nothing new.As far as the game itself (BG) is concerned, I recommend it absolutely. But this Enhanced Edition is not worth it, you should rather get some other version, especially if you can get it cheaper.			"

												This is for the latest update.  ♥♥♥♥ you.  It worked well, why did you feel the compulsion to add bugs to an already-working game?  Pro-♥♥♥♥ing-tip: when you die, don't have the game pop you back to the main campaign, when you're playing The Black Pits.			"

												I really wish i could recommend this game, I do LOVE Baldur's Gates but i would recommend the original over the ""Enhanced Edition"" for the following reasons:- UI changes made the UI very VERY glitchy.- The game will suddenly crash every now and then.I would like to add that i did beat the Enhanced Edition twice, both single and multiplayer and i noticed that the UI and crash problems happen mostly in multiplayer, the single player was somewhat ""bearable"" to play through, but you are paying for both modes thus i recommend getting the original and modding it to work in BG2's engine with HD resolution support.

												Singlehandedly one of the greatest CRPGs ever made. If you have any care for Dungeons and Dragons then you need to play this game. Its based off of D&D 2nd edition rules and very faithfully creates that feeling of playing Pen and Paper Dungeons and Dragons. The story is very well written and the character customization is pretty spot on with what you expect from D&D. I'd love to see more playable races such as Gnolls, Kobolds, Tieflings, and half-dragons (or dragonborn), but that isn't required to make this a good game. The controls may take a little getting used to as the game uses a real time turn based which means pausing the battles will be common and frequent.			"

												The Patch 2+ enhancements make this game an absolute pleasure. So many little things with the dialog boxes, journal notifications, being able to scroll back through dialog when responding to NPCs, sprite updates, map updates, just make the interface much more modern and enjoyable.Definitely recommend, even if you've played through the original.

												This reboot is everything you could have hoped for this beautiful old game and more. There is love that has gone into this from the start menus and comprehensive tutorial and no doubt thoughout this exquisite game.I have been waiting to finally get around to finishing this game for more than 15 years, and even before delving into the first quests, I can see the love and attention to detail that has gone into this previously outstanding game, a must play for any RPG fan, D&D fan, or anyone that has an appreciation for a quality game and the hard work and art, that goes into it.

												Loved the originals, disc swap and all that jazz. I see what beamdog is trying to do, and respect them as fans of the franchise. HOWEVER over half a year and no updates, hotfixes or patches in its current state of mod-breaking bugs  and bugs in general. No ETA on fixes or updates, nothing but ""soon"" for the past half a year. Well its been only 6+ months but hey you know whats on their newsfeed? A NEW secret game that they are developing and need testers for. Sorry Beamdog we are breaking up, my wallet no longer loves you.			"

												I have this version and another site's version, called the Complete Saga which includes ToTSC. Although I have a lot of hours on this version, I now play the (GOG) version, which used to be cheaper (a different story).I'm writing this for my past self and anyone new (that is aged 12-18) to RPGs looking to get into what are regarded by some CRPG lovers as the best who might click this, see the Enhanced Edition moniker, and believe that this is the definitive version of the game.Unfortunately the base version of this Enhanced Edition has AI as pathetic as the original, low quality, mod-tier NPCs, and a UI vastly different from the original's but without any improvements. (The 431 hours I have were spent avoiding the NPCs after the first playthrough, were modded with at least Sword Coast Stratagems, and were before Dragonspear.)The EE is not a definitive version of Baldur's Gate. In fact, there is no definitive, polished, best version of this game, anywhere. It's something you have to scrap together from separate resources, and even then, you likely won't create the best version of the game. I just spent some hours a few days ago trying to reinstall the game on a different PC before I gave up and started playing Baldur's Gate II. And I'm not an idiot. The installation process for the mods is archaic and so easy to make a mistake. There are even differences between modding BG and BG2 because one of the best mods for BG converts it to BG2's engine, but the BG (tutu) is not exactly the same as BG2.Beamdog set out to enhance the game, but they did not make the game better than what is possible with mods.But regardless of my personal feelings towards Beamdog and their added content, I can't recommend this game even if you were looking to play it as soon as you download it. The Enhanced Edition has had a bad history with bugs. They've added patches designed to quash the bugs of their previous patches which introduced new bugs. Their patches are not stable.Baldur's Gate Original Saga is an old game that works. Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a newer game that often does not work.			"

Posted: January 20, 2015
												Forgive my english - This isn't a review but more of a testimony. 14 hours in.I just started playing the classics for my first time. I played DOS which led to Wasteland which was based on fallout1-2 and I enjoyed  Wasteland. So I tried Fallout 2 and I didn't get it for the first 4 hours(at least) and I quit once and started over. But after the initial fail I  really really enjoyed the game. I can't say I ever played a better one. It's an epic story of honor and revenge. Skyrim, witcher2 , ME12, DAO ... it was as good as any of them. So I couldn't play yet another post apocalypse rpg so i decided to try BG2 which everyone seems to agree is one of the top rpgs of all time. I struggled again at the beginning. 6 hours of not liking the game and I also quit once.  And then I started to get into it. It had better party building than Fallout2 and the world  was starting to get interesting   So I stopped because I knew I needed to play BG in order to fully appreciate BG2 because they reference BG in the dialogue.OK, so now I'm playing BG and again the first 4 hours sucked. I was even bored. Even though I knew the UI and play style already from BG2. Again I quit (went back) once and changed some decisions. I didn't pick up Minsc (yet) because I hated the time limit on the quest. It made me nervous. So, anyway, I finally acclimated to the pace and game style and it is a great game so far. Since it's my first run through it's a challenge. I've already lost 2 men (who I didn't mind losing or else I would have loaded the last save).  The combat is fun. Really though the balance is incredible.  The action happens in well spaced intervals. So far the side quests are fun. I'm in no rush to push the game along.  Level progress is nice and slow. I feel very underdeveloped now and I'm happy to have this gang I've put together. Some of them are selfish. One is evil. All are quirky.  Money is scarce.  And I'm not sure what's going on and why I'm being hunted. We are heading down to Neshkel because that's where the actions at. I was there and a bit further t on my first runthrough but I rage quit. This time it's  nicer.I'm sure this game is going to be great. I guess the point of this ""review"" is that you might need to take some time to get into these older games. Once you acclimate to the graphics and the pace you no longer miss anythig about the new games and you get all this great game programing and story telling by  people who REALLY loved their product . Not the ""this is a game made with love"" BS tag line the reviewers say about EVERY game now. This one was obviously made by people who loved  games and fantasy. The action is fun once you learn the rules.The text , which is a main fake complaint about old school rpgs is fine. ""the wall of text"" stuff is a myth. It's the opposite. The writing reflects the ""efficiency"" of text based adventures from the era. Zork (the first text adventure?) never gives you more than a few lines to read. It's the same with BG. Those writers were more skilled than todays. I loved Skyrim but the writing in BG is superior. Skyrim gets long winded and repetitive.			"

												Definitely was way ahead of its time in the RPG game world. I highly recomend if you are big into D&D or fan of old style RPG games. Definitley fixed tons of bugs and stuff that was in the original version, however wouldnt recomend to anyone expecting a graphically ""enhanced"" game as it looks pretty much the same as before, and not a whole lot of options at all still in the graphics settings menu. gui still stretched in wide mode and stuff. But theres 3 new heroes that can join you, there's Neera, a ""wild mage"" with really nice variety of spells, Dorn Il-Khan, a dour warrior, and an initially weak monk Rasaad yn Bashir. a nice addition seeing as theres already over 100 hours of gameplay here.All in all this isn't a remake of the classic Baldur's Gate but rather a more flushed out improvement of the original game.The game has definitley aged well tho. and I recomend picking it up if it goes on sale. great for those late night LAN parties.

												When this first came out, I embraced the idea - I'm not a hardcore purist (some complain about some ""out-of-place"" changes to the game).Sure, early on there were a number of bugs, not all of them were bad though, some of the bugs could even be funny.After a while they patched it some and it worked better (aww, some nice bugs are gone) :P...But then they patched it some more.Now I really wish I could roll back the game to an earlier version.Why?The later patches introduced a very poorly coded graphical ""update"" which allowed zooming in and out. In theory that's a great feature, and it can even be disabled, however...The way their updated game/shaders handles the texture-scaling IS SO BAD that they made a 16year old game look WORSE than on its release - even if you turn the zooming feature off (because it will still use the new crappy rendering regardless).For your information I used to be a game programmer (then switched over to academic research), which is how I know this could, and should, have been done a hundred times better - they seriously need to fire the guy responsible for the new rendering. It's basically the least effort implementation possible, using the most basic form of blurry texture stretching available instead of using any of the many techniques more suitable for pixel-graphics - of which there exists many to choose from - or even just a better general purpose one!I would be ashamed to put this graphics update on my resumé unless there was some special condition attached to it like ""they only gave me a single evening to complete it"" or ""I didn't get paid"" (but then that just begs to question why I would put it on my resumé at all).Because of my past occupation this is like a sore thumb constantly irritating and distracting me - knowing what an insultingly bad implementation they used. Call it an occupational hazard, but I simply couldn't enjoy the game anymore because of this.Edit: Just tried it out again and it seems they have fired that guy! :D(Or he/she got his/her♥♥♥♥♥♥together.)Once again I can enjoy / recommend this game. Keep playing! :)			"

												I fell in love with one side character and one side character alone, his name was Minsc. MY other party members were too busy calling me queer, ""why aren't you a queer fellow"" -Imoenor telling me I was going to fail, ""Our quest is vain"" -Xanfor me to care for them.Minsc, however, took the feet out from under my feet and always knew what to say to keep me going in the right direction, ""butt-kicking for goodness!"" -MinscMinsc only wanted one thing in return for his presence. To free his friend from the vile scourge of a gnoll encampment. I was more than willing to assist Minsc to achieve his goal, but I was currently on my way to vanquish the foes that were tormenting the Nanshekel mines, but I assured Minsc I would help after.As soon as I breathed my first breath of air from the godforsaken mines of Nanshekel I gave Minsc one of those sexy side winks, but all he could reply with was, ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, watch it! I'm huge!""I could tell Minsc was growing impatient, so I pushed on towards to the gnoll encampment without any delay. We were unfortunately walaid by many the highwayman and foe. I thought Minsc was enjoying the adventure with his enthusiastc war yaps, ""The squeeky wheel gets the kick"", I was wrong, however, so very wrong.I was precisely one load zone away from the gnoll encampment (one ****ing loadzone!), filled with glee to help my friend Minsc, but when we got there I then understood true disapointment. We loaded in and I looked to Minsc hoping to see gaiety and pride. Instead I saw hate and utter disapointment, ""hey  Minsc, heh, so we got to the gnolls like you wanted, heh, ready to save your friend?""Unfortunately there was no love left to be felt by Minsc' eyes. His eyes were black and full of rage like a shark that smells blood.""Heh, hey Minsc, heh, ready to go save your friend?""In one fell swoop Minsc drew his +1 two-handed sword and dropped the negative-nancy wizard, Xan, like a dirty sack of potatoes.""Minsc! What are you doing?!""""You say you help save friend, but You not help at all!!!"" Then Minsc began hacking the not so politically correct and naive rogue, Imoen, but I didn't care. All I cared was that I get through to my one true side character Minsc, so I did the only thing I could do. I Ran.I began running frantically through the gnoll stronghold, praying that Minsc would recognize we were where he wanted to be all along and stop slashing at my dwarf cleric main character, ""Owen"", instead I now had an army of gnolls chasing me and my beloved Minsc who couldn't care two shakes about the gnoll army that he was now seemingly a part of from my perspective.I continued running, pleading through my laptop screen until I hit a dead end and there was no where left for me to run. My escape was blocked by an angry horde of gnolls, and an even angrier Minsc.I tried besting the gnolls in hopes it would in someway calm Minsc down, but when he came within striking distance of me all I could feel was the sharp cold iron impale me just under my ribcage and I collapsed like house of cards in a pool of not only my own blood, by also that of gnoll, looking up at my beloved Minsc, ""I forgive you"" I whispered.""*Squeak* Boo says that he was just doing his job,"" -Minsc.10/10 would fall in love with Minsc, only to be killed by him again.

												The original Baldur's gate was a fantastic game, it was a genre defining RPG that original version holds up amazingly (if you can get your hands on a CD copy), yet this version seems to have improved on an almost perfect game. The remastered graphics are exceptional and the smoothness in the way this game runs leaves many other Steam games in it's wake. I don't know what more can be said - if you like D&D buy this game, if you like RPG's buy this game, if you like gaming buy this game, basically just buy this game. I look forward to clocking many more hours into this gem...9.5/10			"

												I always loved playing this Baldur's Gate. Since the OG in 1998 to the ones on PS2 its been my favorite RPG.  Mainly because it takes place in the D&D world. And I am glad someone is trying to bring the old game back to life.There are a lot of bugs still in this game. Not as much as the OG. As there is a lot of them fixed, and you don't need to download a ton of mods to fix it. I think what ever the last patch added however, messed the save games up. It just deleted them. Then I notice the picture was missing for those save games and you can CLICK on an invisible picture. SOMETIMES it lets you load it, most the time(like 95% of the time) it doesn't. I tried starting a new character. Saved. Went to load it. It was not there.What I think would make this game better, is more items to choose from. Seriously beamdog, pick up a D&D players handbook, and just make more weapons. IE: Rapier, Hand Cross bow, Blow gun(useless, but still) Great Axe, Maul, just more basic stuff. More visual, hell, why not just update the rules a bit more as well, and add in more of the Lore that is in the Sword Coast(seens how they just made another expanison for D&D 5.0 based in the Sword Coast) than just the little bit that you have done and then want to charge $20.00 for.I would still recommend this Game however. But I doubt most people want to pay 20 for a game from 98 with just some paint added to it.			"

												Hi, I'm not much of a reviewer but just tried this for the first time and was a bit disappointed. The graphics and overall performance is very sluggish or how you say it. I would have thought they could have made it smooth, but at least with my system:Intel Core i7 4790K @ 4.00GHz16,0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 799MHz (10-10-10-30)4095MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 (ASUStek Computer Inc)etc. it isn't.Of course the main point for this great game is not the graphics, but still it makes a difference to me. It looks a bit like Ultima 6 with outlined characters imo but at that time at least it was obvious it was sluggish.... I have to admit I haven't played this but only few minutes, but this is the first impression. The same good game is there of course, but... As I have played it years back ago (the original that is) and I also have Baldur's Gate II via gog.com, I think this ""enhanced"" isn't worth the money. Though they do sell this also on gog.com...I don't recommend this version, but just my opinion so take it as it is.Cheers...			"

												Baldur's Gate is one of my all time favorite RPGs.  It is a turn based role playing game that emulates 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.  It is based in the Forgotten Realms in the Sword Coast region.  The story line is fun and engaging.  The level up process is interesting and rewarding and the Non Player Characters are fleshed out well. The Enhanced Edition has only made it better.  Besides ironing out some bugs from the original game, they also added some new NPC players complete with side quests.  I also like that they have enabled all of the extra classes from Baldur's Gate II.I have always like BG1 over BG2 because it doesn't feel as ""rail roady"".  You eventually do have to finish the main quest but along the way they give you quite a bit of latitutude to do side quests.In all this is an Amazing game.			"

												Everyone that likes RPGs should play through the Baldur's gate series at some point. It's among my favorite games ever. I think the second game is a lot better, but I still recommend this game. The enhanced edition doesn't add a lot, but I would still recommend it. It's made for modern computers and doesn't require mods to be played. The new companions is a good addition to the game, and I like the new UI. I really really recommend getting some of the best mods like Sword Coast Stratagems, as the game gets more challeninging, but in a better way than just increasing the difficulty (AI improvements).

												As Fallout was to Wasteland, so too was Baldur's Gate to the text based fantasy adventures and RPGs that came before it. An isometric classic, Baldur's Gate paved the way for now-legendary D&D PC Forgotten Realms RPG titles like Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and Neverwinter Nights. With the Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate has now been repackaged to include the expansion, Talers of the Sword Cost, and been reoptimzed with modern resolutions and compatability fixes.Potential customers should know that with Baldur's Gate they are getting an epic classic RPG adventure and the ability to import their playthrough into Baldur's Gate II, also released with an Enhanced Edition. The price you pay for this adventure is an RPG that, like many of its time, does not hold hands. You will be expected to make a charachter and maintain that charachter and a party of adventures through the archaic (even at its time) AD&D 2nd Edition ruleset. Conversation paths and encounters can open up or lock you out of future quests without warning. A single unprepared encounter with a greater basilisk, a web trapped giant spider enclave, or a wizard ambush can decimate even over-leveled parties in seconds. While many classic RPG fans would call Baldur's Gate a ""must play"", I fully acknowledge that the depth, openness, and difficulty of the series can be a major turnoff to modern gamers. To those who take the plunge, feel free to hit me up with advice for charachter creation and remember that the Q key is for quicksaves. Use it often.  "

												I had played this game as a kid and went into it with a huge nostalgia bonus, but I can't in good conscience recommend it anymore. Don't be fooled by the ""Enhanced Edition""moniker, the game is still filled from top to bottom with bugs and frustrations. The storyline is decent (though those of the sidequests and companions aren't) and in the higher levels the tactical, semi-turn-based D&D combat still is a big draw, but it's not nearly enough to make up for all the problems.Balancing for example simply doesn't exist. The early levels are especially horrible since dying or not constantly hinges on a single dice roll (you have less total hp than most enemies can dish out in damage with one hit). The later levels are mostly okay, except for the new content from the expansion, that is simply frustrating and no fun at all. Still, throughout the entire game it all boils down to quicksaving after every fight and then reloading whenever something goes wrong, over and over until the dice fall into the place you need them to. I'm sorry, but don't buy this.			"

												It's very dated and repetitive. Neverwinter Nights provides a much more pleasant experience and superior story, without the illogical difficulty spokes and inability to dissuade attackers with persuasion skills. I recommend it for multiplayer (if it works for you.. there are many disconnects) and people who are die-hard fans of the series. I am currently doing a single playthrough with my best friend, and I'm enjoying bits and pieces of it, but we find ourselves taking breaks often. I am on the fence about this game, so I will put some + and - points.+ Lots of classes to choose from!Like a true d&d game, there are many classes to choose from. Fighter, Barbarian, Ranger, Paladin, Thief, Sorcerer, Wizard, Bard-- etc! Each of these classes has kits that modify certain abilities or restrictions, allowing for quite a bit of experimenting.+ Large game with many areas to exploreYou'll end up spending about two hours making your first character if you're googling for help at the same time. I actually enjoy the process of designing a new character so this is fine by me. After all that, you get a bit of story with not too much text, and you're off into the world. There are a lot of things to do, and the game does direct you to certain places, though very few places are restricted.+ They let you be evil or good to peopleI'm not into the whole being a jerk to people thing, but if you like that stuff then you'll at least appreciate all the murderous options given to you. As a bad boy/girl, you'll get into trouble with the nicer people in the world.= Okayish story, not overwhelmingly soI already know the plot, and it's kind of cool. Essentially you can explain the plot in two sentences but the game takes its time to introduce it to you. If you're attentive enough, you'll probably figure it all out before the great reveal.= MultiplayerMultiplayer is fun with a friend if it doesn't disconnect too much. There isn't much else to say about this, though. Some people might prefer to be alone because they'd have full control over all party members.- The way stats work in this version of d&dYou don't get combat benefits from having 10-16 strength, but you do get it from having 17 or 18. Dexterity should always be 18 to get better armor (..which you'll need), constitution is a big deal, intelligence does absolutely nothing unless you're a wizard, wisdom is similar. They also force classes to have stats that they don't exactly benefit from! This version of d&d is just a bit too primitive in certain aspects, and I recommend Neverwinter Nights because all stats do something to benefit your character, and not having max stats is perfectly fine.- Difficulty spikes, often killed instantly by attackersThe amount of times you get talked to by a mage and then get charmed/feared, after which you are killed because you lost control of your character .. is staggering. There aren't many ways to counter this, and I remember one quest that instantly kills your character during dialog with no warning or means to escape it. This means you'll end up saving and loading a lot, and possibly avoiding conversation just so you can get the first attack off on your enemy (ie: you fireball them before they can even see you). Sometimes the game becomes too easy as well.- Not enough customization optionsENHANCED EDITION, it says. So let me play a redhead. It wouldn't have killed the developer to add some extra coloring options in the game, but at least they did improve things graphically a bit!TL:DR: imbalanced difficulty, unfair deaths, save and load constantly, dated mechanics. Neverwinter Nights is better, but if you enjoyed Neverwinter Nights and want some more RP things, this might do if the price is cheap :) Heard that Baldur's Gate 2 is far better than this one, so working your way to it with the first game might not be a bad idea.

												One of my all-time favourite games. Still holds up perfectly today. I enjoy how it's more open and loosely structured than the sequel, which gives the game a real sense of adventure as you don't know what you will stumble across next. Enhanced Edition content is ~okay~, tonally it's different to the OG content so it sticks out a bit, but it's worth a playthrough. The addition of Neera means there is now an excellent good-aligned mage to recruit. QOL improvements make this the definitive version.			"

												You must gather your party before venturing forth.———————————————————————————————————————————It seems that most of reviews have a deep affection for the original game a long time ago so they know about some differences between the original version and this EE and want to talk about it. As for Chinese reviews, there are just a whole lot of people complaining about localization. I am just a fresh newcomer to Baldur’s gate, actually this EE version and I think it couldn’t have changed much from the original one because the game is still sooooo great.I’ve beaten some Bioware games so I know some of the modern Bioware features: gorgeous main quest, lovable companions, tons of lore and some homosexual staff. Side quests, however, are not strong in those Bioware titles I've played such as in Mess Effect and Dragon Age. However, Baldur’s gate gives me a feeling more like it is a pioneer of skyrim for the open world exploration and endless side quests, or, more appropriately, side ""events"". It is the point of exploration in games that you can always encounter some interesting people and fun stories during your whether or not aimless wandering. That is why I like Bethesda games despite some of their poor designs. Many of those events in Baldur's gate does not have complete storylines. Some of them are just small moral choices to enrich lore. It does not mean that the game has weak side quests. On the contrary, some of the actual side quests are surprisingly good and there are not many simple “go to the dungeon and fetch me something” quests like in skyrim.The game feels like skyrim in some way. But judging from some other aspects, I guess it looks pretty Bioware, even though it might not be the modern Bioware I know. Companions, for example, are quite likable. However, companion part is in a quite similar situation like the quest part is in the game. We have a great amount of companions and nearly none of them have much to do about stories. Instead, they are just being different kinds of combatants with interesting characteristics. Companions in other bioware titles, such as dragon age, can be trustworthy friend, lovers that you really are in love with, tutors and students. Companions in Baldur’s gate are not as good as those in Dragon Age franchise in my opinion, but is still far better than some RPGs such as skyrim. Here I’d like to say that although beamdog might have messed something up in the game, they really did a good job writing and designing those new companions. Dorn and Neera are really cute and Rasaad is much more interesting than a common lawful good guy.The main quest in this game is applaudable, mainly owing to the last two chapters in my opinion. But it is not as good as many other RPGs. In Dragon Age Origin, the four branch main quests allow you to explore four kinds of distinguished powers in Thedas and every one of them is a fantastic adventure, letting you learn the lore from a dimensional point of view. In Baldur's gate, however, all of your heroic actions in early chapters is indeed solving local people problems as the hero does in DAO except the dungeons are less exciting. They are just mines filled with annoying traps. Those adventures in Tales of the Sword Coast expansion is much better and more intense in story and dungeons than those in the original game. Durlag’s tower is probably still one of the best designed dungeons in game history. Thanks to D&D rules, combat is fun in this game. I usually don’t care that much about combat components but I went through the manual thoroughly to get familiar with those rules. To me, the most fun part is spells. I’ve never seen so many different kinds of spells in one game. Many of them serves purposes, not just some kind of duplication. There are always different ways to beat enemies if you put your mage and spells in good use.To conclude the review, Baldur’s gate combines some of the good elements in popular modern RPGs from groups like Bethesda and Bioware as well as its own D&D derived story  and strategy-based combat. It might not be an appropriate expression since the game is much older than those modern titles. In that way, some part of the game may seem crude to a modern RPG fan. But that does not prevent the game from remaining a masterpiece even today. The game is still fun in today’s standard but enjoying the game needs some effort. At least remember to go back to the manual when you have questions. If you are interested in western RPGs and looking forward for more, I think Baldur’s Gate Enhanced Edition is a must play.			"

												One of the best RPGs using D&D rules in history. Even nowdays it outshines most of the titles of the same genre, for its memorable characters (Boo is still my hero) and the storyline, which is still one of the best around after 20 years. A masterpiece and personally one of my all time favorites, avoid it only if you hate the genre or games with an isometric worldview.What's good: -Tactical DnD combat, at higher difficulties it becomes prioritary to prepare for the toughest fights, besides choosing your companions wisely.-Charismatic characters to choose from as your companions throughout the game, each one with its own personality and will. A practical example: you're the usual lawful good paladin, saving maidens right and left, feeding ophans and so on? Do not expect that chaotic evil semi-pedophile dwarven mercenary to stay long in your party. -The game is full of side-quests, most of them rewarding and satisfying. -Characters interact with one another (mostly with you of course).-Romance system available for some characters, further developed in the sequel. You want to play something more like Dawson's Gate rather than Baldur's? Here you have it.-Entertaining storyline and decision making power. You can kill almost everyone in this game, but beware to face the consequences (I myself messed the game up once.)-Even without all of the side-quests, this game is pretty long. Without the expansion and all the side quests included in this enhanced edition, it will take you from 20 to 30 hours to beat the game, if you're not rushing it like mad.What's bad/ possibly not enjoyable for others:-If your a fan of 3D graphics this is not the game for you.-A little dated audio packs in some cases, not a big deal considering the epic soundtrack but still...-By contrast with what i wrote before, some may not appreciate the DnD dice based fighting system. If you're a fan of pure action oriented combat games you'll probably be disappointed in this one.-Objectively dumb racial restrictions in some cases. Why in the world can't I be a monk if I'm an half-elf? Or an elven paladin? Nothing fun-breaking yet still unsettling. To conclude, if you're a fan of traditional RPG or an open minded ACTION-RPG lover, this might be the game for you.PS. Nevermind the hours of gameplay Steam shows, I've beaten this game thrice or more in a non-Steam version, besides the countless hours I spent on the original one.			"

												""Enhanced Edition"" - no. They updated the resolution and probably removed the (now useless) performance-vs-quality options as well as a few visuals. Other than that it's just a few tweaks and features, but the whole engine (!) seems to have stayed the same - especially the netcode.How is that a problem? Well, the game crashes frequently, multiplayer is unreliable and lags, and the game freezes on various occasions (saving/connecting/transferring items/etc) that should not let a modern game freeze. Well, I thought that at least, regarding the ""Enhanced Edition"" suffix.I played BG2 in multiplayer before, and the UI is almost exactly like it - a good thing. But to my disappointment, all the bugs haven't been fixed, instead this game actually crashes more often than BG2 original.If it is reduced, you like RPGs, and you plan on playing singleplayer only, get this. Otherwise, better not support this attempt on getting money with a slightly updated old game (their only work was to fix/enhance the game - and they failed the first part).I feel like I should add that you get the ""DLC"" for the game (2 new chars, sound and icon packs) for free on the Steam edition.Seriously, did you even test the multiplayer before shipping?

												The enchanced edition is a new take on a perfect game by some of the original creators. There are still/new bugs, changes, some attempts to make it modern (knowing that some assets are lost and will never be able to be recovered or improved). The game is old, many new players will not like the visuals and rules, and that's alright, there're plenty of games for them out there. The dice rolls and art style are a huge part of the game, the EE kept most of the important features and added their own little things, UI improvements, some NPCs; with interesting enough quests; They fit well in what was already a great game, now with achievements, cloud and overlay.

												Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 are some of my most nostalgic games and among my Top 10 Favorite games of all time, i could play the original version over and over again and never get tired of it, thus i bought the Enhanced Edition of BGEE1 which at first it seemed like a great remake of the original classic.+Character Creation: This is one of my favorite parts of the game, creating your character.In the original Baldurs Gate there already were tons of diffrent ways you could create your characters.The Enchanced Edition however includes the Class Kits from Baldurs Gate 2 and with Multi-Classing and Dual Classing (which if im gonna try to explain the craziness of that this review would be twice as long) it makes for an insane ammount of replay value.Gameplay: I'v heard people say that this game is complicated  . .to which i say . . compared to modern versions like the Dragon Age games it kinda is, it can get really hard at times too but thats part of why i love Baldurs Gate and other D&D Games.Its not the kind of game you can just rush through, you have to have some strategy, pay attention and sorta ""learn"" the game.Music: In general a Good soundtrack, don't have much to say here honestly, there's nothing really specal that sticks out.Characters: Apart from the character creation and having lots of diffrent dialogue options to choose from, there's a total of 29 party members to choose from in the game including 4 new ones added to the Enchanced version which is a nice addition.You don't get to interact with them as much as you do in for example the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series and even though some of the Party members are more useful than others the ammount of people you can choose to have in your party alone makes for lots of replay value.Story: Bioware and Black Isle(Known as Obsidian Entertainment nowdays) have a talent for creating some great and intresting stories in video games and Baldurs Gate is no exception. It's one of the best things about this game in my opinion(dont wanna say much here because i dont wanna spoil anything)Graphics: May not look much compared to Modern games like the Dragon Age Series but(then again it is nearly 20 years old) back then i thought this game looked great dispite the awful resolution in the original version.Thankfully the Enhanced Edition puts the BG2 engine into the game and makes the resolution extremely nice.-The AI in both BG1 and 2 is really derpy at times, there have been plenty of times when i'm in a narrow dungeon and some of my characters go somewhere completely diffrent than what i told them(or even worse goes the wrong way right into a trap or an ambush).But thats a nitpick for me honestly.And then of course the thing everyone talks about the Siege of Dragonspear update, oh boy oh boy.While i don't like the new cartoonish sprites, they look really out of place in the game but i can tolerate that because at least you can disable them.There might be a couple of bugs here and there but i can forgive that.The thing that still really bothers me and made me stay away from this remake for a long time and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so much that i even gave this game a ""thumps down"" review is the new UI(mainly the character sheet and the journal, seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ Beamdog!?).The new UI in both BG1 and 2 is Ugly as♥♥♥♥♥♥and i have no idea why someone would even think of changing it when the old one was just fine.Final Verdict: 10/10Even though i was really salty about the New UI when it was first released, after i sat down and replayed it... again and i realized i was just being unfair with my critisism here, the journal and the character sheet may look horrible compared to the old one this is still an epic game.Even after all these years Baldur's Gate still holds up as one of my Top 10 favorite games of all time, i could play this game forever and never get bored of it dispite the ugly UI.(That being said the new UI is still ugly as ♥♥♥♥ compared to the original one in the Enhanced Edition and Beamdog i would REALLY appricate it if you gave us the option to switch back to the old one!!)This game is basiclly one of the reasons why games like the Dragon Age series exists today and if you like me enjoy any RPG made by Bioware or RPGS in general this is a must buy.

												Ok, for the quick summery, read this part. If you want more in depth, read past this. I've played Baldur's Gate since 2003 or so finished the game twice total. Only five years after it originally released in 1998. This game is basically my childhood. Over all, this game is much like the original with additions of a new class and the half-orc race of Baldur's Gate 2 and now, there's even more customization in the stats. Over all, the story is the same and enhanced on with new characters. If you're into hard-core RPGs that will last you days, buy this game. It's well worth it. But if you want something that has less time investment, don't go for this.Now for in-depthCharacter Customization: Now, this is an old game, this isn't Skyrim. Your character customization won't be ranging from weight to dirt color. The customization is in the stats: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Willpower, Intellect, and Constitution as well as what weapon proficiency you have from one handed sword to katanas, from two handed swords to halberds and from bow to sling. Then if you chose a caster class what spells you have from the beginning. You can chose your class from the traditional: Fighter, mage, thief to things like cleric, specialized mage, multi-classing, ranger, ect. Then race (which has different stats for each) from human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, halfling, half-orc, ect. The only physical customization of the character is in the portrait, gender, hair color, skin color and clothing major and minor colors. That's it.Gameplay: Now, the gameplay is DnD combined with RTS. You control your party of 6 max, including your character (who, if dies, is game over). You can pause whenever to cast spells, which is turn based. I.E. It could take two turns to cast a Heal Minor Wounds spell or a turn to cast a magic missiles or even five to cast a lightning storm or summoning spell. You can loot items from weapons (which CAN and WILL break by the way. So ALWAYS have a spare!) to armor, to enchanted items which you'll need a mage or the money to identify what they are (don't auto-equip these assuming they're better. They might be cursed items!) If you're a fan of DnD you'll love the gameplay.Story: Without spoilers, the story is amazing and in depth. On disk it spanned over 5 disks and a sixth for the expansion, so the game itself, for the day, was MASSIVE. Games now are 8-12 hrs, possibly a tad more to finish the game, maybe even more than that.. If you want 100% and to actually finish this game successfully, you'll need about a week or two. So prepare for time investment.Graphics: This game was made in 1998, don't expect beautiful sights like in Assassin's Creed or Mass Effect (I know, two different genres entirely, but best comparisons I can thing of). The graphics are decent enough and good for the time it was made, but the story makes up for the graphics. If you want eye candy, this is the WRONG game for you.Size: The game spanned over five, even six disks if you had Tales of Sword Coast. So the game is long. The size of the world is rather decent, numerous side zones, towns and cities from where you start in Candlekeep to Baldur's Gate itself, the world is almost all open to exploration. every building with a door, every mine shaft and tent. As long as the cursor changes to a wheel for travel or a door, you can enter. Might not get a good welcome, but you can enter.Difficulty: The game's difficulty CAN be set, but even on easy it's fairly challenging. Not much more I can say on this factor.Over all, this game is well worth it and a great buy.			"

I am really glad that the game was re-released, but it's incredibly frustrating to see that it has not been patched to allow a relatively smooth multiplayer experience. PLEASE FIX THE MULTIPLAYER! THE GAME DESERVES TO BE PLAYED AGAIN!!!!			"

												I have played Baldurs gate when I was very young, and I found it enjoyable then, however since I got this game and got a better understanding of the game mechanics and how everything works, I found the entire game worth the money. The story is possibly the best out of any game series.			"

												If you are a DnD fan or just love fantasy adventure this is your kind of game. It takes classes and skills from ADnD and plays out just like that kind of game you get quest, epic loot and enjoy a wide cast of characters and places to see. The game pretty much starts out with you being set on a quest with no idea of what to do after the opening quest and setting up of the story line the game sets you in a map lets you meet a well rounded group of people for your party point you in a direction and then lets you go. The story is wonderful and side quest to boot are just enjoyable and finding loot off a monster or bandit is jsut as exciting as the last time. The only downside I can see is the Multiplayer you need to set the characters yourself and have a friend in the game to join, If you do want to do this I suggest you and a friend play together and set a time to play (just like a tabletop DnD game yay!) other wises this may confuses you and seem useless to you.In short a good old fastion RPG set in a DnD style with plenty of replay value with how many classes and moral option you can  be and the cast of characters is big enough you will not hear the same diolog so many times on each play though.

												One of my most favorite games of all time, just saying. Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is probably the quintessential definition of a C-RPG. This game handles like a C-RPG would; you can play the game in real-time(not recommended) or you can pause after each turn, each character takes their turn at the same time, mind you. This game's story is excellent and the writing is top-notch; no complaints. The graphics are nice and are easy on the eyes, nothing that requires a gtx Titian or anything; you could run the game on a toaster. When you start up the game, the game tells you to play the tutorial(I think?). The game itself has a steep learning curve, however if you stick to it and get at least a small grasp of the game; much fun is to be had. I can't really say anything bad about the game. Did I mention the storytelling and dialogue; it's fantastic, the stuff of legends. No compliants at all 95/100.			"

												Ok, for the quick summery, read this part. If you want more in depth, read past this. I've played Baldur's Gate since 2003 or so finished the game twice total. Only five years after it originally released in 1998. This game is basically my childhood. Over all, this game is much like the original with additions of a new class and the half-orc race of Baldur's Gate 2 and now, there's even more customization in the stats. Over all, the story is the same and enhanced on with new characters. If you're into hard-core RPGs that will last you days, buy this game. It's well worth it. But if you want something that has less time investment, don't go for this.Now for in-depthCharacter Customization: Now, this is an old game, this isn't Skyrim. Your character customization won't be ranging from weight to dirt color. The customization is in the stats: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Willpower, Intellect, and Constitution as well as what weapon proficiency you have from one handed sword to katanas, from two handed swords to halberds and from bow to sling. Then if you chose a caster class what spells you have from the beginning. You can chose your class from the traditional: Fighter, mage, thief to things like cleric, specialized mage, multi-classing, ranger, ect. Then race (which has different stats for each) from human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, halfling, half-orc, ect. The only physical customization of the character is in the portrait, gender, hair color, skin color and clothing major and minor colors. That's it.Gameplay: Now, the gameplay is DnD combined with RTS. You control your party of 6 max, including your character (who, if dies, is game over). You can pause whenever to cast spells, which is turn based. I.E. It could take two turns to cast a Heal Minor Wounds spell or a turn to cast a magic missiles or even five to cast a lightning storm or summoning spell. You can loot items from weapons (which CAN and WILL break by the way. So ALWAYS have a spare!) to armor, to enchanted items which you'll need a mage or the money to identify what they are (don't auto-equip these assuming they're better. They might be cursed items!) If you're a fan of DnD you'll love the gameplay.Story: Without spoilers, the story is amazing and in depth. On disk it spanned over 5 disks and a sixth for the expansion, so the game itself, for the day, was MASSIVE. Games now are 8-12 hrs, possibly a tad more to finish the game, maybe even more than that.. If you want 100% and to actually finish this game successfully, you'll need about a week or two. So prepare for time investment.Graphics: This game was made in 1998, don't expect beautiful sights like in Assassin's Creed or Mass Effect (I know, two different genres entirely, but best comparisons I can thing of). The graphics are decent enough and good for the time it was made, but the story makes up for the graphics. If you want eye candy, this is the WRONG game for you.Size: The game spanned over five, even six disks if you had Tales of Sword Coast. So the game is long. The size of the world is rather decent, numerous side zones, towns and cities from where you start in Candlekeep to Baldur's Gate itself, the world is almost all open to exploration. every building with a door, every mine shaft and tent. As long as the cursor changes to a wheel for travel or a door, you can enter. Might not get a good welcome, but you can enter.Difficulty: The game's difficulty CAN be set, but even on easy it's fairly challenging. Not much more I can say on this factor.Over all, this game is well worth it and a great buy.			"

												Baldur's Gate is one of those games that redefined CRPGs. While the original '98 release can be played, the Enchanced Edition adds quite a few needed fixes, additions and a little pick-me-up to function on modern computers and with modern players. Stats, tables and desperately needed explanations on what stat increases what function of your spell or swordslinging with a layout that is much more comfortable to your eyes than the original stone-carved stat screen.Starting out as a snot-nosed adventurer and rising up to be the would-be savior of the Sword Coast, your main character is what you want him to be: From Fighters to clerics, thieves and spellcasters, BG:EE adds all the proficiencies, weapon styles, spells and kits from Baldur's Gate 2 to the original and then some. No more spending that one Cloudkill scroll on a single battle, as it can be written and memorized by a Level 9 Wizard. It also comes with the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion, giving you a much more tolerable level cap, if you happen to be a perfectionist when it comes to clearing quest logs.As curious extras, BG:EE adds *gasp* ORIGINAL CONTENT in the form of three New NPCS, new gear and a battle arena mini-campaign. These extras by no means overshadow the original saga one might have come to love, but add a few needed pinches of charm here and there for parties of all alignments. As a bonus, most of these additions continue their tale in BG2:EE, but that's a completely different story. TL;DR, Go for the eyes, Boo, GO FOR THE EYES, RAAAAaaAAaaAarrrRgGgghhhhhhHH!! even after 15 years..			"

												It's an oldie but a goodie. Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition plays like a strategy game with RPG elements, so it takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to games like Skyrim or more modern D&D games like Neverwinter Nights. Lots of thought and planning is required if you want to survive. The graphics are, of course, much lower quality than modern games (most characters are little more than ""sprites""), but that is to be expected. The dialogue and storytelling is what makes it memorable.I haven't gotten very far (just recently met the famous Minsc and Boo) but I already love it. Highly recommended for Forgotten Realms lovers.			"

												I played this when it 1st came out & I thought it was the best rpg ever to come out at the time. Playing now & I'm happy to say it's still one of the best even compared to more modern heavyweights like Dragon Age or even Skyrim. This game game is played as a 2d topdown view so the graphics are not as good as more modern games but the scope & depth of the gameplay outshines Dragon Age & rivals anything in the Elder Scrolls series (my current favorites).Before getting this game, keep in mind you will have to pay attention to things like encumberance, fatigue, spell memorization and tracking quests yourself (you get an automated journal but there is no auto quest tracking feature like a lot of newer games, such as The Witcher or Skyrim have) but that's part of the fun. This game can be hard, especially at low levels, but the satisfaction you feel when you complete a quest or gain a level is magnified because of that. All in all Baldur's Gate is still one of the best out there & is definately worth getting.			"

Then Baldur's Gate Turbo came out, and we were like ""Ok great, now it's going to be Baldur's Gate 2 right?""  Then we got Baldur's Gate Ultimate Arcade Edition Turbo.  Well, where's Baldur's Gate 2?  Now we've just been given Baldurs Gate Enhanced Edition.  This is a combination of the ultimate, arcade, and turbo editions of the game, as well as all of the DLC Characters unlocked.  Other new content includes an endless assault mode, and a time attack mode.  However, as with other 'upgrades' to Baldur's Gate, E. Honda is nowhere to be found.  I believe this is because capcom wants to promote a positive body image, that Mr.Honda doesn't fall into, proving that capcom hates fat people.  It's ironic as most of the people who still purchase and play these games are in fact fat asian school girls.			"

												With a compelling story, great writing, neat monsters, legitimately interesting characters, and lots of dark corners to explore, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BG:EE) is an alluring RPG. I could easily drop hours into this game just wandering around talking to NPC's, collecting quests, and going off the road in wilderness zones--all of those things are rewarding despite being completely optional. This is a great game. Once your eyes adjust to a 90s spectrum, it's also a great LOOKING game. The new content is also well-integrated, and the new characters provide a nice bonus for veterans of the 90s iteration.Unfortunately, BG:EE is held back by the tabletop rules set it emulates. Slow level advancement and combat being resolved purely by random chance makes the game needlessly frustrating in its early stages. The Nashkell mines are especially painful. One minute you're murking every kobold (reptilian terriers who live underground and get off on ambushing adventurers in their sleep) at-will, and the next thing you know your party is completely wiped out by a lone survivor because no one could roll above a 10 to hit. Stupid THAC0. The slow advancement means you could play the game for several real hours, mowing down waves of enemies, and see no real improvement in your characters' ability to deal with enemies. It can be very tedious. Combine these flaws with an abundance of combat, and the whole thing plays out like a scripted roguelike. Although combat grated on my nerves at times, I don't necessarily have a complaint about the tough difficulty. For example, when my main character was one-hit killed by an arrow trap in the mines, I cringed but remembered all the warnings I got about traps and used the party's thief to meticulously scout them out upon reloading. The game's difficulty improves the experience: figuring out ways to keep your walking targets safe in the face of lots of cheapshotting obstacles adds a dimension of gameplay missing in this post-Diablo RPG climate.I do recommend BG:EE though. Anyone willing to endure the frustrating tedium of the early game combat will find a challenging and rewarding experience within.			"

												You'd have to read all the reviews of the original Baldurs Gate to know how wonderful this game is. I've played through it many times and always had a great deal of fun. The new version fixes all of the bugs (veterans will appreciate that) and adds just enough new features to make it fresh but not so many as to make it feel like a new game entirely. Highly recommended for fans of the original, and also newcomers wanting to know what all the fuss is about.-EDIT -Have to give this a thumbs down. After a so-called patch a while back, the game no longer works properly in Windows 7. Emailed the company along with the error file. They took a while to get back to me and said they cant do anything and consider the matter to be closed. If you want to play Baldurs Gate you will have to get the GOG edition or the DVD version that comes in the D&D boxed set along with B♥♥♥♥nd NWN 1.			"

												The game is great and an improvement on the original, mainly because of the higher resolutions without mods and the additional characters. However part of me thinks that it is a bit overpriced, but thats probably because I have bought this game several different times, once when it first came out on multiple CD, then the rare DVD version, then the BG collection and then this. However I got it on sale so it was a bargain.The game was quite unique for its time, as you could spend hours doing side missions like Elderscrolls games and just progress the main quest whenever you felt like it. You can also do much more than most simple RPGs, like stealing from stores, pick pocketing people, lockpicking and it also has the brilliant Bioware dialog which kinda went downhill after Mass Effect.All in all a brilliant game which is great fun for up to 6 players.

												The enhanced edition does not bring much to the table. The pathfinding is still awful. Some of the sound design as well. And the overall feeling is still way inferior to its sequel.BUT this is still Baldur's Gate nonetheless. Hours of exploring, fighting, levelling, stuffing, questing, minscing, etcing. An amazing old school RPG with a lot of depth in it. Highly recommended.			"

												I highly recommend this game. Of course it isn't up to snuff of current video graphics, but don't let that fool you. The story is highly in depth with plenty of side content as well. Based on Advanced Dungeons and & Dragons; I highly doubt this game will disappoint. If you like in depth and difficult challenges you will enjoy this game. I first played this game when I was very young and I've loved it ever since. The replay value is exceptional as well. Character development is very indepth and you will undoubtedly fall in love with them.			"

												The original Baldur's Gate is a masterpiece; if you already have it, no need to buy the Enhanced Edition as it honestly doesn't add anything worthwhile, and the stuff it does add (3 NPCs among other things), are nowhere near the level of quality as the original BG in my opinion. Higher resolutions and widescreen are nice, but those could be modded already. A good reason to still buy the Enhanced Edition though, and the reason I bought it, is the ability to play it natively on any platform (in my case Linux). This to me is well worth the full price of the Enhanced Edition.			"

												Forgot how much I loved this game!Now, this is not the type of updated/enhanced version that changes what the game is. Not in the least. It is still very much the same old school Baldur's Gate I first fell in love with. If I were to issue any complaint, it's that the AI is still incredibly dumb and it took only 10 minutes of having NPCs to realize, ""Oh yeah... that. They didn't fix that at all.""But you do notice all the little tweaks they added and despite its age, the gameplay is relatively smooth, once you et the hang of the controls.I remember the first time I played the original, I took a Half-Elven Magic User and let fighter NPCs take point. This time, I decided to be a bit more adventuerous and took a Gnomish Fighter/Illusionist. I was a bit disappointed to learn that it wouldn't be the classic AD&D Illusionist, but a modified Magic User, but in terms of game play for Baldur's Gate, that actually works out quite well.I'm looking forward to a bit of a game break, but my next one will definitely be the enhanced Baldur's Gate 2.

												The enhanced edition has made some slight improvements in mechanics that really helps. They have also put in some stuff from BG2 which is nice. The new art style is horrible though and the new characters are lousy.The character creation is the thing they really improved upon and I love it. Finally the ranger can be a good archer, finally I can use 2 swords, finally paladins are... well, paladins are still useless.If you never played this game before there are some things you want to know. This is a game with low levels. Your mage will be über-helpfull but wont be a source of epic power. You will have to get a team of six characters which by themselves wont do much, but together will rock. The gameplay in this RPG is focused on tactics and balance between the characters in your team. This is no hack&slash no brainer. Not to say that it is major brainer, but still. It is a game with good story, funny side characters and entertaining gameplay.Overall, this is still one of the best RPG ever!PS: It works on LINUX!			"

												I've always loved classical version of Baldur's Gate. Enhanced Edition brings all of the memories back with full support for modern day high resolution screens. Changing the Infinity Engine to newer version makes the game so much better with additonal BG2 items. New characters make player excited, despite the game being 16 years old.It also works on Linux despite not being marked for Linux in SteamPlay.			"

												Hard not to recommend BG and the like... classics. So a Thumbs up. Did the EE team do a great job? Short answer - No. They didn't improve on much... the graphics are not brand new or amazing, just ok. I think character animations are the same, if not then they are just there, nothing impressive. They added back some things that were removed in original patches like the hidden ring at the Friendly Arm Inn, which was a huge boon for mages. The new characters and voice acting are ok, I have not used them all... but the overall impression is it was a quick and dirty job. The new companions  are available but its hard to find a party compilation that works with them all due to original party members having allegiances that means you take two of them or none. Not the EE teams fault but they didn't really think it through it seems. Forces you to miss the new or have a wacky group.Some EE team’s criticism. Pathing is still not great, in tight corridors if you tell your 6 man team to move and the guy at the back hits a wall of bodies, he/she will decide they have to go another way and start off in a different direction. Not often, but if you are going to “enhance” a game old pathing issues should be fixed.VERY Minor spoilers below but helps show what I mean about the new EE stuff just not being thought out. The new wild mage companion takes you to a new area. A goblin will escort you to a cave. By following the goblin and listening to his voice acting, which was kind of cute/fun you miss a side quest for the cave, and I think you’d miss the goblins voice acting if you didn’t skip the side quest and follow him. So after the cave you explore the area, find a side quest and now you must go back. You need to find a thing in the cave, but that thing has garbage loot on top of it (non-magical junk - shortswordx2, leather armor and a helm) so if like me, your inventory is full and weight limit is near capacity; are you going to pick that loot up? Probably not. Unfortunately in order to interact with the item you need, you have to move/loot the garbage. So, I googled it and realized the item had to be there so I looted the garbage and ah ok. The item you need, lets say it is a belt. Was it in the pile of garbage, no... you can only see/""interact"" with the belt after looting the other items it should have been included with. Like C'mon. What a run around for very little gain. You meet a guy that buys wolf pelts. None of the random spawns drop them. I could go on... New material is great… Full price for half thought out & poorly implemented new material… mehTldr;Bottom line is if you have never played BG – do it, right now. Amazing RPG, better if you understand D&D rules, and even this older top down style grows on you quickly. But imho the EE team did very little to earn your money, get it on sale.			"

												Heya it's me, Imoen ! Baldur's Gate : Enhanced Edition - back to the roots, to the game released in 1998 that turned me into a RPG lover. Even then, I enjoyed it so much that it became my favourite game for years, until Dragon Age : Origins came out.This is why I could not have been happier when I heard about the Enhanced Edition project : playing this fatastic game again on recent configurations, with a visual upgrade, lots of optimizations and improvements, and even new content. For not only the Enhanced Edition includes the original campaign and the Sword Coast expansion pack, but it also introduces four new companions with different personalities (which means new quests and areas) and the Black Pits, a new and short gladiator-like adventure.Baldur's Gate is a complex RPG based on Dungeon & Dragons rules, taking place in the Sword Coast with an adjustable difficulty. One of the highlights of the game has always been the story, a thrilling scenario of intrigues and revelations, in a huge universe waiting to be explored. From the opening to the battles, through the stuff, the actions, the stats, the turns and the dice rolls, everything is connected and quite complicated if you're not familiar with that kind of game. A simple foretaste at the beginning, with the character creation ; you'll have so many choices to make : ability scores, race, classes (the Enhanced Edition allows the players to pick the specilizations that only appeared in Baldur's Gate 2 at first), alignment, skills, abilities / spells... And those are just a start. There are so many different classes and ways to deal with everything according to your alignment and actions that the game basically offers itself for a replay.I wouldn't recommend Baldur's Gate for people who play for the graphics because, despite the update, Beamdog maintained the particular and original isometric style, that totally fits the kind of game in my humble opinion. The combat system can be confusing at first as well : it's a modified turn-based system in which everybody has his own initiative round. That makes the battles quite slow with a heavy use of the pause button. But do not think it's easy for all that : on the contrary. You'll need strategy, a good team composition and smart use of potions / spells / items.Nostalgia ! Baldur's Gate : Enhanced Edition brings an amazing classic back to life with brio. Relive this incredible adventure up to date with a beautiful soundtrack and a high resolution support, with charming companions or co-op with your friends.			"

												I own these games with all the dlc on my tablet and now I do on steam. 100% worth purchasing it all twice. Don't listen to the ""gamergate"" kids. There's no ""liberal lgbt agenda"" there's no morals shoved down your throat, theres no changed content. There is only extra, excellent I might add, optional content that has been added. It's the same game I grew up loving but, just, with MORE. How could anyone complain about that? Oh, that's right, a female was involved with writing the new content (that you don't have to play if you don't feel inclined to). Such a travesty...There are complaints about UI problems, bugs, glitches, etc. I have over 100 hours now between tablet play and on PC and have found none of these issues. The UI is updated to be more user friendly between platforms. It's like a sleek version of the original BG2 UI. It's fine. If there are bugs and problems that exist that I haven't found, well, it's a video game. These things happen. All in all, this is an amazing, fantastic purchase (even at full price) and 100% worth your hours of time and money. All I can surmise is that the dozens of bad reviews are from the gamergate hivemind just making things up because they're mad that women exist in the gaming industry. Buy this game. Play this game. Be happy.			"

Epic is scope and filled with iconic Realmsian characters (Drizzt, Elminster), this game is a must have for any RPG fan.

												So traveling deep into the world of D&D but ona computer, well this has to be played to believe! I am an avid ""D&D"" enthuiasit and all i can say is playing this has opened my eyes to what is plausable with modern times. You can take on a whole party of your creation, or have the ingame characters join you, and with some of the characters backstories out of this world I cannot praise this enough. Built back in the 90ies there are some general bugs and glitches that happends and you can say this is part of the added ""charm"" but then again when your playing it can cause the old fashioned rage quits! The path tracking is redicilous! I must reccomend this to anyone who enjoys DND as its story line is tradition to a T. Anyone wanting to take a break from Final fantasy, or Try something new, prepare for an indepth world and a storyline like no other, unearth the mysterys that lie within. Call this a prerequisit to divinity as that is only where you can head from here!			"

												The original Baldur's Gate series are easily one of the best PC RPGs. With an intricate plot, tens of side quests, and well fleshed characters and NPCs, the games build an immersive world that you would love to go back to again and again.The Enhanced Edition is exactly what it says on the tin - a well-polished and updated version of the beloved classic. With improved graphics, backported concepts from BGII, and new features, it is a must-have for any RPG fan.			"

												Great to see a game from my childhood come back like this! BG is the greatest PC RPG ever made. The intricacy of the game is unbelievable. To think that back then you could get a detailed bard song from a completely irrelevant NPC or encounter people dealing with problems that have no relation to what you're doing is what makes this game so quirky and fun.

												It is a really good upgrade to the old Baldur's gate game. Yesterday did i Start playing through the enhanced version and so far have it been super fun, brought back lots of memories and the improvements to the interface and to the screen display makes it very enjoyable when it is combined with the good and unique Baldurs gate storyline, side quests etc. My only complaint:I want to buy some DLC's for this game with extra items, extra avatars, extra areas, extra quests etc etc but they are not selling such DLC's.I would also like to see DLC's for Baldurs gate 2.I did test, that i would be able to transfer my party to Baldur's gate 2 and that is possible and easy. I just have to manually copy the save game from the Baldur's gate 1 save game folder to the Baldur's gate 2 save game folder.I also tested, that my ranger (archer) will be allowed to choose a new favoured enemy when the character is imported into Baldur's gate 2 and that is indeed possible. Important, since Baldur's gate 1 only allow you to choose favoured enemies from those races you can meet in Baldur's gate 1.			"

												although i havent finished the game yet, i know from a lot of people, and critics, that this is one of the best rpg's of all time with its sequal being perhaps the greatest of all, and i am a new player to the series after seeing the kickstarters for games like torment and pillars of eternity. and i can say that i love this game a TON. it was a little difficult getting into, but im so glad i did. im dying to play pillars now, and im glad i saw the kickstarters, and listened to my older brother who told me to try it out. (hes much older than i and played the originals when they were new and is a big rpg fan)  so at last im going to say, if you like rpg's and dont know about getting used to the older style, and lack of voice acting, i highly encourage you to get over it and take the time to learn and play this game. im only 19, and this game is before my time, but that didnt stop me. please please please try it for yourself new players, its worth the time and money, and if youre totally not sure, wait for a sale. im looking forward to BG2:EE now.

												I am really liking this game.  I really did not have time to play the original when I had it, but I did buy it, and felt it was a waste.  But now this edition and having a bit more time feels wonderful as I am in a way experiencing it for the first time since it has been so long since I have in the first place.  Ignore the bad reviews, you will like this game, and it is not forgiving if you kill a character they are not coming back remember this alright?  You can have characters resurrected I mean, but what if you did not have the GP to do such a transaction, I treat this game as such; an unforgiving game where if you did you lose your char forever.  Think of it as fire emblem and tactical battles in suikoden games where such choices/mechanics existed.			"

												Baldur's Gate is an excellent computer version of the old AD&D (2nd edition) system. The story is good, the characters excellent and the graphics were beutiful when the game was new. Although the graphics isn't particularly impressive now it is not as anoying as some other old games are when you revisit them 15+ years after release, visually the game manages to be rather pleasing despite it's original release data in the mid-90s.Personally I don't feel that the ""Enhanced Edition"" adds that much to the game, but there was no need to do that either. The new NPCs are alright and the additional quests are fine, though. Beamdog have also corrected some bugs that existed in the original game. It's nice to play this game without having to dig out my five old scratched discs...Definitely recommended for old ad&d nerds, but the clunky system will probably terrify most of the WoW-generation. Overall I think that many younger players may find the game difficult to get to past the first level (and being level 1 in ad&d is horrible), you need to reach at least level 3 before the game gets manageable.

There is wonderful variation in your character creation to build your main character however you want, and then with different NPCs you choose to join you your parties will have very different approaches giving you different games within the same overall story. Though there are plenty of side stories to keep you occupied and you are not obliged to race headlong chapter by chapter.			"

You will find your character leveling slowly, but that should be a tell for you to enjoy the story more. Seriously, there is a lot of work in this game.And for those of my friends who know the Forgotten Realms, this will be such a great game for you guys. Elminster, Drizzt, Cadderly, and the great Baeloth the Entertainer... You will never be so scared of fireballs as you will be with this game.Slightly difficult to get the hang of at first.

The current patch did not only make the game look worse, no! The new UI is unbearably bad and somehow removed features. Why can't I open my containers in a shop any more while selling items? And what in the world happend to the spellbooks and the journal in general?Old graphic glitches in item descriptions are either back or haven't ever been fixed in the years this has been out. Bugs that have been reported in 2013 on their forums are still in this game.And the best of all: even Beamdog's writers don't appreciate this game. You know what? Just play the original.

It gets very, very deep if you pay a lot of attention to not just the main characters but also to all the side-story characters.Overall, I give this game a 9/10, as no game can ever be perfect.

												While there are a few bugs, the enhanced edition is worth your time as opposed to buying the originals. The new characters (Or most of them, anyway. Rasaad is honestly terrible from a gameplay standpoint. Who made the decision to give him horrible stats?) are well worth the time investment. Their storylines add a lot to the generally lonely feel of Baldur's Gate 1. They have a few dialogs with the character and while the romances are simplistic they at least add a little bit of flavor.Though the enhanced edition has its own seperate set of flaws it fixed a lot of the annoying aspects of the original. I'd suggest this game to anyone looking for a game that will pull you in and take you for a ride through why RPG's are so fun in the first place.			"

												I won't talk about Baldur's Gate itself, because it's easily one of the best RPGs ever (if not THE best) and that's all that needs to be said, so I'll focus on the EE features only.An enhanced edition of Baldur's Gate will always have to be compared to BG Tutu, which does similar job and has been around way longer. Like EE, Tutu offers better resolution and fixes bugs (in fact, more of them than EE does). While I still prefer Tutu over EE, I think EE is well done and likely better for players who are not willing to spend hours/days picking the right set of mods. Moreover, EE has extra content - The Black Pits arena and 4 new NPCs.I was surprised myself that I mostly liked the new NPCs. Since all four of them are of different class than the original potential party members, EE offers new strategies, which is something both new and veteran players can enjoy. Baeloth (who is a bit hard to obtain, since he's an easter egg) was even a key member in my party and I can recommend EE just for the perk of having him around. Who wouldn't want to give orders to a brash drow sorcerer?The Black Pits is, frankly, an add-on for powergamers and nothing else. If you are in the game mainly for the combat, you'll enjoy it; if not, don't bother trying the arena at all. It's not related to the main story in any way (unless you count Baeloth). Nonetheless, the fights can be fun and challenging, so there's that.Overall, I'd say that EE is a good way of keeping Baldur's Gate alive and adjusted to 21st century. It adds new content that fits in nicely with the original game and spares players the need to poke around game files themselves. But if you're someone who's been playing Baldur's Gate for a few years, you probably know BG Tutu and have modded the game yourself by now. In that case, EE is redundant.			"

												A higher definition remake of the classic CRPG by Black Isle.  While not as flexible as the original when it comes to the modding community, this game still has a lot to offer.  From beginning to end, you are treated to a detailed story with tons of sub-stories that never (or almost never) detract from the story or overarching plot in any way.  The companion characters you encounter along the way each have their own personalities and interesting agendas, so take heed of who you keep with you!  Among new additions to the game are 3 (or rather 4, because ""secret"") NPCs, each with a distinct playstyle and alignment, new quests, new items, an arena combat mini-game, and all the goodies from the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion pack for the original.  While this doesn't seem like much, it's still enough to add a couple of hours (at least) to the game itself.  Plus, the BGEE community has worked to bring some of the old mods back into this day and age in hopes of making them Enhanced Edition compatible...  So, time will tell with how that goes.Difficulty can be ruthlessly hard due to its classic no-training-wheels approach.  At times, dungeons can feel clunky because of this and outright frustrating, this is also due to the AD&D mechanics that the game is based on.  Also, the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (which this game is set in) is not for everyone.  Besides being a 'vanilla fantasy setting' on all accounts, the Bethesda-esque essential-NPCs can sometimes distract from the environment in certain cases.  If you can overlook these things, BGEE will be a fantastic adventure for you!			"

												Baldur's Gate is called a classic RPG for a reason. A very simple reason. It's good. Very good. The story, the characters, and the D&D lore all shine in this game. The combat is mroe interesting as a spellcaster then a physical character however, mostly because walking up and smacking someone with a sword can get boring. Like I said though, the story, lore, characters, and just overall gameplay more then make up for it. As an actualy tabletop roleplayer, I can say this game is deep enough to satisfy my D&D needs when my group is too busy buying 600$ TF2 hats to actually get together.9/10			"

												Are you a lover of RPG's? Do you enjoy engaging stories that grab every inch of you attention? Are you willing to play with and infuse your imagination into a world with a very rich and interesting mythology and history? Look no further!The Baldur's Gate series was and still is the crowning RPG series, the one to rule them all and in the darkness of Bhaal bind them. So of course the question is how does this enhanced edition work out?Perfectly. The new companions are interesting with their own back stories that really expand the rather modest repertoire of companion stories This is of course compared to today's standards with games like Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age, and Fallout: New Vegas. Keep in mind that the original Baldur's Gate was released in 1998 and it still makes me onanate and♥♥♥♥♥♥me britches from the awesomeness of it. They are prevalently assigned classes that were not in the original, but were in Baldur's Gate 2. The old one. This edition also provides some new locations to explore and have fun with (though they are mostly tied to the new companions). Some might be dissapointed because the original was, with all the mods, a far superior game, in many ways exceeding this newer version. But, and I say this with tears of joy dripping down my red colored baby chins, the modding community and the community as a whole are strong with this one and the mods are already coming out in numbers. My favourite is the NPC Banter mod, which gives just so much to the game that it's a must. Companions get these thinking and emotional dimensions that just must be experienced. It's still in development, but it already does wonders.I'd write more, but I must go feast on the flesh of kobolds now and help an infernal looking kid find his dog. Good day, adventurers!			"

												Play through this game, then solo it, then solo it with the Cursed Sword of Beserking +3, see how you do, be sure to remove curse if you want to open secret doors (That's my only advice), but then use the sword again, I did it, so can you, it is hard but fun.I love this game so much!

												Edit: DO NOT BUY!Beamdog has done what I could not have forseen, with their ridiculous Siege of Dragonspear expansion they have managed to turn the original Baldur's Gate Games into a blurry mess of Arcanum-style character sprites and failed UI-""upgrades"". You now have to scroll in your spellbooks, just so that the new kids don't actually have to learn the symbols (which is psychologically idiotic, cuz humans are good at symbolism), the edge of the map now hangs halfway into your screen killing immersion in the process, etc..This does not feel like Baldur's Gate anymore. I tried to play it. I tried to see the good in it, like the more organized journal, but it didn't come to me.Do not buy this anymore until they fix this. I'm going back to my Big World versions. Goodbye Neera.-------I will never understand the haters of this excellent remake. I also bought BG1+2 as original 6/4-CD versions when they came out. First in german, than a few years later as english DVDs, then at GoG again when they came on sale and I still bought the EE's of both games.And you know what? They've done everything right!1) The small tweaks go over extremly well, like 80 arrows per quiver slot.2) The engine works flawlessly and the little UI enhancements alone were worth the money to me.3) The new NPCs are mostly great. I especially adore Neera, who is so very different from the rest, maybe with the exception of Tiax. I also like Dorn, because both BGs generally lacked evil party NPCs that weren't overacting or plain insane.4) Both EE's are easy to mod. Most Gibberling's & Co mods work, but you need far less of them. The 12-hour-installation of the Big World Project was a pain in the rear, and it usually took me several tries.To sum it up, Beamdog delivered a pure Baldur's Gate experience with excellent new content in a very polished package.

												Great adaptation of 2nd edition D&D. If you like to play D&D and want a video game format this is as close as you are going to get. The graphics can be a little... old at times, but in no way does this take away from the story and characters which are the heart of this game.			"

												I had previously attempted to play Baldur's Gate a few years ago and had given up, believing the controls and menus too difficult and intricate to be worth the time learning. Additionally, the number of times I died in combat against the weakest of opponents filled me with a nerdy, indignant rage which in turn demotivated me to try this game again.However, having played it with other people who know how to play the game well for a couple of hours and being walked through the gameplay step by step, I have changed my mind about it. Yes, it's very difficult and yes, it can be infuriating - but it is more fun when you play in a group. It is not like the Diablo series, or Dungeon Siege, or the Divinty games - this game is really hard. If anything, it holds a likeness to Dragon Age in terms of the difficulty and the mechanics. If you are up for a challenge and know someone who knows this game like the back of their hand, odds are you'll enjoy it. ***			"

												One of the greatest RPG PC games ever (both games and expansions). I own at least four different versions. The four disc set, a two-disc version, BG:EE and BG2:EE on Steam, and the digital versions on GoG. If you like D&D or isometric RPG's you have to play this. However, to be completely honest I would suggest the GoG versions (easier to mega-mod), unless you like it and want to support the new versions and get the new content.			"

												The very first RPG game I ever played, and by far one of the best. With an amazing story, and interesting characters, this game has lots of replay value. Trying to do it all will cap out your exp long before you finish the final quest.With the Enhanced Edition, some fun new characters are introduced, and it's nice to be able to pick a Kit right from the start.My two biggest complaints are not really all that bad. First, while you can create and role-play as an evil hero, there isn't really a benefit to doing this. All the good rewards are for the good quest endings. Being bad just doesn't pay. Second, with dozens of party members to choose from, there are really only a select few who are worth it. Most are either created with stats that are too weak, or are available too late in the game to be a real consideration. Of course, having one or two weaker companions wont break the game, still kind of sucks knowing you are not as strong as you could be if you brought along another member.I've purchased this game 3x over the years. Once as a special pre release at a video game convention when I was in high school on a whim with out knowing what it was. A second time years later after college, when I had lost the original while moving. And now a 3rd time, as the Enhanced Edition. Worth every penny.			"

												Here it is; the myth, the legend. The infamous Baldur's Gate. A high water mark in the CRPG genre, and still considered one of the greatest games of all time even to this day. I happen to agree with these claims. I grew up playing Baldur's Gate, and it has always held a special place in my heart as a gamer. This is about as pure as it gets, it is truly the grand daddy of current western RPGs, you can see playing this game how many of the new games still take inspiration and mechanics from it. If you are an RPG fan, I suggest giving this game a shot. It is very inexpensive and is absolutely worth your money. While it uses the AD&D 2nd edition rules set (My personal favorite), after you get used to the rules, the game really opens up and lets you customize and thrive on the Sword Coast of Faerun. I highly recommend this classic CRPG that defined a genre and became the gold standard that current roleplaying games still borrow from and honor. Baldur's Gate truly is one of the greatest games of all time, and I believe that if you give it a chance, you will understand why so many make that claim and believe it!			"

												Baldur's Gate is an excellent computer version of the old AD&D (2nd edition) system. The story is good, the characters excellent and the graphics were beutiful when the game was new. Although the graphics isn't particularly impressive now it is not as anoying as some other old games are when you revisit them 15+ years after release, visually the game manages to be rather pleasing despite it's original release data in the mid-90s.Personally I don't feel that the ""Enhanced Edition"" adds that much to the game, but there was no need to do that either. The new NPCs are alright and the additional quests are fine, though. Beamdog have also corrected some bugs that existed in the original game. It's nice to play this game without having to dig out my five old scratched discs...Definitely recommended for old ad&d nerds, but the clunky system will probably terrify most of the WoW-generation. Overall I think that many younger players may find the game difficult to get to past the first level (and being level 1 in ad&d is horrible), you need to reach at least level 3 before the game gets manageable.

There is wonderful variation in your character creation to build your main character however you want, and then with different NPCs you choose to join you your parties will have very different approaches giving you different games within the same overall story. Though there are plenty of side stories to keep you occupied and you are not obliged to race headlong chapter by chapter.			"

												As good now as it was in 98'. Everything about Bauldur's Gate stands up to the demands of time, with all the story and challenge from a modern RPG, while still capturing that AD&D feeling. The new content justifies the additional cost, and with enhanced aspects of the game, especially the improved resolutions, it gives a good reason to purchase this, as opposed to using the old disks laying around in a binder somewhere in the basement. While improved overall, this is still a once-upon-a-time game, and has seen it's better days come and go. If you are a solid fan of RPGs, or an older player that remembers clicking away, eyes burned by the CRT monitor, then this is worth buying, but if you are unsure, then this is at least a sure fire win on a steam sale.

Yesterday did i Start playing through the enhanced version and so far have it been super fun, brought back lots of memories and the improvements to the interface and to the screen display makes it very enjoyable when it is combined with the good and unique Baldurs gate storyline, side quests etc. My only complaint:I want to buy some DLC's for this game with extra items, extra avatars, extra areas, extra quests etc etc but they are not selling such DLC's.I would also like to see DLC's for Baldurs gate 2.I did test, that i would be able to transfer my party to Baldur's gate 2 and that is possible and easy. I just have to manually copy the save game from the Baldur's gate 1 save game folder to the Baldur's gate 2 save game folder.I also tested, that my ranger (archer) will be allowed to choose a new favoured enemy when the character is imported into Baldur's gate 2 and that is indeed possible. Important, since Baldur's gate 1 only allow you to choose favoured enemies from those races you can meet in Baldur's gate 1.			"

												although i havent finished the game yet, i know from a lot of people, and critics, that this is one of the best rpg's of all time with its sequal being perhaps the greatest of all, and i am a new player to the series after seeing the kickstarters for games like torment and pillars of eternity. and i can say that i love this game a TON. it was a little difficult getting into, but im so glad i did. im dying to play pillars now, and im glad i saw the kickstarters, and listened to my older brother who told me to try it out. (hes much older than i and played the originals when they were new and is a big rpg fan)  so at last im going to say, if you like rpg's and dont know about getting used to the older style, and lack of voice acting, i highly encourage you to get over it and take the time to learn and play this game. im only 19, and this game is before my time, but that didnt stop me. please please please try it for yourself new players, its worth the time and money, and if youre totally not sure, wait for a sale. im looking forward to BG2:EE now.

												I am really liking this game.  I really did not have time to play the original when I had it, but I did buy it, and felt it was a waste.  But now this edition and having a bit more time feels wonderful as I am in a way experiencing it for the first time since it has been so long since I have in the first place.  Ignore the bad reviews, you will like this game, and it is not forgiving if you kill a character they are not coming back remember this alright?  You can have characters resurrected I mean, but what if you did not have the GP to do such a transaction, I treat this game as such; an unforgiving game where if you did you lose your char forever.  Think of it as fire emblem and tactical battles in suikoden games where such choices/mechanics existed.			"

												Here it is; the myth, the legend. The infamous Baldur's Gate. A high water mark in the CRPG genre, and still considered one of the greatest games of all time even to this day. I happen to agree with these claims. I grew up playing Baldur's Gate, and it has always held a special place in my heart as a gamer. This is about as pure as it gets, it is truly the grand daddy of current western RPGs, you can see playing this game how many of the new games still take inspiration and mechanics from it. If you are an RPG fan, I suggest giving this game a shot. It is very inexpensive and is absolutely worth your money. While it uses the AD&D 2nd edition rules set (My personal favorite), after you get used to the rules, the game really opens up and lets you customize and thrive on the Sword Coast of Faerun. I highly recommend this classic CRPG that defined a genre and became the gold standard that current roleplaying games still borrow from and honor. Baldur's Gate truly is one of the greatest games of all time, and I believe that if you give it a chance, you will understand why so many make that claim and believe it!			"

												Baldur's Gate is an excellent computer version of the old AD&D (2nd edition) system. The story is good, the characters excellent and the graphics were beutiful when the game was new. Although the graphics isn't particularly impressive now it is not as anoying as some other old games are when you revisit them 15+ years after release, visually the game manages to be rather pleasing despite it's original release data in the mid-90s.Personally I don't feel that the ""Enhanced Edition"" adds that much to the game, but there was no need to do that either. The new NPCs are alright and the additional quests are fine, though. Beamdog have also corrected some bugs that existed in the original game. It's nice to play this game without having to dig out my five old scratched discs...Definitely recommended for old ad&d nerds, but the clunky system will probably terrify most of the WoW-generation. Overall I think that many younger players may find the game difficult to get to past the first level (and being level 1 in ad&d is horrible), you need to reach at least level 3 before the game gets manageable.

There is wonderful variation in your character creation to build your main character however you want, and then with different NPCs you choose to join you your parties will have very different approaches giving you different games within the same overall story.

For me they downgrade the game experience and after giving them a try, I was happy to avoid them.That is it. :)			"

												One of the most epic fantasy role-playing computer games ever created. Based on the ruleset of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. If you are more worried about graphics and twitch gameplay, this game is not for you. However, if you enjoy an extremely thoughtful and massive storyline, in an immense environment, with almost no limits to character creation and advancement, not many do it better. It can be played like a Diablo style hack'n'slash, but it is more beneficial to use pausing to give orders to your party. Although it can be hard and frusterating at times, once you get used to it, it becomes easier to prepare for major battles so you don't end up having to restart from too far behind. I really cannot recommend this game enough for any fan of a traditional RPG, especially since this one is keeping so true to the original pen and paper.			"

Cons:Gameplay is pretty basic.It can get a bit repetitive after you figure out your fighting style each new fight isn't really different from the previous.  There are just no surprise elements.This is heavily dialogue driven as the fighting isn't that exciting or difficult. Overall impression:Fun game overall but I'm not likely to ever play through it completely again. "

												I definitely recommend this game as it's been a wonderful experience, getting back to it after years of never forgetting the original. I've had the chance to play it with a couple of friends, something I couldn't experience back then as it was a real struggle setting everything up compared to how easy it is nowadays.Anyway, about the game in itself, I find that this is a huge improvement compared to the original, with modifications really going in the right direction (better map with locations -even though they're kinda dumbing things down for explorers but whatever-, better journal with quests and new iterations appearing on screen while they're added, more classes and sub-classes, etc.)It's always been one of my favourite games of all times, and now I can show my friends why and let them agree on their own, which they do. So go on, buy, and play it if it's not already done !			"

												I Finished classic BG1 with and without Trinity mod million times. BG:T mod enables you to play BG1 in BG2 engine.I bought BG1EE here and BG1EE+BG2EE on GOG just because I love that game so much. However it is a complete disaster. Most of the things that made Baldur's Gate so great are gone. Creators of EE editions had no idea why BG was the best RPG of all time. I would advise you to buy the originals instead but Beamdog did some shady business and combined classics into their EE editions. Still if you can find them, use them instead.EDIT: Ok to be honest, EE edition is not that bad and I gave a negative review after Beamdog's statement that original Baldur's Gate game was sexist and flawed. This is completely unacceptable. I wont argue if it is true or not. If you dont like a game, instead of corrupting it with your own thoughts, you should make a new one and dont touch the story of a masterpiece like Baldur's Gate. And we all saw how that worked for them when they made a new game. Even with legendary characters like Minsc, the expansion was a total disaster in every way. Beamdog crossed the line with their narrow minded shallow story telling.			"

I don't know how you manage to ♥♥♥♥ up so badly trying to improve the graphics you somehow downgrade them but these guys did it.  Baldurs gate is great, I grew up playing it.  Highly reccomend it, it's a god damn classic.  I don't know about this edition though, you might be better off getting the original.			"

												I do still recommend this game after the changes.Were they horribly unneeded and spat on a classic? Yes.So why do I still recommend it?Because, if you go to the beta opting for the game, you can set the game to an older patch, 1.3 to be exact, which is before any of the unnecessary changes took place. So while yes, the update made the game far...far worse. I say EE is still the more stable version of the game as it stands for newer hardware and I'm happy to say that yes, you can infact, avoid that atrocious and unneeded update. If you still want to give them money or not is up to you, I honestly say they don't deserve it but the game itself is still worth it.Just so people stop freaking out as if there is no way to change everything back, I hope this helps some of you that planned on buying the game and were put off or people who already bought the game and were pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Although I will say the Multiplayer side of the game is pretty buggy, for both this and the second game. Not really sure why, but the connecting players tend to crash when loading new zones. It's best to get the original game if you want to use the multiplayer aspect.			"

												This game was mostly unplayable at launch due to bugs. For instance, the quest log--after I got to Chapter 5, it went away, impossible to know what the quests are, what to do, where to go. Just one of the many bugs. The people who give this glowing reviews did not finish the game. And, as you can see, I invested many hours into it. There are areas where if you talk to an NPC before doing something else, the game just about blows up--from talking to an NPC! Your party is stuck, unable to leave the zone. I mean, it's just one thing like that after another with this broken mess. Sure, it is nostalgic, it's FUN, but only if you dabble for a few minutes and then quit, as I suspect 99% of the reviewers out there have done. Play it to win it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. I played through most of the game's content but am not able to finish it to see how it ends.[addendum] Beamdog fixed a lot of bugs during 2014, and I quit playing at one point toward the end without actually finishing. As someone here and on forums has suggested, the game did have corrupted savegame file problems that made a HUGE mess out of the game if you happen to be unlucky enough to have run into it, where the only solution is to reload from an earlier save. My best guess is, I ran into one of those problems, continued playing, and the game was messed up forever after that. Very possible starting a new game with the final patch would clear it all up.That doesn't change the fact that the game was unplayable for me. And just because *you* played it through 100% without any issues, doesn't mean it didn't have problems last year.			"

Every playthrough I've had theres an army of maddening bugs; lag, no sound, etc. I love this series so much, but to see it violated as such is rather unpleasant. Buy the good old vanilla, go for fanmade mods instead. BG Tutu to mention one. The same applies to Shadow of Amn. "

												The Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate is not Baldur's Gate. It is worse than playing BG with the BG2 engine in TuTu or BGT, if you want to really understand Baldur's Gate. I'm not going to give any pros and cons. Why? Because they are only my opinions. If you really want to know for yourself, first -- and most importantly -- you must play the original Baldur's Gate(there is a original version up for grabs at GOG) at least once before any other version. Then, and only then, make up your own mind. Other people's opinions will only colour or cloud your objective opinion of which is best, and why... just like this thread will.That being said, aspects of EE feel cheap and unfinished. Any added elements that they tried to intergrate, like the extra voices or added character portraits, are truly horrendous and do not match with the original game's art design whatsoever. So it feels like I'm playing a version with horrible mods that I would have never added due to their subpar quality. It's like, ""hey, lets take a bunch of already made Baldur's Gate modes, cluster them together and release it as a new game for a ridiculous price praying on everyones nostalgia and games good name!""I wish these ""developers"" had some sort of shame to leave such a grand classic and pinacle of RPG era alone. Apparently not.One of the most disgusting attempts at money grab i've ever seen.I was a sucker to fall for it. Don't make a same mistake.			"

												More  like ""Beamdong""...I haven't played SoD yet, but it changes nothing about the poor experiences I had with Beamdog prior to Dragonspear, conerning their port of BG to iphone. It was terrible for SO LONG. They seemed not to care. For the longest time their solutions to certain problems (the sidebar buttons that remove the sidebar, but don't bring it back) were actually work-arounds that the community had discovered. The tone of their responses to people leaned toward defensive, and it is off-putting. From reading these customer reviews, it only further reassures me that I didn't make a mistake by being wary of Beamdog's newest venture. They should just make mods. It seems like that's what they'd rather do, than deal with any mistakes that they make, or the unhappy customers who feel duped when they buy a broken product, or have a less than positive opinion of said product. I really wanted to be happy about Beamdog's latest venture. But it seems I should not be. Which is fine. I'll find other retro/retro-styled games to get excited about. Tides of Numenara, for example.			"

												For an enhanced edition you have to consider price and what it really adds. So for full pirce do i recommend it? No. On sale? Perhaps. The glaring issue is baulders gate 1 + 2 can be bought more cheaply than this, and with mods (which gog.com tells you step by step how to install) you basically have all you wanted from this (aka wide screen). That being said standing alone is it good? Yes it is, is basically just baulder's gate 1 and that means it has many hours of adventure for those willing to seek it.  I personally would buy the originals and mod them but if this is on sale for a decent price (aka less than 50% of full price) it is worth it. Sadly steam bs system is recommended or not, so at full price its a no.			"

												Baldurs Gate is a old classic, a old gem and filled with nostalgia for many. The EE version polishes the old and adds some similar mechanics that mods used to add to the game. The game still to this day holds up pretty well and the EE version do add on more content. I myself do not hold it in the highest regard but the monk they added is probably the best written out of them all while the Black Pits is fun to test builds or parties in but nothing extremely ""must be played"" since it is only an arena campaign not tied to the storyline of the Bhaalspawn. What you get it what you buy, an enchanced version of the original game with a bit more content and some mod fixes glued on to it. The writing can be a bit ""Ham"" at times, cheesy and such but people praise it for being very ""funny"" and ""realistic"" since it is the kind of thing you would hear around a table in pen and paper. I would prefer a more dark and ""real"" tone myself but I can see why it is found funny by old wolves who enjoyed pen and paper campaigns in and around the Sword Coast. The main story is not bad either. Sarevok is a iconic villian much like Jon Irenicus in game two. The game also lack a lot of ""CnC"", choices and consequences and it do not really give much of options for you beside being a goody good guy, a ""I don't care but I do it anyway"" neutral person and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the part , where all three lead to the same D turnabout no matter if you pick option A, B or C before hand. But it do not effect much in the end, but I think atleast it could given us more options. Mostly you are portrayed to be the good side countering the evil side. Not to spoil anything but you are more or less bound to be the good person and playing evil will render you not getting all rewards or losing reputation like mad. Which is a pretty bad thing to lose.But the big big big but now is Siege of Dragonspear. It is tucked in a bit like someones fan fiction mod inbetween the two Baldurs Gate games and the ending chapter expansio nof Throne of Bhaal. Pretty much out of nowhere and it do not really fit. Some hate it for the writing, some hate it for being a cash cow, others find it to filled with shoe horned social justice things and other political agends, which I partially agree with. On the other hand I did not find the writing in retrospect to be so bombastic and excellent as people said it been before and I think I seen one or two well hidden, but non the less social justicy comentaries in the main game but so sublte and small they are barely noticeable. But beside that cocky commentary from some writers, the forced and poorly written SJW I found it atleast some what appealing to play, it was intriguing enough to pull me through it in about a weeks time. But what I did not like was the similar event of no consequences or even worse, not really any options and the forced ending was not that good. Beside that, it is really hard to consider this canon and then look at BG2 where no one even mentions the Shining Lady ever or her crusade. Caelar Argent as the villian, a GOOD villian or anti-hero antagonist was to me very interesting but could been developed much more. I won't spoil it but I hope to hear more about her. A villian not hell bent on destroying the world, conquering it for doing bad or simply put being a lunatic chaotic evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was refreshing. So some things been hits in the  Dragonspear expansion and Baldurs Gate at the core is still a cheesy at times but good RPG game. But there also been some misses in Dragonspear and people complain of the bugs. I had NPCs disappear so I could not recruit them. I might have managed to kill them by mistake, by pulling trolls to the camp but I did not notice that either way until I was looking for them in camp and they where nowhere. A bit more freedom and options, perhaps if they had made Dragonspear into a spin off, another branch in the Saga, a what if Irenicus never happended, it would been nice. But such is life.6.5-7 I think is a decent grade if we do not inflate it like most gaming medias do today, maybe even 7,5 considering that Baldurs Gate was a great game on release, and one of few good RPGs in its time beside Fallout as far as I know. Atleast one of those games who push the genre on for a while longer. A proper 9 out of 10 back then. But a 7 is still well above average and that is not bad, beside that Beamdog is not perfect and done some weird things so 6.5-7 is fiting.			"

												If you're the kind of person that enjoys having to use basic algebra in order to calculate the best build for your RPG characters, this game is for you. Unlike most modern RPGs there is no voice-acting so you'll actually have to read dialogues. You also have to actually read quests entries to figure out where to go and you need basic orientation skills. All in all I would say that most people born in the late 90s or 2000s should probably stay away from this game because they lack the cognitive skills required to play this game. If you do however have basic scholastic skills, this game is quite an enjoyable RPG experience that requires meticulous planning and use of tactics to beat it at the higher difficulty settings. Most of you are probably too stupid to appreciate it though.			"

												Baldur's Gate is a CRPG classic. It's a massive, sprawling adventure that requires hundreds of hours and multiple playthroughs to fully delve experience. I played the original nearly 20 years ago, and it remains one of my favorite games.Beamdog has done a fantastic job at smoothing out some of the most awkward elements of the original:* Being unable to both dual wield and use a bow* Having to quit an adventure mid-way through to run back to down and dump your bagsWhile also adding some fresh stories for folks that have already played through it a hundred times. While the writing quality of the new content feels a bit below that of the original game, it's better than the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion (included in the Enhanced Edition). The balance of the new classes and characters feels little on the weak side (with a couple exceptions--Dorn, Corwyn), but the game isn't so hard as to feel like trying them is impossible.You'll see some negative reviews by people who are incensed that anything has changed, and others who get offended at the existence of a single, minor character of nonbinary gender in the expansion. Take these reviews with a grain of salt; Beamdog has done a great job on both fronts.I recommend this game for anyone that wants to dive deep into a game and explore. It's a bit like reading the original Lord of the Rings, however, in that--as a classic--mechanics that were revolutionary 20 years ago feel stilted and painful now. This game has even made me appreciate 4th and 5th edition D&D significantly more after seeing what 2E was like in practice.One further note, this game has a vibrant modding community, and there's a ton of things you can add. One specific mod, the BG1NPC Project, is practically essential, as it fixes some bugs, adds a ton of great character dialog, gets some fun NPCs into your party earlier in the game, and adds romance options as well.

												Baldur's Gate is one hell of a game. Sarevok's reign of terror along the Sword Coast, the Iron Crisis, the progeny of a dead god wreaking havoc on the realm. It's a classic, make no doubt.Though more of a fresh coat-of-paint than the remake we all wanted, Beamdog's Enhanced Edition is overall an improvement over the original game--especially now that the many bugs that plagued the game at launch have been ironed out. Of particular note are the additional party members and quest content, which are closer in quality to the quintessential sequel, Shadows of Amn, than the original.Baldur's Gate is a masterpiece. I recommend--in the strongest possible language--that every gamer play both main titles at lease once. I must, in a heartbeat, recommend any gamer out there who hasn't already picked up Baldur's Gate to grab the Enhanced Edition immediately.In a heartbeat.But to gamers of the old school, my fellows and friends, I cannot say the same. Beamdog's Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate is nice, and in many respects superior to the original game, but the new content is far from game-changing, and there's simply too little there to justify a full play-through if you've already journeyed through the original game a half-dozen times. Unless you're a huge fan of the game, I guess. Like me. In which case: have at it!			"

												Great game with a very interesting lore, wide variety of scenarios, characters, and especially quests. There are many Quests that I wish that would be deeper, the story behind them is kind of flat. But, the story of the city of Baldur's Gate, the main pltoline and how it develops is really amazing. There's a huge variety of characters that can join your party, from the Devil to God himself, and even the new ones that were added are very interesting, along with the new quests that involve them. The gameplay itself is very different from modern RPGs, but it is completely playable nowadays. The strategic aspect of the combat is very good and when you manage to master a combat situation it is a very satisfying feeling. It also has a few minor additions as new character portraits, revisited cutscenes and some tweaks to the overall looks of the game.			"

												I'd guess most people would play this game for nostalgic reasons. I've played my share of RPGs but not the original BGs. So no additional nostalgia points from me unfortunately. This being said, I found this game to be very well made and fun to play. It's old fashioned in pretty much every way possible (including graphics, interface, game mechanics etc.), but after giving it some time, this didn't really bother me too much.Some things to note:1) While not buggy per se, this game has some balancing issues and it's sometimes hard to know what to expect when fighting enemies. Some fights are just down right annoying and very difficult to win.2) The game doesn't hold your hand in anyway. If you go to wrong places and pick wrong fights, you die. If you don't, you probably still die. Expect to put in some effort and research if you want to get somewhere in this game.			"

												Wonderful update to one of my favorite classic RPG games!  I can't tell you how many hours I poured into Baldur's Gate in my youth, and it is so nostalgic to play this one again from the beginning.  I give this my highest recommendation - you'll love it!!			"

												After an incredibly buggy release, devs have released patches and ended up with... merely a very buggy game.Pros: Creating and joining multiplayer works easily and consistently, BG2 engine offers a wider range of resolutions than original BG1, Tales Of The Sword coast is included as standard, some new content (new NPCs, voice sets, portraits).Cons: Still more buggy and less stable than original BG1 (numerous crashes, quests keep glitching).Overall, I recommend this, but only just.

												Step right up and see the game that not only influenced literally all the fantasy rpg games you play today but the game that literally saved the fantasy rpg genre.Seriously, this game saved the genre, no one was interested in pouring more money into something no one was interested in playing, ghen this came along.This is truly a great game, not so much early reward and no superepic endgame items either but what you get is a beautifully dcrafted world and a fantastic gaming experience that gives a prime example that good storytelling and great gaming is its own reward.With almost endless character creation possibility, a storyline that rewards you with growth and encourages perseverance to finish, this game is a must for practically everyone.Characters banter, they argue, they have their own personalities, the game world is literally huge, with lots of hidden treats. With the extra stuff from the tales of the sword coast expansion thrown in and the half orc race and character packs thrown in at creation this game offeres a lot more than even people like myself who enjoyed it back in 98 can remember enjoying.Whether you're an old hat that misses this game or a newbie looking for an hardcore rpg experience, this is totally for you, and whats best is... You can port your save game over to Baldurs gate 2 when youre done.			"

												Quite simply one of the best games ever made. The story is amazing, the character progression and interaction was ahead of the curve back in the day.An absolute essential for any lover of the RPG genre, still packs quite a difficulty punch compared to most modern RPG's especially if you plan to take on the DLC bosses. That is of course unless you are power gaming and know what you are doing :).It has a vast array of race/class choices to make, each class having their own specific sub classes, these characters can be taken across to Baldur's Gate 2 upon completion. You are also given your 9 alignment's to choose from, be it Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral or True Evil. These will have an effect on any NPC's you wish to take along with you on your quest to save the lands, or destroy them?The loot is great, there is a vast source of loot within the game especially towards the end game content when you get to say Durlag's Tower. You think you hit God Mode but perhaps the lack of petrification protection will make your Beserker get one shotted by a Bassilisk.The voice acting, whilst small, is passable with a few exceptions being fantastic. Perhaps not enough customisation options. I personally love the isometric top down graphics, but they aren't for everyone.THE ONLY downside to this game is the multiplayer, If you are buying this to play with friends, please research the problems you may encounter first. They have patched the issues now to some degree of success but I have had issue when playing with more than 2 people with it booting one of us out. I know a lot of people who have played the entire game with no problem at all as well though. Just be careful if you plan on Multiplayering.All in all, one of my favourite games of all time. 10/10.

												About 50 hours for one playthrough (not including Siege of Dragonspear DLC).While I like all of the classic Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale series, BG1 remains my favorite.Covers just levels 1 to 8, so not too intimidating to learn class and spell mechanicsYou can choose to completely build your own party in multiplayer mode, but the companions from single-player mode are part of the game's charm.

												I have played this game countless time. My first playthrough was done on a machine that didn't even have the minimum specs to make it run. I had a 1GB hard drive that basically had windows (98 at the time) and baldur's gate. I love everything about this game, the atmosphere, the story, the gameplay, etc. I guess that the nostalgia factor helps a lot in my liking of the game but it doesn't matter, this is my top 1 game, if I had to choose a single game before being locked out till I die, that would be the one.

												The first instalment of the Baldur’s Gate series is the perfect introduction to what would become one of the most beloved benchmarks in RPGs; combining a compelling story, ample exploration opportunity, and tactical combat, all blended together in a well-established setting.Baldur’s Gate is the beginning of a journey that will consume countless hours of your time. You begin, as any good fantasy story begins, as a hapless youth who must journey out alone, thrust into a world they’ve never before seen. Along the way you’ll gather your fellowship of companions who’ll support you and provide commentary and banter on your actions and choices (though, this is more prevalent in the game’s sequel, Baldur’s Gate II). Whilst there is a storyline to play out, you’re never truly forced down a linear path towards it; there’s plenty of opportunity to go off the beaten track and explore the verdant countryside, or dreary dungeons. Cap it off with menacing villain and you’ve got an idea of what makes Baldur’s Gate special.Baldur’s Gate isn’t for everyone, however, and that’s a given. In a world where you have your photo-realistic, fast paced Skyrim, and Witcher 2, Baldur’s Gate may feel like a step back, and that’s understandable – when you look at Baldur’s Gate it does look slightly dated in terms of graphics, and not everything is voice acted (as everything tends to be these days,) but those shouldn’t be reasons to turn away from what is, in my opinion, a very special RPG experience. The graphics may be slightly dated, but they do hold up well even today. Their very particular aesthetic ensures that it is still a very playable game, and the Enhanced Edition’s UI overhaul allows for best navigation for the player. When you compare it to games like Dungeon Siege, or Neverwinter Nights, who opted for a 3D graphical engine, the game looks beautiful and timeless. If you’re playing an RPG for its graphics you’re not doing it right, though. What will draw you in is the dialogue and storytelling. The game really set the precedent for what a good RPG should include in terms of story. Admittedly it does use a tried and tested narrative structure (inexperienced adventurer sets off from the homely home, whilst being pursued by an unknown enemy, gathering friends along the way to help take down this evil), but it doesn’t feel overly cliché. The well written dialogue feels like a novel some times, in terms of the quality and sheer amount, which will strike a chord with some players, but understandable put others off; there is a hefty amount of reading to do, when compared to the minimalist approach of modern RPGs. Personally, I find a great chunk of dialogue compelling, but I can see why it would be off-putting.In terms of what the Enhanced Edition actually adds, there are quite a few new features and many more fixes for old bugs that will never get officially patched out in the original games. Firstly, three new NPCs are added in to the mix, each giving a new personality and set of skills to help you in your adventure. The NPCs are fairly well written, and voiced, but I do think that they don’t blend seamlessly in to the catalogue of NPCs for Baldur’s Gate. They aren’t terrible, by any means, but they are noticeable. One of the more important changes is the UI, which really helps to modernise the title as best it can. It is possible to mod the original game in order to make it widescreen, and give it Baldur’s Gate II’s UI, but if you’re not familiar with the way modding working in the Infinity Engine it can be a little daunting and a little tricky. Overhaul did a good job making a working UI that feels like it belongs in the game. The seldom praised aspect that the Enhanced Edition brings is numerous bug fixes. Baldur’s Gate is over a decade old, and is no longer maintained by its developers, and as such it has built up a number of bugs on modern hardware. What the EE aimed to do was squash as many bugs as possible, and make it compatible with as many computers as possible. It has succeeded in that respect, however it has introduced a few new bugs of its own in the process, so be aware of that. The developers are still working on patches for the game, so don’t fret too much, but do be aware of this fact. Other than this, there’s a fairly decent arena style campaign to play through, for those who enjoy the tactical combat Baldur’s Gate employs.A few final things to note in terms of what the game offers are the rule system and general gameplay. Baldur’s Gate uses 2nd Edition rules of Dungeons and Dragons, which for all its praise can be overly complicated at times. Those unfamiliar with D&D rules may find themselves totally bewildered by terms like ‘THAC0’, and ‘saving throws’ but if you do a little research it can be understood. The rule system is one of the main components that puts people off the game initially, but with a little perseverance you’ll be able to play the game without needing to know every little rule mechanic. The pathfinding in the game will also have players feeling the age of the game, as it is very basic and very frustrating. You’ll find characters taking the sub-optimal route when issuing them to move through a corridor, or a street, which can get pretty tiresome after a few hours of babysitting your party; be warned.All in all, Baldur’s Gate is one of those games that I feel should be given a try, even if you’re apprehensive. Of all the series, Baldur’s Gate II is (in my opinion, and many others’) the superior game, and so don’t let Baldur’s Gate put you over getting the sequel, as BG2 improves upon many of the first game’s shortcomings. The price may be a little off-putting, but if you see it on sale then definitely grab it and give it a whirl. Just don’t go in expecting Skyrim or Witcher, because it’s a whole different beast (for the better).			"

												One of the things RPG's always miss is a strong script editor.  I'm not talking about customization, I'm talking about someone who reviews the script, and edits the crap out of it to make sure it makes sense no matter what play through you do.  BG and BG:EE have always had this.  I just wish Dragon Age, NWN, Skyrim, Masseffect and all the other new /major rpgs had this.   One person can change the landsacape of your entire game.			"

												I wonder if there is any other game that has left such a memorable footprint in my life. The story is truly epic and I prefer the low level fantasy (character dev and inventory) rather than the high level stuff in BG2. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and probably the major reason I will still need to return to this game before I kick the bucket.This enhanced version is great! The whole game got a facelift, the interface especially is nice - doesn't feel old. I also really appreciate to have this on Steam now, patched and ready instead of worrying about patches with the stand alone original version. And no CDs! :)Perhaps best of all - it runs natively in Linux! I could never dream of that becoming a reality when I started gaming BG back in -98. Trying to get the game to work properly in WINE was probably the main reason it took me a decade to finish, the first time around :)If you buy this game, you're in for a great story and experience! Don't miss out!			"

												I have the original game of Baldur's Gate on disc that I bought  back in 1998. I could never play it well on the computer I had back then. I had a Compaq with Windows 98. I now have an HP computer with Windows 7 and tried to play the game. It didn't run much better than when I tried to play it on Windows 98.  I read about this enhanced version and decided to go for it. I bought it thru Amazon and installed it with no problems whatsoever. I can finally play the rpg I""ve always wanted to play, glitch-free as well. I praise all involved for developing this enhanced version and making Baldur's Gate the game it should have been back then. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play one of the best rpg games ever. I recently purchased Icewind Dale, the enhanced versdion, thru my steam account. and can't wait to play that one as well. This was another game I bought on disc back in the day and could never play it well with all it's bugs and glitches. I plan to purchase Baldur's Gate 2 thru Amazon in the near future.			"

												Baldur's Gatewhat is there to say about it.quite a lot as a matter of fact.Back in 1998 when this game first came out, i played it half to death. it used the 2nd edition rules and was overall a great game. im sure i put in a  couple thousand hours playing, trying new characters. then exporting to Baldur's Gate 2 and continuing from their.For a lot of modern gamers, this is a classic title. A must have if one was into D&D.and with the remake and bug patching and making it runnable on todays modern machines.This game gets a 9 out of 10But if you're looking for awesome graphics, this game won't hold that for it. its about playing the game. not drooling over the graphics, though back then this was really high graphics.Is it worth whatever price it is now??I would have to say yes. it is.But only if you loved the older games.

												This is an old but very fun role-playing game.You can be a tough warrior and a great magician.It is possible to travel with fellow of good and evil.The middle of the journey, you will be able to a lot of selection.Different selection, will also change journey.You can play any number of times without getting tired.I would recommend this game.

												If you haven't played any Baldur's Gate before get it right away. But only if you're into old school RPGs, otherwise... you gonna have bad time (and add another bad review).Played it back in the days as young folk with face covered in pimples and now you're old prick with kids, stuffed wallet and annoying wife? Hey, don't drink yourself to death, time to recall old times.			"

												When a NPC asks you to help him avenge his dead friend named Jondal, you can respond with : ""If this Jondal is dead, then he was weak and should never have been born"".Alternatively you can be a good guy and help a demon from the Nine Hells get his puppy back.A classic, and a true translation of Dungeons & Dragons to the videogame format. 10/10 would hang out with Elminster again.

												The Enhanced Edition made it possible for me to finally finish Baldur's Gate after 13 years of attempts. Baldur's Gate II is my favorite game ever, and I've finished it many times, but it was very difficult to go back and try to play BG after BGII. The enhancements are well worth it, and I look forward to replaying with the additional companions. The story mode difficulty option is wonderful as well.			"

												Having always been a fan of the the predecessor this is an interesting game to play. Seeing old friends I grew up with in a new light is a very fun experience. I will say for a playthrough it's okay. The story is like a classic adventure. A bad guy killed someone close to you and you need to stop him. End of story. Most of the screens are just forest with a few bad guys here and there getting into senseless fights. The main parts of the game come from a few sections on the map. For the game itself, in single player, it's fine. Enhanced Edition: There are tons of problems/glitches found throughout the game that EE offers to the table. The most dissapointing part of Enhanced Edition is the lack of being able to export the golden pantaloons into BG2:SoA:EE, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE. That was a huge dissapointment. Other than that.. it's playable?			"

												The game itself is easily the best RPG I've ever played. If you've never played it, it's worth whatever the price is. The only thing I didn't see mentioned in other helpful reviews is the fact that you are given complete freedom upon leaving the starting area. This game was truly 'Open World' long before that was ever a thing.Any quality issues you might have because of the age of this title, such as graphics, are easily overshadowed by the brilliant writing, open-ended gameplay, and the level of completeness and care that was originally put into this game.The Enhanced Edition is a welcome improvement. It launched for me first try with no issues on Win7x64/AMD 8-Core. If all it did was run the game and provide modern display resolutions, it would be a great success.Visual enhancements and more options to tweak gameplay are also included. These are icing on the above-descibed cake. Documentation on some of these features is lacking, but it looks like Beamdog is in it for the long haul.Other enhancements make the game more like BG2, adding subclasses, dual wield, extra weapon types, mechanics tweaks, NPCs, etc. By any measure these things are an improvement, BUT I have mixed feelings about it since I love the original, with all its limitations. In a way, BG2 is less good now.In summary a great rerelease of an epic game. Bugs (new ones) are barely worth mentioning & since this was clearly a project by someone who loves the game I have no doubt that they will be eradicated.No good reason not to buy this game. :)Thanks and congrats to Beamdog. Keep up the good work!			"

												This game is pretty awesome, and you'll like it a lot if you can get past the dated graphics and somewhat harsh combat system. The team at Beamdog has done a fantastic job at rounding a lot of the rough edges that this game had and releasing it again to us with some additional content. I'll get to the additional content later.I had a really fun time playing this game, I had grown up on it when I was a kid, but I had never finished it. So, before this edition was released, I picked up GoG version and played it through to the end with a mixed party, it was a sweet ride, sweet enough that I wanted to go again. So I picked up this version when it game out (I think on the same day or maybe a few after I finished it the first time) and played it again. I finished it up and did just about everything that I could do in the game, trying to find all the hidden tomes, quests, locations, areas, etc. I had a blast. Then I did again! lol. I played it again through for the 3rd time, this time doing a solo speedrun of the game with a ftr/thf/mage (awsome combo), and had an absolute blast doing it again. I can't tell you how impressed I am with this game.But anyways, on to the review.The game is fun, challenging, and has a neat storyline. The graphics... it's a love hate situation; The digitally rendered backgrounds are all really amazing. They are beautiful and stunning to look at, especially after you have completely explored a place. The characters on the otherhand, they are so poorly rendered and animated that you can't even tell that they are actually 3D models and not crapily painted pieces. There are loads of places to go in the game, and a hell of a lot of quests in the game to complete (which is really nice that Beamdog added automatic journal noting so you can actually tell what's a quest and what's not). There are a lot of different monsters to face which eventually require a lot of tactical thinking and spell placement. The classes in the game (AD&D 2nd edition) are unique and are fun to play, especially with the new class kits introduced by Beamdog. The game is fairly straightforward though with it's primary quest chain. Sometimes there's multiple ways to complete a quest (either from alignment, or just dialogue options or approaches), but the game ends the same way no matter what you do.Now for the content that Beamdog has added. There's not much meat here to be honest. The three additional voice acted characters and their quests are cool, but that's about it.I'd reccommend this game to any rpg fan. I wouldn't reccommend this to everyone though, being that the AD&D ruleset is rather archaic hard to understand and comprehend for newbies. 9/10Would speedrun again.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played and the Enhanced Edition is even better. There isn't much enhanced graphics-wise, but there are new items brought in from Baldur's Gate 2, which makes this game more playable and slightly easier. The addition of four new team members was nice, all of them are equally well written and fun to get to know, especially Neera ^^. Somehow, not sure if it was because of this Enhanced Edition, but there were some glitches here and there, blocking me from certain areas or quests. The final fight glitched up too, where the main boss just died when I came in to the room (scaredy cat :P)Certainly recommended if only for the cast of characters, great graphical overworld and well-arranged music tracks. Now, will somebody hold my hamster?			"

I finished it up and did just about everything that I could do in the game, trying to find all the hidden tomes, quests, locations, areas, etc. I had a blast. Then I did again! lol. I played it again through for the 3rd time, this time doing a solo speedrun of the game with a ftr/thf/mage (awsome combo), and had an absolute blast doing it again. I can't tell you how impressed I am with this game.But anyways, on to the review.The game is fun, challenging, and has a neat storyline. The graphics... it's a love hate situation; The digitally rendered backgrounds are all really amazing. They are beautiful and stunning to look at, especially after you have completely explored a place. The characters on the otherhand, they are so poorly rendered and animated that you can't even tell that they are actually 3D models and not crapily painted pieces. There are loads of places to go in the game, and a hell of a lot of quests in the game to complete (which is really nice that Beamdog added automatic journal noting so you can actually tell what's a quest and what's not). There are a lot of different monsters to face which eventually require a lot of tactical thinking and spell placement. The classes in the game (AD&D 2nd edition) are unique and are fun to play, especially with the new class kits introduced by Beamdog. The game is fairly straightforward though with it's primary quest chain. Sometimes there's multiple ways to complete a quest (either from alignment, or just dialogue options or approaches), but the game ends the same way no matter what you do.Now for the content that Beamdog has added. There's not much meat here to be honest. The three additional voice acted characters and their quests are cool, but that's about it.I'd reccommend this game to any rpg fan. I wouldn't reccommend this to everyone though, being that the AD&D ruleset is rather archaic hard to understand and comprehend for newbies. 9/10Would speedrun again.			"

												Having always been a fan of the the predecessor this is an interesting game to play. Seeing old friends I grew up with in a new light is a very fun experience. I will say for a playthrough it's okay. The story is like a classic adventure. A bad guy killed someone close to you and you need to stop him. End of story. Most of the screens are just forest with a few bad guys here and there getting into senseless fights. The main parts of the game come from a few sections on the map. For the game itself, in single player, it's fine. Enhanced Edition: There are tons of problems/glitches found throughout the game that EE offers to the table. The most dissapointing part of Enhanced Edition is the lack of being able to export the golden pantaloons into BG2:SoA:EE, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE. That was a huge dissapointment. Other than that.. it's playable?			"

NOTE: I’m posting this review on both Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition and Baldur’s Gate 2: Enhanced Edition pages, since my opinion is valid for both products, and they should be considered as one.What can one say in front of such magnificence? These two RPGs are simply the pillar of western production of this genre, and when the two are combined in a single game they definitively are among the top 10 of the must-play for every PC gamer out there, no matter the age.BG:EE and BG2:EE are simply THE definitive Dungeons & Dragons experience, including almost all the possible 2.5 Edition Core and several optional rulebooks of the Forgotten Realms setting and translating them into a marvellous duo of 3rd person games.Although both games are very old (they were developed and published between 1998 and 2001 by Bioware / Black Isle Studios), they have been “enhanced” and made available on modern systems (including Windows 7/8/10 PCs, OSx, Android and IOS) by the guys at Overhaul Games / Beamdog, who not only re-tooled the original Infinity Engine to make it run on modern platforms, but also added several other goodies that were not present in the original release, in addition to bug fixes and standard “curator” jobs.I could go on for pages and pages describing in detail the marvels of the Baldur’s Gate Series, but I’ll try to cut it short and stick to a much shorter format.PROs- Ever dreamed of taking your typical AD&D session with your friends out of the pen & paper setting to a PC screen? This game is for you!- Charismatic characters and companions: Minsc the Ranger (and Boo!), Jaheira, Viconia, Xzar, Sarevok… what else can I say?- Longevity: both games combined are well over 100 hours of gameplay- Replayability: seriously, there are hundreds of possible combinations of classes / races / kits / alignments / companions / choices to completely change your experience at every playthrough- Every action you make affects the game world, like it is expected from a proper Western RPG. Apart from some scripted events to progress with the main story, the rest is up to you- Multiplayer: join with 5 friends to create a fully custom party!- The (new) developers are supporting the game with patches and fixes, and they actually listen to the community- Compatible with most of the original BG / BG2 community mods- Runs on every system, even your mobile phone / tablet (NOTE: the Android / IOs versions are separate purchases). HW requirements are very lowCONs- After more than 16 years from my first BG playthrough I still cannot find a single flaw in any of these games. They are simply a masterpiece.In a nutshell, these games set THE standard all the following RPGs on the market were measured against, and none of them was able to surpass Baldur’s Gate until now.Buy them, play them, enjoy them. 12/10, would pickpocket Drizzt again			"

Now with me being older, smarter, and more of a nerd(and proud of it) I know what I need to do and how to play it. Sure it can be hard at times if you dont have the right gear or skills, but its nothing some grinding here and there or going from shop to shop cant fix. If you are new to this game, take it slow and save often as you can and will die alot.			"

												When I first played BG, I hated it. That was a long time ago, when there was no enhanced edition and it only ran in ridiculously low resoloutions (what do you expect, it was an early 90's game).After the Enhanced Edition came out, I loved it! I suppose I always enjoyed the fundamental elements of it, but now that it's un-glitched, and with better resoloutions I can't get enough of it. BG is set in the forgotten Realms, but it does a good job of appealing to people who aren't fimiliar with FR. You play as an orphan who must set out to figure out why you father was murdered, who did it, what connection it has to an iron shortage, and why assassins are after you as well. Its a top-down isometric RPG where you can control your own custom character and up to 5 other characters. This all done in a Dungeons and Dragons style with 2nd edition rules.There are compelling characters that feel real, a lush and vibrant world full of lore, and a plot that is as complex as it is interesting. I would find it hard to believe that someone would be unable to fell immersed and intrigued by this game.My one criticism is that combat is brutal, even on lower difficulties. This is because you start from first level and can only get as high as ninth level during the course of the game. It is somewhat frustrating, but it evens out a quarter of the way through or so. Slogging through it is definately worth it for the later payoff, though. And if you're skilled enough, it isn't even that bad. Some would argue that the difficulty is a good thing. This isn't a game that hold you by the hand, or expects you to be stupid. No, it is intelligent and mature. I only played the vanilla version of BG once, so I'm not an expert on the differences between regular and Enhanced. I think that with 3 extra companions, each with their own personal missions, and the Black Pits game mode, the price is worth it. As far as I know, nothing was deleted or changed that might make fans of the classic version angry. In fact, I think the 3 new companions are even MORE interesting and well-written than the vanilla ones. It's also hard to argue when hundreds of lines of dialouge that were previously silent are now voice acted. BG1 is a classic. It easily fits into my list of top 10 best games ever. If you never played BG, this is your chance. If you did play it, but aren't sure if EE is worth it, let me tell you that it is.			"

												This is it. One of the most ultimate Roleplaying experiences of all times.Well, if you allready own and played the original Baldur's Gate and the Tales of the Sword Cost Add-On, there is not much to tell. You might still want the game if you want to try some new classes which were not available back in the original game or if you want some new subquest related to four new NPCs, or if you want to try a new short campaign mainly about arena fighting. Or if you want to replay the game with some better graphics, support for modern hardware and better multiplayer options. But in the core it is still the old game back from good ol' times.If you have never played Baldur's Gate but you love (true) party-based rpg games with a deep storyline, much lore and epic fights, moral choices with true consequences for your gameplay and interacting NPCs, let me say this: Stop searching. Click Buy! If you are searching for good RPGs on relevant community-site on the web, you will almost always find Baldur's Gate in the Top 10 although the game is more then 15 years old. And there is a reason for it.The closing of Black Isles Studios which originally developped the Baldur's Gate-Series and Planescape: Torment and the Icewind Dale-Series was one of the saddest days in gaming history. No studio ever again made such high-quality RPGs.			"

												This game (and its sequel) is really the single best example of a PC game using actual DnD rules, but in this case the computer is the Game Master.  For its time, it was considered extremely well done.  The story is really strong, and will keep you playing just to find out what happens next.  If you squint real hard, you can sort of see the similarity between this game and more recent fantasy RPGs like Dragon Age.  The idea of pausing the game to issue orders to your squad, then resuming action to see those orders carried out sort of started with Baldur's Gate.			"

												This is a remake of the role-playing video game Baldur's Gate and its expansion Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast which were both originally released back in 1998 by Bioware. This review will contain minor spoilers.Graphics definitely shows its age and can be distracting for a newcomer who have not experienced such graphics before. Personally for me, i find it dated, but with a certain nostalgic charm. Environment art are pretty detailed however and are lovingly rendered in pixel art. Character sprites however look very generic and small. The music consists of nice sweeping orchestral pieces. Sound effects sound good with the clashes of swords and the swoosh of a magic spell. I did encounter issues where the volume would suddenly crank up for no reason at all during certain events (Eg: when a trap got activated).The main 25 hours story unfortunately felt rather generic although it has a unique way of presentation with a narrator reciting the script as if like a Dungeon Master in the pen and paper version. As such, I felt that the general feel of the game doesn't feel at all like a video game, but feels more like the pen and paper experience translated into digital form. This may or may not be a good thing depending on your tastes.I liked how organic and natural sidequests were presented. You could have a random NPC walk up to you for a chit chat which may lead to something more sinister or just wander around and help out along the way. I recommend not to slavishly do each and every quest, but rather play thru the game normally and just let your party randomly encounter these side quests. Also, because this game is old-school, do not expect it to hold your hand and show you your exact quest objective. You are expected to read the ingame journal which will give vague hints and you actually have to do some exploring.The game has quite a high combat difficulty curve at least at the beginning when your initial party is low leveled. It will not hesitate to throw a tough boss or impossible random encounters (a crew of lvl1 characters against 8 higher leveled bandits. Really?!?) relatively early and wipe your party. Remember to always save your game before and after every conversation, and before and after every battle. Proper position and tactics are essential and vital to early combat.If you persevere however, this difficulty curve will drop very significantly when your party members are around Level 4. At this point, you will find almost all non-boss battles to be a breeze where all you had to do is to select everyone in your party and just zerg rush mobs. Enemies do not scale to your level. I find this sudden drop in difficulty to be very strange and felt very odd considering how hard it was to survive during the early levels.As for boss battles, its very easy to exploit the game by getting your magic users cast area effect spells before they even see an enemy to soften them up. This is particularly true for the last boss where I just lured his allies out one by one, zerged them, went out to rest and heal and repeat until he is the only one left standing. Needless to say he died in about 25 seconds to my zerg rush.Overall Rating: 6.5 / 10Criticizing this game almost feels like a crime considering that alot of people enjoyed it alot. I enjoyed this game for sure, but I felt it might have been a little too hyped up. My view is that it is a good game, but it could definitely be alot more polished. My main concern was that the story narrative was too overt instead of being subtle. You are literally being told a story instead of experiencing one (if that makes any sense)For anyone like me who have played the original pen and paper version and also experienced older RPGs before, do give it a try if you haven't already as you might enjoy it. For younger players who have never experienced older RPGs and never touched the pen and paper version before, i'd recommend watching some gameplay video previews before committing to it as this game does show its age now.

												I recommend that you do NOT buy this game here on Steam, at least not yet. The version uploaded to steam is an old outdated one for some reason. If you're lucky enough to get it to work on your computer, you're in for a buggy experience. Wait for them to (hopefully) patch it properly, or just download the original game on GOG.com and install BGTutu, which essentially does much of the same as the enhanced edition.Having games on steam is convenient, sure, but there's no point having convenient access to games that don't work.

												I Have recently purchased this on steam, but have been playing it for a while now on my mac.  This remake is FANTASTICALLY redone with even more content than before.  I can't reccomend this enough, as long as you're a fan of rpgs that require a little brainpower and are slightly unforgiving.  Remember to save often; after all, this is based on the older AD&D ruleset and you're bound to get wiped out a few times.			"

Great RPG, cool world to explore, little humor here and there and the story is interesting.

However the reward for exerting the effort to complete the game greatly outweighs the amount of hours you dump into it.This is one of the greatest games that I have ever played, and not because of the graphics, voice-overs, or emaculate cut-scenes... because BG doesn't deliver in those departments. The game was made in 1998, so take that into perspective. The game was way ahead of it's time, and to go back and play it in 2014 really reminds us of how ""advanced"" of a game it really was.			"

												I played Baldur's Gate when it originally came out and didn't understand much because I didn't know D&D. Why are my characters dying after one hit? Why don't they hit anything? Why are lower armor class numbers better? And so on. So I put it aside after a brief time, disappointed.Fast forward 2 years or so. Shortly before Baldur's Gate II was released, I gave it another try. And it clicked! Although to this day I'm not a fan of their (modified) D&D system, mainly because of the limited ways to develop your character, I discovered that there were a lot of other things to like in this game. The huge (for the time) open world to explore, the many interesting items to find, a competent story and challenging - if sometimes a little random - tactical battles. Of course, I only fell really in love with the series when Baldur's Gate II - and later, Throne of Bhaal - came out but I guess this would be a topic for the Baldur's Gate II review. There are very few RPG series where you can play a character from a nobody to a god over the course of 2,5 games. The sense of power progression in this series is unmatched in my opinion. After initially dislilking Baldur's Gate, I've now played through the game four times and three times through the whole saga (fun fact: My first character was a paladin, maybe that's also a reason why I disliked it at first...). This brings me to the ""Enhanced Edition"" because the fourth playthrough which I finished earlier today was with this remastered version. I'd heard much about the issues with this ""improved"" version but fortunately, I seem to have evaded the worst after playing the patched up version now. I had only some minor issues which didn't interrupt my enjoyment with the game at all. It's nice to play in widescreen in a native resolution. The engine is apparently updated to Baldur's Gate 2 level which means nicer graphical effects, a lot of UI improvements and gameplay conveniences. The two new companion characters, which are DLC content, integrate nicely into the game and are more fleshed out, similar to Baldurs Gate II companions.If you have the time and patience, you can mod the old game to maybe even higher standards than the Enhanced Edition. But if you just want to play without much messing around, I can recommend this version. The Baldur's Gate saga is one of the all time greats and a true classic.			"

												Baldur's Gate: EE is a great game. Easily one of the top 3 RPG's I've ever played.  If you are into RPGs D&D you probably have already played it. However, for those that are unfamiliar, there is immense detail put into the story and world in this game--the Baldur's Gate series has one of the best stories. The enemies and fights can be challenging--mind racking sometimes--while you figure out what works and what doesn't. Who to deal with right away, and who is less threatening to your party. Save often.Test things out, what do spells do. Sometimes, I'd come across a spell that would have been really beneficial had I known about it earlier--or potions for the matter. I hoard mostly in these games, but learning how to effectively use what you're finding or buying can really sway a battle in your favor. Some battles become very easy, once you have a good strategy, appropriate gear and spells to cast.Also, pre-read some tips about the new features, because they make the game a lot easier to play--quick loot. I played the 2nd in the series first, and I still had much enjoyment coming to the first 10+ years after. If you play them in order, you can import your character across games.Some may find it slow--your characters move slow. There can be a lot of reading, equipment management, exploring, adventuring, etc. This game is about planning and executing strategies through a well written world. Deciding who to help--quests--and what to skip. Warning a party mixed with evil and good aligned party members lead to disagreements. So it may be difficult to see the entire game, or every quest, first play through.If you enjoy the game you've easily 50-100+ hours of gameplay to immerse yourself into, though there is a level cap--to keep you from power leveling and steam rolling the near end. The Black Pits expansion seems interesting, an arena challenge, 15 or so fights to test your skills in battle. Played it briefly, though honestly, I bought this for the main story and game.Great game!			"

												Not only does the enhanced edition add a whole new beautifully crafted and elegent overlay and UI, it also has been completely configured now to include all the character classes and benifits of BGII and BGII enhanced. There is no reason now NOT to play the origianl BG, because playing this is revisting all the classical parts of the time period of gaming without the drawbacks of an older D&D engine. Buy it.			"

												new patch's didn't ruin the game from working for me seeing as the multiplayer never worked for me or my friends the disrespectful behavior of  beam dog to a already set story-don't like the fact that they made a story mode difficulty so i can get all the story without any challenge for the most part some people don't deserve the story without the challenge+pro the graphics i feel are as good a port as possible seeing as u used to play on 800x600 res on those old 15in monitors now u most likly have a 21in+ 1920x1080 LCD monitorhere are some reasons why things had to be done differently Graphicallyin the original Baldur’s Gate,” explained Daigle, “these cobble stone streets here, this was just a close up picture of coffee beans and they just repeated over and over again. In ‘98 you had a 15 inch CRT, so you’re not going to notice or care probably. Nowadays when you’ve got an HD screen, you’re like, ‘Oh, those are coffee beans.’ We had to render out new streets and then lay them into the original 2D art and then paint over it. It was this whole process.”i didn't get the DLC SOD, so i dont have to see the unacceptable things they change to char  personality's besides the fact, that it dose not even play like BG or BG2 its pretty much linear it has chapters of open world but once the chapters done you can no longer go to the previous areas.but as for the gay or trans char its not really that forced and in the D&Dfirst edition there's a gods who come to people as what ever gender they want so a trans in the game is no biggie or a gay but the personality's of set characters not the new ones being changed is unacceptable in my opinion also the fact that allot of your choices in the game mean nothing unlike the original BG1&2 i really dont care that i can now see and play with 100+ char in a screen at once means nothing to me			"

The story is compelling, the characters are varied and interesting, and you have a lot of options in terms of your party makeup, which quests to do, how to solve quests, and really how to play the game in general.

												Get ready for some serious RPGing. It's intimidating at first but the game will eventually grow on you. Beware action heroes this is a real-time point and click RPG, not a sword swinging, spell slinging killing game. Take this review from the perspective of a non DND player.General information-  Strong association to character, class and story (Alignments, Class restrictive to alignments, Characters take note of story events and alignments)Combat takes place with unseen dice rolls for hitting and damaging targets. Magic once used has charges (depending on the type of mage/wizard)Every class seems to be resourceful and well thought out with a serious amount of balance for the first time player. (Thieves are extremely useful, as are mages/wizards. Detecting traps and uncovering magical items are what these classes can be used for)5 NPCs can be used in a party. (It's recommeded to actually have a party, this game isn't a cake walk without one. Alternatively 5 players can also be used if you can ever get a game going)Items and spells are locked to class restrictions so planning is a character is a useful way to succeed in your adventures!Careful planning before encounters are advised when going into unknown territory (Unlike some games where running through the front door would be the norm)Sleeping in game is a option for recovery of spells and healing.Banter between player character/other characters is a welcome breeze for character delevopment and story telling. (I know it's a bioware game, shut up lol. This is normal I get it.)IMMERSION. Try to become the character if you will :3.Auto-saving frequently will save your keyboard from a Dark Souls/Skyrim wrath-like reaction.When characters in your party die they can be resurrected but will drop all items on the floor where they died. Positives and Negatives-+Some voiced lines but mostly text.+Played with the pause feature actually being a critical part of play.+The class system is what you would expect from a DND experience, maybe lack luster (Unmodded/hasn't played DND)+A strong focus on story telling. Although the second is where it get's beefy.+Extremely strong character roster, much better in the sequel but still worth a buy.+Not too flashy. Most games have extremely flashy fights and what not to make the game appear more dramatic than it is. This game just hits it right in the dot for me. It's more of a + than a negative really.-Poor multiplayer, what else needs to be said? I had a bad time connecting to people and keeping it stable. Probably just me but who knows.-While it has strong story telling the story is lacking in this edition, buy the second one and with mods you can play this version on the second BG2.-Old style graphics. Think like Rune Scape/Helbreath/Diablo 2/ Etc-Ran on my PC but might not for others, friends have told me concerns of the game being unable to run correctly, their spec's vary.TL:DR - DND simulator with a top down perspective and real time combat (With pause feature). Interesting story and characters. 7/10 a good buy if its your first game in the series, wait for a sale don't buy the game for $20, see GIF http://i.imgur.com/uBqtwws.gif "

												A classic that put Bioware on the map. It is in depth, challenging, rewarding, charming, and most of all it's DND. Modern players most likely won't like the learning curve or the slow pace unless they already have some tabletop experience. The best way to think of this game is a ""simulated DND session where the PC is your DM."" (Dungeon Master for those unfamiliar with the term.)Play IF:You like rich storyYou like table top games (DND, Pathfinder, Shadowrun, etc.)You seek a challengeLove the DND Campaign setting ""Forgotten Realms"" (This is where the more recently release ""Neverwinter"" MMO and the famous RA Salvatore Drow novels takes place....in this game you can run into the Drow himself by the way.)You want a steep learning curve that once understood makes for an indescribable feeling of accomplishment.You like traditional high fantasy settingsYou like controlling more than your own character (Success depends on orders given to up to six party memebers.)You like various flavored NPCs to recruit (There is a large amount of potential party members to pick up or kick out of your party and they react to how you choose to play the game.)You want replayability (Play it as the ultimate good guy then go back and slaughter everyone no matter who they are.)All in all Baldur's gate is one of my favortie rpg franchises if not my all time favorite. It isn't for everybody but those who it is for know what I'm talking about. It's pretty often I hear those around my age say their favorite game of all time is Baldur's Gate II. This one is a great setup for that one and I highly recommend it. If you aren't use to it then be patient, give it time, and think outside of the box. This game does not hold your hand like most of today's games. You may just fall in love with a genre of game that is nearly  forgotten today. That being said...here's to the current crpg renaissance.			"

Could have kept myself busy for a while longer with sidequests and Black Pits but I am ready to move onto BG2. As a kid I wanted to love this game but the reading and D&D system was too much for me. Very happy that I was able to pick this back up 15 years later and finally complete it. Still have my old BG collectors edition. Big map and everything. Very nostalgic. Cant wait to undertake the rest of the Beamdog games. Thanks guys!			"

												Excellent game.  I was disapointed at first when I bought it because of the number of bugs, so I uninstalled the game.  I gave it another try after a big patch was released and the game was much better !Being able to play as any kit from Baldur's Gate 2 gives the game a hole new gameplay.  I already owned Baldur's Gate on the 5 CDs, but bought it again for the new features.  The new NPCs are good, but I didn't keep them after finishing their quests.I was a bit disapointed with Black pit, it's only a small arena repeating fight after fights...  it's not that long and not worth it as a reason to buy the game.

BG has never looked better and the quality of life improvements actually make it enjoyable to play without the whole host of mods I usually install. Beamdog's original content (characters, classes, etc.) is still mediocre IMO but easy enough to ignore. Unless there's a mod that you absolutely have to have the Enhanced Edition is a must have for BG / CRPG fans.			"

												This review contains general points about the baldur's gate series, summaries of both the main game and the expansion which I completed just recently, as well as my own personal experiences with both games.General Points about the Baldur's Gate seriesAnyone who loves hardcore rpg strategy-based games, with a more advanced D&D (Dungeons & Dragons) ruleset, will no doubt enjoy this epic game and its respective counter-parts. The Baldur's Gate franchise hinges on the story being based on the specific era where Nobles, peasants, commoners, elves, drow, orcs, ogres and all other manner of creatures of varying strengths and abilities existed. Brilliant story and brilliant gameplay indeed.Know that you not only have the option to complete this game solo, but you also have the option of completing it with friends and/or other party members which you can also choose to have come on your journey with you. If you're feeling super hardcore and are also brave enough to meet any challenge with your super over-levelled protagonist character/created party members, you can also try to complete this game on its hardest and newest difficulty ""Legacy of Bhaal"", but know that you will not be able to change your preferred difficulty if you chose LoB difficulty at the start of your session.Summary of the beginning of Baldur's GateYou start off in a place known as Candlekeep (your hometown) raised by your foster father Gorian and at some point he becomes increasingly concerned that you're in danger, so he urges you to leave candlekeep with him in the hopes that you'll be safer and shortly after leaving Candlekeep, Gorian and you are ambushed by a gang of thugs and Gorian fends them off himself so you can escape, sacrificing himself in the process. A girl named Imoen offers to join you as your primary objective is to set out to find who the the leader of those gang of thugs really was that killed Gorian. From then on, the story can unfold in quite a few ways depending on what you decide to do next after that.Summary of the beginning of the Siege of Dragonspear ExpansionAfter successfully beating the final boss of the main game (which henceforth declares you, the ""Hero of Baldur's Gate""), you start off in an underground tomb underneath the Baldur's Gate city, accompanied by Imoen (who, if you recall from the main game, offers to join your party after you left Candlekeep), any other party member who was with you in the main game if at all, and the Flaming Fist (who are essentially, the military army you encountered inside the Baldur's Gate city from the main game when you first entered it), with your first primary objective, being to locate and bring to justice in any manner of your choosing (i.e. kill outright or leave alive long enough to have em taken into Flaming Fist custody) a certain avid follower of the Final Boss whom you defeated in the main game. Once that's over with, your party members leave you to go on with their lives, while you and Imoen then end up within the Royal Ducal Palace bedroom of Baldur's Gate, for some rest and respite, until out of nowhere, some unknown assasins infiltrate the bedroom where you and Imoen are. intent on killing you. However, Imoen is the one that takes a critical hit from said assasins, to the effect that a poison attack leaves her near death. Unconfirmed rumours then start flying around that it was the charismatic warrior, Caelar Argent, and her ""Holy Crusade"" who may have been behind this. Accordingly, your new primary objectives for the rest of the game are two-fold: Firstly, to find out who specifically sent those assasins after you, and; Secondly, to also kill the respective perpetrator of those assasins, by any means necessary.My own personal experiences playing both Baldur's Gate and the expansion, Siege of DragonspearI personally enjoy the thrill of being able to enter into battle wondering if I have enough weapons and armour attributes to survive the encounter. Having certain characters (or possibly other friends involved) as party members are also a great help.When I do end up surviving said battle, my created character gains varying amounts of experience and sometimes upgrades, but when I don't, I either attempt to find other avenues of defeating that which had defeated me the first time or if I've exhausted all options, then I attempt to avoid having to fight it if I can.Another thing I enjoy about this game series also, are the varying ""relationship"" dialogues that can happen between a created character and a certain opposite gender party member. The relationship between your protagonist and the opposite gender party member will either keep going or break up with you (even to the extent of leaving the party if bad enough) depending on how you respond to their dialogue with you. Only thing that has frustrated me about this game series off-hand however, is that whenever a party member wants to go on a specific quest and you chose to let him/her into the party, but after a while when he/she realizes that your party is either ""too good/bad"" for him/her, he/she abruptly leaves the party and never returns, thus that quest that you originally accepted regarding that party member that abruptly left, remains permenantly unfinished for the rest of the game. Addtionally, something that has really started to bother me about Siege of Dragonspear inparticular, is that while the gameplay itself is brilliant, the story itself lacks certain aspects which would have otherwise completed it fully. The most obvious example of this which immediately comes to mind, is that none of the relevant NPCs in this expansion explain nor even admit at all, to who actually sent the assasins to the palace to kill you near the start.  Other than all that, overall this is quite a great game and a great introduction into the epic Baldur's Gate franchise. You can also expect a similar kind of experience described above, in both BG2 Enhanced Edition: Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal (Expansion) and the newly developed BG Expansion: Siege of Dragonspear DLC.

												Baldur's Gate was my first real computer game, and it changed my life. I've never known story telling as good as this in a game, and I've never fallen in love with mechanics as much as in this game.Now, with the enhanced edition, I feel there are enough changes to keep it fresh and relevent. It's definitely been dated as time has passed. The D&D rules are old and require a bit of a learning curve. Still, it's a great homage to one of the titles in Gaming canon.If you haven't played this when it was originally released, you might not enjoy it, but I think it's still worth a go. It was a groundbreaking title, that influenced all RPGs that followed.			"

												If I had to choose one game as the pinnacle of CRPGs and dungeon crawlers, this would be it. Deep character customization, deeper story. It is very hard to not find something to do in this game. Don't want  to do the story just yet? That's cool, there's plenty of other quests to be done. Want to explore for awesome loot and dungeons? There's plenty of that too. The NPCs are excellent as well, as they want to do what they want, even if that means ditching you in moments where you need it most. This sounds tedious, but if a member leaves, chances are they were not suited for your party any ways.Great graphics (for its time), great animations, humorous, story-rich, plenty to do, lots to explore, and just all around fun. 10/10			"

												I've had the original Baldur's Gate since it was first released and since then it's been one of my all time favorite games. I was sceptical about the re-release enhanced edition but decided that since it was on sale I would give it a shot. I was not dissapointed.The new interface, while more technical adds a bit more depth to decision making on equipment. The steam-matchmaking system is incredible compared to the old multi-player, and the higher resolution helps with seeing combat without having the move the screen. Lastly and most importantly it works. Without having to alter windows resolution, bit-colors, or not working simply because it was made for such and older system. 10/10 for an amazing rog with a space hamster.			"

												A truly faithful adaptation of the old classic...BG:EE is exactly what I played over a decade ago, but shined-up a bit for modern hardware.In addition to the classic Baldur's Gate, BG:EE includes Tales of the Sword Coast as well as some additional NPCs, character portraits, and voices.  Nothing Earth-shattering, but it adds a hint of novelty to an old classic.BG:EE is also running on an updated engine with a couple nice new features, like the ability to highlight interact-able items.Of course, it is still the same old game...  Which may turn off some modern gamers.  The graphics aren't terribly impressive.  Combat is a little on the slow and stilted side.  The AD&D 2nd Edition rules are feeling a little old and stiff.  And there's precious little in the way of quest guidance.Still - if you enjoyed Baldur's Gate the first time around, you're sure to enjoy BG:EE.			"

												To play the BG series is to love the BG series. While it's possible to find the original game with it's expansions for less, the additional support, bug fixes and revamped networking makes this a significant technical improvement to a game that was amazing in every other regard. The added Black Pits campaign is very short but a fun aside from the orginal game.			"

While some of the older DnD mechanics can take some time to come to grips with, I can recall no other game where I feel such a sense of achievement from powering up from the ""OH GODS, I DIE IN LIKE TWO HITS"" state most characters start the game as to a nearly unstoppable juggernaught that stands tall against the worst this brutal RPG can throw at you. Not the most user friendly, but anyone looking for a moderate challenge (and lots of character class choices) should check this out.			"

												Tried to play few times with the modded classic version, but couldn't go further than the Nashkel Mines. Not sure exactly why. Probably I modded it wrong and the text was straining my eyes, looting was a hassle and I die all the time. Or probably the classic version looked too old. Or probably because this time I try not to engage enemies in the early game, avoiding hordes of kobolds and slowly gaining exp by doing the easy stuff first.Now with the enhanced version I can loot better. Currently I'm slaughtering bandits for golds. Such a good life.The quest journal is still a mess tho.			"

												This is a review for a very specific catagory of people.I bought this game, along with it's sequal, only so that I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of patching it whenever I reinstalled my existing, regular version. I generally play at least one infinity engine game a year and don't keep them on my hard drive inbetween.If this review was for the game itself it would be nothing but glowing praise. Baldur's gate still somehow stands up to more modern releases when coupled with the tutu mod, et al. As it stands, this enhanced edition changes some elements in a way that I, personally don't like.If you are a returning player, like me, and looking for convinience, I recommend a little research into the differences between this, and a modded original.

												This remake of a amazing classic has managed to stay very true to the orginal. The creators of enhanced edition took the most popular mods and added them into the standard game in addition to fixing various annoyance bugs that plagued the original. While this game offers very little that you cannot get by buying the original and modding it your self, it does off the convenience of a single install without having to mess with the inner files.This game has stood the test of time and will provide you with a amazing amount of depth and replayability, and with the addition of modded content after you finish your first dozen or so playthroughs you can add hundreds of hours to the gameplay.I do infact reccomend this purchase for anyone who has not experienced the saga before as it is perfect for anyone new to the game. For players who already own the original saga and have extended the game with mods this version is less useful, it will not offer you anything aside from new companions that you don't already have.

												Baldur's Gate was my first real computer game, and it changed my life. I've never known story telling as good as this in a game, and I've never fallen in love with mechanics as much as in this game.Now, with the enhanced edition, I feel there are enough changes to keep it fresh and relevent. It's definitely been dated as time has passed. The D&D rules are old and require a bit of a learning curve. Still, it's a great homage to one of the titles in Gaming canon.If you haven't played this when it was originally released, you might not enjoy it, but I think it's still worth a go. It was a groundbreaking title, that influenced all RPGs that followed.			"

												If I had to choose one game as the pinnacle of CRPGs and dungeon crawlers, this would be it. Deep character customization, deeper story. It is very hard to not find something to do in this game. Don't want  to do the story just yet? That's cool, there's plenty of other quests to be done. Want to explore for awesome loot and dungeons? There's plenty of that too. The NPCs are excellent as well, as they want to do what they want, even if that means ditching you in moments where you need it most. This sounds tedious, but if a member leaves, chances are they were not suited for your party any ways.Great graphics (for its time), great animations, humorous, story-rich, plenty to do, lots to explore, and just all around fun. 10/10			"

												What can I say about Baldur's Gate that hasn't already been said? Even though I'm mostly a hardcore adventure game player, this game beats most others hands down. The storyline becomes increasingly interesting as it progresses, and as the territory opens up more and more. Combat is won by intelligent strategy, and the game can be played a multitude of ways. It follows the old classic Dungeons and Dragons rules, where low armour class, for example AC0 or AC -2 is better than Armour Class 6. Somehow this adds to the authenticity of it all. The inventory screen is great: very satisfying, with great sound effects, and clearly one of the models for the World of Warcraft inventory screen. Personally I preferred the inventory screen on the original classic release, but it's not much of a gripe really.Where this beats WoW hands down is in story. ""Quests"" all fit together in a coherent whole, so that they are not mere fetch quests or kill-20-mana-monster affairs, but are intriguing sub-plots, which help you piece together the story. And if you don't do a quest fast enough - for example saving a loved one - one of your party members can get upset and attack you. Yes, your party members can attack each other, and this can be a nightmare when facing opponents who can Charm you, etc.The number of curios in this game, from hamsters to pantaloons, is brilliant, all of which make it seem like a detailed world you progress in. You can steal or kill good characters if you wish, but this has ramifications. You also have to keep party members happy if they are of different alignments, and they occasionally have conversations with each other, which come out in the audio voice acting - which is terrific. The soundtrack is truly incredible. Michael Hoenig did an awesome job.This really is a fantasy roleplay game, as opposed to a slash'n'bash affair. Fans will probably dive straight to the plough fields to see if the ankheg armour is there. It seems impossible that this game is so old now - released in 1998 - but was and still is light years ahead of its time in terms of sheer playability. The modding community was also very active after its sequel Baldur's Gate II and Icewind Dale, creating mods such as The Darkest Day, and all sorts of weird and wonderful exploits, all of which could make the game even more interesting, given a sensible level of tweaking. Someone even produced a huge all-encompassing Big World package a few years back which brought as many mods together into one package.You can multi-class and be a mage/druid and fighter as your main character - you can have six in total at any one time, but you can always sack someone and re-hire later. You can die! Quite easily if you are not sensible, so progress saving is a must. You can walk around like a travelling halberd salesman with a bag full of weapons, or travel light, as you wish. The level of detail in this game indicates that the creators were big fans of D&D, and did I mention that it all ties in to Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms campaigns, popularised by R.A. Salvatore's books? No, I didn't did I. Also big props to Beamdog for simply providing me with a Steam key after I gave them my purchased serial. A company doing things right. Bioware is now a household name, but even after the publishing of Baldur's Gate they were not so well-known - but Bioware were not the publishers - they were the developers. One of the designers, James Ohlen, was also a lead designer for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which also has a truly great story. Another, Ray Muzyka, was bizarrely a practising physician, along with his co-founder Greg Zeschuk. Proving once and for all, that D&D is for everyone.			"

												A classic game that made D&D the coolest thing since sliced bread. It reminded me of why when old D&D mages chose anything other than sleep their party killed them and told them ""This time don't pick anything other than sleep. Dumbass."" If anything is to be said of gameplay it is this, quicksave often this game cuts your heros down like a sexual predator does children sudden and when it is least expected. But it is the repeated gesture of trying new and interesting combinations of skills and abilities that eventually lead you to triumph over some obstacles, the rest is usually luck. By in large one of the most rewarding experiences i've had in a long, long time.			"

												The classic returns with high resolution support. Still the great game and story that it always was but now easier to play on newer machines. There is litterally no reason for any RPG fan to not buy this. If you played the original it's not like rose tinted glasses but a direct window back to the glory days. If you didn't then now is the chance to experience one the defining moments of the genre.			"

												The core of the game is still there, and what's been added fits in seamlessly.  If you want to save the 100+ hours for something newer, stay away because you probably won't be able to help yourself once you start on the campaign.The whole arena campaign is kinda meh, but that's not really what you're getting the game for so it doesn't really detract from the experience.

												This game is the holy grail for RPG games.. This game is straight up ADAD 2nd Edition,Everthing about it is D and D from classes to monsters.i should also note that if you don't like reading this game is not for you,it is an old game so their is no voices reading the texts so you have to read it to actually  to know what you need to do in the game. If you have never played D and D the games monsters are going to surprise you on what they do and all the magic items and spells you won't know what they do unless you have actually played D and D. this game is really fun to play and i strongly recomend it to big RPG or D and D fans.

												Baldur's Gate and B♥♥♥♥re awsome.  Baldur's gate + new char's + new missions + new areas + new resolution = stop reading this and buy it.Baldur gate had a very strong story that kept you pushing to find out the truth.  There are many twist in the story that makes you believe that you know what is going and who is responsible.  Then boom, you are poorly mistaken.  Baldur's gate's story is able to keep you hooked because of this.Gameplay has always been fun and challenging.  Because of limited resources, wheter spell count, ammo, or broken weapons; this game makes you think (hit the space bar and plan) and then react based on your assets.  Did you spam all your spells?? Bad move, that was just the first fight in this dungeon!! You just brought 2 quivers of bolts/arrows?  Silly Silly man.  Basically, if you enjoy playing  a games that makes you use your brain;  you will be happy.  You enjoy FPS where all you do is dash and shotgun people, then this isn't for you.			"

												This isometric strategy rpg rewards you for creative use of your party's skills while you uncover a secret as to why you are hunted by a powerful dark lord. There are so many quest in this game that I would be suprised if you found them all in your first playthrough. Just as fun as the original, but with an improved UI and bug fixes. It includes the extra characters, and their side stories, as well as the expansion. One of the features I enjoyed the most with the new UI is the color changes between each character. It really makes it clear who is who when you have two people wearing the same armor.			"

Unfortunately I experienced some graphical errors while playing this version. I haven't heard of this problem elsewhere so it is possible that it is my computer and settings that caused this.http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/7385/important-regarding-intel-hardware-driver-issues-slow-game-performanceI looked up the problem and it appears to be with intel processors?

I replayed both many times. The enhanced edition changes are ok I guess. The support for higher resolutions and smoother graphics all together are the nicest addition. The Black Pits are pretty much meh.			"

												If you played BG back in the day, you will find this version much, much more playable on your modern PC. I played BD and BG2 for years, multiple times across a decade, but mostly stuck to B♥♥♥♥s the resolution for BG was terrible (thus the game becomes more time-consuming than it need be) and tinkering with the mods was becoming troublesome.If you want a super-playable BG out of the box, I got this for 5 bucks on steam, and oh man, its better than before. BG2 rules and classes/spells means I can look forward to a cleaner import to BG2 (because cmon that's whatcha wanna do isn't it). It should be obvious, I'm speaking to the experienced players of BG. I have no idea what a newcomer would think of the price, given the graphics (even with the awesome resolution fix, its still ten years old). Us old-timers play the game nostalgically, and that's the reason I bought the game. Also I waited for it to come on sale, and am waiting for BG2 to go on sale as well...			"

You always thought there was a little more you should know because of a random scroll, text, tomble, or ""other"" you just finished reading.  That imperfection is less overwelming in this game.  I think it is under appreciated.  I give it 5 out of 5.  Trying to put the mouse away with this game isn't easy!			"

												Baldur's Gate 1, while not as good as the 2nd Shadows of Amn and thone of bhaal, is a great title.I played the original version ages ago and while it had its flaws was a great experience.This version now only fixes the flaws but made several improvements and even added extra stuff to boot.And seriously, who need full 3D worlds, the art style of these games for the background and characters are like playing a beautiful classic painting and fuels your imagination of how it must look like from your characters perspective.

												Don't let my ""low"" hours fool you, I have a copy of the original game that I've played for at least a hundred hours, and I quite often play my games in ""offline"" mode.A huge amount of story depth, wonderfully rich characters with growth, a true-to-the-source gameplay and character creation...all these things are in Baldur's Gate. And the Enhanced Edition just makes it even better.If you like Role-Playing Games then you'll probably like this game, unless you are a complete graphics-♥♥♥♥♥ that can't stand playing anything less than Crysis games or Skyrim. If you can ""stomach"" games like Diablo 2, Sacrifice, or any other ""old games"" with ""bad graphics"" then you'll discover a rich, wonderful story just waiting to be heard and explored. In addition, you'll find extravagently beautiful (especially for 1998) backgrounds, voice acting, sounds, paintings, and buildings in this game. If you played Neverwinter Nights (1 and/or 2), Planescape: Tormet, Divine Divinity, Icewind Dale, or any other ""iconic"" RPG then you'll definitely want to play this game.However, you also might want to realize that in a game like this you'll want to micromanage the crap out of your party. After every round you'll probably want to pause, make sure your spellcasters (or damage dealers) are going to actually do something that round of attacks, and then unpause. I can't tell you how many times I've had to pause to make sure my Archer is attacking something, since he kills damn near everything in two to three hits and there's no way I'm letting him switch to his AI, which wants him to attack enemies with his DAMN FISTS. STUPID AI!*Ahem* Anyway, yeah, you'll want to make sure your spellcasters do something after each spell, that your high-accuracy high-damaging characters switch targets, and that you probably won't want to use most of the AI (as is always the case in RPGs in my experience).

The enhanced edition captures all the nostalgia of the original game and lives up to its name as the Enhanced Edition with great new features such as new characters, quests, an extra storyline (The Black Pitts), and a much better multiplayer base. If anyone is looking for a great way to just relax, save a few villagers, and kill a BUNCH of Kobolds along the way then try living the 90's D&D adventure.			"

If you are a newer hardcore gamer and enjoy RPGs I would HIGHLY reccomend playing this game.  It will take you a few tries and countless hours but you will greatly enjoy the story and the experience.   With ~25 classes and even more combinations the ability to reply this game is there.  I have spent easily 200hours or more on this game in my life and still enjoy it every time I come back to play it.			"

												I firest played Baldur's Gate when they actually charged money for demos. It was a great game, so I purchased the whole things and spent a few summers at least playing this game between school years. I've now purchased it again on Steam, and it's better than ever. The enhanced edition brings some new features and helps complete the game in a more modern era of gaming. It is a lot more resource intensive than it used to be however. Making me wonder what method they used to update the game. I was suprised my laptop couldn't play it decently even though it's light years ahead of the computer I played the original version on.			"

												When my Dad was slightly younger, he had the ""Gold Box"" titles of D&D games, in all of their intrigue. I played them, but I was much too young to understand any of it - while I remember him pulling out journals and reading and drawing maps and all kinds of other things. This game is my ""Gold Box"" -- my golden age of D&D RPGs. Though it has aged, it still carries much of the mystery and sheer bigness that I remember. Now, it is immortalized (hopefully!) so that my children can look back and say, ""Hah, how primitive, and yet how interesting.""			"

												With regard's to Baldur's Gate itself: This is perhaps the greatest RPG that has ever been made. To be a fan of this genre and to have not played this game is pure blasphemy and should be reconciled immediately. All kidding aside, this game is truly incredible and it is a true testament to its quality that it can stand up to current generation games. Baldur's Gate is based upon the Dungeons and Dragons' D20 system and borrows from the Forgotten Realms universe. The game has an incredible cast of characters, varied environments, well-balanced gameplay and so much depth that you'll want to play every class again and again.If there were any black mark's against this game, it is only that people who do not know D&D and Advanced D&D rules will struggle and the difficulty curve is more of a scatter plot on your first play through since the game gives very little direction and it is very easy to get into high difficulty encounters at low levels if you go into the wrong areas.With regards to the Enhanced Edition: The game came out in 1998 and this edition manages to fix many bugs and update the graphics to make them less pixelly and more tolerable to play on high resolution systems. Additionally, several new characters, companions and quests have been added to give veterans something new.There is no game I'd reccomend more than this... except Baldur's Gate II...			"

You get to control a D&D party as they go on adventure, interact with NPCs, and reveal a pretty cool plot. It's just a ton of fun, and hours and hours of entertainment. I mean HOURS. I've barely scratched the surface of the enhanced edition, but so far it is just as good as I remember, so it wasn't just good because of nostalgia. It was good because its a freaking awesome game.

												Baldur's Gate 2 is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. But I never played BG1. I feel that 1's characters were not quite as memorable, I prefered the areas of 2 more, and Irenicus is among my favorite villains to this day. That said BG:EE is a great game. I've spent most of my time playing the Android version since I tend to like CRPGs more when I'm traveling nowadays.  And other than some mobile specific issues, the Enhanced Edition works well enough that I'd happily recommend this game to fans of older turn based tactical style RPGs.If you enjoyed recent titles like Divinity Original Sin or Wasteland 2, keep in mind how many absolute classics there used to be. This genre was huge in the 90s and is coming back. I have spent time with 3 of the Enhanced Edition games so far and I've enjoyed them all so far. If you played the original versions to the point of not feeling the need to go back, the EE does not add much (other than multiplayer functionality) but I find that not having to mod the older GoG version on modern systems is worth the extra cost.Players that want to save a bit of money, the older versions of all Enhanced Edition games can work on modern systems but require a little extra leg work. Or just catch these games on sale.			"

Great RPG, cool world to explore, little humor here and there and the story is interesting. Though I must say that the story in BG2 is bigger and darker and BG1 scratches only the surface of the back story of your character.But in any case, if you like RPG's and you can see past the dated graphics, you'll have hours and hours of RPG goodness.

The story will suck you in and immerse you into a world of intrigue and politics, treachery and adventure.  Characters are well fleshed out and feel alive as they talk with you about your surroundings and actions.  And there is a veritable cornucopia of weapons, spells and tactics to ply your unsuspecting foes with!  You owe it to yourself to play this series!			"

												Get ready for some serious RPGing. It's intimidating at first but the game will eventually grow on you. Beware action heroes this is a real-time point and click RPG, not a sword swinging, spell slinging killing game. Take this review from the perspective of a non DND player.General information-  Strong association to character, class and story (Alignments, Class restrictive to alignments, Characters take note of story events and alignments)Combat takes place with unseen dice rolls for hitting and damaging targets. Magic once used has charges (depending on the type of mage/wizard)Every class seems to be resourceful and well thought out with a serious amount of balance for the first time player. (Thieves are extremely useful, as are mages/wizards. Detecting traps and uncovering magical items are what these classes can be used for)5 NPCs can be used in a party. (It's recommeded to actually have a party, this game isn't a cake walk without one. Alternatively 5 players can also be used if you can ever get a game going)Items and spells are locked to class restrictions so planning is a character is a useful way to succeed in your adventures!Careful planning before encounters are advised when going into unknown territory (Unlike some games where running through the front door would be the norm)Sleeping in game is a option for recovery of spells and healing.Banter between player character/other characters is a welcome breeze for character delevopment and story telling. (I know it's a bioware game, shut up lol. This is normal I get it.)IMMERSION. Try to become the character if you will :3.Auto-saving frequently will save your keyboard from a Dark Souls/Skyrim wrath-like reaction.When characters in your party die they can be resurrected but will drop all items on the floor where they died. Positives and Negatives-+Some voiced lines but mostly text.+Played with the pause feature actually being a critical part of play.+The class system is what you would expect from a DND experience, maybe lack luster (Unmodded/hasn't played DND)+A strong focus on story telling. Although the second is where it get's beefy.+Extremely strong character roster, much better in the sequel but still worth a buy.+Not too flashy. Most games have extremely flashy fights and what not to make the game appear more dramatic than it is. This game just hits it right in the dot for me. It's more of a + than a negative really.-Poor multiplayer, what else needs to be said? I had a bad time connecting to people and keeping it stable. Probably just me but who knows.-While it has strong story telling the story is lacking in this edition, buy the second one and with mods you can play this version on the second BG2.-Old style graphics. Think like Rune Scape/Helbreath/Diablo 2/ Etc-Ran on my PC but might not for others, friends have told me concerns of the game being unable to run correctly, their spec's vary.TL:DR - DND simulator with a top down perspective and real time combat (With pause feature). Interesting story and characters. 7/10 a good buy if its your first game in the series, wait for a sale don't buy the game for $20, see GIF http://i.imgur.com/uBqtwws.gif "

												A classic that put Bioware on the map. It is in depth, challenging, rewarding, charming, and most of all it's DND. Modern players most likely won't like the learning curve or the slow pace unless they already have some tabletop experience. The best way to think of this game is a ""simulated DND session where the PC is your DM."" (Dungeon Master for those unfamiliar with the term.)Play IF:You like rich storyYou like table top games (DND, Pathfinder, Shadowrun, etc.)You seek a challengeLove the DND Campaign setting ""Forgotten Realms"" (This is where the more recently release ""Neverwinter"" MMO and the famous RA Salvatore Drow novels takes place....in this game you can run into the Drow himself by the way.)You want a steep learning curve that once understood makes for an indescribable feeling of accomplishment.You like traditional high fantasy settingsYou like controlling more than your own character (Success depends on orders given to up to six party memebers.)You like various flavored NPCs to recruit (There is a large amount of potential party members to pick up or kick out of your party and they react to how you choose to play the game.)You want replayability (Play it as the ultimate good guy then go back and slaughter everyone no matter who they are.)All in all Baldur's gate is one of my favortie rpg franchises if not my all time favorite. It isn't for everybody but those who it is for know what I'm talking about. It's pretty often I hear those around my age say their favorite game of all time is Baldur's Gate II. This one is a great setup for that one and I highly recommend it. If you aren't use to it then be patient, give it time, and think outside of the box. This game does not hold your hand like most of today's games. You may just fall in love with a genre of game that is nearly  forgotten today. That being said...here's to the current crpg renaissance.			"

												Fought Wyvern. Died.10/10Edit:Finished the game. Boy was that awesome. I beat all of the ToTSC expansion and did a decent amount of side quests, no normal difficulty in 60 hours. Could have kept myself busy for a while longer with sidequests and Black Pits but I am ready to move onto BG2. As a kid I wanted to love this game but the reading and D&D system was too much for me. Very happy that I was able to pick this back up 15 years later and finally complete it. Still have my old BG collectors edition. Big map and everything. Very nostalgic. Cant wait to undertake the rest of the Beamdog games. Thanks guys!			"

												Excellent game.  I was disapointed at first when I bought it because of the number of bugs, so I uninstalled the game.  I gave it another try after a big patch was released and the game was much better !Being able to play as any kit from Baldur's Gate 2 gives the game a hole new gameplay.  I already owned Baldur's Gate on the 5 CDs, but bought it again for the new features.  The new NPCs are good, but I didn't keep them after finishing their quests.I was a bit disapointed with Black pit, it's only a small arena repeating fight after fights...  it's not that long and not worth it as a reason to buy the game.

												If you were lucky enough to grow up in the 90s (as I was) and experience the masterpiece the first time around, then this should be an easy buy for you. It's the original (with Tales of the SC) with additional quest lines, character portraits, voices, and more, plus the action packed ""Black Pits"" mode where you generate a full party of characters to go into an arena of ever more difficult opponents.If, however, you never had the chanc to play Baldur's Gate before, let me tell you, you're in for a treat. Before BioWare made Dragon Age, Jade Empire, Knights of the Old Republic, and Mass Effect, they created a true work of art in Baldur's Gate. It uses 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons as the ruleset, and is to my mind, the closest thing that you can find to a true D&D experience in video game form to date. This isn't a hack and slash, folks; it takes planning, party management, and depending on the characters, an inventive use of your available spells. But if you're smart enough to be up to the challenge, Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II are enthralling experiences worthy of your time.			"

This game is a very good game once you get  far enough in it and have a decent level charater/party.  MY only problem i had is with the EE version is that they took some stuff out of the original game thaat was not in the EE version. My other issue is i had with the game is that i could not put disk 1 to 5 in to my pc when the screen show up.

Posted: February 19, 2015
												Alright. This review is from someone who never played the original Baldur's Gates. For me, this game was really hard to get into. I kept starting it, spending an hour trying to get the highest roll on my character, and then when I got to the game, the graphics just completely turned me off. I felt like maybe I was just too late and my palate had been tainted by newer games. So about a week ago I decided to force myself to spend a couple hours to give the game a fair shot. I am very pleased with myself that I made that decision.The characters, atmosphere, dialogue trees, and challenging fights really make this game quite enjoyable. Character customization feels limited compared to newer titles like Neverwinter Nights 2 and Dragon Age Origins, but you can see very clearly how this game is the early ancestor of those titles. Despite the limitations of being an older title, Baldur's Gate feels incredibly deep. It's also a lot darker in some ways than most newer rpgs are.I suppose if I'm being objective, I can name a couple criticisms. It seems like your party members sometimes have a hard time going to a spot that you tell them to, especially if you have your whole party selected. For example, one of the party members will randomly decide to take the long way ALL the way around a mountain instead of just going a much shorter distance to his destination. So it kind of forces you to be on your toes and really micromanage your party's individual movements, and not in the ""good"" ""hardcore rpg micromanagement"" kind of way. Actually, that's the only criticism I can think of. I like this game so much I decided to make my avatar Xzar. ""Montaron! I... I never loved you!""Easy 8/10 if taking its age into consideration. Newer or more casual gamers may not be able to get into this game very easily, but you should really give it your best effort!Edit: Seems like a lot of people are complaining about crazy bugs and other problems. Just for the record, I never had a single problem. But just keep those in mind.			"

												This review contains general points about the baldur's gate series, summaries of both the main game and the expansion which I completed just recently, as well as my own personal experiences with both games.General Points about the Baldur's Gate seriesAnyone who loves hardcore rpg strategy-based games, with a more advanced D&D (Dungeons & Dragons) ruleset, will no doubt enjoy this epic game and its respective counter-parts. The Baldur's Gate franchise hinges on the story being based on the specific era where Nobles, peasants, commoners, elves, drow, orcs, ogres and all other manner of creatures of varying strengths and abilities existed. Brilliant story and brilliant gameplay indeed.Know that you not only have the option to complete this game solo, but you also have the option of completing it with friends and/or other party members which you can also choose to have come on your journey with you. If you're feeling super hardcore and are also brave enough to meet any challenge with your super over-levelled protagonist character/created party members, you can also try to complete this game on its hardest and newest difficulty ""Legacy of Bhaal"", but know that you will not be able to change your preferred difficulty if you chose LoB difficulty at the start of your session.Summary of the beginning of Baldur's GateYou start off in a place known as Candlekeep (your hometown) raised by your foster father Gorian and at some point he becomes increasingly concerned that you're in danger, so he urges you to leave candlekeep with him in the hopes that you'll be safer and shortly after leaving Candlekeep, Gorian and you are ambushed by a gang of thugs and Gorian fends them off himself so you can escape, sacrificing himself in the process. A girl named Imoen offers to join you as your primary objective is to set out to find who the the leader of those gang of thugs really was that killed Gorian. From then on, the story can unfold in quite a few ways depending on what you decide to do next after that.Summary of the beginning of the Siege of Dragonspear ExpansionAfter successfully beating the final boss of the main game (which henceforth declares you, the ""Hero of Baldur's Gate""), you start off in an underground tomb underneath the Baldur's Gate city, accompanied by Imoen (who, if you recall from the main game, offers to join your party after you left Candlekeep), any other party member who was with you in the main game if at all, and the Flaming Fist (who are essentially, the military army you encountered inside the Baldur's Gate city from the main game when you first entered it), with your first primary objective, being to locate and bring to justice in any manner of your choosing (i.e. kill outright or leave alive long enough to have em taken into Flaming Fist custody) a certain avid follower of the Final Boss whom you defeated in the main game. Once that's over with, your party members leave you to go on with their lives, while you and Imoen then end up within the Royal Ducal Palace bedroom of Baldur's Gate, for some rest and respite, until out of nowhere, some unknown assasins infiltrate the bedroom where you and Imoen are. intent on killing you. However, Imoen is the one that takes a critical hit from said assasins, to the effect that a poison attack leaves her near death. Unconfirmed rumours then start flying around that it was the charismatic warrior, Caelar Argent, and her ""Holy Crusade"" who may have been behind this. Accordingly, your new primary objectives for the rest of the game are two-fold: Firstly, to find out who specifically sent those assasins after you, and; Secondly, to also kill the respective perpetrator of those assasins, by any means necessary.My own personal experiences playing both Baldur's Gate and the expansion, Siege of DragonspearI personally enjoy the thrill of being able to enter into battle wondering if I have enough weapons and armour attributes to survive the encounter. Having certain characters (or possibly other friends involved) as party members are also a great help.When I do end up surviving said battle, my created character gains varying amounts of experience and sometimes upgrades, but when I don't, I either attempt to find other avenues of defeating that which had defeated me the first time or if I've exhausted all options, then I attempt to avoid having to fight it if I can.Another thing I enjoy about this game series also, are the varying ""relationship"" dialogues that can happen between a created character and a certain opposite gender party member. The relationship between your protagonist and the opposite gender party member will either keep going or break up with you (even to the extent of leaving the party if bad enough) depending on how you respond to their dialogue with you. Only thing that has frustrated me about this game series off-hand however, is that whenever a party member wants to go on a specific quest and you chose to let him/her into the party, but after a while when he/she realizes that your party is either ""too good/bad"" for him/her, he/she abruptly leaves the party and never returns, thus that quest that you originally accepted regarding that party member that abruptly left, remains permenantly unfinished for the rest of the game. Addtionally, something that has really started to bother me about Siege of Dragonspear inparticular, is that while the gameplay itself is brilliant, the story itself lacks certain aspects which would have otherwise completed it fully. The most obvious example of this which immediately comes to mind, is that none of the relevant NPCs in this expansion explain nor even admit at all, to who actually sent the assasins to the palace to kill you near the start.  Other than all that, overall this is quite a great game and a great introduction into the epic Baldur's Gate franchise. You can also expect a similar kind of experience described above, in both BG2 Enhanced Edition: Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal (Expansion) and the newly developed BG Expansion: Siege of Dragonspear DLC.

Unless there's a mod that you absolutely have to have the Enhanced Edition is a must have for BG / CRPG fans.			"

In ‘98 you had a 15 inch CRT, so you’re not going to notice or care probably. Nowadays when you’ve got an HD screen, you’re like, ‘Oh, those are coffee beans.’ We had to render out new streets and then lay them into the original 2D art and then paint over it. It was this whole process.”i didn't get the DLC SOD, so i dont have to see the unacceptable things they change to char  personality's besides the fact, that it dose not even play like BG or BG2 its pretty much linear it has chapters of open world but once the chapters done you can no longer go to the previous areas.but as for the gay or trans char its not really that forced and in the D&Dfirst edition there's a gods who come to people as what ever gender they want so a trans in the game is no biggie or a gay but the personality's of set characters not the new ones being changed is unacceptable in my opinion also the fact that allot of your choices in the game mean nothing unlike the original BG1&2 i really dont care that i can now see and play with 100+ char in a screen at once means nothing to me			"

												I LOVE THIS SERIES!  I had the original disks and when I saw this ""enhanced"" tag I knew I had to play it again.  Fun to play for those into old fashioned RPG D&D styled games.  PLENTY of characters and ways you can play the game with graphic updates to match the second version so visually more appealing imho.  Only downside is the DLC characters, specifically Neera.  Kinda like a bad npc mod who spends most of the time complaining and being trying to be sassy that I tried avoiding her on other runs through the game but nice to have EARLY game if you prefer a non evil spellcaster that can cast more damaging spells than Xan and also isn't a babbling psychopath like Xar. Over all a good time and a goofy but fun story with lots to do!			"

												Alright. This review is from someone who never played the original Baldur's Gates. For me, this game was really hard to get into. I kept starting it, spending an hour trying to get the highest roll on my character, and then when I got to the game, the graphics just completely turned me off. I felt like maybe I was just too late and my palate had been tainted by newer games. So about a week ago I decided to force myself to spend a couple hours to give the game a fair shot. I am very pleased with myself that I made that decision.The characters, atmosphere, dialogue trees, and challenging fights really make this game quite enjoyable. Character customization feels limited compared to newer titles like Neverwinter Nights 2 and Dragon Age Origins, but you can see very clearly how this game is the early ancestor of those titles. Despite the limitations of being an older title, Baldur's Gate feels incredibly deep. It's also a lot darker in some ways than most newer rpgs are.I suppose if I'm being objective, I can name a couple criticisms. It seems like your party members sometimes have a hard time going to a spot that you tell them to, especially if you have your whole party selected. For example, one of the party members will randomly decide to take the long way ALL the way around a mountain instead of just going a much shorter distance to his destination. So it kind of forces you to be on your toes and really micromanage your party's individual movements, and not in the ""good"" ""hardcore rpg micromanagement"" kind of way. Actually, that's the only criticism I can think of. I like this game so much I decided to make my avatar Xzar. ""Montaron! I... I never loved you!""Easy 8/10 if taking its age into consideration. Newer or more casual gamers may not be able to get into this game very easily, but you should really give it your best effort!Edit: Seems like a lot of people are complaining about crazy bugs and other problems. Just for the record, I never had a single problem. But just keep those in mind.			"

												I was fairly 'meh' about the Enhanced Editions but the 2.0 patch has completely sold me on them. BG has never looked better and the quality of life improvements actually make it enjoyable to play without the whole host of mods I usually install. Beamdog's original content (characters, classes, etc.) is still mediocre IMO but easy enough to ignore. Unless there's a mod that you absolutely have to have the Enhanced Edition is a must have for BG / CRPG fans.			"

												This review contains general points about the baldur's gate series, summaries of both the main game and the expansion which I completed just recently, as well as my own personal experiences with both games.General Points about the Baldur's Gate seriesAnyone who loves hardcore rpg strategy-based games, with a more advanced D&D (Dungeons & Dragons) ruleset, will no doubt enjoy this epic game and its respective counter-parts. The Baldur's Gate franchise hinges on the story being based on the specific era where Nobles, peasants, commoners, elves, drow, orcs, ogres and all other manner of creatures of varying strengths and abilities existed. Brilliant story and brilliant gameplay indeed.Know that you not only have the option to complete this game solo, but you also have the option of completing it with friends and/or other party members which you can also choose to have come on your journey with you. If you're feeling super hardcore and are also brave enough to meet any challenge with your super over-levelled protagonist character/created party members, you can also try to complete this game on its hardest and newest difficulty ""Legacy of Bhaal"", but know that you will not be able to change your preferred difficulty if you chose LoB difficulty at the start of your session.Summary of the beginning of Baldur's GateYou start off in a place known as Candlekeep (your hometown) raised by your foster father Gorian and at some point he becomes increasingly concerned that you're in danger, so he urges you to leave candlekeep with him in the hopes that you'll be safer and shortly after leaving Candlekeep, Gorian and you are ambushed by a gang of thugs and Gorian fends them off himself so you can escape, sacrificing himself in the process. A girl named Imoen offers to join you as your primary objective is to set out to find who the the leader of those gang of thugs really was that killed Gorian. From then on, the story can unfold in quite a few ways depending on what you decide to do next after that.Summary of the beginning of the Siege of Dragonspear ExpansionAfter successfully beating the final boss of the main game (which henceforth declares you, the ""Hero of Baldur's Gate""), you start off in an underground tomb underneath the Baldur's Gate city, accompanied by Imoen (who, if you recall from the main game, offers to join your party after you left Candlekeep), any other party member who was with you in the main game if at all, and the Flaming Fist (who are essentially, the military army you encountered inside the Baldur's Gate city from the main game when you first entered it), with your first primary objective, being to locate and bring to justice in any manner of your choosing (i.e. kill outright or leave alive long enough to have em taken into Flaming Fist custody) a certain avid follower of the Final Boss whom you defeated in the main game. Once that's over with, your party members leave you to go on with their lives, while you and Imoen then end up within the Royal Ducal Palace bedroom of Baldur's Gate, for some rest and respite, until out of nowhere, some unknown assasins infiltrate the bedroom where you and Imoen are. intent on killing you. However, Imoen is the one that takes a critical hit from said assasins, to the effect that a poison attack leaves her near death. Unconfirmed rumours then start flying around that it was the charismatic warrior, Caelar Argent, and her ""Holy Crusade"" who may have been behind this. Accordingly, your new primary objectives for the rest of the game are two-fold: Firstly, to find out who specifically sent those assasins after you, and; Secondly, to also kill the respective perpetrator of those assasins, by any means necessary.My own personal experiences playing both Baldur's Gate and the expansion, Siege of DragonspearI personally enjoy the thrill of being able to enter into battle wondering if I have enough weapons and armour attributes to survive the encounter. Having certain characters (or possibly other friends involved) as party members are also a great help.When I do end up surviving said battle, my created character gains varying amounts of experience and sometimes upgrades, but when I don't, I either attempt to find other avenues of defeating that which had defeated me the first time or if I've exhausted all options, then I attempt to avoid having to fight it if I can.Another thing I enjoy about this game series also, are the varying ""relationship"" dialogues that can happen between a created character and a certain opposite gender party member. The relationship between your protagonist and the opposite gender party member will either keep going or break up with you (even to the extent of leaving the party if bad enough) depending on how you respond to their dialogue with you. Only thing that has frustrated me about this game series off-hand however, is that whenever a party member wants to go on a specific quest and you chose to let him/her into the party, but after a while when he/she realizes that your party is either ""too good/bad"" for him/her, he/she abruptly leaves the party and never returns, thus that quest that you originally accepted regarding that party member that abruptly left, remains permenantly unfinished for the rest of the game. Addtionally, something that has really started to bother me about Siege of Dragonspear inparticular, is that while the gameplay itself is brilliant, the story itself lacks certain aspects which would have otherwise completed it fully. The most obvious example of this which immediately comes to mind, is that none of the relevant NPCs in this expansion explain nor even admit at all, to who actually sent the assasins to the palace to kill you near the start.  Other than all that, overall this is quite a great game and a great introduction into the epic Baldur's Gate franchise. You can also expect a similar kind of experience described above, in both BG2 Enhanced Edition: Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal (Expansion) and the newly developed BG Expansion: Siege of Dragonspear DLC.

												Baldur's Gate was my first real computer game, and it changed my life. I've never known story telling as good as this in a game, and I've never fallen in love with mechanics as much as in this game.Now, with the enhanced edition, I feel there are enough changes to keep it fresh and relevent. It's definitely been dated as time has passed. The D&D rules are old and require a bit of a learning curve. Still, it's a great homage to one of the titles in Gaming canon.If you haven't played this when it was originally released, you might not enjoy it, but I think it's still worth a go. It was a groundbreaking title, that influenced all RPGs that followed.			"

												If I had to choose one game as the pinnacle of CRPGs and dungeon crawlers, this would be it. Deep character customization, deeper story. It is very hard to not find something to do in this game. Don't want  to do the story just yet? That's cool, there's plenty of other quests to be done. Want to explore for awesome loot and dungeons? There's plenty of that too. The NPCs are excellent as well, as they want to do what they want, even if that means ditching you in moments where you need it most. This sounds tedious, but if a member leaves, chances are they were not suited for your party any ways.Great graphics (for its time), great animations, humorous, story-rich, plenty to do, lots to explore, and just all around fun. 10/10			"

												What can I say about Baldur's Gate that hasn't already been said? Even though I'm mostly a hardcore adventure game player, this game beats most others hands down. The storyline becomes increasingly interesting as it progresses, and as the territory opens up more and more. Combat is won by intelligent strategy, and the game can be played a multitude of ways. It follows the old classic Dungeons and Dragons rules, where low armour class, for example AC0 or AC -2 is better than Armour Class 6. Somehow this adds to the authenticity of it all. The inventory screen is great: very satisfying, with great sound effects, and clearly one of the models for the World of Warcraft inventory screen. Personally I preferred the inventory screen on the original classic release, but it's not much of a gripe really.Where this beats WoW hands down is in story. ""Quests"" all fit together in a coherent whole, so that they are not mere fetch quests or kill-20-mana-monster affairs, but are intriguing sub-plots, which help you piece together the story. And if you don't do a quest fast enough - for example saving a loved one - one of your party members can get upset and attack you. Yes, your party members can attack each other, and this can be a nightmare when facing opponents who can Charm you, etc.The number of curios in this game, from hamsters to pantaloons, is brilliant, all of which make it seem like a detailed world you progress in. You can steal or kill good characters if you wish, but this has ramifications. You also have to keep party members happy if they are of different alignments, and they occasionally have conversations with each other, which come out in the audio voice acting - which is terrific. The soundtrack is truly incredible. Michael Hoenig did an awesome job.This really is a fantasy roleplay game, as opposed to a slash'n'bash affair. Fans will probably dive straight to the plough fields to see if the ankheg armour is there. It seems impossible that this game is so old now - released in 1998 - but was and still is light years ahead of its time in terms of sheer playability. The modding community was also very active after its sequel Baldur's Gate II and Icewind Dale, creating mods such as The Darkest Day, and all sorts of weird and wonderful exploits, all of which could make the game even more interesting, given a sensible level of tweaking. Someone even produced a huge all-encompassing Big World package a few years back which brought as many mods together into one package.You can multi-class and be a mage/druid and fighter as your main character - you can have six in total at any one time, but you can always sack someone and re-hire later. You can die! Quite easily if you are not sensible, so progress saving is a must. You can walk around like a travelling halberd salesman with a bag full of weapons, or travel light, as you wish. The level of detail in this game indicates that the creators were big fans of D&D, and did I mention that it all ties in to Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms campaigns, popularised by R.A. Salvatore's books? No, I didn't did I. Also big props to Beamdog for simply providing me with a Steam key after I gave them my purchased serial. A company doing things right. Bioware is now a household name, but even after the publishing of Baldur's Gate they were not so well-known - but Bioware were not the publishers - they were the developers. One of the designers, James Ohlen, was also a lead designer for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which also has a truly great story. Another, Ray Muzyka, was bizarrely a practising physician, along with his co-founder Greg Zeschuk. Proving once and for all, that D&D is for everyone.			"

												I truly think there in no other game like this.  BG2 for PC was a bench mark game in RPG games.  It's stories were a little difficult to follow. You always thought there was a little more you should know because of a random scroll, text, tomble, or ""other"" you just finished reading.  That imperfection is less overwelming in this game.  I think it is under appreciated.  I give it 5 out of 5.  Trying to put the mouse away with this game isn't easy!			"

												Baldur's Gate 1, while not as good as the 2nd Shadows of Amn and thone of bhaal, is a great title.I played the original version ages ago and while it had its flaws was a great experience.This version now only fixes the flaws but made several improvements and even added extra stuff to boot.And seriously, who need full 3D worlds, the art style of these games for the background and characters are like playing a beautiful classic painting and fuels your imagination of how it must look like from your characters perspective.

												Don't let my ""low"" hours fool you, I have a copy of the original game that I've played for at least a hundred hours, and I quite often play my games in ""offline"" mode.A huge amount of story depth, wonderfully rich characters with growth, a true-to-the-source gameplay and character creation...all these things are in Baldur's Gate. And the Enhanced Edition just makes it even better.If you like Role-Playing Games then you'll probably like this game, unless you are a complete graphics-♥♥♥♥♥ that can't stand playing anything less than Crysis games or Skyrim. If you can ""stomach"" games like Diablo 2, Sacrifice, or any other ""old games"" with ""bad graphics"" then you'll discover a rich, wonderful story just waiting to be heard and explored. In addition, you'll find extravagently beautiful (especially for 1998) backgrounds, voice acting, sounds, paintings, and buildings in this game. If you played Neverwinter Nights (1 and/or 2), Planescape: Tormet, Divine Divinity, Icewind Dale, or any other ""iconic"" RPG then you'll definitely want to play this game.However, you also might want to realize that in a game like this you'll want to micromanage the crap out of your party. After every round you'll probably want to pause, make sure your spellcasters (or damage dealers) are going to actually do something that round of attacks, and then unpause. I can't tell you how many times I've had to pause to make sure my Archer is attacking something, since he kills damn near everything in two to three hits and there's no way I'm letting him switch to his AI, which wants him to attack enemies with his DAMN FISTS. STUPID AI!*Ahem* Anyway, yeah, you'll want to make sure your spellcasters do something after each spell, that your high-accuracy high-damaging characters switch targets, and that you probably won't want to use most of the AI (as is always the case in RPGs in my experience).

												A classic game that made D&D the coolest thing since sliced bread. It reminded me of why when old D&D mages chose anything other than sleep their party killed them and told them ""This time don't pick anything other than sleep. Dumbass."" If anything is to be said of gameplay it is this, quicksave often this game cuts your heros down like a sexual predator does children sudden and when it is least expected. But it is the repeated gesture of trying new and interesting combinations of skills and abilities that eventually lead you to triumph over some obstacles, the rest is usually luck.

I'd never played it before, so we both got the game and now we play it together with the online multiplayer feature. It's a lot of fun and a great way to connect with each other, and I'm really enjoying having the adventure! It's a great old iso RPG that brings both of us back to our childhoods. Plus it's cool to see the 2nd Edition DnD rules incorporated into a computer game!			"

Graphs are out of date but hey what do you expect from a game originally released in 1998 :-)Ive read bad reviews of the BG-Enhanced version but so far I havent encountered any bugs or shortcomings. The adding of new characters are nice but not needed. A very good game but the price is imho way too high for a remake of such an old game. Same goes for the follow up and Icewind Dale series			"

												With this game, you get out of it what you put in. Simply put, it's very time consuming and difficult. However the reward for exerting the effort to complete the game greatly outweighs the amount of hours you dump into it.This is one of the greatest games that I have ever played, and not because of the graphics, voice-overs, or emaculate cut-scenes... because BG doesn't deliver in those departments. The game was made in 1998, so take that into perspective. The game was way ahead of it's time, and to go back and play it in 2014 really reminds us of how ""advanced"" of a game it really was.			"

												Is this a good game: absolutely. It's a genre defining (and spawning) isometric RPG with D&D style mechanics allowing for excellent gameplay. It lacks the tempo of some modern RPGs but makes up for it in character. Thought and skill are often much more important than just brute force...Having said that it is also a huge example of Achievemtns done BADLY... and they're seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.1- there are just way too many. With well over 100 achievments you can't focus on getting just 1, you just have to play through and see what popped.2- they don't work... You play through, you do exacle what you need to do and nothing happens. You reload and repeat 10 times and sometimes that works... sometimes it doesn't.3- Some are incredibly specific. Such as have 100 lore or become a grand master. With the low level cap of BGEE these are just stupid: did you choose the kensai over the fighter? Tough luck, you max out at lv8. 1 lv too low for grand master, suck it...4- I'm used to games having achievements just to lure you into getting teh DLC, but this is OTT blatant. By the time I've done all the achievements that I can (discounting those I should have but don't work), I'll max out at about 45%. Just ridiculous.			"

												Baldur's Gate is a classic turn based RPG that looks and plays very nicely in the enhanced version.   I played the original to completion and liked  it a lot; I went through it again with the enhanced version and it actually felt fresh and was fun to play again after so many years.  It helps of course that the there is considerable replay value because of the character creation and playstyle opportunities, including many choices as to companions.If you haven't played it I would suggest it is a lot like Dragon Age Origins (obviously DA  was  heavily influenced by the earlier game).  Of course the graphics aren't going to be quite as good but they are certainly not bad in this version.			"

												An easier version for anyone who has tried the game but found the rule book and mechanics too much for their britches. Game creators added the 'normal' difficulty which has automatic maximum hitpoints on level, 100% chance to learn new spells, weaker monsters, and generally a lot of foodstamps for unresourceful. Story is still the best for RPG's.			"

												Baldur's Gate: Enhanced EditionEverything the original was and more, if you are one of these games who has fond memories of this title but cannot get back into it due to the terrible feel of the interface in the original, this manages to fix a whole lot of that with nothing more than some resoution tweaks, Makes the game infinitely playable again.

												This game have brought back alot of memories from my childhood playing old D&D rule base game. I have played the original and EE version of this game.   This game is a very good game once you get  far enough in it and have a decent level charater/party.  MY only problem i had is with the EE version is that they took some stuff out of the original game thaat was not in the EE version. My other issue is i had with the game is that i could not put disk 1 to 5 in to my pc when the screen show up. This is one of the best RPG ever made. my rating 9/10 it would be 10/10 if they added the physical disks in			"

												Alright. This review is from someone who never played the original Baldur's Gates. For me, this game was really hard to get into. I kept starting it, spending an hour trying to get the highest roll on my character, and then when I got to the game, the graphics just completely turned me off. I felt like maybe I was just too late and my palate had been tainted by newer games. So about a week ago I decided to force myself to spend a couple hours to give the game a fair shot. I am very pleased with myself that I made that decision.The characters, atmosphere, dialogue trees, and challenging fights really make this game quite enjoyable. Character customization feels limited compared to newer titles like Neverwinter Nights 2 and Dragon Age Origins, but you can see very clearly how this game is the early ancestor of those titles. Despite the limitations of being an older title, Baldur's Gate feels incredibly deep. It's also a lot darker in some ways than most newer rpgs are.I suppose if I'm being objective, I can name a couple criticisms. It seems like your party members sometimes have a hard time going to a spot that you tell them to, especially if you have your whole party selected. For example, one of the party members will randomly decide to take the long way ALL the way around a mountain instead of just going a much shorter distance to his destination. So it kind of forces you to be on your toes and really micromanage your party's individual movements, and not in the ""good"" ""hardcore rpg micromanagement"" kind of way. Actually, that's the only criticism I can think of. I like this game so much I decided to make my avatar Xzar. ""Montaron! I... I never loved you!""Easy 8/10 if taking its age into consideration. Newer or more casual gamers may not be able to get into this game very easily, but you should really give it your best effort!Edit: Seems like a lot of people are complaining about crazy bugs and other problems. Just for the record, I never had a single problem. But just keep those in mind.			"

												I was fairly 'meh' about the Enhanced Editions but the 2.0 patch has completely sold me on them. BG has never looked better and the quality of life improvements actually make it enjoyable to play without the whole host of mods I usually install. Beamdog's original content (characters, classes, etc.) is still mediocre IMO but easy enough to ignore. Unless there's a mod that you absolutely have to have the Enhanced Edition is a must have for BG / CRPG fans.			"

												This review contains general points about the baldur's gate series, summaries of both the main game and the expansion which I completed just recently, as well as my own personal experiences with both games.General Points about the Baldur's Gate seriesAnyone who loves hardcore rpg strategy-based games, with a more advanced D&D (Dungeons & Dragons) ruleset, will no doubt enjoy this epic game and its respective counter-parts. The Baldur's Gate franchise hinges on the story being based on the specific era where Nobles, peasants, commoners, elves, drow, orcs, ogres and all other manner of creatures of varying strengths and abilities existed. Brilliant story and brilliant gameplay indeed.Know that you not only have the option to complete this game solo, but you also have the option of completing it with friends and/or other party members which you can also choose to have come on your journey with you. If you're feeling super hardcore and are also brave enough to meet any challenge with your super over-levelled protagonist character/created party members, you can also try to complete this game on its hardest and newest difficulty ""Legacy of Bhaal"", but know that you will not be able to change your preferred difficulty if you chose LoB difficulty at the start of your session.Summary of the beginning of Baldur's GateYou start off in a place known as Candlekeep (your hometown) raised by your foster father Gorian and at some point he becomes increasingly concerned that you're in danger, so he urges you to leave candlekeep with him in the hopes that you'll be safer and shortly after leaving Candlekeep, Gorian and you are ambushed by a gang of thugs and Gorian fends them off himself so you can escape, sacrificing himself in the process. A girl named Imoen offers to join you as your primary objective is to set out to find who the the leader of those gang of thugs really was that killed Gorian. From then on, the story can unfold in quite a few ways depending on what you decide to do next after that.Summary of the beginning of the Siege of Dragonspear ExpansionAfter successfully beating the final boss of the main game (which henceforth declares you, the ""Hero of Baldur's Gate""), you start off in an underground tomb underneath the Baldur's Gate city, accompanied by Imoen (who, if you recall from the main game, offers to join your party after you left Candlekeep), any other party member who was with you in the main game if at all, and the Flaming Fist (who are essentially, the military army you encountered inside the Baldur's Gate city from the main game when you first entered it), with your first primary objective, being to locate and bring to justice in any manner of your choosing (i.e. kill outright or leave alive long enough to have em taken into Flaming Fist custody) a certain avid follower of the Final Boss whom you defeated in the main game. Once that's over with, your party members leave you to go on with their lives, while you and Imoen then end up within the Royal Ducal Palace bedroom of Baldur's Gate, for some rest and respite, until out of nowhere, some unknown assasins infiltrate the bedroom where you and Imoen are. intent on killing you. However, Imoen is the one that takes a critical hit from said assasins, to the effect that a poison attack leaves her near death. Unconfirmed rumours then start flying around that it was the charismatic warrior, Caelar Argent, and her ""Holy Crusade"" who may have been behind this. Accordingly, your new primary objectives for the rest of the game are two-fold: Firstly, to find out who specifically sent those assasins after you, and; Secondly, to also kill the respective perpetrator of those assasins, by any means necessary.My own personal experiences playing both Baldur's Gate and the expansion, Siege of DragonspearI personally enjoy the thrill of being able to enter into battle wondering if I have enough weapons and armour attributes to survive the encounter. Having certain characters (or possibly other friends involved) as party members are also a great help.When I do end up surviving said battle, my created character gains varying amounts of experience and sometimes upgrades, but when I don't, I either attempt to find other avenues of defeating that which had defeated me the first time or if I've exhausted all options, then I attempt to avoid having to fight it if I can.Another thing I enjoy about this game series also, are the varying ""relationship"" dialogues that can happen between a created character and a certain opposite gender party member. The relationship between your protagonist and the opposite gender party member will either keep going or break up with you (even to the extent of leaving the party if bad enough) depending on how you respond to their dialogue with you. Only thing that has frustrated me about this game series off-hand however, is that whenever a party member wants to go on a specific quest and you chose to let him/her into the party, but after a while when he/she realizes that your party is either ""too good/bad"" for him/her, he/she abruptly leaves the party and never returns, thus that quest that you originally accepted regarding that party member that abruptly left, remains permenantly unfinished for the rest of the game. Addtionally, something that has really started to bother me about Siege of Dragonspear inparticular, is that while the gameplay itself is brilliant, the story itself lacks certain aspects which would have otherwise completed it fully. The most obvious example of this which immediately comes to mind, is that none of the relevant NPCs in this expansion explain nor even admit at all, to who actually sent the assasins to the palace to kill you near the start.  Other than all that, overall this is quite a great game and a great introduction into the epic Baldur's Gate franchise. You can also expect a similar kind of experience described above, in both BG2 Enhanced Edition: Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal (Expansion) and the newly developed BG Expansion: Siege of Dragonspear DLC.

												Baldur's Gate was my first real computer game, and it changed my life. I've never known story telling as good as this in a game, and I've never fallen in love with mechanics as much as in this game.Now, with the enhanced edition, I feel there are enough changes to keep it fresh and relevent. It's definitely been dated as time has passed. The D&D rules are old and require a bit of a learning curve. Still, it's a great homage to one of the titles in Gaming canon.If you haven't played this when it was originally released, you might not enjoy it, but I think it's still worth a go. It was a groundbreaking title, that influenced all RPGs that followed.			"

												If I had to choose one game as the pinnacle of CRPGs and dungeon crawlers, this would be it. Deep character customization, deeper story. It is very hard to not find something to do in this game. Don't want  to do the story just yet? That's cool, there's plenty of other quests to be done. Want to explore for awesome loot and dungeons? There's plenty of that too. The NPCs are excellent as well, as they want to do what they want, even if that means ditching you in moments where you need it most. This sounds tedious, but if a member leaves, chances are they were not suited for your party any ways.Great graphics (for its time), great animations, humorous, story-rich, plenty to do, lots to explore, and just all around fun. 10/10			"

												What can I say about Baldur's Gate that hasn't already been said? Even though I'm mostly a hardcore adventure game player, this game beats most others hands down. The storyline becomes increasingly interesting as it progresses, and as the territory opens up more and more. Combat is won by intelligent strategy, and the game can be played a multitude of ways. It follows the old classic Dungeons and Dragons rules, where low armour class, for example AC0 or AC -2 is better than Armour Class 6. Somehow this adds to the authenticity of it all. The inventory screen is great: very satisfying, with great sound effects, and clearly one of the models for the World of Warcraft inventory screen. Personally I preferred the inventory screen on the original classic release, but it's not much of a gripe really.Where this beats WoW hands down is in story. ""Quests"" all fit together in a coherent whole, so that they are not mere fetch quests or kill-20-mana-monster affairs, but are intriguing sub-plots, which help you piece together the story. And if you don't do a quest fast enough - for example saving a loved one - one of your party members can get upset and attack you. Yes, your party members can attack each other, and this can be a nightmare when facing opponents who can Charm you, etc.The number of curios in this game, from hamsters to pantaloons, is brilliant, all of which make it seem like a detailed world you progress in. You can steal or kill good characters if you wish, but this has ramifications. You also have to keep party members happy if they are of different alignments, and they occasionally have conversations with each other, which come out in the audio voice acting - which is terrific. The soundtrack is truly incredible. Michael Hoenig did an awesome job.This really is a fantasy roleplay game, as opposed to a slash'n'bash affair. Fans will probably dive straight to the plough fields to see if the ankheg armour is there. It seems impossible that this game is so old now - released in 1998 - but was and still is light years ahead of its time in terms of sheer playability. The modding community was also very active after its sequel Baldur's Gate II and Icewind Dale, creating mods such as The Darkest Day, and all sorts of weird and wonderful exploits, all of which could make the game even more interesting, given a sensible level of tweaking. Someone even produced a huge all-encompassing Big World package a few years back which brought as many mods together into one package.You can multi-class and be a mage/druid and fighter as your main character - you can have six in total at any one time, but you can always sack someone and re-hire later. You can die! Quite easily if you are not sensible, so progress saving is a must. You can walk around like a travelling halberd salesman with a bag full of weapons, or travel light, as you wish. The level of detail in this game indicates that the creators were big fans of D&D, and did I mention that it all ties in to Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms campaigns, popularised by R.A. Salvatore's books? No, I didn't did I. Also big props to Beamdog for simply providing me with a Steam key after I gave them my purchased serial. A company doing things right. Bioware is now a household name, but even after the publishing of Baldur's Gate they were not so well-known - but Bioware were not the publishers - they were the developers. One of the designers, James Ohlen, was also a lead designer for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which also has a truly great story. Another, Ray Muzyka, was bizarrely a practising physician, along with his co-founder Greg Zeschuk. Proving once and for all, that D&D is for everyone.			"

												The legend is back - in HD!+++ My favorite feature in the game is the HD + free zoom combo. This makes the game playable on modern displays without any hassle. AFAIK, even though there are mods that add widescreen support to the original, zoom is a feature unique to the Enhanced Edition.++ The other great feature in EE is the inclusion of all of the Baldur's Gate II class kits to the original BG. (It should be mentioned that here have been mods that do that for years.) Those kits are extremely unbalanced and extremely fun (though many blossom only in BG2).+ There are a few new NPCs to spice things up. They are all right.+ There is some arena-like feature called ""the Black Pit"" that I didn't bother to try.+ BG1 was and remains a great game.- The original BG was the first Inifinity Engine game, and Bioware had still not achieved their full potential. One can see this clearly while playing. A lot of the areas you explore are a half-empty; a lot of the quests are pedestrian; the pacing of the main plot is erratic; the story is bland; the dialogues are silly; the NPCs are not fully fleshed out; the items are weak; and so on. In short, everything that made BG2 so great is imperfectly implemented in BG1.Great classic, solid remake, 9/10 recommended.			"

												Is this a good game: absolutely. It's a genre defining (and spawning) isometric RPG with D&D style mechanics allowing for excellent gameplay. It lacks the tempo of some modern RPGs but makes up for it in character. Thought and skill are often much more important than just brute force...Having said that it is also a huge example of Achievemtns done BADLY... and they're seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.1- there are just way too many. With well over 100 achievments you can't focus on getting just 1, you just have to play through and see what popped.2- they don't work... You play through, you do exacle what you need to do and nothing happens. You reload and repeat 10 times and sometimes that works... sometimes it doesn't.3- Some are incredibly specific. Such as have 100 lore or become a grand master. With the low level cap of BGEE these are just stupid: did you choose the kensai over the fighter? Tough luck, you max out at lv8. 1 lv too low for grand master, suck it...4- I'm used to games having achievements just to lure you into getting teh DLC, but this is OTT blatant. By the time I've done all the achievements that I can (discounting those I should have but don't work), I'll max out at about 45%. Just ridiculous.			"

But it is one of those games that takes time to master, and worth the time.  Follow the main story, or go off the beaten path.  Be whoever you want to be, but with real consequences for your choices.  Choose your party wisely, and pay attention to their needs.  This is no simple game, and that is a good thing.			"

												Baldur's Gate is a classic turn based RPG that looks and plays very nicely in the enhanced version.   I played the original to completion and liked  it a lot; I went through it again with the enhanced version and it actually felt fresh and was fun to play again after so many years.  It helps of course that the there is considerable replay value because of the character creation and playstyle opportunities, including many choices as to companions.If you haven't played it I would suggest it is a lot like Dragon Age Origins (obviously DA  was  heavily influenced by the earlier game).  Of course the graphics aren't going to be quite as good but they are certainly not bad in this version.			"

												This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed classic. While some of the older DnD mechanics can take some time to come to grips with, I can recall no other game where I feel such a sense of achievement from powering up from the ""OH GODS, I DIE IN LIKE TWO HITS"" state most characters start the game as to a nearly unstoppable juggernaught that stands tall against the worst this brutal RPG can throw at you. Not the most user friendly, but anyone looking for a moderate challenge (and lots of character class choices) should check this out.			"

												This is a remake of a game released in 1998. It doesn't change much from the original, mainly adding widescreen and HD options, updating the combat system to the sequel's improved version, and bugfixes and some minor content.Is it worth the money? If you already own the original, I wouldn't say so, because it can easily be modded to about the same level as this. However, if you don't own the original, or just want to download it and play it, without fuss or modding on your new machine, I'd say go for it! However, be prepared for what it is: an old CRPG, with everything that means. Clunky UI, difficult combat, lots of talking, and a rather poor explanation of concepts and such. It's a beast, but you'll be rewarded if you manage to tame it.As for the new content, it's decent enough, adding three new characters, which are all more fleshed out than the original ones, with a lot more dialogue and such. It also has new portraits and a new area called the Black Pits, which is basically an arena where your party squares off against waves of monsters trying to survive. In all, okay but not worth to buy it just for that.Buy it, or don't, I'm sure you'll be happy either way. Live long and prosper, you sexy beast.			"

I love the new zoom feature and most of the little tweaks to the interface. Dialogues are very well written and engaging. I didn't read them so much when I played the old version many years ago, but the writing is very, very good. It's a difficult game, very easy to get slaughtered at the beginning and this takes a player by surprise, especially one who is used to leveled enemies. One could assume they are easy because the heroes are LvL 1, however beware! Not to mention the weapons break at the start of the game. So far, I am enthralled again.			"

												A classic game that made D&D the coolest thing since sliced bread. It reminded me of why when old D&D mages chose anything other than sleep their party killed them and told them ""This time don't pick anything other than sleep. Dumbass."" If anything is to be said of gameplay it is this, quicksave often this game cuts your heros down like a sexual predator does children sudden and when it is least expected. But it is the repeated gesture of trying new and interesting combinations of skills and abilities that eventually lead you to triumph over some obstacles, the rest is usually luck. By in large one of the most rewarding experiences i've had in a long, long time.			"

												I bought this game on its initial release back in the 90s and quickly realised that my PC was not powerful to handle it. These days I mostly play this game on my Ipad (hence my low number of hours played on Steam). How technology changes...I'm currently replaying the game after not having played it for about 15 years. I thought its age would grate on me, but I find it just as enjoyable as I used to. For those who haven't played similar games and are unfamiliar with 2nd edition D&D the game will probably not seem very intuitive or user friendly. If you're up to the challenge to try something different though, and want to see a well crafted game and a great story, it's well worth it though.			"

												I had this when it first came out back in college. Had a fun Saturday when four of us set up a LAN in my apartment and played this for the day. Didn't get very far with it after that and then that computer broke and I lost my saves. After college I installed it again and got further with the game but then my computer broke and again lost my saves. As it turned out I had only scratched the surface of the game content. When I got around to getting a new computer the game was too old to run.So I was really excited for a chance to try again on my Linux Ubuntu 14.04 Rig. Part way through my playing it, they created the enhanced edition. For the most part the enhanced edition is better. Some of the charm was removed like the way the journal worked, but for the most part it has been improved. The graphics are better but not really changed. It supports modern resolutions and widescreen TVs. I had a blast playing it for the most part and was able to finally finish the game. I thought the game has aged very well. The story is good and the combat allows for all kinds of things you might try playing real D&D. It is a long game and there are many side quests I did not end up doing. The rules are second edition AD&D. I grew up playing that, so this was super fun and nostalgic. It is very nice to have a computer keep track of all the complexities of the game. Some quests are still a bit bugged but I did not encounter anything game breaking.If you grew up playing 2nd ed. AD&D or want to learn what it was all about then this is the game. It's all here. Multiclasses and class changes. Full theiving abilities. Big lists of spells. Subclasses. Scrolls, potions, magic items. The amount of content in this game is crazy. Also if you are a fan or CRPGs this would be a good match for you. Keep in mind the graphics are old school, but they still look decent. Highly recommended.			"

												I played this game and its sequel allot even before the Enhanced Edition was released.Great story, fun and interesting characters (Go for the eyes boo!) game play is good but I guess its a bit complicated to understand the systems behind it if you never touched a table top rpg back in the day.I would recommend this game even if it wasn't enhanced. The second game is more varied and superior but this one is definately where you want to start and take it all the way to the end. Butt kicking for goodness!			"

												Really was looking forward to playing this after having played Baldur's Gate 2 a number of years ago ... but the co-op experience has been very frustrating, to say the least.  One bug after another has prevented us from really enjoying the game.Perhaps after a few more rounds of bug patching I'll be able to post a positive review.  So far this feels like an Alpha or at  best Beta game.			"

												BG remains a fantastic game to this day, though coming back to it? I was quite frankly irritated with the limitations of the inventory system and reminded very quickly as to why I make sure I pick up Neera (for her Gem Bag) and the Scroll Case that was added in the EE. Anyways, other than that? I want to say ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to whoever decided to keep the level cap for the base game. seriously, ♥♥♥♥ you. My anger about that has nothing to do with game balance and everything to do with the fact that the game is based on a system that lets you go much higher in power and an artificial limiter is left in for ""game balance."" What the ♥♥♥♥. Use the ♥♥♥♥ing rules or don't upgrade the game. Especially when you are literally going to waste my time setting up for the second game in the series.As far as the DLC ""Siege of Dragonspear"" is concerned, I really don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the social pandering of having so many women involved being ""Special."" But I'm am quite irritated that although you figure out Blondies role in the whole matter, to the point that you catch him with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar, you can't change anything with that knowledge. Otherwise, come up with something for BG2, that includes the stuff you opened up with SoD for consistency if you already haven't. Lastly, the DLC was too railroady. Other than that I liked it, especially the use of hiding things behind animations that only people with Infravision can pierce or have to be told about to find. "

												Enhanced with new bugs and broken features! It's disappointing to see a classic game manhandled by a team who clearly don't know what they're doing. It's better to just play the original with only the mods you want. This version has come a long way, but it's taken far too long and still has many outstanding issues, and is missing key features that I would have expected from an ""enhanced edition"" such as steam cloud support and achievements.

												When I was younger and had little to no patience this game was awesome.  I would make character, after character, after character, starting and trying out new classes and races.  Now that I am older and wanted to stick with one I am very unhappy with what I have discovered.  The game caps your level very low.  My Monk that I have been working on is going to be practically usless seeing as the main bonus's for monks revolve around them getting to high levels.  I really wish something would be done but I know that my complaint will go unheard.  I payed for a game that halts progress.  Not happy.			"

												Baldur's Gate: Cashgrab Edition (aka Copypaste Edition) is the 'improvement' of the original DnD classic. Including both the base game and the TotSC expansion pack, it also added some new super cool NPC-s and over 812963529 fixes blah blah blah... Do yourself a favor, fellow RPG fan, and disregard Beamdog's self praises. This game offers NOTHING over the original game. 3 new companions - 2 completely unneeded and one hilaiously overpowered but just as unneeded, who the fk needs a monk in a lowlevel adventure, same for a wildmage when you have a specialist mage anyway - all with their own questlines which are so excit.... sorry fell asleep from the excitement. As for the 400 improvements/fixes/whatevers, I couldn't point out one, with the exception of adding higher resolution to the game (which you could achieve with a mod in 30 secs anyway). Characters still bump into each other the turn back.Characters still get stuck in each other/chairs/any imaginable obstacle that could be circumvented in 0.5 seconds.Characters still pause momentarity EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TIME you issue a new order.Characters still get lost and confused carrying out complex orders like: go down a hallway, go around a corner, go down the cliff and not just stand in the cliffside, etc. Pathfinding's as awful as ever.Characters still rather just rush into battle with fists instead of switching to another batch of projectiles in their quiver...Dice rolls are still hilaiously rigged (don't get me wrong, the game's fun and all but having my characters roll 2-1-1-3-6-2 without end while enemies roll 20-16-20-17-19 literally all game can be annoying, not to mention HP rolls).And add to this list any other minor/major inconvenience the original had... Enhanced right? Nope. But at least there's a potion bag now, and some (totally irrelevant) BG2 spells.IN SHORT: if you're an RPG enhusiast, but never played Baldur's Gate before, go for it. If you have hundreds of hours in other editions of BG like myself (originals on disks, GoG edition whatever) just pass, unless you want to play BG2 with a friend. Because let's be honest here: why would anyone play BG1 for itself... It's just the ability point grab/xp farm for BG2, a game wastly superior in every aspect. And hopefully a game that has actually been enhanced, not like this.You disappoint me Beamdong. "

												Siege of Dragonspear was the first producted I ever requested a refund for on Steam, luckily my request was successful.It crashes every five minutes, I am not joking. Half the time I fast travelled or entered a building it would crash.I only played about 30 minutes of it before I gave up on it and uninstalled the expanion. Luckily my saved game was salvagable. My initial impressions were:* The UI in SoD is very dark and quite unpleasant. * The game felt very linear.* It did not feel like Baldurs Gate, it felt like a poorly made clone. * The story wasn't drawing me in at all. It felt corny and 'simple'. * The voice acting was very average. * The misc. quests were less than two minutes long.Not recommended.			"

												This thumbsdown is not related to the whole SJW expansion controversy. I genuinely believe this game is not worth purchasing on its own.If you enjoy ADND combat rules, you might like Baldur's Gate. There is a lot of that stuff. However, if you are a fan of intriguing story, compelling characters, having a general idea of your goal and purpose, or understanding what's going on, I don't think this game is the game for you.Almost nothing happens. The majority of the content seems to be running errands for people. Very few characters, with even less character interaction. Combat is unnecessarily complicated (ADND combat rules are obscure and annoying). First fight in the game was just me and a dude missing 10 times in a row before I finally landed a hit for like 3 damage and instakilled him. Generally very hard to tell what's going on in combat. Movement is unbelievably slow -- first dungeon I spent more time walking than doing anything. My mind was blank, just clicking to move forward until something happened.Do not recommend.			"

												This is a review for people who may not know much about Baldur's Gate or Dungeons and Dragons in general.Baldur's Gate is a role-playing game with a well written story and uses simulated dice rolls to determine the success (or failure) of your actions in the game. The story takes place in a high fantasy setting. It begins with your character growing up in a cloistered town called Candlekeep. You were adopted many years ago by a man named Gorian, who has been kind to you. You know nothing of your heritage or history. One day, you're told by Gorian that you must prepare to leave Candlekeep, the only place you've known all your life, with great haste. There were no explainations given for such a dramatic change of pace in your life, but you do know that Gorian received a letter before he broke the news to you. So, you set foot outside Candlekeep with Gorian... and your adventure begins.You don't need to understand a whole lot of the mechanics to enjoy the game, but be prepared to at least learn about your chance to hit a target and their chance to hit you. I'm putting this in the simplist terms possible because the lexicon of game mechanics doesn't read too well in a cursory review. It is less scary and more simple than it first seems. The game is based on the second edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rule set, which is antequated by what would be several future editions of the Dungeons and Dragons rule set, but it isn't without its merits. If I had to pick one thing I liked best about this game its the story. I wouldn't say it is the greatest story I've played in a game (that honor would go to Xenogears), but it is enchanting in that I want to spend a lot of time trying to learn what happens next and just stomping the villians feels good.One thing I like least about the game is that it can be difficult to know if you're properly prepared for advancing the story when you're at lower experience levels. It seems like you have to save after every battle. Death is extremely prohibitive in this Baldur's Gate, so if one of your party members dies it will cost you sizable funds, especially early in the game, to resurrect them. Resting often is a necessity with mages in the party, as spells are finite and only reusable after memorization and rest. Usually, it is a good tactic to only use spells when confronted with large groups or very strong enemies.If you liked Pillars of Eternity or any of the newer isometric RPGs that have come out in the last year or so, I'd say you should give this one a shot. This game was amazing for its time and it holds up fairly well. Expect to see a few things that have been done better in more recent titles, but it's nothing you can fault the game for being that it's almost 20 years old and lacks clairvoyance.			"

												A lot of the reviews for this game are biased due to nostalgia and or, ars3 kissing of beamdog. But a good many are just blatant lies or fake reviews. The game is very buggy, more so than the original. Achievements are bugged. Many of the so called enhancements are common mods anyone can install their self in the original. Some content was actually removed and or the game is so bugged can't be accessed as one could from the original. 20 USD for this game if you don't have the original version, yes if you are desperate and want easy online play with others... and only if you can't get the key from a site like ebay for 5 quid or the original game for that matter. If you have the original, no. Don't. This should be called the UNENHANCED version. I never played a game with so many crashes and bugs in my entire life, as this. Even the U.I is bugged. Will they update it? No. Do they care? No. Beamdog cared more to claim something is of their content/creation and that of reputation than to actually enhance the game, fix the bugs they created, and so on. I love Baldur's gate, but what Beamdog did to this game, is semi blasphemy. My review might be negative, but I do say if you don't have the original... Purchase the key on ebay for 5 quid or a copy of the original. If you can't do that.... Then go for this. But expect crashes. Expect bugs. Expect the worst. It is a degrade. Mods for the original actually enhance the game more so than anything Beamdog did. I beat the game multiple times and over 80% of the achievements are bugged for me. Dynaheir crashes the game when resting in certain areas, for UNKNOWN reasons. Killing her in your party, followed by resting, will allow you to bypass that bug. Took me about 30 plus minutes of trial and error to just find the cause of the crash when resting. But she isn't the only game crashing bug. Bags of holding crash the game, wands crash the game, monster summoning crashes the game, playing the game also crashes the game...  If it were not for the HUGE amount of bugs, I would have recommended it. Also, NONE of these bugs are in BG2:EE and they seemed to be fixed in the DLC.. yet not in the main game. You might as well just get BG2:EE, and ignore this one if you don't want a ♥♥♥♥e load of bugs. Achievements in BG2:EE are also bugged but at the least it don't keep crashing for any insignificant action/reason. FYI: The expansion for BG1:EE is too out of place and really has nothing to do with the series. Think of it like it's own game. If you want to consider it a true expansion.I edited this review due to my rant with the DLC and not actually FULLY playing the entirety of it's dlc. So, I removed my statements about the DLC. When I complete the DLC 100%, then will edit this again. Wouldn't be fair.Side note: Don't ever believe in a review from an account with less than 10 games or little to no play time involved. They are fake. Games like this have lots of fake reviews, just to try and make it positive for rating. Beamdog has asked/bribed/told many to write fake reviews for this game. So, you can't trust the reviews for any Beamdog product.			"

												I can't even begin to say how many hours I've spent playing this game and its sequel over the past decade or more, both the original and enhanced edition. Thousands of hours, easily. I've bought both games probably five times each (original version on CDs, enhanced edition downloads for PC, mobile, and Steam, some of them twice). The amount of time and money I've poured into this franchise is testament to how much I love it.Even after so many playthroughs and so many years, I still can't get enough. It's like virtual heroin to me.Do I like everything in the new edition? No, but I didn't like everything in the original either, or in any other game, and I'm just glad that others still care enough about these old games to keep putting work and talent into them. I can always quibble and complain about something, but the bottom line is that the new edition still has everything I loved (and hated) ten years ago, plus new stuff, some of which I love and some of which I like ... not so much.If I were to complain, I really wish they could have changed all those arbitrary restrictions of the original. They always drove me crazy. Let me play an elven bard already, goddammit! Changing things like that would be my first order of business if I was in charge.My biggest issue with the new Siege of Dragonspear campaign is the implication that the dreams you have are the work of Irenicus. In the original Shadows of Amn campaign it always seemed plain to me that the Irenicus you saw in the dreams was just a spectre of your own subconscious/the blood of a dead god in your veins trying to influence your path and shape you in Bhaal's murderous image. Irenicus had nothing to do with it, he was just a convenient and present enemy for your mind to taunt you with. This gave the dreams a certain dark atmosphere that's totally lacking if it's just Irenicus whispering in your ear while you sleep, so to speak.The new romances in SoD could also use some work. I don't mind that they're short and won't continue in the sequel, that can be just as interesting, but I was a bit surprised to find myself getting more and more romantic with Corwin, because that was not really my intention (my bard was still mourning his fluffy wolf-love from the werewolf isle, whose dried belladonna flower he still kept with him through everything. It wouldn't be until he met Aerie that he was ready to let go of the past and move on.) Seemingly no way to get out of that one, so I just rolled with it in the interest of not starting over without at least seeing the end first. Then I was even more surprised when Glint started complaining loudly that I wasn't being faithful to him. I honestly was just being nice to him, but at some point he must have taken my politeness as flirting, and I had no idea. None. So I ripped out his heart and stomped on it, because that was the least rude option the game offered me.That was not ideal, to say the least, but at least now I know to be careful with those two in the future.But whatever flaws it has - and the original had plenty of its own - it's still easily one of the greatest games ever, and we don't get nearly enough of its kind. It may not be for everyone, it certainly is still showing some age, but to me it's absolutely a classic and I'm far from done with it yet. I think I will be playing this for many more years to come, and would gladly recommend it to anyone willing to give it a shot.			"

												Essentially this game boils down to trying to micromanage a highly talented pack of Zerglings. I hate the pause action and general interface so much that I couldn't give two craps less about the fundamentals. If this were a turn based game I would eat it up. However its basically an RTS with a pause button. I do not find this type of game immersive, relaxing or fun. If you dont like what you see in the pictures or the combat system, don't spend the $20. Unless of course 20 dollars means nothing to you.On the other hand, if you wan't to play starcraft meets diablo with a pause button, go for it. Im sure players who are geared towards more action based games will rather enjoy this, if they are also fans of RPGs.This just isnt my type of RPG. The majority high opinions of this game are mostly nostalgia.			"

												I love this game. The original was great, and the enhanced edition made it worth playing once again.Amazing how years after it originally was released I still remembered so much of the quests, the characters and the plots. To me that is proof of how good it was, that it stuck with me for all these years and to date I have never found another game of this genre that has come close to the quality of this game (and BG2)			"

												It holds up well. I didn't really play that far into the original release (and therefore can't comment on what specific changes have been made) because I was a dumb kid, but as a dumb adult, I really like the writing, music, and atmosphere. If you want those things but slightly better and with good combat, maybe buy Pillars of Eternity. That said, they're both good and this one is much cheaper. If you're a fan of KOTOR, Dragon Age, or Bethesda's RPG's, it's worth looking into the game largely credited with kicking off big, open, Western RPG's as mainstream releases.			"

												Baldurs Gate: Enhanced EditionBaldurs Gate has always been a favorite game of mine. While I haven't played it a ton of hours this time around, I'll never forget the first time I did play it, and the 100+ hours I played. Baldurs Gate is an Infinity Engine game, and a lore-heavy one at that. You create a character, and then you're put into the Sword Coast world, you come across different people as you play who will either like you and join your cause, dislike you and attack/leave, or will ask you to join THEIR cause. The characters are voice acted, and their personalities are memorable. If you're familiar with D&D, you'll enjoy playing this game a lot. -Lots of reading-Lore Heavy-Memorable Characters-Lots of gameplay-HIGH replay value (different class, and companions, and side missions)-Difficult (but rewarding!)-Great game for thinkers, and strategist "

												It gets a recommendation...barely, even the 2.0 patch won't change that.  I won't spend too much time looking at the original game.  It was a wonderful game which deserves your time.  Instead I'll spend time looking at what was changed and if it is worth your time and money.  However they did little to expand beyond the original game and what they accomplished could be done, and has been done in some cases, with mods.For the good, it's Baldur's Gate as it was when it was created with some engine upgrades and a little expanded content.  Baldur's Gate needs no more recommendation than its name, if you enjoyed Black Isle, Obsidian, and Bioware's entries, you'll enjoy this one.The first you see at the title screen is the addition of a second campaign - The Black Pits.  There is no story or questing - this is a encounter mode where you kit out a party and fight a series of encounters with monsters and parties until you, or they come out on top.  This mode has real value for multiplayer games.  Grab your friends, grab some gear, then run in with your characters and beat up all the bad guys.The second you see is the addition of the Bauldur's Gate II class kits and classes to the game.  These don't push too hard on the difficulty as your companions will only use the default classes (with the exception of the new companions).  If you play a multiplayer game with pregenerated characters, this could be a problem if you care about encounter balance.There are four new companions - Neera, Dorn, Rasheed, and the hidden one.  For all but the hidden one, they come with more questing, dialogue, and story which makes them very valued.  The only problem being Dorn and Neera's overpowered capabilities which make them almost push button choices for a min-maxed party.Edit: Just turned it back on and played for a while after the 2.0 patch.Hoo boy, this update is either a love it or hate it update.Some nice things are there, like the ability to have off-hand weapons and 2 handed weapons in inventory slots for easy weapon swapping without having to play with the inventory.  The journal was also updated and I will sit in disagreement with everyone and say it's better - the old journal was nasty.  There are five quicksave slots.  There is also a new class - shaman - which functions as a druid with spontaneous casting like a sorcerer with a few extra abilitites.  Equipment selection highlights characters which can use it and characters/loot stands out in pausing/maps/and in the overworld.  Incidentally I like the changes better over the old UI and feel this is what they should have aimed for when they made an enhanced edition - a real enhanced edition and not a 2015 pc port of an old game.  This is all, of course, based on preferences.That said, the new UI does have its share of problems, several problems.  First, the interface is too gimmicy, something simpler would have done better and made for a less jarring transition between the old game and new updates- the new map screen demonstrates this.  Once the expansion is installed, the UI changes to a black background, which I do not like.The worst of the changes are the bugs and crashes which come with it.  There are more bugs and crashes since the 2.0 overhaul, not enough to cause me to do any more than annoy me.  It does bother me that stability has gone down and the old 5 USD version of the game can manage it with fewer crashes if you have the right mods installed.One thing I will say in agreement with other reviewers is - the wrong time to introduce a major overhaul of UI and gameplay is not years after release, it is prior to and on release.  Pushing this much change on the game will create a jarring change where you open the game and it's not the game you remember.  This will chafe with your player base you will receive a lot of much deserved criticism from all sides for your decision.While the remaster does, at this point, do things differently enough to stand out as its own game, many of the changes were not that much beyond the original and feel experimental and sometimes unwelcome.  The UI is a case of love it or hate it.  It's biggest competition is Bauldur's Gate via the old version on GoG with mods to update it to work on current systems.  While I like this version enough to recommend it, that old version works well enough to be serious competition for this game and may serve your preferences better.			"

												I havent played the original version of Balders Gate so I couldn't say whether or not the Enhanced Edition makes the game significantly better than the original, or whether the recent update is a travesty which ruins an otherwise excellent game. The perspective I offer will be that of someone thats new to the series and hasnt played many isometric RPG's. To quickly summarise, BG is absolutely fantastic.Combat is challenging at times and will require you to consider different stratergies or party makeups (on normal) making success feel very rewarding. The graphics generally look fine and significantly better than what I've seen of the original (without mods) however when fully zoomed in the graphics do suffer. The storyline and diagloge is often extremely funny and very engaging, although you will be expected to do a fair amount of reading due to a limited amount of spoken lines, however I have found this only adds to the immersion. Party Banter is quite limited and would have benefited from being more prominent to which end I would recommend using the NPC project mod, which adds further interactions amongst other welcome changes.The games currently on sale for £6 which I would say is 100% worth it. At a full price of £15 there is a fair arguement that the Enhanced Edition doesnt add enough to the base game and you may be better of buying the original but I dont feel qualified to say either way. Whichever version of BG you get im confident you will thoroughly enjoy yourself.			"

												One of the top RPGs EVER.   Made by people passionate for RPGs.  The story is great, but it's the dialogue that sells it.  Between the very well written party characters, the humor, and the questing that makes you actually feel like you accomplished something by reading your journal and using your head, this game and it's ilk are the last bastions of when games were still well written.  You could go thru hundreds of lines of dialogue in the game space it would take to have a couple badly acted cutscenes form newer games.  As far as ""which do I play, BG 1 or 2?""  BOTH!  You HAVE to play BOTH!			"

												The first Baldur's gate is the best one. It is a nice worldly balance of good and evil, allowing for many different players of many different styles to play this game and be left satisfied with the end results. Having the ability to choose your path and your moral stance seems to do well in this game; since the world in itself tends to be as I said: balanced. The range of quests offer decent reward and the game's challenge is nice. The game plot wise is interesting and starts to develop and grow more as you play, which I must say is a great way for a game's plot to go. While I am not particularly a big fan of the E2's THAC0 system, if you set up your character and companions with the right skills and are resourceful in using them, this game won't be a constant ""miss, miss, miss, critical miss."" If people don't like THAC0 or DND's sometimes unpredictable conclusions (in terms of fighting, etc); then you might not like it. The lore is somewhat gritty, but it gives you some room to fix things with nice endings; thus not being a complete waste of time for Good/Neutral characters. The older game engine's pathfinding for your party as well as some other issues such as not being able to shift-click and see the ""waypoints"" for movement is actually a nuissance when a random member gets suck in your group while you are trying to move around an obstacle. Now correct me on this if I am wrong, but I was unable to find a way to maintain my party's formation, thus when I tell them to move it seems like they don't stick together, and whoever makes it first will likely be the first target from a enemy encounter. This can be very frusterating at times, especially when you want to assign who you want in the front of a column, etc and if they will walk ""together"" while holding the formation.The game is old, but I would have expected that maybe the Enhanced Edition would have implemented some improvements in these areas. The sound effects are as old as the game, but they are not bad to begin with. The only issues I have with audio is that some magical spells are particularly too loud; such as the spider web trap or the thorn spells; they make lots of noise at a higher volume than you are used to. The inventory management is still the way it was  from the first release in 1998, where you can't have other members pick up gear if your current member is full. I was expecting maybe in the Enhanced Edition that the items on the ground could be sorted through the party's inventory, rather than me having to keep clicking different people and then having them pick up the items.Overall rating: 6/10Breakdown of Positives:+ Good lore from an older game.+ Enhanced Edition gameplay and interaction tweaks.+ Additional characters introduced in the Enhanced Edition.+ Game's atmosphere is well-balanced to cater to the choices of any moral alignment.+ Starts at a nice pace and picks up mid-game.+ Runs very good both on Windows and Linux from my experience.Breakdown of Negatives:- THAC0 is a flawed to-hit formula, was hoping maybe a change to the newer 3.5 forumla.- Party pathfinding is around the same as the old games. Was hoping to see this improved.- Inventory system was not improved really. I was looking for a easy auto-sort function for picking up loot.- Some magical spells emit rather out of place sounds at higher volume, like thorns or spider-web.- Party formations are nearly useless, since parties will NOT retain the formation upon movement, but rather break up whenever they run into something (including other members). This can be frusterating and end up with a confrontation with a broken unit coherency. Conclusion: The game is fun and I definitely enjoyed the story and the openness of this classic, but some areas of the gameplay as mentioned make me question the significance of this ""enhanced"" edition..

												FYI, I bought this on Steam after buying it from Beamdog when it originally came out a few years ago, and I haven't played my Steam copy yet which is why my played hours are so low. Baldur's Gate is a game that I have been playing since 1998. It's an incredible game. This is a solid update, plays well, no more loading screens, and incorporates many quality of life improvements that you previously needed mods for. There are new classes and kits to use, and now there is a brand new adventure in Siege of Dragonspear.It's true that out of the box, the game looks different after the latest patch. However,  the changes that Beamdog made, particularly the ones that change how the game looks, are customizable and can be turned on/off (like the sprite outlines and other UI changes ). It takes less than 2 minutes of checking off options in the gameplay menu to make it look like the original. As for bugs, the only ones I experienced were minor (e.g. a map marker with the wrong label). I recently played through the OG campaign and Siege of Dragonspear, and I had a blast. The original campaign is still great, and most of the popular mods like the NPC project have stable versions that work with the EE version of the game. Be advised that the Steam version of the EE may cause you to jump through some hoops to get mods working. As for Siege of Dragonspear, it was fun. The story bridges the gap between BG1 and BG2, and overall, it does a good job, particularly when you remember it is bookended by such great stories. Tonally, it has to walk a line between the colorful adventure of BG1 and the dark journey of BG2, and there are several attempts to show your character dealing with their heritage, their accomplishments, and the relationship they have with the public at large. There are some NPC and player responses that may make you think, 'My Bhaalspawn would never say this' or 'this character would not behave this way', However, there are some really great moments with many of your favorite series characters (canon party in particular) and you are sure to enjoy at least a couple of the new NPCs (I thought M'Khin and Schael were interesting, could not stand Glint, YMMV). There is banter between old and new characters, which can range from annoying to charming, but this is usually due to personal preference with NPCs.There are plenty of quests and interesting locations, and even a few new gameplay concepts thrown in as well. I'm glad Beamdog took some risks with the gameplay as it provided some awesome moments, like being chased by a lich through it's lair while racing to destroy it's phylactery, or sneaking by a sleeping dragon, or exploring a ruined temple of Bhaal, or managing the titular siege, planning the attack with the coatition generals, and then leading the assault personally.If you enjoy CRPGs like Divinity: Original Sin, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, or Pillars of Eternity, give this a game a shot. If you are a BG veteran looking to play again, give this a shot before going back to your CD copy.			"

												Finally played through the expansion, and it was better than expected.The prologue was a little bit clunky, perhaps as a way of re-introducing players who hadn't played recently (I went straight from the main campaign), and it was a bit of a hiccup discovering that I'd have to dump most of my party members, but it ended up being worth it to have so much voice acted content, and tying things so well into the start of Baldur's Gate II (there were happenings mentioned in the intro of BG2 that I'd forgotten all about, and this did an excellent job of explaining them).The new characters were all really fun, and I think it would be great to bring the thief/cleric gnome into BG2 sometime. Sometimes the voice acting of side characters wasn't at the level of the original series. I'm noticing that in other EE content as well, it varies quite widely.The inability to re-visit previous groups of areas in the expansion seemed a bit unnecessary, it might have made sense story-wise, but it's not great for gameplay, and it wouldn't have really been an issue plot-wise than the same option which usually exists for other eras.Most of the UI changes I'm a fan of, though it took a long time to get used to the floating text box, as it feels like it partly reveals the world only to obscure it and make it feel awkwardly frustrating, like the entire viewport can't properly be seen. But at this point I'm used to it, and looking back at pictures of the old version looks a bit awkward and cramped now.n			"

												A classic RPG. Played the original 6 disc version back in the day, so my time logged on Steam is pretty low. Perhaps a bit slow to start, but after the game grip its claws into you, you'll be in for a wild ride. The original game features excellent voice acting and a good story. This has been preserved in the enhanced edition, with changes mostly dealing with bugs, lobbies in multiplayer, cleaner textures, high resolution support and a zoom feature. Baldur's Gate II is objectively a better game, but both are fantastic in their own right. If you're an RPG fan but not fond of the price, wait for a sale. Definitely worth it.			"

												RPG games hit their height when this game released, then that height was dwarfed by this games sequel. Dungeons & Dragons has never been so perfectly captured in a video game before or since the Baldur's Gate games. High adventure has never been captured so perfectly. While you don't get the same amount of party interaction as the second game, you will grow to love your companions dearly as they save you from the fire of the high level Wizard sending your comrades into a state of confusion and terror, you will cheer with righteous fury as Khalid hacks down the evildoer, fistbumping Mazzy as she sends an arrow hurtling between the eyes of the Battle Horror seconds away from decapitating you. You will appreciate Imoen as she disarms traps that would ♥♥♥♥ you♥♥♥♥♥♥up good. Viconia will be kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥ but she'll heal you, and you best believe Jaheira has your back. If you're not familiar with AD&D rules, you're gonna be in for a bit of a crushing.

												This was not what I expected as I normally only like FPS's, shiny things and loud noises.  But this made me have happy feelings.  I cannot read, so I didn't know what was going on most of the game, but I had a blast making my own sound effects and pretending I was shooting the bad guys with shooty guns like in my favorite FPS.   My dad caught me playing this game and he was happy.  He changed my drool cup twice that week.  It was awesome. Now that I have successfully gotten past the character creation screen, I have decided to give this game a rest for a while.  I am going to spend the remainder of my years playing as many CoD sequels as they will make.  I really like the soldier guys and making shooties at other soldier guys.  Also,  I think Activision cares about me and would never hit me like dad when he's been drinking. 5 out of 5 circles! Also if you like this game you should see my bike!

												Probably the second-best rpg ever made; BG2 being the best, and this is not said lightly. If you have the time to put into this game and its sequel, there is no better rpg experience in terms of story, gameplay, depth of character, plot twists, dialogue and writing, and overall size to reward exploration than the Baldur's Gate series.

												This was a game I grew up on in my early years and have always enjoyed ever since. It at its core like a dungeon crawler except the dungeon is actually a expansive section of the world called the Sword Coast. You can recruit party members from a vast variety all around the world with new additions in the ""Enhanced Edition"" changes which actually provide some interest to this over the original game counting any additional fixes they would have. I could continue on with this little section of praise but I feel it best that I leave the rest of this up to you, reader of reviews. I hoped calling you out like that would jolt you slightly to get you a slight bit more interested but just like the tootsie pop owl, the world may never know. Well probably just me. This is besides the point, bad marketing off, actual reasons for you to read this on. The original game that this version ""enhances"" I would probably recommed much more so than whatever this game is to be called. With recent updates as you may have heard (or read, reading is more common over internet) there has been troubles with the multiplayer aspect, which I haven't encountered as often as other people but still enough to warrant it an actual annoying nuisance. The visuals for this game I would actually say have been downgraded since the original game as it seems that only the npc's/characters have had updates to their style but not the background/land that you walk upon. This takes the feel of immersing into the game and lore of it a bit harder as it feels almost like it reminds you that your out of place (which your character, rest assured, is probably in the right place. Unless you fight big scary things as low level, then your place should be on the road running). The UI of the game was much better in the original game as this one seems to give the impression that everything is in the right place on screens like the Character Record screen (the head), but in reality its the same as taking all your files in a folder and putting them into their own folder in there. The original UI for that particular screen would seem a bit too much at first but after a second glance you're able to find any info you need rather than sifting through tabs to find the one tidbit you deem relevant. There are more than likely quite a few other niche's that can be disliked that I'm missing but the same can be said for the good aspects. Overall the reason why I recommend this is because there is an option to revert this back to V1.3 if you go to     Steam Library > Right click BG > Properties > Beta > V1.3   . For those of you who are new to the series I would recommend it as is as you wouldn't have a previous version to compare it to. Well that about wraps it up I guess as I have run out of things to ramble on about. I would say not sure how to end it but the truth is I'm never really sure so heres a link to the store page (which is above you but you can click on it if your lazy about scrolling. This appeals to some of you I'm sure)And well I guess here goes the TLDR(semicolon)TLDR;Go read it you lazy computer user. This does bank on you using computer but lets be honest, most people use computer and reading reviews on a phone means your probably into steam a bit and if your a bit into steam you should be READING what is ABOVE THE little paragraph of TEXT right here.

												This is a remake of the first RPG game I ever played on a PC. Shut up and buy it.This is a rather epic game and anyone enjoying D&D should love it (it's based on 3.5) ! Personally I think it is simply one of the greatest games of all time, period.If you like strategy games, buy this. Also the original had network abilities, though very very badly designed. I haven't tried to play this as multiplayer but I know I would love to.If there is one game that is worth getting, definitely it's that one.			"

												This game brings something new to the table, er... it did when it was released pre-2000. Whatever... anyhow, it's really fun. I got lost in all the different characters and customization between all the minute things ingame, but that's not bad at all. In fact, as someone who's always had a love for RPG's this thing has been a dream come true. Unfortunately, I'm extremely new and I can't seem to progress to far without dying and having to find some alternate way to accomplish my goals. I guess many would see that as a perk of the game, but being a very impatient person has led me to some very angry rage-quitting. Nonetheless, I refuse to let that change my opinion over this great game. If you buy this, I hope you gave patience... You'll need it. "

I cannot read, so I didn't know what was going on most of the game, but I had a blast making my own sound effects and pretending I was shooting the bad guys with shooty guns like in my favorite FPS.   My dad caught me playing this game and he was happy.  He changed my drool cup twice that week.  It was awesome. Now that I have successfully gotten past the character creation screen, I have decided to give this game a rest for a while.

												Summary:This is a famous old school RPG with a plot that is lauded by fans. It's mechanics are largely based on the D&D tabletop game (2nd Edition rules).To Buy or Not To Buy:This is a more freeform review, as I expect the vast majority who will buy this, already have. If you played this back in the day and enjoyed it, then I'd recommend it (for nostalgia, if nothing else). LIkewise, if you are a student/designer interested in playing this to analyze its design. For everyone else though, I would recommend giving it a pass.Thoughts:Since I lived through the time-frame of BG's release and was (and still am) an avid D&D player, one might expect me to give this game a glowing review, but I just can't recommend it to contemporary audiences. It's old school, in a way that most millenials would find infuriating, unintuitive, or boring. It lacks many of the UI and gameplay refinements that came along later and that most gamers today would consider baseline standards. To put it another way, it's a really old PC game. If you understand what that means and enjoy the charm of that style, then I recommend it. Otherwise, nope.			"

												If you are old enough to remember playing this when it first came out, it's a nice trip down nostalgia lane.  However, the limitations of the 2.5 D&D ruleset really cripple character flexibility.   It was a nice diversion for a bit but I stopped about 1/2 way through as the game simply takes way too long to play.  With a family, work & other activities vying for my attention, I didn't feel like I was actually making progress with only 1-2 hours of playtime available on the days I could actually play.			"

												If you've played the original Baldur's Gate and enjoyed it, this game is fantastic. :) It has features previously only available for BG1 through mods, such as the tab-light when searching for doors/items on the ground. There's new characters added, which aren't out of place and fit in nicely with the game. After years of obsessive playing, thoroughly enjoyed this update.			"

												This was a lot of fun.  It is pretty old school and it runs quite well on modern systems.  My only gripe is that the black pits expansion is nothing more than a bunch of rounds of fights.  There is no exploration and adventure involved. "

												This game got me into RPGs and it's one of my favorite games. It's a great RPG with an immersive storyline. Character creation doesn't have as many options as RPGs these days - but then again, I'm not a big fan of spending an hour shaping my character's eyebrows in Skyrim.  Being able to import your character into BG:II and continue playing the character in the second game was, and still is, a nice feature of this game series. I would recommend this classic game to just about anyone.			"

The NPCs added are really cool and feel like they belong to the original game. The game did not crash one single time (unlike the original which crashed often on Windows 98). I think most of the improvements of the second game were brought to this enhanced edition. The game runs in 1080p without any trouble and the UI and gfx are not too small either.

If you're into character or team creation, games with good story (and great back stories!), tactical and micromanaged battles, and you want to get completely absorbed for many hours into a super fun game, then you must buy this one.Gameplay: 9.5/10Story: 8/10 (gets much better in Baldur's Gate 2)Characters: 10/10Art: 6/10 (needs further modernisation)But seriously, this is a game you need to experience.

												This game got me into RPGs and it's one of my favorite games. It's a great RPG with an immersive storyline. Character creation doesn't have as many options as RPGs these days - but then again, I'm not a big fan of spending an hour shaping my character's eyebrows in Skyrim.  Being able to import your character into BG:II and continue playing the character in the second game was, and still is, a nice feature of this game series. I would recommend this classic game to just about anyone.			"

												This is a good but hard game to get into for a first playthrough. Since the game uses 2 edition rules of D&D. The game story starts slow but in later chapters really picks up. Also this game uses Advance Dungeons & Dragons Second Edition rules, thus will be very hard to get into for new players.			"

												This game is one of my favorites, I prefer Baldur's Gate II (which I spent most of my life playing it) but this EE is awesome.It has a good history and gameplay, and the character creation is just perfect. However, if you are looking for a game with great 3D graphics don't bother yourself,  this is an old school game, a classic of RPG and you can play it with friends.10/10			"

												As a long time avid fan of this series, this remake has so many positives and improvements and so far I can find no losses from it's conversion. The additional content and updates over my old disc copy make this well worth getting your hands on.To me this is one of the most brilliant story lines ever written in any game ever and I would place it in line with the Mass Effect series for that alone.Compelling and incredibly in-depth.Highly recommended for any player who loved the originals.

												First impressions: I am ashamed to say that I had not played this game when it first came out and so far I am impressed. The graphics are of course dated but certainly not messy, I thought the older graphics would be distracting and bother me, but after awhile you get used to them and it doesn't bother you at all, and  as I begin to learn the game, there is a very satisfying depth to it, which certainly helps you forget about the ageed visuals. During the tutorial, I killed one of my companions..in the tutorial! Well that doesn't turn me off at all, in fact I like it. You have to proceed thoughtfully in this game. Just the kind of experience I was looking for. It plays similarly to knights of the old republic. You have to pause the action and decide how your party members are going to engage the enemy. This game seems to me to be one that can suck you in the more you play it. As your understanding grows, so does your interest. I am only about two hours in and already I feel like I might be in for a long play session with this.			"

												Where to begin...As I have grown up playing role playing games such as Morrowind and Fallout 3, it was truely a treat to play a game with this amount of depth, character customization, a diverse amount of classes, challenging and tactical gameplay, likeable characters and party members, and an amazing story that will intrigue you from the beginning, considering that this game was made well before my time. If you are a fan of Bioware RPGs and/or Dungeons and Dragons, you are missing out on a truely great experience if you have not played this game yet. As this game is an enhanced edition of a game from the late 90's, the graphics will certianly not please the typical grahics ♥♥♥♥♥. My only complaints are that the pathfinding is not too great at times, and the multiplayer feels like it was added on at the last second; it seems that the developers did not properly accommodate the game mechanics to integrate properly with multiple players. Overall, Baldur's Gate was a fantastic experience, and I'm certianly planning on importing my save onto Baldur's Gate 2.			"

												So i was a huge fan of this game when it came out. it holds some very fonds memories, and not so fond frustrations.Good: The story is amazing, the character development is great.Bad: You will save and reload a lot in this game. In fact, save after every battle and save before you speak to anyone important, and save after you explore a large portion of the map. save, quick save, and reload are essential for enjoyement.Cool: The graphics are just as pretty as they were long ago, with notable improvements. also the ability to add your own portraits is nice. Lame: The old AD&D system did not age as well as the later incarnations of D&D. This is actually persional preference and your view may vary.			"

												If you are old enough to remember playing this when it first came out, it's a nice trip down nostalgia lane.  However, the limitations of the 2.5 D&D ruleset really cripple character flexibility.   It was a nice diversion for a bit but I stopped about 1/2 way through as the game simply takes way too long to play.  With a family, work & other activities vying for my attention, I didn't feel like I was actually making progress with only 1-2 hours of playtime available on the days I could actually play.			"

												I've clocked well over 600 hours playing Baldur's Gate I and II since I was 12, when a copy of BGI came bundled with my first CD-ready computer. I love Baldur's gate.The enhanced edition is better graphically and mechanically, and it would be a lot easier for a newcomer to get into it and it's certainly worth giving it a try if you're a veteran of the series. Many of the 'fixes' are welcome, and the varied classes and spells make it much more playable.HOWEVER there are some horrible, horrible bugs. For example there is a limit on game speed (which makes combat feel fustratingly slow if you're used to setting it to 60 updates per second in the original) and the incomprehensible path search nodes (which mean your character cannot negotiate narrow corridors, and often defaults to taking 'the long way round').The latter has caused me to prerpetrate a 'ragequit' when it repeatedly interfered with combat.

												I've clocked well over 600 hours playing Baldur's Gate I and II since I was 12, when a copy of BGI came bundled with my first CD-ready computer. I love Baldur's gate.The enhanced edition is better graphically and mechanically, and it would be a lot easier for a newcomer to get into it and it's certainly worth giving it a try if you're a veteran of the series. Many of the 'fixes' are welcome, and the varied classes and spells make it much more playable.HOWEVER there are some horrible, horrible bugs. For example there is a limit on game speed (which makes combat feel fustratingly slow if you're used to setting it to 60 updates per second in the original) and the incomprehensible path search nodes (which mean your character cannot negotiate narrow corridors, and often defaults to taking 'the long way round').The latter has caused me to prerpetrate a 'ragequit' when it repeatedly interfered with combat.

												What a classic! Redone and made even better with the addition of faster movement, a zoom in feature, a quick save button and hotkey, larger quivers for archers, expanded classes, new quests, with the same old story line that you know and loveThis is a must-buy for D&D fans of all ages			"

												My brothers, my friend, and I bought this game to play the multiplayer together. I loved this game, and still have the 6 discs the original game needed. I was siked when I found out it was on Steam. So, we tried to play the multiplayer, which was ridiculously broken. it took us 2 hours to finally get into the game, having to spent 20 minutes rerolling stats because we would get kicked from the session, or the game would crash. So, if you were looking forward or wanting to play this game with your friends, don't bother getting it. It was, however, awesome the one time we got it to work, I just wish they would patch the game and fix the bug riddled multiplayer. However, the single player campaign and the Black Pits worked well, and I was glad I could play my old game without swapping discs in between every fast travel. The game really ins't that different, and we found ourselves and I found out personally, that the new characters weren't anything special, and the environments looked good, but not that big of a change. I would recomend this game to any fans of the series, but stay away from the multiplayer. 5/9 hours I've played was sitting in lobbies and character creation arbitration sceens, waiting for the game to work.

												A classic in all forms of the word. Don't play this game expecting it to work like modern day RPG's. It has a lot more in common with a game like Dark Souls. Expect to die a lot, but this game doesn't require any grinding. Simply do the quest you find and you'll stumble on the main quest line.I highly recomend this game.			"

												For those of you hoping for a good MULTIPLAYER experience.. AVOID.I find it very much a single player game. You could maybe play with one friend locally; otherwise its bad.Each time someone speaks to an NPC it takes around 5s to cut to where that player is and EVERY PLAYER sees this lol.And there are still network difficulties.What more to say? Well if you've never played this game and want a cool single player experience give it a go. Also try Pillars of Eternity if you like this genre, it is a bit more modern. :)			"

												What can I say?  The Baldur's Gate experience now 'enhanced' with added companions and quests, classes, weapons/weapon specialisations and too many other knick knacks to mention.For some people this is a welcome thing, for purists though maybe not so much.I first played Baldur's Gate a year or so after it's original release (1998) and was overwhelmed by the freedom of exploration and depth that was on offer.  Thats not to say the original was an overly complex game but it certainly requires an attention span to understand the second edition D&D rules and how the stats play with your character and companions you may acquire on the way.This edition takes the original and augments it with some of the features I mentioned above but also changes some things which I feel are for the worse such as the cutscenes and some useless companions, but these are minor quibbles.  The combat is just as satisfying, the story just as good (yes I liked it, despite criticism from others) and Minsc's dialogue will never get old.For purists I recommend NOT purchasing this.  Heading over to a certain site that specialises in games that are old and good to purchase the original and then installing the various mods that improve the base game and having a blast that way is the way to go.For everyone else who wants the new and (arguably) improved Baldur's Gate experience then this is the purchase for you.In short - the good:*Compelling story*Interesting companions*Satisfying gameplay and dialogue*Sense of wonder and exploration is still there*Now playable across different operating systemsThe bad:*Some new additions lacking and not so fun*New cutscenes aren’t so greatThe ugly:*NO CLOUD SAVE - WHY CAN’T YOU DO THIS.  This can be bypassed with dropbox but if you’re going to allow the saves to work across several devices and operating systems then this should really be there.  Beamdog have stated that save games for EE are compatible across OSX/Windows so it makes no sense not to enable it at least for steam users.			"

												This is the way to play a true classic. This will raise the bar for storytelling you may not like newer games or find them boring or simple after playing Baldur's Gate.Baldur's Gate has aged graphics and uses the ancient 2nd Edition Dungeons&Dragons rule system so beware, you may get killed in your first hours easily. If you are new to computer games (or  less then 5 years in RPG ) this is not your typical diffuculty setting here. Well if you take heed on the warning and prepared yourself , you may start one of the most epic stories ever told in a cRPG ever, so excellent story here. When you finished the game , it will be like reading 2-3 books of good RPG novels what's more, thats your story as you had chosen. Although main quest is linear there are many paths you can choose. Every different character you created and every different party you set up changes the way you play. Item and spell diversity is nice. There are no game breaking bugs. Game is still mod capable if you want more content. Keep in mind story continues to new upcoming Siege of Dragonspear and onto Baldur's Gate II. You can import your saves to them which will affect many quests depending on your choices here. A must buy for any RPG player. "

												Where to begin...As I have grown up playing role playing games such as Morrowind and Fallout 3, it was truely a treat to play a game with this amount of depth, character customization, a diverse amount of classes, challenging and tactical gameplay, likeable characters and party members, and an amazing story that will intrigue you from the beginning, considering that this game was made well before my time. If you are a fan of Bioware RPGs and/or Dungeons and Dragons, you are missing out on a truely great experience if you have not played this game yet. As this game is an enhanced edition of a game from the late 90's, the graphics will certianly not please the typical grahics ♥♥♥♥♥. My only complaints are that the pathfinding is not too great at times, and the multiplayer feels like it was added on at the last second; it seems that the developers did not properly accommodate the game mechanics to integrate properly with multiple players. Overall, Baldur's Gate was a fantastic experience, and I'm certianly planning on importing my save onto Baldur's Gate 2.			"

												So i was a huge fan of this game when it came out. it holds some very fonds memories, and not so fond frustrations.Good: The story is amazing, the character development is great.Bad: You will save and reload a lot in this game. In fact, save after every battle and save before you speak to anyone important, and save after you explore a large portion of the map. save, quick save, and reload are essential for enjoyement.Cool: The graphics are just as pretty as they were long ago, with notable improvements. also the ability to add your own portraits is nice. Lame: The old AD&D system did not age as well as the later incarnations of D&D. This is actually persional preference and your view may vary.			"

I recently installed the game to see if it has become playable, and I was first greeted with the new inferior character creation UI that makes picking a color a lot more tedious, and once I got into the actual game, I noticed that some of the patches has included some weird smoothing effects that turn the once beautiful sprites to look like some obscure vomit shapes.It is absolutely clear to me that if you want to experience Baldur's Gate, it is better to go with the GOG version. This 'Enhanced' Edition is just a crime agaisnt humanity.			"

												I adored the original Baldur's Gate. I played it for at least a hundred hours. Along with the other Infinity Engine games, it was among the best of their kind, and set the tune for what a PC RPG was for a decade. I got this game planning to give it a thumbs up without even playing it (and many others have done just that.) But above all else, I must be honest in my reviews. I can't imagine actually playing through this game today, with its clumsy, backward design. But I'm not rating this game while living in the time Baldur's Gate was originally released. It's been over twenty years, and it shows. We've learned a lot about UI and ""User Experience"" since then, and to charge more than a few dollars without doing some serious reconstructive work is asking too much.The ""enhancements"" are only the absolute bare minimum required to make the game acceptable by today's standards, and those are the standards I'm obliged to use since the game is for sale now. The superficial changes (such as being able to choose higher resolutions) don't impress me. At $40 (the asking price at the time of writing), I would expect at a minimum for the game to have a redesigned UI.It may have been state-of-the-art when I was a lad, but ultimately sweet nostalgia is all I could wring from this game - a game that had its day long ago. The sun has set on that day, and nostalgia is free. So do yourself a favor and spring for something newer. Pillars of Eternity is a modern spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, and at time of writing they are even similarly priced.			"

												This game is fantastic. The story is good and the characters are fantastic and the combat gets really deep and interesting, basically allowing you to play any way you want.If you have ever seen the ""Extra Credits"" youtube video about Dark Souls II allowing players to decide their difficulty with in game choices, like melee greater difficulty than magic, that is what Baldur's Gate is like. You can go full out power gamer and try to min/max everything and get the best out of everything, or just play how you want with terrible party compositions and a more role play focus. I mean, there are the standard difficulty options of 'easy', 'normal', etc. but how you play the game can make it much harder or easier too, which I appreciate. This game took me years to get into, I'll admit that. I just kept restarting changing classes and decisions I'd make. It felt like such a hard and inaccessible game - which in many ways it is, it demands a lot of you in terms of learning how to play. But, after years of half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempts and finally actually getting into the walls of Baldur's Gate, it feels pretty good man.			"

												A bug-ridden mess that tacks nifty content onto an already pretty good game.  The good: New characters, new banter, a new arena-style area, class kits, some of which are also new, and a graphical update.The bad: Quick/auto-save unusable due to deletion, a problem which cost me a chunk of character creation time since I didn't know those saves were going to be deleted for no reason, issues with monitor turning on and off mid-play.  Not necessarily a ""bad"" but original characters didn't get much if any banter that I saw, making the difference between them and the new ones a bit jarring.tl;dr : Wait for some of the bugs to be fixed, or learn about them ahead of time so you can play around them.  It's your choice, but I cannot honestly recommend spending a bunch of money on something that does not work as advertised.  This was supposed to be updated to work BETTER on modern PCs, not WORSE.

												Hey it's Baldur's Gate all over again, but with enhancements that make it not-so-clunky to play in 2016. Same old storyline but with all of the added enhancements, characters, mods, etc. that make this the ""standard"" for computer D&D gaming. A far better experience than the original.  Highly Recommended - 9/10 - bonus points for nostalgia.			"

												This is just not a good game i gave the original many chances and this one several and it always fails to impress. The game is just too hard and not in a good way.Good games that are known for being hard all have one thing in common, they're hard but they are also fair. hard games punish you mercilessly, but the good ones only do so when you make a mistake. This game isnt so much challenging as it is annoying. As someone who has played DnD 2nd before  I knew enough about its convoluted mechanics to get by, or so i thought, This game is not in any way a faithful representation of DnD no matter which version. This game feels like playing a campaign with a DM who is both terribly sadistic and incredibly stupid. you encounter horde after horde of enemies and their hit rolls are so absurdly high and for you the opposite is true.  your magic is almosy compltetely ineffective against any strong enemy, they nearly always make a saving throw, so any hold, charm, or cripple spell is worthless, sure you can trap a bunch of goblins in a web,or stinkign cloud but why  would you? and god forbid you deign to think the spells will work against anything even slightly stronger.All of this would be tolerable if the roleplaying were not so nonexistant. The story is doled out in meager portions, and what is there is not terribly compelling. sure im the child of a god but i just got one shotted by a kobold archer.The npcs they added are frankly just corny. The person who wrote for neera must have sincerely thought she was funny. but getting my entire party magic missiled to death by a bunch of mages so i can have a mage join that regularly summons cows or fireballs herself isntead of casting armor. the others frankly are even worse having a monk in your party when your level cap is around 7 or 8 is a terrible idea, the blackguard is a walking cliche, and the writing for the new content in general is quite amateurish.All in all i cannot recommend this game nothing has changed with this new version. Some minor graphical upgrades and nothing else. the game is too frustrating in combat, and the plot is just not interesting enough to motivate me.			"

												I really wanted to love this game. I remember loving the sequel as a kid, however....I have played DnD since I was about, oh, 8, and now at 24 I feel I know DnD pretty damn well. I've played many hundreds of hours of the real pen and paper game, so I went in knowing exactly what to expect. ....However. What can best sumarize this game is simply ""...What?!"" It is a confusing utter mess of a game. it will say to press the x to close the window. there isn't one. you have to hit the hotkey to close it instead. Okay, minor quibble. However the real issue is how much it just MANGLED and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the rules. In normal dnd, higher AC=better. makes you harder to hit because higher roll with modifiers is required. however, different things gave... utterly random AC bonuses. the super heavy armor gave 4 but the cloth gave 8? ....kay, uh, and my dex bonus now SUBTRACTS from my AC. so... being more able to dodge attacks makes me... more able to be hit? this game is a mess. its incredibly unclear where anything is, or why I'm doing it, or any indication of how long to wait (sometimes it will just say ""wait for a moment"" and a second or 4 minutes will randomly be required) and again, the rules. the poor, mangled abused rules. Like.... trying to upgrade my 17 STR to 18? it instead became 39. I even took a screen shot for that one. I went from 17 to 39. which sounds great, right? except now I did zero damage.the rules of this came are just... utterly utterly BROKEN. story could be great? I wouldn't know. I couldn't put up with it anymore, it was just completely ruined by having rules determined by a schizoid DM. So.... buy the sequel instead? or just wait until steam gets temple of elemental evil, I suppose.			"

												REVIEW UPDATE:GOOD NEWS!!!:As of v 2.3, you can now get the achievement ""In the Name of the Father"", although the ""you chose poorly"" and ""grim deeds to come"" cheevos are still bugged and unachievable...Come on Beamdog, only 2 more cheevos to fix, YOU CAN DO EET!!!Seriously, I'm begging here... PLEASE let me 100% this game achievement-wise, PLEASE!!!!!!!*dramatic <HEADDESK>*PREVIOUS:This game used to be the be-all and end-all to me... the best game of its time!  (when played with TuTu mod and BG2 with extended ending and Edwin romance) However, the achievements kind of ruined it for me...  WAAAY WAAAY too many achievements, they're OVER 9,000!!!  (129)Seriously... WHY DO I GET AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR KILLING THIS GAME'S VERSION OF JAR JAR BINKS!?!? (Noober in Dragonspear)Also, at least 3 achievements are still glitched and unobtainable...I do recommend this game, but only barely... it is a pale, sickly shadow of what it once was!  Maybe some of that is nostalgia talking, but not all of it!  Not by a long shot...Here's the list of pros and cons as I see it currently (6 pros, 8 cons):Pros:1. game 1 of possibly the best D&D-style videogame series of all time!2. Explore the Forgotten Realms, and discover if you have the skills to beat Drizzt Do'Urden!3. Achievements (sort of, at least they exist)4. Plenty of mods everywhere on the web with more content! (best content is for Baldur's Gate 2 tho)5. EE Keeper exists, to help speed up otherwise useless achievement runs and generally help you to not have to replay the whole game if you forgot to grab the pantaloons waaaay back in BG 1...   T_T6. Siege of Dragonspear DLC, finally an answer to what happened between BG 1 and BG 2!Cons:1. It lacks trading cards...2. it's 2e D&D, or rather their own version of 2e D&D... bleh3. Achievements:  WAAAY too many... an achievement to kill that annoyance, Noober?  REALLY?4. Achievements: They lumped Siege of Dragonspear's cheevo's in with BG1's cheevos... which is why there's 129 of them... only 61 in vanilla BG1!  (only, ya right...)5. Achievements:  Currently, 3 achievements are bugged and unachievable (as of 2.2):In The Name of the Father (tell priestess of bhaal to murder and whatnot after freeing her),You Chose Poorly (bet a party member's soul on a riddle match and lose), andGrim Deeds to Come (get ambushed outside of Baldur's Gate after sneaking out [pretty much the ""beating Dragonspear"" achievement]) Yep, have fun with an imcomplete 126/129 on the game, until Beamdog eventually gets around to fixing it!6. This game is old... like really old!  Seriously, this game is ancient!  It was released in 1998! (not really a con, but throwing it in there, some people might care... not really that old either, but it is compared to what's out now.)7. EE Keeper exists (yes, I know it's also in the pros, but cheaters will abuse this, making it hard to feel accomplished when bragging about beating Insane Difficulty)8. In the same vein as #7, the Command Console comes automatically fully enabled, and is ridiculously simple and easy to use... legit players of this game will cry tears as the cheaters abuse these 2 things thoroughly!

												I love this game.  My hours do not reflect the total amount of time I've spent trekking along the Sword Coast.  I bought this game near launch day back in the late '90's, and have spent who knows how many hours playing with different classes and different NPC's.Now with the Enhanced Edition it has the BG2 engine (which is very welcome as it definitely improved on the original), more classes, the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion, some new items and NPC's.Even though I've spent hundreds of hours playing the original, I'll probably spend hundreds more using the new classes and NPC's.It's worth it.  The Siege of Dragonspear expansion is pretty good as well.  Some people have complained about the social justice-y vibe, but I didn't find it that distracting.

												I finally played the first part and beat it.  After all these years.  I am so happy right now.  Course now i must get the Siege and BG2 etc.  So much fun doing this again.  I have the game boxes from way back when I bought them.  I just had so much going on that kept me from being able to play.  The wonderful thing about this game is you can jump right in and find yourself drawn into the story.  I love the new characters too.  Dorn, while a little naughty and evil.....is perhaps my favorite.  He stood by my character the whole time, even when I went all lawful good in rep.  Ugh.  haha!  This game is must!  And playing a different character does actually change the story for you.  Your reactions are different.  My next play is a mage thief i think.  Definitely add this to your game library.			"

												When thinking of a game to play that relates to the mechanics of D&D 2nd Edition, and the lore of the Forgotten Realms, Baldurs Gate comes to one's mind first most of the time. This game offers a wonderful RPG experience to anyone new and old veterans, and despite the amount of negative reviews over bug issues, I still consider it to be very playable. I've just bought it recently and played through the whole story, and I've never met any annoying bugs at all. (Except for one where Minsc wouldn't listen to my commands for one time.) So to conclude this review, I'd say that Baldur's Gate EE is still a good buy for any D&D and RPG players out there.			"

They don't make games like this anymore Divinity OS is good but still doesnt come close to how deep AD&D is. Seriously just look up the spells, feats and classes for this and many other D&D games like BG. Even crazier is the tabletop version is even deeper and makes the pc rpgs look watered down lol.

												""My review is clean as an elven♥♥♥♥♥♥"" There's not a lot ot say about this franchise that hasn't already been said. Simply put, this series is one of the best examples of when western rpgs finally started to truly compete and surpass jrpgs. If you are under the age of 30, love rpgs, and are interested in seeing the history of video games preserved you simply MUST give this game a chance. It's not perfect, but it does so many things right for the genre it's a crime that there are people going into game design who have never played it.Pros:-Minsc, you'll understand when you play the game-Fun story to play through with voice talent ranging from fantastic to meh-New content, classes, party members, etc. over the original game add TONS of replayability-If people support projects like this more and more developers might be willing to go back and restore their old games to make them available for the modern audienceCons:-Graphical barrier to entry might be a little high for some but the art design is good enough you can overcome that (You whipper snappers and your photo realistic graphics! In my day you had to make due with only one pixel and you liked it!)-Combat is a little dated and it's not always obvious what decisions you make are really changing things (a lot of stuff goes on under the hood as it were for better or worse)-Minsc can die forever if you aren't careful			"

												Very Obtuse and overly complicated menu/spell/battle system ruins what is probably a really good game. I love turn based isometric games like fallout and such but this game is just too complicated. I literally cant figure my way past the first tutorial battle. The other thing is that this game does not appear to actually be turn based as the only way to pause the action is to press the space bar, otherwise the critters will just keep pummeling your party why you desperately try to get a spell going.I recognize that there are legions of fans for this game and I have played real paper and pencil D&D myself, but I tend to hate on games with a extreme learning curve. Not fun.If you like spending hours trying to figure out basic gameplay then this title is perfect..................................................................................................................................................................UPDATE:You know I could just erase my original review, but I will let it stand as it was a honest first impression. I have since forced myself to go back and learn the system. I actually watched a dude on youtube go thru it and explain the basics. I wouldn't say its my cup of tea but then again its getting better as I play it. So those who don't know these type of games. You really gotta hang in there. For the record I still don't like the pause/command system compared to the real turn based combat of Fallout, and yes I spent a hour to learn this game lolChanging my no to a yes.			"

												Baldur's Gate has been my favorite game for over 10 years. I originally started with Shadows of Amn, and then later bought the first one. Both games are absolutely amazing, and it saddens me how underrated the games have always been. For me, Baldur's Gate is the perfect game. The story is amazing (Especially in Shadows of Amn!) as well as the characters. The graphics are absolutely beautiful; I would take them over 3D ones any day. The characters are not very detailed (Except for their portraits) but the art of the Sword Coast and the animation for spells and such is quite enjoyable. The game has a lot of humor throughout if you look hard enough; near the end of the first game in the Enhanced Edition you even get a Big Bang Theory reference from Baeloth! There are also some Star Wars references here and there. But not all the jokes are so hidden; there are many that are obvious and they are amazing, and there are just SO MANY REFERENCES TO POP CULTURE. IT IS AMAZING. The game also has things built in simply to annoy you and add to the experience; Noober and Neeber are GREAT examples of this. The gameplay is great; and I mean AWESOME. The map setups are really nice, and give you a lot of exploring to do. There are also quests all over. Fighting is fun because it does take some strategy, especially against certain mages. The game lets you adjust the level as well, so if you want a more challenging game you can make it so, and change it anytime you want. The items are fun and sometimes give you some amusing descriptions. Also, a lot of the game requires you to figure things out on your own, be it riddles, figuring out quests and so forth.Did I mention the music? It is beautiful! Michael Hoenig knows how to compose, that is for sure. The soundtrack is perfection.Overall, Baldur's Gate is a beautiful, amusing, fun filled game, that I don't think can be beat (Except by maybe more Baldur's Gate games... Or I am Bread, gotta admit that is an awesome game). But seriously, this game is great and will provide hours, days, weeks, months, YEARS of fun. I've played it so many times. But anyways, it is really difficult for me to stop talking about this game, but I doubt anyone will read a review that is any longer. So yeah, play this game and enjoy it for the rest of your life.P.S. I highly recommend the Enhanced Editions to the originals. Both are great, but the Enhanced Editions give you more than the old ones, as well as fixes some previous glitches or setbacks.			"

You won't regret playing it.Pros+ Tons of characters that you can add to your team, including a few that weren't in the original game+ Big world to explore, many adventures to live, different ways to approach every situation+ Amazing plot, one of the best RPGs out there+ Character customization+ Enough content for hours and hours of gameplay+ Deadly hamstersCons- Though a big fans of these games, I still think D&D system doesn't work really well here, it's more suited for pen and paper- Can be really challenging sometimes, especially if you're not used to the game system behind it- Formation sucks, or maybe I do... couldn't make the archers and casters stay behind unless I controlled them apart from the rest of the group all the time!- You can't play as Boo			"

												One of the best RPGs of all time. When it was first released, I did not like the pause-turn style of RPG and I didn't like Baldurs Gate at first. I have since realized that this is one of the most satisfying, engrossing RPGs, that I believe would be a good recommend for someone who does not normally like RPGs. There is excellent characters, storytelling and gameplay. Its a mystery why there are not as many RPGs that can successfully write a truly compelling adventure.			"

												Dispite the ""enhanced edition"" not adding much compared to alternative expansions... Baldurs Gate is a game i come back to play over and over again because of how well the game is made. Lots of story, lots of variety in character building, The difficulty scales well and punishes just the right amount.This game endlessly surprises me how much I get drawn into the stories, and how much more engaging it makes the battles in between.

												I've played Baldur's Gate more than any other game in my life, even back before Tales of the Sword Coast where you had to swap between the five CD's if you wanted to travel around the map. Among my fondest memories, the BG series always gives me great pleasure, so I cannot in good conscience accept what Beamdog and their putrid claws has turned this beloved franchise into, part of the culture war where even beeing a ""cis white male"" is wrong. Eventhough the ones buying this game are usually white males. Do not buy this game and do not support Beamdog as they have clearly shown that crappy writing is perfectly exusable as long as you make it serve diversity, forcibly if possible. In a world of orcs, goblins, dragons, monsters, magic and divine, earthshattering prophecies unfolding, it's still more important to inject social commentary because thats how SJW's can make themselves look good.

												You'd be hard pressed to find a better classic-style RPG than Baldur's Gate.  Despite its age, and one glance will surely date this game badly, the experience, story, and challenge remain top-notch.  Some glitches due mire this conversion and some additional saves will be necessary for safety sake, so be warned.  Also worth noting, long time players will not see much value in this game as the refinements to the games engine and extra content have been perfected by modders long ago.  If you still own the original game, double dipping into this release will probably be unnecessary.  But for those that lost their original discs (like myself) or that have missed this experience for whatever reason, pick this up.			"

It's very possible to get lost and need a handbook, I spent hours trying to figure out what I was supposed to do, and not all quests will give locations so if you forget where you encountered someone, goodluck.2. Isn't about the game, but I just wish this had trading cards, I would throw more money at my PC then.			"

												I may have VERY FEW hours put into this game so far, but i've beaten the series on playstation.It's on the list of games to beat, but I have such a long list, i couldnt resist the temptation of trying out the gameplay, and checking out all the new character classes.(There are quite a few new one)It is an EXCELLENT game, very well done with the Enhancements. They changed the whole gameplay entirely, its more of a Command and Conquer, Click Style, Strategy game. Very well done too.The best part about this game, is being able to enjoy the story all over again, with added Characters, and stories/quests. If you expect anything like the old game, (scenery, gameplay, style, graphics) you may be disappointed, but i do reccomend giving it a good try before asking for a refund.It is nothing but an excellent experience playing this, i couldnt imagine a better enhanced edition of this game. I defenitly look forward to playing more of this game in the future!			"

Part of it might be a bit of nostalgia from playing the game many years ago, but it really does capture, as best as is reasonably possible within a video game framework, the magic of a D&D campaign. It's not perfect, but if you can get past what is a slightly dated engine, you'll experience the game that turned BioWare into the ""masters of the western RPG.""The sequel is a better game, but you should really buy and play both. Baldur's Gate 2 in particular really shows how fantastic BioWare was when they were small and had nothing but dreams in their eyes.			"

												I may have VERY FEW hours put into this game so far, but i've beaten the series on playstation.It's on the list of games to beat, but I have such a long list, i couldnt resist the temptation of trying out the gameplay, and checking out all the new character classes.(There are quite a few new one)It is an EXCELLENT game, very well done with the Enhancements. They changed the whole gameplay entirely, its more of a Command and Conquer, Click Style, Strategy game. Very well done too.The best part about this game, is being able to enjoy the story all over again, with added Characters, and stories/quests. If you expect anything like the old game, (scenery, gameplay, style, graphics) you may be disappointed, but i do reccomend giving it a good try before asking for a refund.It is nothing but an excellent experience playing this, i couldnt imagine a better enhanced edition of this game. I defenitly look forward to playing more of this game in the future!			"

												I played this game back when I was young, so of course I hopped all over that when I seen it re-released on steam.Solid RPG, great story (even if you aren't a fan of reading or lore you'll follow along pretty well)great gameplay, easy to learn controls and whatnot.2 Cons I have,1. It's very possible to get lost and need a handbook, I spent hours trying to figure out what I was supposed to do, and not all quests will give locations so if you forget where you encountered someone, goodluck.2. Isn't about the game, but I just wish this had trading cards, I would throw more money at my PC then.			"

												I enjoyed this expansion a great deal. It did a great job of bridging the gap between BG 1 and BG 2. The graphics, considering it was running on the old infinity engine, were excellent. The story was enjoyable however I did have a small complaint in that it was very linear. This is excusable considering the entire point of the game is to connect to specific story points in the series but I still feel it could have been done better. Another minor complaint was how little it effects anything in BG 2- only a small amount of items will show up in random places later. My favorite part of SOD was the NPC's. Traveling again with Boo (and his medium sized terrestrial friend Minsc), Viconia and other series favorites- actually voiced by their original actors- was a real nostalgic joy after so many years. The new characters too were a lot of fun, Captain Corwin and M'Khiin being my favorites.Obviously there are some strong opininions and disagreements about this game but for me personally it was well worth playing. I think any old school fan of Bioware who loves their modern titles like Mass Effect and Dragon Age will find this Beamdog expansion fits right in.			"

												You'd be hard pressed to find a better classic-style RPG than Baldur's Gate.  Despite its age, and one glance will surely date this game badly, the experience, story, and challenge remain top-notch.  Some glitches due mire this conversion and some additional saves will be necessary for safety sake, so be warned.  Also worth noting, long time players will not see much value in this game as the refinements to the games engine and extra content have been perfected by modders long ago.  If you still own the original game, double dipping into this release will probably be unnecessary.  But for those that lost their original discs (like myself) or that have missed this experience for whatever reason, pick this up.			"

												DONT BUY UNTIL THEY GET RID OF THE NEW GRAPHICS!!!I LOVED BG 1 & 2. I played them for hours and hours then went back and played them again. SO when I found out that there were enhanced editions I started playing all over again and fell in love with BG EE.....But then these *&^(@*#^%@'s went and CHANGED the graphics and inserted their personal politics into my favorite game. Now I can't even play it. The new graphics physically make me sick. I'm not kidding. I literally get sick after a very short time. The new graphics are horrid. 2.0 is a travesty. Why did they ruin this amazing game?I paid for this game and without any warning they completely changed the already amazing graphicsinto something absolutely sketchy and horrid looking ruining my experience and making an amazing game unplayable. GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GRAPHICS PLEASE!!! I hate these horrible cartoonish colors. Something about these 'updated' (Read =ruined) graphics makes me physically ill. I really want a refund. I cant play the game anymore. I also bought BG2 EE and BG1 EE for my son to play via multi-player and we cant even get the updated 2.0 versions to load on his computer in single player now.Way to go! You ruined these games. Iv'e never heard of a game company deliberately ruining a game before. Apparently, they don't intend to stay in business. Either that or they hate D&D fans and enjoy alienating an entire genre of gamers.Drop the 2.0 and go back to the original game that was working so wonderfully.For those who want the expansion, fine....keep the graphics changes for them but I want my BGEE and BG2EE back the way they were!!! They worked fine before and now they SUCK.Oh, and FYI....I've canceled my plans to buy Icewind Dale EE and refuse to spend even one more dollar on Beamdog products until they give me back the original BGEE graphics. Why buy something I cant play?Changing the graphics from a stable,well recieved, beautifully rendered engine to a shoddy, ugly, unstable, sketchy trainwreck was the worst decision ever in the history of gaming.Oh...and apparently Beamdog has decided to force their politics on Baldurs Gate fans! I don't care about your politics or what your employees do behind their closed doors.Seriously! This is Baldurs Gate. This isn't Liesure Suit Larry's Hottub. We just want toplay the old game on new computers....THAT's ALL!!! Changing beloved characters and adding politically desperate language to please some angry programmer's warped views is unacceptable to the majority of BG fans and the feedback here is ample proof. I guess you guys never went to business school or learned the maxims, ""the customer is always right"" and ""never dump on your core clients.""My monthly game money will go to some other deserving company.  Beamdog apparently doesn't want it. They are too busy telling off customers and messing up time honored, beloved and respected games.Restore the game graphics and functionality or I will never spend money on a Beamdog product again.

												BGEE - It is probably the future of modding, and it has a lot of ease of installation advantages over the original games.  Buy it, but ignore the new NPCs.  They're badly voice acted and written.Dragonspear - Bad writing and slow progression (you can only gain roughly 2 levels) lead to a really stagnant expansion.  Beamdog has tried to cast people not liking it as hating the Regressive Left politics they crammed into it... and granted, that's hate worthy.  But most people just think they have crap writers.

												I loved the Baldur's Gate series (espacially with all the mods) and when Beamdog came out with the expansion I picked it up along with the two enhanced editions, thinking that they would run more smoothly with windows 10.  That turned out to be a big mistake - my original BG runs fine but with the latest patch to the EE the sound no longer works properluy - only the music plays, none of the speech or sound effects play.  The EE was a total waste of money for me - and I can't understand how Beamdog can actually make such an old product worse.			"

												If your life as gamer began after this game original release - you can skip it. I tried it around release date, but didn't get far, and after many years retried it again after hearing how awesome game is, deep story, combat, freedom, blah blah blah.1. Freedom and randomization is kinda bs. For example me and my friend got the same RANDOM encounter in the same place every time we load game. As for freedom... you can say it's there, but all maps which are supposedly be optional are just very boring forest textures which may hurt your eyes if u watch on it for a long time.2. Combat. Riiiiiiight. U'll curse this entire system if u try to use 2 handed sword and that class where user is becoming one with sword and blah blah blah. Plus since it's DnD there are situations where your party sleep 2 meters away from some sort of nest with skeletons and undead only because your mage ""forgot"" healing spell.3. Story. I tried to follow it and enjoy it... but it really become boring very fast and if you go on side quests for a while - those texts for next chapter where they say that you were in a hurry to get to a place... right. I completely forgot about me having to get there. I was walking in yet another forest like 5 clicks in the opposite direction.4. Some random stuff you may not like. There are problems here and there like at current version of the game ""Join"" button for multiplayer doesn't even have text on it. Or some weird stuff where you ""entered"" map on the left side and your party respawns like they entered from top... weird connectivity between places.So yeah. If you want to buy this because you haven't tried original - ignore or buy on big sale. With games we have now (Witcher 1, 2, Dark Souls, maybe even Skyrim, Ys Origin and Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale and so on) there are plenty of amazing games with dark/cheery heavy/hilarious INTERESTING stories and great combat mechanics.

												This review is mainly for the Siege of Dragonspear expansion, rather than the base game.  I felt I had to share my two cents on it because of how much hate it was getting.  The people who are shouting all the nonsense about the writing being poor in SoD are either insane, or are just doing all they can to trash Amber Scott.  There's simply no other explanation than that.I myself am 34 years old, and the fact of the matter is, Baldur's Gate 1 is an old game.  It's a VERY old game.  And lets face it - while the writing and play mechanics were ""decent"" for its time, unmodded it doesn't hold a candle to the writing in most RPG's, let alone modern Bioware titles.  If you think otherwise, you're not being honest with yourself.  It's the nostalgia talking.Beamdog did the best they could with the material they were given, and the honest truth of the matter is, their product turned out to be more impressive than the original title.  Let's not kid ourselves: If this expansion had been released 15 years ago back when the Infinity engine was still popular, it would have received awards.  They took BG1, and bumped it up as close to a modern standard as they possibly could.  The story and presentation are far more intelligently designed than the original, while still staying perfectly true to the established lore - not an easy feat, yet they accomplished it in spades.I can only surmise that all the backlash is coming from social media troll armies - no more, no less.  It's a good expansion with good writing - made for a game that I'm willing to admit is past its prime.			"

												Baldur's Gate has not aged well. The impenetrably poor 2nd Edition D&D ruleset makes the combat and exploration gameplay a complete chore. The game is left with no merit except for a story that starts incoherent, briefly touches on a mildly interesting conspiracy, and then abruptly ends. A handful of funny jokes and well-voiced companions isn't enough to overcome the shortcomings.			"

Dying as many times as you do in this game is evidence that the game designers didn't understand what they were doing when they built it. I don't feel like a hero when I play this game. And for me, that's a failure on the part of the game designers. Save yourself the headaches, new age players would be better off getting Dragon Age.			"

												Massive issues and bad graphice options.  Not much of a Enhanced edition.   I played the orginal back in the day and BG is a wonderful game.   This ...  EE version is not worht the money.  PLUS.  If you have a laptop and looking for a game to play on a older mechine ""on the go""  this is not it.  It doesnt run on allot of mechines with intergrated graphices chips (laptops and basic pcs)   so  you can wait your money buying this game and it wont work.  Its to bad.			"

												I have played and beaten the original Baldur’s Gate series. As one of my favorite games, I have replayed it several times and am quite familiar with everything. Thus I was excited for the EE series. It has several major issues/bugs; however, overall it is great game. The graphics and GUI are updated, which I find aesthetically pleasing. I especially like within the inventory it shows damage and armor changes when you pick up a piece of gear. The memorization interface is more crisp and modern feeling. The game is as difficult as I remember, but I only play on Core Rules, so I cannot speak about the harder modes.My main complaint about the game are the bugs. One of the biggest, is moving the screen will sometimes cause it to “lock” and it will auto-scroll into a corner and keep it there. The only way to stop it is go into a menu and exit it. This bug makes this game almost unplayable due to the fact you are popping into a menu every few minutes to resolve this bug. "

												Im sure this ould be an amazing game, if I could play it as the character I created. I created a Fighter/Mage/Cleric with a 91 stat roll, making most of the stat pretty even. However, in the tutorial, it gives me a weapon to equip. The weapon is a dagger. I cannot use daggers. There are no other weapons around that I can equip. Therefore I am stuck, unable to move forward. And it doesnt help that a guy, named after the device that holds up my pants, yelling at me every few seconds to equip the weapon he gave me, when it is quite clear that that is impossible. Screw you belt.			"

												Somehow I find the Legacy of Bhall difficulty unplayable, but the game is still good. Rats having over 50hp are insane, same with all small monsters. Even with amazing Armor Class you are bound to get rekt by the low level mobs rolling crits like crazy (I'm on 18 dex as Figther with 2 skill points in one hand style with Ankheg Plate on). I think that this difficulty should only improve the HP of the monsters, but not that much, not that much of luck. Core AD&D mobs like hobgoblins are squishy and they shouldn't be much tougher than decent hero. Running around with everything on your back to allow your archer to snipe them in 30 shots makes no sense, if you ask me. I will still finish the game on this difficulty, provided you fix the bug with difficulty change without reason. Dying on such difficulty is normal. Makes the game as hard as Dark Souls sometimes.

												The game is a classic and will engage RPG enthusiasts of every stripe. The Enhanced Edition brings some interface and quality of life improvements to the table, with some options to tune the game toward the classic AD&D experience if you're a hardcore player. The additional NPCs added to the game are not quite as memorable as the originals, but they are a nice addition, and I did particularly like Dorn Il-Khan.The new Siege of Dragonspear DLC fits the tone and story of the original excellently, and I would recommend anyone who enjoyed the original game to get it. I did get a somewhat railroady feeling from it in my playthrough as a villainous character, but the tropes and flow of the plot fit perfectly with the high fantasy of the rest of the series. It lacks a certain depth to make it truly remarkable, but it's certainly very enjoyable for any D&D fantasy fan.			"

												A classic CRPG that holds up well today. Modern gamers might find the difficulty a little uneven in places- being the first CRPG I really took the time to play through, this game absolutely destroyed me to the point of frustration on multiple occasions- but some preparation and careful planning make it a lot more managable. Stock up on arrows of dispelling!! Brushing up on your AD&D rules would probably help too.The story is simple to follow and a great place to get started on the lore of the world, which overall makes this a great starting point for anyone interested in playing DnD or getting into the genre as a whole. Despite some frustrations I really enjoyed my time with Baldur's Gate, and without a shred of nostalgia.			"

I liked it a tad less than IWD (with all of IWD's expansions).  But BG wins in the area of interpersonal relationships/feuds: good party mechanics and excellent writing!PROs:--  Classic D&D rules--  Satisfying RPG mechanics--  Caters to ""party of six""--  Well balanced, but challenging, game play--  Good art and battle effects--  Great story writing--  Enjoyable intra-party social banter--  Good replayabilityCONs:-- Not really a ""con,"" but I would have liked to have seen a larger variety of characters to add to the party; or the abilty to form your party entirely of your own engineered PCs, as you can in IWD.

												The Siege of Dragonspear DLC is Beamdog taking a big stride in its stewardship of the Baldur's Gate IP. The freedom to tell new stories and introduce new characters is a big job, and with SoD they've proven they can create some memorable and interesting characters that feel right at home in the Baldur's Gate world. Some classic characters are back (with very welcome voice work from old favorites), while the new characters manage to be distinctive. It's a welcome chapter that holds its own with the other entries in the series.			"

												I could see this being giant in the late 1990's.  It has a lot of depth, difficulty, and customization. The story path, freinds you choose, and type of char you pick makes each playthrough very different.That being said:  It is very dated, I had to MOD it to play it (kept crashing), and the controls are not a lot of fund.  Old school gamers with a lot of free time to learn and re-start will get a big kick out of it.... however I think I am spoiled.  I sucked at it, had to save/load a lot, and got to the point that I just kept dying and decided it was time to move on.  I can see this being someones Fav game of all time, but I can also see it being loathing.  Know your product and decide wisely if this is for you!

												This game has aged poorly.  Not because of the graphics, which are old school but fine due to a nice art style.  The starting difficulty is way too high for new players.  The tutorial is poorly done.  I could not find the basement and the final item to complete it.  Newsflash developers, tutorial is to help players learn the game, save the challenge for later.  Something is seriously wrong when you have to check online faqs just to get past the tutorial.By all accounts it is great if you somehow manage to get far enough.  I kept getting wiped out even on the easy skill level.Learning curves matter in games.  A good game for folks who have played the original version.  Or for masochists who play games like Dark Souls, another game ruined by sky high difficulty.			"

Along with Baldurs Gate, the disc also had a demo of Populace, and I played the snot out of that as well.Baldurs Gate is what got me into PC gaming as a child and started my illustrious career as a game-a-holic. A large and beautifully hand-drawn world with plenty of side quests and places to explore and find, Baldurs Gate is a fantastic story-driven or sandbox adventure game even for those NOT familar with the D&D world. With plenty of classes and character building options all set up in a easy to read format you can easily have fun even if you're new the genre. IMO one of the best rpg games ever made.

Just finished the game, and I can say now that I am VERY, VERY happy that I finally did try it. The game is nearly 20 years old now and it has held up extremely well. Great story, interesting characters, interesting locals, and lots of loot and the DnD system to go with it. Just finished the game and now I'm currently downloading Baldur's Gate 2 as I type this.

												I originally did not recommend this game because I was not able to run it on my computer (ATI video card). For reasons other than this game I changed my video card to NVidia and the game now runs in all its former glory from way, way back when I first played it (around late 90's). I must now absolutely recommend it. Regardless of how old this game is, its story line and game play are difficult to match by modern games. Besides, when is the last time you actually had to go on an adventure with a party? I cannot rave enough about Baldur's Gate - only caveat is this: make sure your video card is on the compatible list.			"

												Calling this game the ""Enhanced Edition"" is something of a misnomer. On the surface there doesn't appear to be much to differentiate it from the original game, besides a few cosmetic differences (someone actually complained about interface now having a blue border!) However, there are a number of changes that, in my opinion, do in fact add to the experience. Some of these, like having your enemy's health status in their tool-tip a la B♥♥♥♥re very useful (no more fighting tough enemies and wondering if you should save that last magic missile spell or use it and hope it wastes them). I wasn't that impressed with the new content (the Black Pits was fairly boring), though thankfully the new NPCs have been integrated into the storyline without too much jarring (I did use one of them as a means to some quick cash as they came with a couple of goodies that I sold for oodles of GPs).The main advantage of this game over the original (and the old Atari 4-in-1 boxed set I bought a little while ago) is that it runs very well on Windows 7 and despite the old graphics, doesn't feel like a nearly twenty-year-old game. The story is still one of the most engrossing in a game that I've come across; unlike later RPGs, I actually find myself caring when a party member dies (as opposed to Neverwinter Nights).Oh, and let's face it, I'll take any opportunity to spend some time listening to Jim Cummings as Minsc...

												Haven't beaten the game, but still really like it. GREAT entry level game for this isometric rpg genre.If you are curious about the game, go ahead and try it. Of course you need to know what to expect. Pausing the action to assign tasks to your party, looking for every NPC with a name, and lots of reading. Extensive UI adjustments like auto pause options, character and item highlighs when pressing tab, and adjustable font size seperate from resolution setting mean this game is very flexible and allows you to play comfortably.Only downside is I wish I had bought in bundle. Without Baldur's Gate 2 I can't experience the high level stuff.			"

												Note: I returned to this review to update it for clarity.TLDR Version: This game (minus Dragonspear which I did not purchase) is a good purchase for a newbie; Veterans (especially those who are not afraid of the gymnastics necessary to make the originals work on a newer system) don't need to buy.As a prologue: Playing through this game, I encountered multiple bugs which made quests unwinnable and froze the game. This frustration - and my return to the working Baldur's Gate Tutu (If you don't know what that is, you should probably buy this game) - definitely colored my following review.For the Review:This is a good purchase for a person who has never played Baldur's Gate and is willing to play an old-style AD&D (2nd Ed) campaign. It is intense and is probably too much for a person used to modern RPGs.For Veterans: It's cheaper, and more stable, to simply get Baldur's Gate (with Tales of the Sword Coast), and Baldur's Gate 2 (with Throne of Bhaal) and mod them. While I love bioware, and *did* gladly pay again, unless you've never played either of the games and are afraid of the modding scene just avoid this game, it's not worth your time.P.S. The long and the short of it is: If you do not want to do the surgery necessary to mod BG, then I guess this is an acceptable substitute. But the original game, with mods, is superior this one. The game is solid, but buggy, and even with the additional areas and NPC quests, does not feel like a separate outing. Maybe the Siege DLC gives it added clout... but I'm not convinced that this is worth a separate purchase unless you've never played BG before and are uncomfortable with the modding community.			"

												As a digital DnD embodiment, it's perfect. As a computer role-playing game, it has many flaws. The world is empty, the characters are flat, the storytelling... huh, what's a storytelling? I love difficult and hardcore games, but this one is just too boring and not worth the efforts, though it is classic indeed.			"

The game cant progress past the opening cinematic , there was no mention of bugs or issues present prior to purchase, and then in the 1/25 chance that it does progress past the opening cinematic, when playing a game if the player needs to rest, the result is a stuttering freezing half picture followed by a crash. I've also yet to receive any support from Beamdog. Not worth the frustration, let alone 20$. Dont waste your money.			"

												I thought that purchasing the enhanced edition of BG would actually end up being a positive. In fact it was a mistake. There's no reason to purchase this overpriced version of the game when you can easily purchase BG I & II from GOG, follow the directions on the mod page and update the games to run in 1920 x 1080 with cut content restored as well as plenty of fan-pleasing additions. This was just a pathetic cash grab. Unfortunately as a BG fan I fell for it.Constant screen glitches, unresponsive controls, the addition of one ridiculous arena mode and a lack of additional content remove any value from this edition. It actually runs worse than the GOG versions of the originals properly modified and updated for current-gen hardware.TL;DR : Overpriced re-release. Buying BG I & II for less at GOG and following the instructions for properly modifying the games will give you greater enjoyment - for less money - than this garbage.			"

												There is much to like in this game.  Though Baldur/s gate is about twenty years old in my mind it still holds up. I have a lot of fun playing it.   There are thing to like about the game, like you can now create a whoile party in single player mode.but there still unresolved problens, at least in my game.  For instance if you are playing an Elven Mage/ rogue you do notnhave the ability to cast spells, so in effect you have a rogue that rises more slowly and has fewer hit points,I just rose a claric to third level and to my surprise no second lever spells.  I do not know if this  hols true to msages as well but it might.When my party goes into an inn and rent a room nothing happens.  No time goes by, nobody gets rested and no hip points are restored.   You have to leave town and camp out in the woods for that to happen.When I go into a temple I can not buy anything.  Things and services are there to buy but the 'Buy' button does not work.   You can not buy any potions, and services, like 'Raise Dead.'  That means that if one of your party dies, if you want to keep him you have to refight the battle again.These are only the problems I have noted.  There might be more.  On the other hand no body else have noticed these flaws so that might only occur on my computer.  But until the flaws are removed from my game I can not reccomd the game.			"

												It's extremely depressing that this supposed ""Enhanced Edition"" isn't actually enhanced.Everything looks the same, only made clear (which, my video card did already...) and the problems that were in the original Baldur's Gate remain completely untouched.Sure, there's a tournament mode put in, but you could have easily downloaded the mod (or one similar) for Black Pits.Literally another cop-out resale of a classic.Not worth the money, unless it's dirt cheap on sale and you enjoy the Baldur's Games (or hardcore dungeon crawlers).

I encountered a handful of bugs of varying severity. I took the time to report them on the forums. Within two month they've been fixed. Credit where credit is due, beamdog listens to feedback that's presented reasonably and constructively.My advice, wait a month or two to pick up the game if you're on the fence and don't want to play something that feels like early access, but they are working on it.

Its rich with quality content; a role-player’s dream. It has an awesome modding community which adds lots of great content. In fact I wish the developers of this remake had implemented some of these mods. As far as the new content goes the developers fixed a lot of the bugs from the original game, but added new quests that are rather buggy. They also added a short campaign called the Black Pits which is a lot of fun, but be warned it is quite difficult. "

												One of the best true RPG games ever made. My only true negative is that you cannot run.... takes a while to walk everywhere. Other than that, love this gamePlayed many hours of this game when it originally came out. I always wanted to play D&D but most of my friends were not into it. So when I got my hands on this I just loved itNow as the Enhanced edition with a new expansion its even better.I do wish there was more of a character role playing. It seems as there are always 3 options, good, evil, or just trying to make money. Also, the lack of explanation of spells and abilities can be annoying. I had to go online multiple times to get a better explanation of how a spell works or whatever it was. If you have a good understanding of D&D you will probably be ok.			"

												this is a good game, dudepros:tons of content- i played in the fast lane and beat it in 40 hours, and that's plenty for 20 bucks, but there's tons more quests out there that i haven't even done yetstrategy- i played on easy and even cheated a little (sorry) and the combat encounters still had enough variety and challenge that it was necessary to plan out my moves whether i was fighting kobolds or big scary demonschoice- this game relies heavily on dialogue options for most of the decisions you make, but it's not hurt by that. the options are well thought out and smart, and there's hardly ever a moment where the thing you want to say isn't listed there. or at least, that's how it was for me. the decisions are also really challenging- they feel meaningful and they really force you to think them through. this has you feeling like you're really blazing your own trail.customization- there are a lot of cool options for making characters and cool gear to suit them up in, so you really feel like your character is your own creation and kicks butt.fun cast of characters- there's an option to create your entire party at the beginning of the game. it's a cool feature, but i'd urge you not to do that, since the NPC companions are so much more fun to have in your party and they add an extra story element and they all have their own little character arcs. i got a big kick out of seeing how my party members interacted with each other and me as went through the adventures and suchart- i think this game really benefits from the isometric 3d style. there's so much detail packed into the dungeons and castles and houses and forests which, paired with the lore and stories spread generously across the world, really creates a feeling that this place is alive and realcons:slow start- the story takes a while to pick up and make sense, and you don't even meet the guy behind everything until near the ending (and the only thing you hear about him through the rest of the game is that ""there's somebody behind all of this""). inventory tetris- the game has so many items that you're gonna have to shuffle items around a bunch, and you'll have to sell a bunch, and drop a bunch. i didn't mind this so much, it was kinda fun trying to decide who needed what the most, and having to make critical decisions of either dropping the magic sword or the really nice armor, but if you're not into that kinda thing, this might make for some dull momentsmusic- i hate to say it, but the music in here can be kinda lackluster. there's a limited number of songs, and at some point you get kinda tired of hearing the same three inn songs over and over. you'll also hear the main theme all the friggin time, it's worked into most of the soundtrack. it's cool for a little while, but i found myself wanting more variety.ajantis- won't stop saying helm. calm down dude. even helm is getting tired of hearing his name so much. however, if you time his commands properly, you can get him to say ""helm yes!"" which is pretty cool i guessnoober- how about now?overall 9/10 pretty heckin good game, you really feel like you're getting your own experience here, and the world is built around you doing just that. i'm a fan. bought the sequel. will probably buy the expansions and icewind dale too.

												As a Dungeons and Dragons player I loved this game. Loved getting to try out the different classes and cross off all the quests. Hours of game play. Was never able to get the multiplayer working though.			"

												I first played this game in the early 2000's i quickly fell in love with some of the quirky comments of some of the NPC's. The only problem i have with this game is the rng can be a little brutal for beginners...and which of the many colorful companions to include in my party(Minsc!) i highly recommend this game.			"

												Old School With Great High end Graphics, This is the Mother of all RPG's. BlackIsle Started this with one of the greatest Storys and adventures in PC game play & this is still the RPG game everybody tries to stand up to when they build an RPG. This is still one great adventure that is never ending. I have played it all the way through more than 200 times and I still discover new things. This was followed by Tails of the Sword Coast & then BG II when it got even bigger and better. Now or comming in 2016 there is a 3rd edition that is set between BG and BGII this game series will last for eons as the best of the best in RPG The Forgotten Realms Sword Coast and dungeon crawling adventuring. I origanally paid over $120.00 for this series and now I bought it for around $10.00 for the first story so I can play on windows 10 Thanks to Steam.I give Baldur's Gate and all the expansions 10 out of 10 and I believe it should be rated even Higher as Best series ever!!!

												The mark used to measure all RPG games, including BG2 which is the only one that exceeded.Awesome game with a competent implementation on one of the most controvese, complex, gratifing and rewarding game system, the AD&D.Don't loose the chance to play THE GAME that set the mark.I'm going to try the solo mode now, after so many gameplays, just cuz the Pillars of Meiocrity failed to deliver any decent experience and just gave me the taste in the mouth.This game will be replayed, over and over, over the decades.The enhanced version is a very nice rework including very well need UI improvements.

												I played the original Baldur's Gate when if first came out years ago.  When the Enhanced Edition came out I was hesitant about picking it up since I've ""been there, done that"" with the original.One day it came on sale and I said, ""what the heck.""It's the same insanely fun game - yet different.  The new characters you can bring to the party, the UI changes, the graphical tweaks all make this a refreshing update.  It's not worth the price of admission, however, unless you can set aside any zealotry you might harbor for the original.  As I said, it's the same game - but it is different.  Hardcore purists will be outraged, perhaps.Overall, I am very pleased that Beamdog brought this classic back to us.  The original was an insane amount of fun and they didn't screw that up.  Maybe I'm not as overly passionate about my classic originals as others, but I still enjoy this game.There are not enough D20 ruleset games to be had.Pros:* Same Baldur's Gate* ""Go for the eyes, Boo!  Go for the eyes!  RAAAAARGH!""* ""Heyya, it's me.  Imoen.""* ""My hotel's as clean as an Elven ar*e.""* Fighter/Mage is still powerfulCons:* The journal is terrible (at least in the update I'm running)* Dynaheir is still useless* Fighter/Mage is still powerful* Some may find the graphics dated (and they are - the game first came to us in 1997)			"

												I understand that there is some controversy surrounding Baldur's Gate: EE and the newly-released expansion Siege of Dragonspear. However, if you're expecting this review to address any of the ongoing nonsense, you're going to be very disappointed. Instead I'm going to focus entirely on Baldur's Gate 1. I've just finished a play-through of the Enhanced Edition, and barring some very minor issues, it was a thoroughly solid experience. I didn't play multiplayer or use mods either, which apparently saved me from a lot of headaches.Moving on...Baldur's Gate is a fine RPG, but it's also an acquired taste. The story is interesting in that you don't get a sense of how high the stakes are, until towards the very end of the game. The vast majority of the game's content is optional. You're either exploring dozens of forests and mountainous regions, or you're in extremely claustrophobic dungeons with narrow hall-ways. In order to progress the story, you have to explore not one but TWO iron-ore mines. There's also a serious kobold problem. The little buggers multiply like rabbits. Durlag's Tower - the prime piece of real estate in the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion - is an annoying slog due to the hundreds of traps. The intro dungeon to Baldur's Gate 2 gets a lot of flack, but I think it's far more compelling than any of BG1's dungeons. BG1 also epitomizes early AD&D. Your chances of survival are incredibly low, and you don't have many options to work with. For example: Mages are far better at debilitating enemy parties rather than nuking them. Pretty much everyone in your party needs a ranged-weapon for the first couple hours. Even then, you'll be lucky to defeat a pack of wolves or a couple ogres. You won't have a chance against beholders, dragons, or anything else that's actually cool. Overall, it's next to impossible to play this game after BG2, it's like going from a phoenix to a duck.But you know what? There's something oddly interesting about the humble beginnings. In a game like BG1, starting off with absolutely nothing can be pretty neat. It really gives players a sense of where they stand in the world, when they have to struggle to deal with seemingly everyday encounters. Upon starting this adventure, you and your party are just a pack of losers, and the quests you take on reflect that. While the real heroes are out saving the Forgotten Realms, you're rescuing cats and resolving disputes among commoners. It's actually refreshing, but I think that's mainly because I've been spoiled by more recent games. You know the kind, where you start of at level ""awesome"" and eventually hit level ""most awesome"". Baldur's Gate 1 was designed to set players up for bigger adventures, and they didn't take any shortcuts. I have to respect that.I also think that the ""world"" of Baldur's Gate consisting mostly of generic forests and mountains helps with the role-playing aspects. There are times when I like to build a party of my own created-characters, and not rely on pre-made NPCs with their own storylines. Sometimes really detailed locations can get in the way of the role-play, because you're expecting to have certain heroes in the party, in order to ""properly"" experience the adventure. There's enough freedom in this game for both styles of partying.The combat can benefit from a lack of options. Winning some encounters can involve tactical positioning, or knowing who to target. Sometimes all it takes is for the mage to be killed, or knowing that a deadily basilisk can be undone with a level one spell. It's sounds so quaint, but I think that understanding the basics is really helpful in the long run. This is something that isn't really communicated in the sequel, partly due to the expectation that you're familiar with BG1 and AD&D. I spent far too much of my time in Amn, relying on summoned polar bears and fire-elementals. Maybe when I get around to playing through Baldur's Gate 2 again, I'll have more confidence in attempting different strategies.The main point I'm trying to get across is that while Baldur's Gate 1 has aged, it has done so with a little grace. It's not quite wine, but it certainly isn't milk. Even the doldrums that are early-level AD&D can be entertaining in the right mindset. The open-nature of the Sword Coast, allows players a lot of freedom to explore at their leisure. You're going to run into some encounters that are most-likely beyond your current abilities, but when you gather the tools or develop the skills necessary to overcome them, then it's pretty rewarding.To its credit, the Enhanced Edition includes a number of options that mitigate the more annyoing elements of the original game. While I'm not too keen on some additions such as the pop-up journal entries and newer events/characters being fully-voiced, the core game is handled very well.Although, I should mention that I have a Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 box-set, and I have no plans for getting rid of it no matter how Enhanced these Editions get.

												It's a good game.   (currently playing 2.1 patch)The expansion is fun, and I like the new characters,  They fit in with the world.The new menus are different from the original game, but they're not bad.  They just take some getting used to is all. They've grown on me.The main reason I like it though, is there are some ease of use things that just rock such as spells having a green background if it's a spell you don't yet have memorized.  This means you don't have to open every doggone scroll to see if it's one you you've already got.  Then, if you click it to pick it up in inventory, it highlights the characters in your party that don't yet have it memorized, that can memorize it.  The same goes for weapons and armor. Add to that, the modding community is still quite active.  Wiedu for the win!  (Now if only ""Level 1 NPCs"" was updated to account for the new content.)I've been playing this game longer than most of the negative reviewers have been alive, and I think it's only getting better.  This is a good game, and it's worth your time and money.			"

												I played the original a million years ago, back when my hair wasn't quite so gray.  Loved it then, and loved it now.  Even with the ancient graphics, the game was better than many current-gen games.  Lots of depth, great storyline, and little random humourous bits here and there.The *only* complaint I have is with the NPC pathing logic.  It will drive you completely insane sometimes, especially in dungeons.  My characters would just randomly decide to ignore me, and go wandering off into the dungeon trying to find their own personal ""shortcut"" or whatever.  If you've never played this game before, you should try it.  It really is a classic for a reason.			"

												The original was one of the best RPGs ever made. The enhanced edition simply enhances the experience. Lots of people have complained about the latest patch, and how the UI changes are less intuitive, especially the journal. This is simply a matter of opinion - I simply love the new look, and actually bother to use the journal now. In the past the journal was but a jumbled mess of notes here and there.The game is relatively cheap, and is one of those games every self-respecting gamers should play. Try it now.			"

I bought this game hoping to co-op it with my friends, but none of them buy games and I'm always left to end up playing stuff like this on my own making it harder and less fun than it should be.But besides that, it reminded me of the original Diablo game, except you had to control multiple characters in battle at once, choosing what to attack them with, what skill, what movement, and also look at what the enemy is firing and at your parties health points. WAY too much s*it to do at once. Constantly died, didn't enjoy it in general.4/10 "

And the new Quick Loot feature is priceless.This one is a tried-n-true timeless classic.			"

												iPad version brought to PC.1. Scroll-tips and mouse cursors aren't zoom-agnostic. When i zoom-in i'd like to have a larger mouse cursor, like it was in classic BG.When i hover mouse cursor over a character, or monster/animal - scroll-tip should be larger, font on this scroll should be larger too, once again, like it was in classic BG.2. Issues with sound - you'll have to turn down sound hardware acceleration to play sounds properly.3. Developer has it's own shop - (Beamdog). So this in-house shop get's patches waaay faster than steam. Current steam version patch is 1.2.0000. Before it's release there were 8 month of no support to steam version.4. Community on the official forum is not friendly. Any critics (and believe me, if you're an old-school BG fan, you'll get lots of it)  will be got as an offense.Overall, game doesn't look solid, if you aks me. Some things were enhanced, some not, some - crippled due to iPad conversion.Also, keep in mind, Steam version won't get SteamPlay - if you need Mac version you have to buy it from Beamdog shop (yep it's exclusive to them).I've seen this game in a pre-1.2.0000 patch state. Believe me - it was horrible; i asked steam support for refund, but they refused. If you need details - here's my profile on official forums, and all bug-reports i've sent them (before 1.2.0000): http://forum.baldursgate.com/profile/discussions/28923/ArchmagePlayed it (pre-1.2.0000 and current 1.2.0000) for less than 1 hour and i don't feel i want to play it at all. PS: ""Enhanced"" edition of the game adds homosexual (gay) characters, and has according sexual themes/dialogues associated with them (Dorn and Hexxat). Just wanted to warn you if it offends you or might offend your children.TL;DR:Not recommended. Get GOG or Amazon version of Classic BG instead.			"

Posted: April 22, 2016
												This is a review of BG:EE without the DLC.First and foremost, the original Baldur's Gate is a monument of RPG that withstood the test of time because of brilliant storytelling and mostly accurate D&D ruleset (2nd edition, which in essence is the same as every D&D standard ruleset ever). If you never played Baldur's Gate and want to try a classic RPG, do not hesitate and get it. A game that stood proud for nearly 20 years with nice graphics (because of the isometric 3D) is a no brainer.Then Enhanced Edition added compatibility for linux, steam, easier access to modding and some content in the form of additionnal characters with their own sidequests (some very good, some just ok). There is also an arena-style additionnal short campaign, but it's mostly irrelevant (it's nice that it's there. Some fun dialogue options but nearly 0 story element). So, all is fine and dandy.However, when the extension Siege of Dragonspear launched, the game was updated to 2.0 (and 2.1 shortly after). This update consisted in an engine/UI update. Now that thing are settled a bit, I will say that the game lost a bit in charm but gained a bit in modernity: -: health bars are modern and usefull, but damn they are ugly.-: contextual info can be globalized, but damn it's ugly now.-: inventory has moar stats, but damn is it... no actually it is still nice. Still uglier than before though ;)-: spellbooks are still buggy and terribly ugly.-: character info sheet is definitely better than before.-: cancel/confirm buttons are inconsistently placed, which is disorienting at first. But you get used to it after 5-10 hours.Overall, all this is minor details though.Sadly, there is a bit more. 2.0 / 2.1 made several mods incompatible with the game. For a game which is nearly 20 years old, this means that a fair share of old mods may never work again with the game which nullifies a major selling point of the enhanced edition.Additionnally, multiplayer is having major gamebreaking issues. For now, you should consider this game as soloplayer only. I think most players would play solo anyway, but it's always a shame to see a neat functionnality broken in one day just like that.To sum it up:-: Grandiose RPG who stands proudly among the giants of RPG: Dragon Age, Fallout, The Witcher, Oblivion, FF VI... If you like RPG and don't know it: get it. No questions asked.-: The enhanced edition tag is worth some quests, compatibility and steam access. Minor UI changes (slightly negative overall, but details are details).-: Huge red flag risen for Beamdog developpers for breaking multiplayer, breaking some mods, unfortunate art design choices (sadly for them, BG was an extremely polished game so the smallest mistake just jumps out at you and gnaw your eyes out faster than any hamster ever will) and questionable conduct toward community of players (just trust me on that. Don't open the can of mutated carrion crawlers).			"

												I remember playing the original Baldur's Gate on my old Packard Bell way back in high school, so when I saw this Enhanced edition on sale for just $5 I had to jump on it. 31 hours of playtime later, I finished it again. I thought this was an excellent update to the original and included some nice graphical enhancements that makes it look and work better on a modern PC.The ONLY bugs I encountered were with the journal system, as it did not always update correctly. This made completing some quests difficult because it wouldn't show you the last bit of text telling you where to go or who to speak with. Luckily, there are plenty of online resources to help with this sort of thing so it wasn't such a big deal.In the end, is it worth picking up? Absolutely! It's still one of the best RPG's ever made and the sheer diversity of gameplay make it rather amazing. With the combination of spells and abilities, you have so many different options as to how to approach battles and it's definitely way more than just another Diablo-like click-and-kill kind of game. It really helps if you've played D&D before and know a little about the classes and their abilities.			"

												It may be old, but I got a lot of joy out and entertainment out of this game. I'm replaying it again so I can be ready for the new Seige of Draponspear DLC.(Update) There were a lot of complaints about SoD,  apparently because a writer decided to make a social statement and included a transgender character. But honestly, that was such a tiny fragment of the DLC I suspect people that complained have an issue with something besides the writing. Anyways, I think it's a terrific DLC. I've enjoyed meeting all the old characters again, and hearing their voices. Overall I like the updates to the UI, though I have encountered a few minor bugs. I think it's a good story and I enjoyed playing this.			"

												This is something I should get used to I guess. My review of a game changing with the patches that come out for it.When this came out I was disappointed. Now, touching it again after time and many patches, I'm really impressed.I wish they had found and reused the original artist hi-res backgrounds and sprites to enhance the game instead of blurring it to increase resolution, but appart from that, great job beamdog!

												I had never played this before. I'd heard friends talk about it, and I love the Dragon Age games, so I finally decided to give it a try. The D&D 3.5 rules took some getting used to, but this game is awesome. Looking forward to Dragon spear, BG2, and Icewind Dale.			"

												Great update of the classic. Not sure what others are complaining about - my experience has been crash-free, bug-free, and very entertaining. If you have a religious devotion to the original Baldur's Gate, then maybe this game isn't for you. But it's a well-designed RPG, the story is entertaining, and I'm looking forward to the new version of BG II.			"

												This game is just something every RPG or PnP-Player should enjoy.At first it might be quite clunky which is understandble considering this a very old game.But after getting used to it having a complex system offers a lot of options and thus very extended gameplay.The ""Enhanced""-remaster doesnt add alot in fact it removed some cutscenes which isnt that bad but it made the game playable on newer machines with some little additions, which is great.While there is a main goal, there's a vast world to explore and interact in any way you like to.The DnD-System this Game uses is rather complicated and a lot more difficult than newer versions or even Pathfinder, so to understand all the numbers you might need to do some research.This is not even all but just some aspects about the game, it wont hurt trying this out as it is very cheap.So have fun rerolling your stats for 100hours to get the max			"

YouTube™ Video: Baldur's Gate e1: The Quest Begins!

			Baldur's Gate Episode 1. Some things happen, and some people may not make it out alive. Where else can you find me? Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/NMEplays Game Link:...		

This, and Baldur's Gate II were my introduction to a more open world RPG when they first came out.  They give you the freedom to explore the world at your pace, interact with a diverse cast of characters, and choose the route you wish to take to the end.  Some of those things may seem pretty standard for some games now, but it was beyond brilliant back then.  Best of all, the game still holds up today.  The story is engaging, the dialogue is interesting and at times hilarious, and the world feels alive around you.I believe I picked this game up on a sale for about $5, but it's well worth the normal $20 as well if you're not willing to wait for a sale.

												Great game, great expansion and to those screaming about how awful it is to have trans people talk about being trans in a game you really need to get your close minded bigoted selves out of my games. You call people who appreciate diversity “social justice warriors” as if it's an insult but that is a label I'm happy to wear if it means more inclusivity and diversity in my games. And if your upset because they changed the original, than play the original not this. You can still buy it, I own a copy and love it. I'm sick of hearing people cry through their rose tinted glasses about how someone changed the game in an enhanced edition, obviously they changed it that's why it's the enhanced edition not just a re-release of the same game. If you want to play the original, go ahead buy it and play it. If you want to play the original with a number of nice ui fixes/upgrades, some cool new characters and pieces to the story, and an awesome expansion than this is the game for you.ps. There are some bugs that I wish they would get around to fixing this is not a perfect game but it is a really good one and worth picking up and playing. I loved this game when the original came out and I love this version now and I hope to see many more games like this new enhanced edition coming from Beamdog. Keep up the great work and ignore the people blinded by nostalgia or their own bigoted minds that can only deal with sexuality and gender as long as it is their own sexuality and gender.			"

												The option to create a full party in single player is money. I Just started a new game with my DLC purchase and plan on going all the way through. I've played since Vanilla BG and have over 1000 hours all games combined and I'm not dissapointed in anything thats been done by Beamdog. I'm in Chapter 4 of the first game and the changes are nothing drastic and are nice imo. I'm looking forward to the dlc. I highly recommend.			"

												I'm a big fan of Baldur's Gate 2 so i decided to finally try this one. To say i was dissapointed is an understatement. I seriously question the wisdom of starting at level 1. A level one character in 2nd edition dies quicker than a mayfly with progeria. You're basically shoehorned into playing a fighter or cleric, as thieves have so little HP a swift breeze will kill them, and mages have the same problem with worse AC but have the insignificant bonus of a single 1st level spell. The combat is pretty bad because of this. becuase of your lack of strategic options, battles are decided by the most lopsided RNG I have ever seen. You cant use cleric spells because you need to use all of your slots for heals as taking more than one hit is certain death, and your mages cant cast more than one spell per rest, and stealth characters are near worthless becuase if you fail a roll, and you absolutely will four out of five times, getting discovered means instant death every enemy is instantaneously and perfectly aware and has already fired seventeen trillion arrows into each of  your orifices. Im not joking. I tried to use Imoen to scout ahead and find traps she got found by kobolds and thunk thunk thunk she was dead in less than half a second.BG2 was certainly difficult and in many areas downright cheap, but you had options. you could try different spells or different buffs, different weapons and equipment, Here no such luck if those wild dogs mysteriously all made a save against your sleep spell prepare for melee and probably reload after agonizing reload until you have suffered long enough for the dice roller to reach ♥♥♥♥♥♥, then you will finally survive losing half your party and be allowed some paltry amount of progress, only to have your party wiped out by a bear that is clearly constructed from adamantium.I wanted to like this game, but it is simply not fun to play. The dialogue and character development that i loved in Baldur's Gate 2 are not present here, but the plot was interesting enough. however the tedious combat with fighters who could not hit the broad side of a barn from inside the barn with a barn of equal size,  thieves who couldn't sneak their way around a deaf bat, and wizards who cannot do more than fart in the general direction of an enemy without needing an 8 hour nap afterwards. IT just makes it too tedious to want to continue.If i had to sum this game up in a single sentence, I would say that It's a well made game but is just not fun to play.			"

												This was a game I was introduced to when i was young by a brother and we all had alot of fun planning stuff out for it. I love this game and suggest it because alot of fixes have been made from the origonal. although alot of people say most of those fixes can be found online i for one like to have it all in one place. for those people who are familier with this game the EE edition does not add much more then some new NPC's, enought updates to the graphics to run on modern systems and alot of bug fixes. do not expect a massive change in graphics they wanted to preserve the old feel which i feel was a wise move on their part.for new comers, this is a old 90's really early 2000's game, no the graphics are not updated and some of the steam suggestesions claiming this game to be similar may be a tad off. if you find intrest you are welcomed here into the BG community but please do your reserch and understand what you are getting yourself into. this game is not like many others i've seen. the rules are second eddition D&D rules, these are largely outdated and a bit unorthadox if you have not seen them before.I love this game and would suggest it to many people.last bit the price is a bit much for the game, if you are crazy like myself you will find that you will keep building characters and not completting the game and have over 150 hours plus, if you look at it in the long haul $20 for a game that you will virtualy keep with you forever is nice but most people would want this cheeper, if you have the pacenice to wait then the game is certianly worth it on sale.

												The baldurs gate series is one of the gems of the 90s but to truly appreciate the full story one should experience both games. The orignal Baldurs gate was at it's release n 1998 quite a big thing as it was the very first game to use the famous infinity engine. So in a way one can thank the original baldurs gate for other games such as icewind dale and Planescape Tormnent.The game was so incredibly good for it's time not only because it used a remarkable new engine, but because it was the very first game to really give you a true dungeons and dragons experience in  a gaming enviorment. The orignal game was extremly good and rare for it's time. The way you could chose different paths, be truly bad or good, having so many uniqe and different dialouge options and events was breathtaking back in 1998. Heck, the game gives you more freedom than most other rpgs released even to this dayI loved the game back in my early teens and now in my 20s i still love the game, because it was an incredibly important stepping stone. The way the sequel followed up on this beauty was incredibly impressive. When I have talket to people who want to play the Baldurs Gate saga I always recommend starting with the origianl story since the games are heavily connected. And even though I feel that Baldurs Gate 2 is a superior game there's just something beautyfull about the game that started it all. If your going to play it now and you come from games like divinity or pillars of eternity, you have to understand that the baldurs gate games are quite higher on the difficulty setting.It also uses the old D&D THACo system which you really need to know because it's one of the most important stats in the game. the easiest way to put it is that the lower the number the better. it can be a very hard game at times, but it's because of its difficulty compared to modern games, that killing a boss actually feels incredibly rewarding.

												It is really hard to not recommend this, as I would count Baldur's Gate as my favorite game of all time. So while I am not recommending you buy Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, I am still wholeheartedly recommending you get Baldur's Gate, as it is absolutely incredible. If you have never played Baldur's Gate, go to GoG or somewhere and buy the original game. I have easily sunk 200 hours into the original game, back when it required swapping multiple CDs. Only buy this if it is a last resort and you absolutely cannot play Baldur's Gate any other way, as even here it is incredible. But buy the original elsewhere, and not this.   There is really so little work they needed to do to this to make it great. If it was absolutely unchanged it would still be incredible, but sadly the changes they've made are for the worse. There are still stability issues which I don't get with the GoG version, but the most notable problem is the cinematics. In the original Baldur's Gate, you would get these beautiful (for the time) cut scenes of the area you were entering. The opening cinematic has been replaced with a far worse attempt to recreate it, and most areas have nothing more than a brief glance at the area. The cinematics created such a great feeling of the area you were aout to enter, in nashkel, beregost and the gnoll stronghold, that removing them seriously dents the game experience. The game of Baldur's Gate itself is as glorious as ever, but this is simply not the best way to play it. It isn't the revamped experience that was promised. It is apparantly possible, with some modding, to get the game back to normal, cinmatics and all, but it seems very backwards to have to do that just to undo the changes that are the supposed selling points of this 'enhanced' game.

												This has been one of my favorite games since it's initial release back in 1998. The story, gameplay, and exploration are excellent. I like how most treasures and encounters are hand-placed, and while this can take some from the replay value, it adds a sense of reality to the world. Too often in games where loot is randomly generated, what I find is out of place or contradicts what the NPCs are telling me.The Enhanced Edition adds many great improvements. One of my favorite improvements recently added is Story Mode. While I try to play the entire game without going into Story Mode, I don't have a lot of time to play, so I don't like fighting difficult battles 10+ times. Story Mode allows you to advance the story by making your party unkillable in combat.			"

												Almost everyone interested in this will know that Baldur's Gate is a great game. I agree, but that's not what what this brief review is about.The important thing is that Balur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a greater game. Hard to admit for BG fans, I know, but it's true.I myself used to think that the enhanced edition was solely based on the success of the original game, but after playing it, I can witness that the enhancements that were made, while doing an amazing job of preserving the original game's overall style and feel, are indeed worth buying - even for someone who owns the original game already (as I do).With fewer bugs, additional content, proper widescreen support (let's face it: the existing mods were nice attempts, but in the end not fun to play with) and overhauled everything, this is definitely worth your money and your time! And then I shouldn't forged the Siege of Dragonspear DLC, which managed to overcome my expectations (I hadn't thought that it might be as good as the original content. Turned out it was - and in some places, possibly even better).And then there's Tiax. He rules all.Have fun playing!			"

												Baldur's Gate before is a good game.  And this supposibly makes it better.... aside from the obvious outlines which weren't needed until we highlight people.  After playing a bit of the story mode, then followed by a friend and family session in the multiplayer, it is actually quite good.  A small bug in the multiplayer happens when you first try to enter, but after the second time or so you'll fully be in the game.  Bugs aside, the story is still there and there's an additional story too.  I tried a little bit of the new story, but I'd much prefer the original game, so I stopped that one until I beat the original game.All in all, the game is good.  It's not perfect, but good.  That's all.			"

												I am personally well pleased by this enhanced edition of Baldur's Gate. I also bought Dragonspear and BGII. I am playing on Linux and never had any issue so far. Please take the time to look at the Graphics and Gameplay options. A lot of negative comments I've read about this game here can be fixed by simply turning On or Off some options in the game.Some Highlights of what I like:- I like the new revamped UI. There is a more modern and gloomy feel to it, which I prefer.- Journals entries now pop-ups and are way better organized than before. These can be disabled if one does not want them.- In-built widescreen and high resolution display is great. I advise you to enable ""Zoom Lock"" for a crisper display experience.- It is now possible to use missile weapons in quick slots even with a weapon equipped in the off-hand! I can play a two-weapon rogue-fighter that can conveniently switch to a short bow in BG1, this is epic.- Legacy of Bhaal difficulty change completely the pace of the game and is fun to play.Honestly, I wouldn't be able to go back and play vanilla BG1 and 2 on Windows after playing the EE on Linux. Great job Beamdog and thank you for revisiting this great game and adding new original content to the saga. Brings a lot of good old times and memories back. I hope there is more to come.			"

												The original Baldur's Gate is one of my favourite games of all time. A huge world with plenty of engaging characters, tough challenges, great dialogue, and tonnes of replayability. It's a game I've played once or twice a year since I first bought it ten years ago. This Enhanced Edition is a mostly improved version of that game, so of course I recommend it to anyone looking for a great game. The game has been improved graphically, multiplayer has been modernized, and extra content has been added. The additional content mostly matches the feel of the original Baldur's Gate, and anything that you don't like is easily ignored.  Generally speaking, bugs have been fixed, though there are still some minor ones present. Bugs are going to be present in any version of Baldur's Gate due to all of the complexity and variables. Fortunately, Beamdog is still releasing patches to fix what they can. Most of the mods for Baldur's Gate have been updated to work with the Enhanced Edition as well, so there's very little reason to play the original over the Enhanced Editions.			"

												Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a slightly upgraded version of the original iteration. It hasn't changed much but the biggest upgrade for me was that the game doesn't need DosBox to work and runs smoothly on my Win7. Some might argue that buying from GoG.com and modding the ♥♥♥♥ out of it is a better choice but I don't find that an argument good enough.First of all I don't like modding in any form and wish to play the game as the devs intended in the first place. Secondly I delete and redownload my games on a whim and installing mods (and remembering what I was supposed to install) every time doesn't feel like a thing I enjoy. There are some new characters and missions + other small additions to the game but those didn't change the gameplay much and luckily didn't break the lore that is still fantastic. BG1:EE is hard as it should be. If you enter an area too early you will be crushed instantly. If you don't prepare for each bigger fight you will be crushed. If you don't quick save you will be crushed unded frustration. That last sentence is the only downfall of BG but that's the way games worked back then. Besides modding there's no real reason to NOT buy BG:EE on Steam.			"

												I just have to review this because of all these idiots coming out of the woodwork after the April 1 updates. Esentially what they did on April 1 is release a brand new DLC (Which also has terrible reviews under it.) and update Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2 with a plethora of improvements and modernizations. The updates improved the game DRAMATICALLY, but of course to improve you also have to change, and as we all know, change is scary. The reviews which are at the time of writing shown as the most ""helpful"" are rather brainless expressions of shock at multiple changes of the UI and graphics. Before said updates, the game was was similar to how it was on it's original release, and it aged TERRIBLY. The NPC and creature models looked terrible, blending into the background to the point where you couldn't click on them right, the pause screen was a terrible mess, spells and effects were barely visible, opening a journal or fidning any sort of information was difficult and painful, you could never tell how far away a creature is from dying so any form of strategy was nigh impossible without full understanding of the game mechanics and complicated UI setup. Esentially, it was an unplayable mess for any modern gamer. I myself, who thinks the more complicated the better, and who usually gets into old games with ease, also found it very difficult to get any enjoyment out of the game, to the point where I completely gave up on it. Then, they updated it, and suddenly nearly all the issues were solved. The characters were given a black lining around the model, letting you actually see animations and giving you a contrast between the background, something that is supposed to look like an ogre can actually be humanly indentified as an ogre now! Whenever you complete or progress a quest the journal entry that your character writes pops up on the screen for a few seconds (Letting you pause the game via space bar and read it, if you so desire.) whereasin before you had to press Escape, click on your Journal, click on the right quest then click on the right part of the quest and then attempt to find the new entry just for a little comment given by your character. Character profiles now display more information, health bars are now shown above creature heads letting you actually know when something is about to die, difficulty options were added for more replaybility, challange or to give a helping hand to starters, the background now goes gray when you pause the game letting you more easily spot enemies, the UI was just generally improved graphically, and so much more! For the first time in many years, Baldur's Gate is playable. And I am both annoyned and baffled that some people are angry over these changes, a vocal minority I hope.			"

												If you are ready to get sucked into a classic isometric rpg then this game is for you.It is very enjoyable recruiting the NPCs to join your party with their own personalities and goals instead of creating a whole party at the beginning. Character customization is pretty good and allows you to make your hero whatever you wishStory: Pretty basic become a hero by slaying the bad guy main storyline but it is very entertaining and the extra info you learn about why what is happening is pretty exciting. You are in no way forced to continue the main story though and can explore all the surrounding lands to your hearts content and get tons of hours of gameplay without even progressing through the story.Combat: I love tactical realtime with pause combat. You can play any battle without pausing but it is highly unlikely and you will not do well without pausing to queau your parties actions. Tougher battles must be thought through and you will cannot advance with just putting your head down and trying to beat down combatantsCustomization: Already touched on this a bit but you are pretty free in making your hero what class and race with proficienies in wherever you want them. Just note that you should read into the classes and realize what you want to do with your character instead of creating what sounds good at the time and then realizing it is not right for you.Overall: This is a must buy if you love classic isometric rpgs with a real time pause battle feature. Great open world that you can explore and get many hours without ever touching the main quest line, and when you do decide to pursue the main story you will not be dissappointed.			"

												Fantastic.  The new updates to Baldur's Gate:EE released near Dragonspear make the game much better.  It always saddens me that the rich world of Faerun is only well-represented today/remembered by a handful of games that have extremely limited scope, and I'd really like to see more companies tell their stories using this type engine.  That said, Dragonspear is excellent.  I really enjoyed every minute of it, and (as an adult) had to fight the urge to binge through in a few sessions.I'm writing this review to hopefully encourage people who liked BG & BG2 to give it a chance, in the hopes that this might encourage Beamdog to develop additional DLC for BG or BG2.  Would be great if they were able to spend more time on the overall story, create some new tilesets, and maybe introduce new characters areas for exploration.  Pro's:+ Gampelay.  + Being able to clearly see the benefit of different weapons/armor without busting out a calculator.+ New story is ~ 20 hours long to complete.  I somewhat rushed and finished in about 22 hours.+ Lot's of new dialogue is relevant and well-written.+ Added character development for existing characters.+ Possibly bridges BG & BG2.Con's:- Want moar.  moar moar moar.- Some parts of the story seem generic or rushed, although the overall arc is well-written.- Needs new tilesets. If tilesets were completely new, then they were not distinct enough.  ..I understand it's all The Sword Coast, but a little more diversity would be nice.There seems to be an online PC/SJW or anti-SJW crowd pushing hate for this expansion.  I emplore you to really consider that Beamdog can't appeal to you, but ask yourself- are they really trying to wrong you? Maybe it's just an age thing, but I don't have time to worry about whether a transgender character or feminist character are well-represented, and Beamdog would have to come out and state that they're clearly anti-LBGT/anti-feminist for it to even matter.  Also due to age, I've gamed long enough to see many good things just die.  Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and (stand-alone) Neverwinter Nights titles made up the majority of these isometric adaptations of AD&D rulesets and lore, and I've always liked them.  But those companies were either bought up by much larger companies (looking at you, EA), and their products were watered-down, or changed altogether.  It's indescribably uplifting to see at least somebody taking charge again, and reviving this genre.  So please, if you feel slighted- it's ok to share.  But please be absolutely damned sure harm was intended before waving the battle-standard; good things like this don't happen often, and many times they die too early.			"

												This is an excellent bridge between two of my favorite games. It retains the spirit of the games while shedding some of its more cumbersome mechanics. My only complaints are that it's somewhat buggy, and the journal entries aren't nearly fleshed out enough to be useful for a number of quests involving lists. Some of the quest solutions are somewhat counterintuitive as well. In general, however, I'm very happy to see the gap between BG 1 and 2 closed, and I think the developers, particularly the writers, did excellent work. And for the record, I'm a transgender gamer who owns every game in this series, as well as Icewind Dale and related games. I'm dedicated to this brand of game, I have been for over a decade, and despite the pitiful mewing from gamergaters, the inclusion of a trans character in this game, however minor, was an excellent and timely choice for the devs to make. Buy this game!			"

												This is a review about the Siege of Dragonspear DLC.  This is an excellent expansion to the original campaign - and does exactly what it set out to do: link the two story lines.  Right from the beginning, the story takes on a slightly darker tone than the original story, and includes some moral ambiguity that is far more common to RPG of this time, and not so during the time that Baldur's Gate was first released.  The story is engaging and fits perfectly within the BG universe.  It took me over 30 hours to reach the end of the campaign (which of course, is just the beginning).For fans of the original game, I cannot recommend this DLC enough.  You will not regret it.			"

												THIS REVIEW IS FOR SIEGE OF DRAGONSPEAR ONLYBg1 is 10/10  Buy it now.  Bg2 is 10/10  Buy that too. I'll make this relatively short and relatively spoiler free.  Gameplay  8/10   Gameplay is pretty solidly BG-ish.   There's a new interface with 2.0  that some people don't like.  I actually kind of prefer it.  Some people have complained about bugs.. but I've only seen minor insignificant ones.Sound I don't care about music or anything.. I always turn music off.  so incomplete/10Graphics  8/10   Kind of the same old BG.  Which isn't bad if you like BG.  I think some of the lighting effects are new, which is coolVoice Acting  6/10  Passable.  Not at the level of BG2,  maybe that wasn't possible.  Also an old favorite returns..  won't spoil it but that's a plus.  New Characters 4/10  Bland, boring,  some of the worst voice acting is for the new guys.  Corwin WOULD be intriguing if not for the writing... which I'll get to, and if you could carry her over to BG2,  which since you can't for any of the new guys makes them rather irrelevant.  New Class Shaman 2/10  Simply a broken class from what I've seen.  Basically some type of gimped sorcerer-style Druid  with a summoning special ability.  While this sounds great in theory I don't see the point as mostly you'll have the same healing spells you'd have otherwise.. just less of them.  So there's no special spellcasting reason to have a Shaman,  and the summoning ability- you activate  it,  and stand there spitting out summoned creatures.. which grow in power as you level.  Sounds great but there are three problems 1.  It takes quite a while before you summon a creature.. so the fight is usally over, or mostly over by the time you get your first creature out.  2.  You can't move, cast spells, defend yourself... anything while you do this.  That makes you extremely vulnerable.. so oftentimes the enemies are quickly beating you down while you stand there summining.  3. You only have a chance of summoning.  So if you fail.. you have to keep standing there for another ten seconds or so doing nothing until you can try to summon again.  Again.. the fight is over by then.  I think this could all be fixed by making your first summon 100% and having it happen immediately.  Writing 4/10  This is the big deal everyone is going on about.  First - the SJW thing.  It is clear from playing SOD,  that for whatever reason,  there is absolutely a PC bent to the dialogue,  plot,  etc.  Everything from religious zealotry,  treatment of women,  anti-violence,  single motherhood,  equal pay,  racism.  You name it.. it's probably at least hinted at,  if not flat out being lectured at you through a character's dialogue.  Of course the biggest controversy is over a trans character,  inserted in the game for no real reason,  serving no real purpose,  who volunteers their story,  for no reason other than I suppose to ""educate"" the consumer.  As many people have pointed out,  in the D&D world,  trans people would have zero problems as there are any number of magical ways to make yourself look or actually be the opposite sex.  Look at the end of the day.  I don't really care.  Don't agree with much of that kind of agenda.. but it's their game, their views right?  The PROBLEM is that it all breaks immersion and drags you out of the fantasy world so you can think about and ponder real world issues.  I will say that the trans character isn't marked essential, doesn't aggro,  and carries some decent loot so...just throwing that out there as an option.  The bigger problem is that a lot of the writing is simply lazy.  A lot of the dialogue options make it perfectly clear they're forcing you down a certain path, good, neutral,evil responses all basically say the same thing.   A good example,  without spoiling TOO much is at one point you meet a dark elf,  and he has a captive female goblin.  Now when you interact with him,  no matter whether you're good or evil,  no matter whether you choose the good or evil dislogue response,  it always results in the goblen slave being freed and you insulting/threatening the drow.  Then the slave lectures you and the drow.  I mean seriously.  There are other issues with all this.. too many comedic responses etc.  But I've already typed too much on this topic. I'm giving it a 4/10 simply because it's held my interest.. and all these issues haven't made me stop playing it.Overall - 5.5/10   And yet at the same time you could argue this is a 10/10 must buy.  The reason is if you're a BG fan,  which you should be,  you're going to buy this,  and it offers enough to sate your appitite.  At the end of the day if you just follow the story.. move  from area to area.. fight monsters.. you should have a good time.  Try not to think about the writing too much though.  If you HAVEN'T played BG before,  then you are wrong.  You will proceed to buy it,  then you will become a fan and need to buy this.  So like I said it's really a must buy.  But if I'm being completely impartial and the other BG games didn't exist,  SOD would be an ok-ish RPG that occaisionally lectures and irritates you.			"

												I have been having a blast with this game, but it isn't without its faults.The Good:The game is fun, it really is. It's a great experience that i've been enjoying ever since I got it. There's a ton of character customization options, almost too many, and the situations i've gotten into have been both hilarious as well as frustratingly difficult. Controlling 6 characters takes a bit of getting used to and a LOT of pausing, but the result is combat that feels tactical and rewarding when you get it just right. Characters have a limited AI that lets them handle themselves for basic actions, but always lets you give them specific orders so you don't have to babysit their every move. The world itself is charming and there are subtle (And not so subtle) pop culture references that made me chuckle when discovered. The Meh:The UI can be confusing at times, especially since the game's ruleset is from the earlier days of D&D. I tried explaining what THAC0 was to a friend, it took him a while to understand it. And durations of spells (Round? Turn? Hours?) are not explained well in game...or at all? I couldn't find it, I had to look it up. You can tough it out and learn by experience, but I feel the game could have been more user friendly if it tried.The Bad:Bugs. Oh god the game is buggy as heck. Is it playable? Yes, but it takes alot of jumping through hoops to get multiplayer working. Eventually it resorted to Hamachi virtual networking and port forwarding, but even then the game crashed and some pausing issues happened causing us to frequently restart the game entirely and load up a save. This happened with SOME friends, but not others!? LIke, what? Single player seemed decent, I haven't had any issues there, but multiplayer needs some serious work. It's functional, but barely.Overall:The game is good, and I would recommend it. Just expect to find yourself with a bit of a learning curve to handle, and some technical issues may arise, but the game is fun and engaging, and DIFFICULT.			"

												Don't let the thumb's down reviews fool you - this is still a fantastic game. Some people seem to have had technical problems but I have been playing for dozens of hours since 2.0 and have had zero problems (unless you count the fact that I got 2 copies of the baby on werewolf island - don't ask). (Side note - I am now running around with a baby in my backpack just for the fun of it).It is still BG. It has new classes and kits to try. It has a way easier loot interface. The story is 100% as great as it has always been. I do not think any technical issues will remain for long.			"

												Look, if you want to play Baldurs Gate 1 or 2 you really should just find a download for it somewhere and mod it so it works.   Enhanced Edition has clear technical issues and shoehorns things into the game that don't really need to be there. You should definitely play Baldurs Gate 1 and 2, but don't do it this way.  "

												As someone who only played Baldur's Gate 2 when it came out and enjoyed it greatly, I don't think I would've gotten there if I had started with the first game. It has not aged gracefully.The first problem that drove me away from the game for a few months was the ridiculous difficulty. I enjoy a challenge, but this game is just unfair. Almost everything in the game is based on random chance, and the odds keep stacking up against the player. For hours and hours I would have to reload almost every fight 5 times, because my main character would get one-shotted. This ends the game, even if someone in your group had the skills to resurrect her. But more than 30 hours into the game, I'm not even close to getting such a spell. There are temples that offer such a service, but having party members die gets expensive FAST.The second problem is the outdated game design. Mages are next to useless in the beginning of the game. They can cast one or two spells per day, after which they must rest. Resting in the wilderness risks an ambush, so it is not something to be done at a whim. Resting at an inn is safe, but travelling to one also risks an ambush. The encounters are not usually hard, but they are annoying and can sometimes lead to casualties, especially when the party is weakened. Therefore, while mages and clerics are immensely useful later in the game, they're basically just dead weight for the longest time. A cleric is somewhat more helpful than a mage, though, because they can wear armor, swing a weapon, and have access to a wider variety of spells right out of the box. You will not get a real cleric until fairly late into the second chapter, though, unless you created your main character a cleric.Also, did I mention enemies spawning in areas that have been covered by fog of ware for mere 15 seconds?And this leads into the third problem. Baldur's Gate aims for a real D&D roleplaying experience. While I am the first one to applaud any game that tries such, it must not interfere with the gameplay. BG does so in spades. Firstly, aside from your main character, every group member has a personality. But this is good, right? Well, yes and no. Some personalities are simply less tolerable, ranging from simple whining to almost comical villainy. This becomes a problem, with the reputation system. You gain some when you're acting like a decent human being, and down when you're being a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Good characters like the former, evil characters prefer the latter. The choices are usually either or, and while there is often an indifferent option, it usually passes an opportinity to gain experience and powerful loot. Needless to say, going too far into one extreme will cause characters of an opposing alignment to get emo and leave. To make matters worse, most NPCs come in pairs. If you choose to ditch one, their companion will also leave. While none of them are completely useful, there are some that are much more useful than others.Pathing is also abhorrent. If a character's path is blocked, even temporarily, they will make a round trip around the map if they have to, happily running into enemies. In combat, however, they have a tendency to get stuck on each other trying to get close enough to attack.Itemization is also rather capricious, but before moving into the essentiae of it, I'll mention monks. They're a class that cannot use armor, and should generally not use weapons. While this causes them not to require the most common items, they become even more dependent on rings, amulets and such that are very rare. Other classes also have their own problems. Using any weapon without proficiency will incur penalties for using said weapon.  Most classes gain proficiencies very, very slowly, so choosing them wisely is important. But again, the game pulls a fast one; while enemies drop more weapons than you can carry, it is mostly short swords, halberds and short bows. Other types are really uncommon. This is important, because for reasons pertaining to the story, metal weapons can break. Permanently. This is, again, dictated by random chance, but I've had around 10 weapons break thus far. It gets really annoying when there is only a steady supply of weapons that no one is proficient with. Apparently magical weapons are not affected, so while the problem adds to the frustration of the harsh beginning, the selection of weapon types is really subject to the designers' whims. It's pretty much impossible to predict which weapon proficiencies will be useful in endgame.The game's only saving grace comes from the world and the story. I haven't been able to uncover much of it, and while it does seem interesting, I don't find the game fun to play anymore.			"

												Never played before, but know a bit about Second Edition D&D. Friend insisted I experience it, so I played.Made a character. Fighter/Mage Male Half-Elf Multiclass. 3d6 in order, no ""adjusting"" stats because that isn't how rolling works. 78 total stat points, 09 strength, 14 intellect. Core Rules difficulty. No reloading after failing to scribe a spell. The plot can be summed up as Everybody Wants You Dead: The Game. You live in a monastery and your wizard foster-father just starts freaking out one day and telling you to pack some stuff because we're GTFO-ing. Somehow a couple of extremely incompetent goons made it into the monastery despite the entrance fee being ""you must donate a book worth A @#%&load of money,"" in order to kill you, for... a 200 gold bounty? Maybe lower? Whatever the case, they aren't getting a good return on their investment, mostly because their nonmagical daggers are flimsy.So you leave, then Big Armored Guy shows up and kills Wizard Dad. Your little sister shows up to help you because it's boring in the monastery, but apparently Wizard Dad just doesn't care about her because he fully intended to leave her behind. Then you meet your replacement parents and learn that all the iron in the region is messed up somehow and it's probably your fault, because of... reasons? Oh, and more ""assassins"" try to kill you while the bounty notices they carry show a steady increase in price. None of these fights can be avoided by not telling the people trying to hunt you down what your name is. The option to wear a cowl and avoid people should exist, but whatever. The game must be close to twenty years old at this point, yeah? I'll cut 'em a little slack for that. Game / programming limitations and all that.Throughout my journey in ""The Sword Coast,"" I've encountered a female chicken that gets turned back into a male human, an old male hermit extolling ""the joys of being a woman that one summer"" when a wild surge hit him, a group of ""amazons"" who are really just female adventurers trying to murder you for the reward money, more chances to belittle female adventurers for looking so gosh-darned cute in their chainmail bikinis, a bard who tells women they belong in the kitchen making cupcakes, and a radfem who treats men as unnecessarily horribly as the men in the setting treat women. You also have the opportunity to tell one of the new characters ""lololol make me a sandwich"" in response to her saying she's having the time of her life adventuring. The writing and setting are completely sexist, and the cast of companions is BORING. Except Minsc. Minsc is kind of hilarious, but once you get tired of the same few lines he gives out, he goes from ""entertaining"" to ""we get it, you have a pet space hamster and that's half of the entire basis of your personality.""The only time most of the main cast ever speaks up is to react to reputation changes or comment on your surroundings. There's generally a line for certain characters referencing the fact that you're in a city, or you're in the woods, or you're in a dungeon. And sometimes two companions will interrupt a traveling session to fight to the death. Seriously. The only party members that even bother speaking about something else are the ones that were added in the Enhanced Edition, and the sexism from the old game is still visible in dialogues with Neera. And normally I'd probably say something about Neera being completely self-centered, manipulative and unlikeable, but 1) that also applies to a lot of other characters, and 2) she's a wild-mage. Wild mages are supposed to be chaotic, catty, and fun, and Neera is all of these things.Dorn is single-minded in his obsession with vengeance against those who betrayed him, and if you take him on as a party member you don't really get the option not to ask about his powers and not get an answer when he forces dialogue, but... the writing is lazy elsewhere too. Also, what would you expect from a Blackguard? They're ""evil but not chaotic paladins,"" so Dorn makes a lot of sense as a character.The game just oozes magical items though. You get a magic belt almost as soon as you leave the monastery, the new characters come with their own magic weapons (with Neera's staff being a bit hazardous for her to wield in combat because it might be her that gets burned), some encounters just drop amazing weapons for such a low level party, but it looks like longswords and zweihanders are the favored weapon in this game, just like so many other RPGs. You can even grab a set of elven chainmail (read: armor that wizards can cast spells in without penalty) and magic rings that increase the amount of spells you can cast/prepare per day by a large amount. And if you've got a wild mage in the party, casting through Nahal's Reckless Dweomer with such a ring turns that character into a completely overpowered powerhouse.Baldur's Gate is such an easy game once you know how the game interprets the 2nd Edition (Best Edition) ruleset that I wonder why there are easier difficulty settings than the one I chose. ""Normal,"" which is apparently the default setting at character creation, penalizes the damage enemies do. It should be called ""Easy,"" but there is also an ""Easy"" mode where enemies are penalized even further and player characters get a +6 bonus to all their rolls. And *then* there's ""Story Mode,"" where the player's party literally cannot die. Ever. It reminds me of the DOOM difficulty setting known as ""I Am A Wimp.""And yet, with all this rampant sexism and magical weirdness, so many reviews on here are complaining about the game being full of Social Justice because the expansion has a minor non-evil transgender cleric that can be encountered. Or there are complaints concerning ""They Changed It, Now It Suck."" Or that multiplayer doesn't work. But who plays a computer RPG for the multiplayer? Why is that even an option in the game? I thought multiplayer was what tabletop D&D and MMOs and Shooters were for. But whatever, obviously multiplayer Baldurs Gate appeals to somebody, or it wouldn't be in the game.But, the interface is easy to make sense of. Not giving commands to the party when enemies appear isn't a suicidal tactical option because the AI generally knows how to handle itself. People with bows engage enemy units without input from the player long before said enemies can close in for melee. Melee characters move to engage nearby foes, and move on to the next foe when the one they're attacking gets hacked into chunks. Sometimes they get hung up on pathfinding, but telling them to attack the next target generally fixes that issue. And, for all my issues with the writing and the boring plot that was probably a lot more interesting in the late nineties (when RPGs weren't flooded with the ""special snowflake protagonist who's descended from a god or a dragon or is Destined For Greatness that the player must customize from the ground up"" archetype yet), it's a pretty solid game. It's certainly a lot more entertaining than Neverwinter Nights, even if you do run into Mary Sues like Elminster, The Doctor, and Drizz't Dro'Urden. At least here you get the option to murder such characters in cold blood! And for what it's worth, the game also serves as sort of a history lesson in gaming culture.This is the sort of video game that led to the birth of the kinds of people who threaten female video game developers in today's age, but it's also a sign of evolution in the industry regarding the treatment of female characters in RPGs. But, it's also evidence of stagnation in video game storytelling, because in all the time that's passed since the release of Baldur's Gate, the majority of RPG protagonists are so, so very bland because they follow the same cookie-cutter design process.Baldur's Gate isn't really my kind of girl, but I've taken worse ones to bed.

												10/10 WOULD RECOMEND. As BG 2 is my favorite game of all time i was going into this not expecting to see much justice done. Even the initial plot had me raise an eye brow but im 100% exicited and on board with this expansion. This slots into the bhaal spawn saga and adds ALOT more depth to it, not cheesy or over done. It all makes sense and feels like a perfect prequel to the set up of BG 2. Did i mention they got alot of the origional voice actors in? They did and it is awesome. This is the first time in a long time iv been exited to play baldurs gate again and it feels amazing. Get behind this guys as if this is the quility of game they want to make with the EE engine then i cant wait for them to make more......now if they would just update those crusty old models that would be something			"

												Short 'review'.  I bought the EE for 1 reason alone:  3440p support.  Which looks glorious.  I haven't been able to get the original version's widescreen mod to work at anything over 1080p.Other things I've noticed:I don't care for the additional 4 PC's but you can ignore them.  They are not soo out of place that you can't just treat them as an NPC and move along. [ie nothing like the Pillars of Eternity backer NPCs]Some pathing improvements with 2.0. [though you may want to downgrade to 1.3 which is still available as:]Can't comment on AI improvements as I've always used the SCS mod for that which still worked on 1.3 which you can still downgrade too if you want to use old mods.Some love for the missing new BG2 weapon skills such as club.I might have bought BG1 3 times over the years, but I don't mind paying make the process a lot more seamless than messing with the 3rd party mods.  And that changed to being essential after moving past 1080p.			"

There is some fine new features comparing to orginal BG1 that gives more replay value for BG:EE even for old BG1 fan like myself. I don't get it why ppl complain so much about these new changes.

This is in addition to first-class support for OSX, Linux, Android, and iOS with the same codebase. If you were a fan of the originals or have never tried these games, this is definitely the version to get.

												Remember that song, by that dude that people always plays at weddings? You know, the one by Barry White?For me, that's Baldur's gate. When it initially dropped, waaay back in 98 I was only a kid, and coulden't get past the first area of the game.But I stuck with it, and the game rewarded me in oh so many ways. It was the first game I fell in love with, the one who opened my eyes to CRPG's and tabletop RPG. Now, almost 20 years later, it's still my favorite game and i still play it. Often.Now, this game is probably not for everyone. Some may find it slow, some may find it boring or tedious, while others may be overwhelmed by the walls of ingame text. But if you're a fan of RPG's you shoulden't let this one (or it's sequel) slip past you.In my opinion, the storyline of Baldur's Gate is the best one ever put in a computer game. (Though Morrowind comes in at a close second)I have never played another game, where the story felt like such an unfolding mystery, and made such great sense, when you at last had the final piece of the puzzel, and were able to see the bigger picture.The writing is great, the characters are fleshed out, the voice acting is (mostly) superb, and though the graphics are dated as hell, I would still say that they themselves are fantastic. But for me, theese things are almost (almost!) secondary. The reason I say this, is because the engine, the gameplay itself, is what truly makes this game stand out for me.There is an almost limitless number of posibilities, on to how you engage your enemies be it with blade or spell.It takes some getting used to, and might seem clunky at first, but when you understand how the system works, you are rewarded with one of the deepest combat systems I have encountered to date. It's tactical and intricate, but at the same time as blunt and gritty as a meat cleaver.And it runs on almost everything nowadays. (even Ipads)The EE edition, also makes this a very customizable game. You can tweak most anything to your liking, be it the graphics, the difficulty, or how much feedback you want the game to give you on various things going on behind the scene.That being said, it IS an old game, and an old engine, wich means that if you really want, you can exploit it to such a degree that it breaks the game. Baldur's Gate however, is so much more, than the sum of it's partsWhat Baldur's gate manages really well compared to so many other games, is to really make you feel that you are on an adventure. To put you into the game world to such a degree, that you become oblivious to the real world around you.In my opinion, Baldur's Gate is a timeless , classic masterpiece that everyone should allow themselves to experience.

												For anyone having trouble to get the multiplayer to work, the best and easiest way is to use Logmein's Hamachi VPN program, make a multiplayer LAN game, and join all players you want in BG in your Hamachi server.  We tried many methods save forwarding ports (no one knows router passwords it seems!); nothing was working at all without doing ports.  Hamachi worked right away, didnt do ports, just typed the ip into the direct connect option (Hamachi gives you the ip) and voila!Granted the game is a bit older and the controls for combat are a bit primative (almost always need to pause just to make the attack clicks), but it plays like it should; enemies are still hard (even on normal).  Only thing I wish was that the autosave was a bit more consistant, seems to save fine when entering or leaving a building but not so well when switching areas inside a cave or mine.  As long as you remember to rest and save a bunch this game should be very fun for all!Hope this helps get everyone online together, games like this are always better with more people.			"

												My review is about the Siege of Dragonspear update to graphics and menus:Good:- New character look, more cartoon shading with outline.- Better UI font (sharp, bigger) and better menus in generalLots of small annoyances- The new map zoom in and out takes 3 seconds and makes me dizzy.- Opening quests now takes a lot of clicks while before it would not, someone missed interface design classes.- Quick save now create multiple files... Before you could just always do it and load the last one, now you gotta check which one you want to load.- Export character file reduce file name to like 6 characters... No idea why...I've just started playing it and will update but I keep finding so many new annoyances that I had to post some feedback. "

												One of the best games ever, only surpassed by its sequel and Planescape Torment.  Replayability value is high, there are so many character variations and NPC companion choices that you can't experience it all in one playthrough.Before Siege of Dragonspear: EE update was good, it brought the engine to the same level with BG2. I liked the new NPC's, even though they had too many spoken lines compared to the old NPC's which is a bit jarring.After Dragonspear: The sprites got more cartoonish, but am getting used to them now. The new UI is not very good, it is difficult to find stuff there. The new journal system is meh. It is not a good improvement but not that bad either. The new map function works great. Unfortunately new features added new bugs.I agree with many of the negative reviews but I still recommend this game. The new features do not make the core experience bad. If you have never played it you would not even know about them.PS. Sarevok really needs a hug, too bad he has to wait until Throne of Bhaal for that.			"

												A Response to the Other Reviews:I don't post reviews often, but it appears that the lowest common denominator has decided to be very loud with regard to this game. It's a fun game, and it deserves a fair shake.GRAPHICAL UPDATES:People complaining about cartoonish graphics have no place posting a review on the Steam market. The thick black border they're talking about, a simple graphical update that makes the game easier on the eyes at 4K and other modern resolutions, is entirely optional. In fact, the option is in Graphics settings and couldn't really be easier to locate. Other than that, the only updated assets are textures that were blatantly unable to survive the HD transition (the original Baldur's Gate used an actual picture of coffee grounds to appear like the ground/road, for example, an interesting choice that can only work on the old, blurry 800x600 CRTs of yore.) The replacement textures are high-quality, tasteful, and lore-friendly. USER INTERFACE/USER EXPERIENCE (UI/UX) UPDATES:The UI recieved one update of any consequence at all: Journal entries now appear at the top of the screen to alert you to the fact that you've acquired a quest or learned something new about an important, ongoing chain. This is ultimately a useful feature, but on this particular issue I can see why some people might be incensed. The UI element is a little noisy, and given that this is the sort of game where one could understandably have purchased a real-world journal to track activity, it does markedly change the experience from the original. I'm personally of the opinion that the improvement is a complimentary (if not necessary) one, mostly to make the game enjoyable for a generation of gamers born into quest markers. This should be an optional feature, probably, but it's presence doesn't render the title the sort of hyper-active, dopamine-fueled, flashing slot machine that other reviewers make it out to. This is still a far cry from Hearthstone.REBALANCED DIFFICULTY:There are more options, one of which brings the ruleset into alignment with Baldur's Gate 2, making for a smooth transition (much like the options offered by the WeiDU tweak packs for the original or the BiG World Project.) This is strictly something you can't complain about. The original difficulty settings were notoriously limited and once the system was mastered, woefully inadequate. As a long-time veteran of the series who obviously cares way too much about it, and as a game developer who's worked on RPGs in the past, this is the one change that should not interfere with your decision whether or not to buy this game. POLITICAL ISSUES:Why this ever needs to be a section in a game review is beyond me, but the current state of affairs makes it necessary. Brace yourself for stupidity. A large reason for the negative attention this game has garnered recently is... The expansion contains a transgendered character. *GASP* Lock the kids indoors, shut the shutters, draw the curtains, as from the state of things, you'd guess Strahd himself descended upon the town to wreak havoc. In reality, it's an inoffensive NPC with an aside that points to a gender transition at some point in their past. Why is this offensive? Well, never mind the Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity, an item that has changed the PC's gender since the game's release. Never mind that Eliminster, iconic wizard extraordinaire of the Dungeons and Dragons universe, lover to Mystra the Goddess of Secrets, Survivor of the Time of Troubles, and WotC's best sales-driving cover man since Drizzt Do'Urden, spends a good chunk of time walking the earth as a female and makes several appearances. (Let's all be honest about what we'd do with Polymorph Self.) Anyway, in summary, the idea of magically changing genders is not new to the series and has somehow offended a humorless group of teetotalers. ***NOTE***This game is very old. It contains a number of bugs. Some of them have been in the game since Black Isle held the reins, some are a natural consequence of working with a game from the 90's, and some of them are indeed derived from Beamdog itself. However, it's worth noting that they seem to genuinely care about this game, and as someone who has worked in the soul-sucking industry for several years, that's a pretty rare feat among developers of largely-known IPs taken as an aggregate. They regularly patch this game, developed a new expansion, and provided free, substantial content updates of high quality. They easily could have released this game, made a quick buck on the brand recognition, and abandoned it. They easily could have gotten away with reserving the content updates only for those who bought the expansion. I highly recommend supporting Beamdog as it currently exists, if only to encourage more genuine passion in an industry that's in sore need of it.			"

There are more sophisticated RPGs out there today, but you'll still enjoy some unforgetable characters and challenging battles.  As for Siege of Dragonspear, it's a worthy addition and let's try not to take a game that include a belt that changed your gener in the original so seriously.			"

												I'm only prompted to write a review as a response to all the negative reviews recently posted regarding the UI change. I played the original BG and BG2 back in the old days. I think the changed UI is fine. Not necessarily better or worse on the whole. The game is still amazing and will completely absorb your life if you let it. On a more philosophical note, I think the prevalence of these reissues of classic games is in part a response to modern gaming's emphasis on cutting edge graphics over absorbing and well designed gameplay. The continued popularity of BG and other classics is a testament to the power of great gameplay, story etc. I certainly understand if someone preferred the old UI, but to change your review from net positive to net negative just because the journal is a different design now and the sprites have outlines seems to be missing the point. The game was amazing. The game is amazing. The game will continue to be amazing unless Beamdog does something to actually break it. The changes might annoy a little but the game is still amazing. Buy it.			"

												Im betting if you are looking at this game, you have owned it before. However, I think if you are looking at reviews, you might be considering it. So, this game is a top down real Role-Playing Game. Many games today claim to have the cause and effect but none match the old DnD based video games. Also they are still updating and expanding it! As if it needed expansion. I still own the box mine came in for windows 98, and it says that there is over 500 hours of gameplay! I doubt you would find that worth in many modern games, if you played them through 3 times. This is a squad based or (not recommended) solo game. To reach the end, is only to prepare for Baldur's Gate 2! Which is also a fantastic continuation. Anyways, don't buy this game if you: -Hate Stories-Cant stand older graphics-Want everything handed to you-Dont enjoy games based on Dungeons and Dragons?Good luck, and have fun.

												I first picked up Baldur's Gate from the discount bin in the local Tech fair. back then I was 18 and $10 for a game that came out just earlier in the year (in a very heavy cardboard box no less!) seemed like a good deal, if I hated it then it was just $10.18 year old me was then trapped. TRAPPED!!!! the first two hours were spent rolling and re-rolling the dice to get the highest stats possible before started the game... just to discover that the class she picked reaaaaaaaalllllllllyyyyyyy sucked and she had to start over.Then came the agonizing crawl through the game, where you felt like a moron trying to figure it all out. My 18 year old self didn't see the sun until a week later.... AND IT WAS ONLY TO GET MORE BG!!!!!!I am now in my 30s and when I saw this on sale I thought ""hey I liked that game, let's go through memorylane again""2 hours later... my 18 year old self wants to kick my butt from here to the moon... what have I done... remember me fondly!!!!!!

												I remember the day I started playing Baldur's Gate.I was seven years old.I was exploring the basement.I found it in a box with a bunch of textbooks on coding in C++.I installed it with no problems because of the talent for Windows that I got from somewhere.I then proceeded to create a mage.I just went with whatever stats.I sucked for a few hours and then restarted.This time I acually worked on my character.I read the manual about pretty much everything.I then proceeded to learn that killing guards for their armor is not a good plan.To this day I always take the good path because I am haunted by that memory.I don't remember much after that, but I remember that I loved it so much that I created possibly illegal copies of the discs so that I could play with a friend.I later was told by the universe for the first time ever that I REALLY suck at everything, because he was so much better than I had been even though I had been playing for about a year at that point.Then I learned he was cheating.He was still much better than me however.He usually went with a ranger, then proceeded to get every hidden item in the game.We never really ended up playing multiplayer.I easily have thousands of hours in this game.I have bought about thirteen copies of the original, including the GOG version.I believe I am finally ready for playing the Enhanced Edition.NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL NOW GO AND PLAY REROLLING SIMULATOR 1998 REMASTERED!...I realize that a review like that says nothing about the actual game and that I will get nothing but downvotes like when I wrote a review for Clannad without putting anything about the music and voices and graphics and story and all that jazz.So here you go.Pros:THE MUSICTHE MUSICIMOENTHE MUSICMINSCTHE MUSICTHE GORE SWITCH THAT SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCETHE MUSICTHE STORYTELLINGTHE LORETHE MUSICTHE MODDING COMMUNITIESCons:RerollingAnnoying as **** fatigue popping out of nowhere at the worst timesTHE MODS ARE CONFUSING TO INSTALL HELP SOMEBODY PLEASERerollingDrinking the wrong potions.LAST THINGHOW TO PLAY: KEEP YOUR LEFT LITTLE FINGER ON Q YOUR LEFT THUMB ON THE SPACE BAR AND THE RIGHT HAND HOLDS THE MOUSEPause once every .0909085678246843 seconds and check your surroundings.LOOK AT THE SETTINGS IF YOU WANT AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THE ORIGINAL GAME.

												Baldurs gate 1 and 2 are in mine opinion the best RPG games ever made. If you like RPG games and ever wanted to play really superb Dungeons and dragons experience this is the game to pick.As whole i dont think it is bad exp, just not on par with Baldurs gate games (Mainly thx to mixed writting). Old BG2 characters like Irenicus, Imoen or Viconia are well done (they made them a lot like in baldurs gate 2). The problem are characters that are new made by beamdog, or that didnot had much quotes in BG1 (for example Safana speaks and act like 10 year old girl (never picked her in BG1 so dunno if it is from there)). New class is nice and combat is still superb and some dungeons are really well done. As whole I think this exp is worth a money, but it is not nearly as good exp like Throne of Bhaal.			"

												Doh. i just paid $20 for BG EE only a week ago and missed the $5 special. Still worth every penny and will save up for dragonspear expansion. So how good is BG EE? Awesome. i had been told to play this game for 20 years but felt it could not measure up to the Temple of Elemental Evil which has been modded and expanded for 20 years by the circle of 8. Co8. I feel steam should offer to buy the rights to the game and compensate those modders for updating the game and attempt to release a modern version of TOEE. It uses the best version of D&D rules as it includes all the feats and the battles are simply much more strategic with initiatives, attacks of opportunity, interruptions, feints, and a stunning radial menu to tie it all togther. The battles are so deep that it had to be turn based as every single decision must be carefully considered. Watching every dice roll becomes a lot of fun. But of course BG is simply bigger and grander and more wonderfully told. So while TOEE certainy beats everything ever made in terms of tactical pressure in the heat of battle it is simply not as good as BG 1&2 in terms of rich deep story telling. It is such a shame that pillars of eternity chose not to emulate the TOEE battle system and went with the more crude semi turn based BG system. Maybe they felt Divinity was too much competition but Divinity is really dumbed down compared to TOEE. Anyone who has played through the TOEE NC (new content) version and got through the hickory branch and all the expanded material knows what i'm talking about. TOEE's thumping soundtrack played during the final battle against the plant god is the single most electrifying experience of my role playing life and that includes the 1st Wizardry and the 5th Ultima. Over 30 years ago prior to the release of the apple 2E there was a game called ""Odyssey"" which has been lost to history and i can't even find info on it with google or youtube. For true RPG historians i would like to say this was the very first game ever made for a computer and may have been the 1 to start it all. If anyone remembers this game please message me. ;)			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this game. Sure it's not quite as good as the original (or it's superb sequel for that matter)... but it's more Baldur's Gate...and thats a very very good thing.This review covers Siege of Dragonspear (I'm not going to comment on BG:EE as i havent had a chance to go back and play it with the latest patch installed). OLD MEETS NEW - I love that the team decided to use a retrofitted version of the Infinity Engine. If they'd have used a modern engine (like the excellent pillars of eternity) i doubt thayd have been able to preserve that elusive BG magic or maintain a sense of continuity with the other games in the series. CAST OF CHARACTERS - Im a little divided on the characters Beamdog chose to pull into the DLC. The notable absence of Branwen left me wanting. I ultimately replaced her with viconia, who fitted better with my evil aligned party. But i cant help but wonder if Beamdog missed a trick here...to enhance less common characters with excellent backstories and take them as DLC characters into the sequel. FAMILIAR VOICES - It was great to hear some familiar actors reprise their roles. Dream come true. Well done Beamdog.Gameplay - It plays just like Baldurs gate...until it doesn't. It just feels different. This has a large part to do with the way the story is told this time round and the altogether more linear path you're expected to walk. Its not bad...its just...different. My one gripe however is that this new campaign style led me into a situation here I was unable to complete some quests (SMALL SPOILER: Report to the sergeant that I was rescued Skie). Which was pretty annoying. I hope this will be patched in the future.BUGS - A lot has been made of all the bugs in the game. Maybe i was the exception but i encountered very few bugs. The one i did encounter was incredibly annoying though. I ventured through a massive level, found the exact spot to drop an explosive barrel and then...nothing. the game didn't register that id dropped it in the right place. Im 100% sure that i did.All this being said, i found BG:SOD a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the BG series. 7.5/10			"

												An expansion to an almost 20 year old game was destined to be controversial, especially when we're talking about a beloved franchise such as Baldur's Gate. Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear is Beamdog's first true attempt to write an original campaign in the Baldur's Gate series, with mixed results. The writing has improved, if only slightly, from the developer's previous material in the Enhanced Editions (which weren't good I'll be honest, the monk was decent, though), it still falls short compared to the base games but that is to be expected. Still an upward trend one would hope. One great thing is the voice acting, that I'll give them. Major props for getting some of the originals back. The gameplay is little different from the previous games and they do give you certain challenging encounters, though they made some strange changes to the interface which I don't like, but perhaps new players will find it to be better. It does sadden me slightly that some characters are used as prompts in the play of identity politics and ideology pushing; it feels a little on the nose. Truth be told I would be more tolerable of it if it didn't come across as blatant virtue signaling, and trying to earn brownie points for being 'Oh so progressive'. But who am I to say which demographic the developers should target, I'm just giving you my impression of the game.  Anyway I did enjoy the game so it'll get a positive review from me, but be aware that it is a mixed bag, though more good than bad in my opinion.Cheers.   "

												I happened to be strolling by the Store page for this while looking for something, and then saw all the negative reviews. After reading thru a few, I can say with some certainty that many of the accusations of bugs are factually incorrect as of now with update 2.1, or even with back the big update 2.0. I can't comment on the multiplayer or the new expansion, but I can safely say the singleplayer can be played almost completely as it was before, and if anything it's been vastly improved by small yet important tweaks. You can read more in the ""Recent updates"" section directly under the purchasing options of this page, but I'll provide probably the most telltale example: ""Metal weapons will no longer risk breaking once the iron crisis has been resolved (BG:EE) (19766)"". That was an oversight that stayed in this game since its creation in *1999* and though it can be rendered somewhat moot by the magical weapons you might acquire beyond that stage, anybody who rushes the story and/or picks less popular weapons was SoL for the past 15 years. But hey, ""don't fix what ain't broken,"" right?That said, a lot of the aesthetic changes were eye-sores to me.....but guess what? ALL but one of those changes are optional and can be switched off in the menu. I was on a BG bender for the past month when the 2.0 update came in the middle of my playthrough, and after restarting the game to see the changes I immediately logged off. BUT, a few days later I got back on, stopped being lazy and checked the Gameplay options, and sure enough, the sprite highlights, the health bars, the Story Mode difficulty addition - all can be switched right off, I can personally confirm those options were available within a week of the update. Even better, there now are more customization options for your party's AI and a few new Sound and Graphics options that get rid of some my own personal pet peeves. Also, I found and followed simple instructions on reinstituing Console Commands to try it out, and it still works perfectly.I 1st received BG as a gift when I was a kid, and I've been playing it on and off for over a decade. I even still have the original CD packet, but jumped on this version when it was on sale. I don't regret it at all - BG:EE is better than the original, nostalgia be damned straight to hell. Beamdog's art and writing can clash sometimes with Bioware's, especially the former, but overall EE is a massive improvement. The implementation of the sequel's better mechanics alone is worth shelling out the cash for this, and I honestly think Beamdog did a very good job of sticking to what made BG great. Neera, Dorn, Rasaad, and especially Baelor are all decently-written and well-voice acted characters that I look forward to seeing more of as I start my BGII:EE playthrough. Again, I can't speak for the expansion, and after reading more into the ""controversy"" and watching a video on gameplay I have a few opinions of both sides, but I'll hold my tongue on that and stick to what I've actually experienced. In sum, BG:EE is not only still playable, but better than the original BG.			"

												Okay, as a hardcore BG fan since the very first day of its release many moons ago, I feel I have to review this properly. I've consistently played these games, and the other infinity engine games, since I was a doe eyed boy of 12, jacking it over the sheer scale of everything.  PRO's:Great story that gets better the further you get inNew NPC's that don't suck completelyNew class that makes druid spells almost usefulNew items that provide much entertainment (careful with those specs)I love the new UISwitch between dual wield and bow? At laaaaaast!Fills the gap in the story in a scale I wasn't expecting at all really, but was pleased with.More monsters!Better NPC banter  CON'sThe trans character was a bit clumsy. Fair play for the inclusion, but could have been better.Buggy as hell. Not unplayable, but annoying at times.There's no real distinction between the evil and good paths (that I found yet)Shaman is okay, but Druids and Clerics need a few more spell pages. Also, let's be fair, druid spells suck balls and the game needs to borrow a few from Icewind Dale 2,in which druid is the most fun class, to my mind (Thorn Spray? Rolling Wave? Static Field? Come on guys!)I saved a copy of every scroll in BG1 to dual class my fighter to mage in SoD and none of my scroll cases, gem bags, or potion cases came with me. Most frustrating.Quite a few spoken/script inconsistencies. Characters saying one thing when another is written down.Sometimes it's a little unclear on what you're supposed to do.That's about it. Shaman is okay, but druid spells still suck nads and there's no stronghold in SoA. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed it and the ending actually♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off (in a good way). The series just got huuuuuuge and I'll be praying to Helm (giggidy) that there's a third. Something to do with the CHARNAM and Aerie's baby perhaps? Write that one in somehow, there's your challenge Beamdog.			"

												I have been giving this game serious thought for many years, i played the original, and only stopped playing when my computers could no longer play due to far too many incompatabilties rendered by time, however, i will say, this is no light romp, the world of abeir-toril, and faerun by further extension is a world of dark fantasy. prejudice, and morality are in constant question in this world, just as they are in our own, however it is important to realize that this is also no freeform rpg, it is meant to tell a story, and any good author will produce mental, emotional, and sometimes even physical reactions to their works, as even the latest dlc has accomplished such, i would rate it a total success, it is not here to aid you in blissful ignorance, it is in a way, meant to nag at your consious mind, not to simply annoy but to provoke thought, recently there has been backlash for a newer npc being transgender, personally i take no issue with it, nor do i take issue with the prujudices within, some call these ""modern issues"", but in fact they are not, the human race as a whole has struggled with these issues at various points in history, sometimes more than others, but the issues have been present for at least the last 3000 years, and so calling them ""modern issues"" is a fascile argument, and is ultimately, even now a Plebian example of thought, ""Learning without thought is labor lost, thought without learning is perilous"", in any event, i urge you to play this game, it will provoke many things, but my point is simple, to appreciate the full scope of the game, it pays to do just a little side research into this world, to truly get a hold of and grasp the concepts and how they are handled, by the peoples and entities within, but to be sure this is a world of fantasy, the question remains, as it always has, are you ready? (P.S. not being rude here, or at least not trying outright to be, there are alot of things going on in our loyal 20 year old community atm, most fed by 4 sides from 2 arguments, i seek neither to incite them, or to belittle them, merely to provide a functionally coherent review of a series i hold dear.)

BG:EE takes me right back to the stories and characters I love, whle also bringing some great quality of life enhancements. The ability to get a snapshot of what impact a gear change will have on my stats is super nice, as are the floating healthbars. Not to mention the great enhancements to party AI that makes controlling a full party super simple. Last but not least, I'm a big fan of the new characters. I feel like they do a great job showing off the more unique class options and bring some great writing as well.			"

												I like it. After disabling the funny Char-Outlines and the funny colored circles and the health bars, it felt like like a true BG game.Haven played much, but from what i saw, it' beautiful. The writing is spot on, the atmosphere is very good and the Voice-acting is gold. Felt like coming home to meet very old friends. The areas are some of the most atmospheric ever made in an IE game. It is obvious that the old engine has been tweaked beyond her years. The crowded Street of BG are an testament to this. The downside, is that this broke my mods and till mod-makers or the Devs adress this there will be no mods.But this is hardly a big problem. Those who want to finish BG:EE with mods better uninstall this expansion. Tiill you are ready to impport your toons for SoD.Anyway. A fresh BG expansion after 15 years of wait...whats not to like.

												The Baldur's Gate Enhanced Editions go beyond nostalgia and become somthing transformative. The game's U.I. and playability are btter than they've ever been, the Infinty Engine is venerable but holds up on modern systems and the sprites look fantastic. The added quests, NPCs and writing has been fantastic. I played Baldur's Gate in 98, it was the first PC I ever bought with my own money, I loved that game and that experience, the Enhanced Editions have actually provided me with my most enjoyed Baldur's Gate playthrough ever, after all these years.DragonSpear is a blast, so much care went into it, enough to reunite key members of the cast after 18 years! There's surprises to be found here for huge fans of the series and some things that will get you to smile, if you have any love for Baldur's Gate please reward yourself and buy this game!			"

												Do yourself a favor and buy this game. The Baldur's Gate saga is generally considered one of the best RPG series of all time, but whether you agree with that or not you are sure to love it. A few things that might be usefull to know if you are considering buying this game:This is an RPG above else, there's a lot of reading to be done and while combat encounters can be really fun and challenging (VERY challenging at times), the story and immersion is where the game shines the most.This is an older game, the UI can be a bit clunky at times and the pathing is a pain sometimes, and of course the graphics are out dated, you should know this from looking at the screenshots but don't expect modern graphics. However in my opinion the game has aged gracefully thanks to being 2D, often the hand drawn background and sprites are beautiful and has a charm you rarely find these days.This game requires patience, in order to truly enjoy it you have to allow yourself to take your time, explore, immerse yourself. Even normal monster encounters can be really challenging at times, at least in the beginning of the game, expect to reload and dont forget to quicksave regularly. You should also expect a very long game, this is why I usually recommend picking it up only when you can give it your full attention, this is not something you'll finish over the weekend. At the moment I am writing this I am about 50 houres in, and I expect to hit at least a 100 before I am done with the main story.. And that's not even counting the Dragonspear expansion.The enhanced edition does pretty much what it says, it allows for higher resolution, more game settings, and introduces some new NPC's that fit the roster perfectly (mostly). The best thing about these NPC's in my opinion is that they have alot of banter and random events centered around them, since party banter is probably the number 1 thing I wish BG1 had that BG2 did, this is great. Speaking of BG2, if you like this one you should definetly pick the sequal up too, it's pretty much the same but better in every regard, better combat, better story, more party interactions.Reading my review it sounds mostly negative, but I assure you - this is one of the all time greats, a must play for any RPG fan. The story, the atmosphere, it's some of the best out there, in my personal opinion it is only topped by it's sequal (BG2) and possibly Planescape: Torment and I have been an RPG enthusiast for over a quarter century so I have experienced a lot of different RPG's.

												This is an excellent port of an excellent game. The people who dislike it due to the addition of some recent content are the kind of people you'd kick out of your weekly gaming group because they'd keep trying to hit on the one female player, and even after she's said no, will attempt to do so in the game, making it awkward for everyone involved.Just because there may have been rampant sexism in a medieval fantasy world, doesn't mean we need to have it on our discussion boards. It is the ugly side of gaming, and it should called out and shamed every time it rears its head.Fortunately, actually playing this game provides a delightful means of escaping the insane vitriol of ignorant bigots who are mortally terrified of being wrong.

												Baldurs gate is one of the best RPG's in gaming history, and Beamdog has done a great job curating that history, improving gameplay mechanics, fixing bugs, and, with Seige of Dragonspear, adding thier own twist to the Bhaalspawn saga. If anyone enjoyed the originals, they'll enjoy the enhanced editions, too. Newcomers should expect a bit of a learning curve, since AD&D 2.0 rules were a bit eclectic, but there's a great community out there willing to help clarify any questions about the odd numbers you see on your character sheet or to explain what the hell a THACO is. Well worth the price tag! "

												The worst part about this game is creating your character. Skills and effects are not explained properly. You have to rely on stupid dice rolls and your character will have more/less skill points based on that. Is all about rolling a dice and getting good RNG. The UI is the worst i've ever seen in a RPG and makes you quit before you even finish the tutorial. Game asumes you alredy know D&D rules, universe, and mechanic so if you are new player that comes from other games, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												why do people keep calling crpgs strategy games? I hear this all the time how important it is to properly strategize and how important character building is but that counld not be farther from. All of these damn games are about is rolling a die and hope you get lucky. There is no strategy to this, at all, you just throw dice over and over and pray the RnG gods hold good favor this time, and if they dont, just reload over and over again until your brain goes numb. character building really doesn't matter wrth crap either. It is painfully obvious how each character should be built and your character stats are completely dice roll based which is the stupidest thing to me. And it doesn't even matter because you can just reroll infinateley and reallocate points as you please so its really just a dice roll to see how much of your life span gets wasted and how big your will to live is. equipment is a joke not seeming to mater in the slightest what your weapon choice is because they really is no difference ( i even looked into it on a forum and the only profeesion al answer to what weapon is good was that their is no real difference in weapon types, the difference comes in with the stupid magic weapons so yeah they are just an asthetic for most of the game.) Armor just seems to do absolutely nothing and is just flat out confusing nonsense unless you spend hours of your life figuring out what all this nosnese is by reading a bunch of crap off the wiki for it to still just be nonsense ( it's like the plot to FFXIII). In combat you have no clue what anyone of the enemies are  doing or has equipped, and (at least early game but i wont torture myself by playing this game anymore than i already have) you have no way of getting them to go for a certain character who can take hits. you just have to hope that the enemies dont lock on to the squisy guys who die in literally one friggin hit, (oh hey more luck nonsense.)  I want so badly to like these games, because I love the Idea of role-playing, but I cant stand gambling, and thats all any of these games are. the people who like these games are just gamblers who dont want to waste their money and thats fine, great, do whatever you please, but stop lying to people by saying there is strategy to try and justify it to yourself. If you don't mind RnG and you like the idea of roleplaying, this game may be for you, but understand how little your input actaully matters. Also be ready to quicksave after you do anything what so ever and reload whenever anything negative happens, because trial and error is difficulty right?(Edit: I removed all curses because I felt it invaldiated my arguement before it began. I do not hate this game or people who like it, I am just saying what I feel is true, these games are about RnG not strategy, and it is dishonest to say otherwise.)			"

It more or less plays exactly like I remember it, with the much needed additions from BG2.  Sorcerers ahoy!!! :PThe interface has changed but nothing really wrong with that for me.

												I got this game because I am a huge fan of classic JRPGs, so I thought I would give classic WRPGs a chance.However, I constantly found myself dying at the hands of weak enemies, and having to repeatedly reload my file made me feel like I was abusing the save/load states on an emulator, which cheapens the experience for me personally. I also don't like how I have like no spells or special moves, and whenever I use whatever stingy amount the game gives me, I already have to sleep to recover. I'm not saying this is a bad game, but I feel like this is only enjoyable for a specific type of audience who grew up with this stuff.

												They have sexually deviant characters in the game now, can't just be a reg D&D like game it now must have sex stuff it in and you are forced to interact and acknowledge these rejects who make sex their focus. What a pathetic game. Insta refund, they ban anyone who posts agaisnt their perversions on the discussion board because they have no respect for freedom of speech nor do they want to hear any critisism of their precious snowflake game. This game is as bad as Shower With Your Dad Sim...Dont't be like these devs and support Clinton.Be normal and Vote Trump!			"

												the game is fun to whoever likes the style, but mainly, this version removed all those damn annoying bugs from the original version (at least the ones which never let me play it through)			"

												I am nearly at 50h and my char is at level 6 xDIn my childhood I mainly played BG II and wanted to replay BG I and did it with this steam version. For me everything works perfect and the game is fast as hell (compared to how it was on my Windows 98 PC like 15 years ago :D ).Still one of the most awesome games out there!			"

												I'll keep it short and simple. This game is over 10 years old. It has aged well if you include the community mods that improve the graphics, UI and some other extra stuff.This new release also has bugfixes and an improved UI. And ever since the patch last month, the game has improved considerably.But why would you pay for this, when you can get the community mods for free?1) It's easier2) It's more stable3) This version has a few extras:A few new fully voiced playable characters with extra quests. There is also an arena mode. But I don't really like it. Is the game worth it? Yes. Even after 10 years the game is still awesome and better than some recent RPGs. I am looking at you Dragon Age.

												I'm sure this was an amazing game in its day... but lets face it, that was a long time ago. From the perspective of a modern gamer with no fond memories of the original, the graphics look dated, the interface feels clunky, and the combat dull. Combat comes in two varieties: either you play on normal difficulty setting, where it makes no difference what you do, your team will faceroll everything you right-click on, or you turn it up to insane where the fights will still be easy except that mobs will periodically one-shot and perma-kill your melee units despite ridiculous amounts of armor and buffs.The game is actually pretty linear, but it's not obvious where that line is. You have to glean hints about where and what to do by running around talking with every npc in sight, then remember what they told you since there are minimal breadcrumbs. I get this is trying to bring in some old-school table-top style RPGing I don't have the patience for this kind of game play. Give me a compass and a quest-arrow please. I swear if I have to read one more page of flowery, archaic quest text I'm gonna scream.Plus it's 2nd edition rules. Yeah. 2nd. You know, like Thac0, slings-or-gtfh, and race-specific multiclasses? Berk.			"

												I'm a big fan of Baldur's Gate, played it many times and still own and play the ""old"" version. And to be frank I like the not-enhanced version better (always have). The enhanced version is fine and has that advantage that you can play it practically on anything. I was really dissapointed when I found out that they changed the animations and the wait for the polish dubbing was really long (and you don't play Baldur's Gate in Poland without Fronczewski). The added classes are somehow disturbing, like they don't belong. There are some mods, but you can't change everything.The graphics somehow bugged me and some locations seem different.But if you never played it, you'll never feel the difference.All in all it's a great game and a classic, go play it!
