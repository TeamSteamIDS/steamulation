								This game showed a lot of promise and it was good, but then after an update at the end of 2014 the game has been dead, no updates no word from the developers nothing, and even the last update was only after the community managed to get the developers attention after months of silence, and now its been nearly a year, don't but this game until at least the developers do something to show they are working on the game.Warning aside, lets get into the actual game.You are the 'Hive Mind' of the zombie and control every zombie in that has been infected. Only 3 missions and 2 scenarios so very limited there it also has a sandbox however it also only contains one map so overall the game is not worth the money for developers are asking for			"

Early Access Review
								Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!I'm going to preface this review with what I think Early Access should mean. Then I'm going to tell you what ""Undead Overlord"" is. Early Access should be a title that, while unpolished and lacking features, is a fun experience that feels... nearly complete. Like a game that can stand on its own with maybe a little asterisk. And throughout its developmental process it should only improve, getting polished and expanded. Good examples of this are ""Kerbal Space Program,"" ""Sunless Sea,"" ""Prison Architect..."" the list goes on. Then they're released into the full-release wild, like ""Betrayer"" and ""Sir, You are Being Hunted."" That is the expected and desired life cycle of all things Early Access. And let me add this: I think Early Access is not above criticism - even downright damnation. If a game is bad, it's bad. I'm not giving it leeway because ""it isn't done yet."" If you're selling a product, finished or not, I'm going to criticize it. People think criticizing Early Access is tantamount to punching a baby. I don't agree with that. Especially when the game is 30 minutes of content with an intended additional 60 minutes of content.This game is bad. Objectively. It is a fact, like how old the universe is, how its heat death is inevitable, and how St. Paul, Minnesota is the happiest place on Earth (full disclosure: I've never been to St. Paul, Minnesota). Firstly let's address the graphics, arguably the least important feature (especially for an RTS). I feel that you have three options when developing a game: you can go the technically impressive route, the artistic route, or a wonderful fusion of both. ""Undead Overlord"" decided on the fourth, controversial option of terrible. This is pretty ugly. There is no artistic merit here. This is not fun to look at. This is like staring at the sun; it will cause inevitable blindness, madness, and is wholly inadvisable. It is jagged, blocky, muted, and utterly painful to look at. The levels are barren (particularly the one skirmish level). The character models look like the tourists in a ""RollerCoaster Tycoon"" game. I know graphics aren't that important at the end of the day, but you still have to stare at this for hours on end.Gameplay is the real meat of any good game sandwich. Unfortunately for you, ""Undead Overlord"" features a single, suspicious slice of green bologna. You select your zombie, click on a target, and he runs over to jankily smack him or her around until they collapse into a pool of blood, resurrecting to join your dead ensemble or providing a snack for health and strength. Interesting concept, yes. But it's shallow and not fun. You're just clicking your increasingly unruly horde at dwindling townspeople and first responders until there's nothing left. Then you're on to the next of three levels. You'll blast through these in... five, ten minutes (the levels are small and same-y)? But don't worry, the developers plan on adding six more! That's roughly an hour and a half of entertainment potentially! And if they meet some unspecified monetary goal they're going to add such exciting features as MULTIPLAYER, HUMAN CAMPAIGN, and MAP EDITOR. The AI is nonexistent. They react to your presence (sometimes) but don't expect them to seek you out or patrol of their own volition. This is a very one-sided RTS. The aforementioned skirmish level really shines a light on this. The level design on the single skirmish level is also pretty bland, featuring nothing but room after room stuffed with an assortment of humans and/or dog corpses.So that's it. That's ""Undead Overlord."" It feels and plays like an iOS game. The trailer is admittedly cool looking, as is the concept. But I didn't see that game when I played. I'm not picking on this game or the developers. I just don't want you to be burned. This is not worth your hard-earned cash or time. When you can buy complete games for less than this, and when you can purchase Early Access titles more polished than this, what's the incentive? Do you like to gamble? To live dangerously? ""Undead Overlord"" is about as fun as staring into the sun. Some might disagree, shouting in disbelief while staring till their eyes melt out of their skulls. But you and me? We'll just keep walking, sunglasses on and eyes fixed squarely ahead.			"

								As fun as this game is, the production is almost non-existent. Devs almost never talk to the community. You know how long it took them to churn out Alpha 1.16? 10 months, for an abysmal update, and they only ever talked to us once or twice, and that was them trying to give us bulshit reasons as to why they won't make their game. This is nothing but a smash and grab game, made to look cool so they can take your money and never give it back. Great buisiness model guys! You've successfully used the Steam refund system to your own advantage! Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the devs are starting to act childish. ""Don't mind the hate, we don't :)"" you better start minding the hate, if you don't fix this sh!t you're going to lose everything. This is to everyone on Steam, stay away from this game!			"

								It's got potential. If only we could do something about the shotguns one-shotting Zombies, it would be a wonderful game. I like the fact that clearly, the missions are meant to have some challenge to them; sacrificing individuals to kill stronger enemies, luring enemies out, using the arch-types effectively is a MUST. I also like the fact that the arch-types reanimate their foes, it's nice to know that when my Speed Zombie is cutting a swath of death through SWAT soldiers, it's fallen prey will revive and help continue the fight.I /LOVE/ the fact that the Humans retain their appearance they had when alive, as Zombies, rather than relying on a single model. However, I have a few problems with the game:AI: I dislike how the Zombies act like foolhardy lemmings and just all charge a nearby enemy without me saying so, it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to try and keep them from rushing out of cover and being mowed down accordingly, it's also a pain to get a large group through a door in a timely manner. Weapon Balancing: Shotguns are more powerful at range than Assault Rifles. WAT. I'd understand if it's like, a one-hit up close, but the range of shotguns is just annoying as all hell.But, overall, it is a game with potential, and while it has problems, it's considerabley better than most other Indy strategy games, and I look foward to tracking this as it updates accordingly.

								DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.The object of this game and the idea are amazing, this game would be innovative if the devs would finish it. this game seems to be in eternal early access, enough said, not worth your money at all, unless they actually end up finishing it. which i highly doubt it considering how long its been in early access.[Update]It seems as though they will not be finishing this game. The last update was 7 months ago, and we haven't heard anything from the Devs since. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It will be $15 straight down the toilet. They have abandoned this project. Unless they spontaniously release another update, this will stay Not recommended from me.[Update]Sorry, but i forgot to mention the bug i've encountered that has rendered this game impossible to play. All characters are headless and textures are purely black. I can't see what the hell is going on, i've tried EVERYTHING to figure out the problem, and from what i hear i am the only person who has encountered this. This is the only game i have any trouble playing, so it's not my hardware or my software. Just....SERIOUSLY....DON'T BUY THIS GAME.			"

								$15 for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombie-themed RTS thing. If you are even remotely thinking about buying this, you need to go on a long walk and have some serious self-reflective inner monologue because that is a very bad idea. If you were hoping for something along the lines of Stubbs the Zombie, then this is a woefully underwhelming unloved younger sibling of it. To pay even $5 for this atrocious abortion of a zombie game would be a bad decision. Anyone with financial freedom, stay far away from this game. It's been abandoned by the devs and the last meaningful update was over a year ago. Scumbag devs took the money and ran and are doing just enough to keep the steam store page up so they can get more money. This game is not worth it and deserves to be shut down. These devs should be ashamed at this mediocre piece of work and they probably would be if they weren't so scummy and greedy beyond belief.			"

								I purchased this game when it first became available and despite not having much content it was quite fun. The next few paragraphs covers a period of time when the Devs went AWOL for a good few months. They have since returned, and are now actively working on the game again, so please either skip the next 3 paragraphs or continue reading until the end. Thanks.No updates since december and the ONLY activity on the forums is always just a couple of lines denying this game is dead and a short explanation about how busy they have been with new babies etc...I believe they have no intentions of developing this game any further and are simply cashing in until it is removed from sale. If this is not the case, then a simple progress update on the forums once a month would go a long way. So my recommendation is, DO NOT BUY a game where the developers can't even be bothered to spend a couple of minutes once a month to update their paying customers.1/10EDIT: After several months of hearing virtually nothing from the Devs they have finally posted a status report. While it is almost 6 months since the game was last updated, at least it now appears the game has not been abandoned.I would still advise people not to buy the game, at least until more content is added. I will revise my review, if and when more content is added.EDIT#2: It's been 2 months since the status report and there has been no further contact and no new content.     I've added a link to a Steam Group dedicated to bringing in some kind of regulation to Early Access games.          http://steamcommunity.com/groups/earlyaccessrefundgroupEDIT#3: The game has had an update, with the promise of more to come. Still don't think it's worth the asking price currently but what is in the game, is well polished and bug free.   3/10EDIT#4: It seems the Devs are putting more time and effort in to the game since the long awaited update (see EDIT#3). Another small update has been added with the promise of more to come, including an upgrade to the game engine.Seems like things are finally moving in the right direction again and having been one of their harshest critics in the past, I feel i should give them the benefit of the doubt.I sincerely hope this game goes from strength to strength and turns into the gem of a game i hoped it would when i first got on board.5/10EDIT#5: 10 months since the last update and suprise, suprise, virtually no communication from the Dev's and no new content.Maybe we will see updates in the future but to be honest, i don't care anymore. 2.5/10			"

Keep it on your list for the future though.

Early Access Review
								I loved the game. it seems the Devs. are running behind on it, which i hate... its a good idea of a game to put you in control of a horde of zombies instead of blasting away at them like every other game now-a-days... but i'm with the group when this game is dead and the creators just took the money... It's sad.... i just wish people would stick to their creation and complete it instead of putting it on early access just to get money out of gamers...thats f*cked up. there is no decency in indie devs anymore. they take advantage of gamers who like to play cool looking games. tisk tisk...

								There are hundreds upon thousands of zombie survival simulators out there, but this one let's the user assume the role of the other side for once.  No longer must you cower in fear in some corner, starving to death because you're afraid to go outside.  As the ""undead overlord"", you'll control swarms of zombie units with intent on creating mass destruction.  It's currently a single player game with limited functionality and bugs (as one would expect from an Alpha build), though the developer did mention multiplayer, a human campaign, and map editor as ""stretch goals""...meaning these features will be added IF they receive enough support.  I'll be interested to see what direction this particular game takes during the Early Access stage.

								This game was coming along fine, with some interesting gameplay. But it hasn't been updated in 7 months as of this review. If they would have kept with it, and updating it, I would give it a thumbs up.The overall idea is cool. You control the undead, and use them to wipe out the city. You can either eat the humans to regain health, or change them into zombies, to add to your army. You can merge zombies into more powerful undead creatures, and use special abilities with these creatures.Like I said, it was looking great. I'd have loved to see a completed game. I guess they didn't get the support they were looking for.Addition: I am writing this addition to my review  about 14 months after my initial review. Since my initial review, the developers have disappeared again. There was a minor (and I mean VERY minor) patch about eleven months ago. Since then nothing.i am not saying the following out of anger or malice. But this game needs to be pulled. I would like my money back, but I'd settle for it being dropped from Steam, and the developers barred from Steam. This game hands out promises like a politician, and like a politician forgot all about their supporters once they had their money.In the two years I've had this game, it's hardly made any progress at all. They've tweaked some of the levels, and that's it. It's been version 1.16 for almost a year now.			"

Early Access Review
								NEWEST UPDATE ON MY REVIEW:The developers updated the game!!! They are working on it! If they keep this up, they will get a recommended review from me! Two more missions and some more content, not sure it was worth the wait but still this shows the developers still care about their game to some degree...OLDER UPDATE ON MY REVIEW:Interestingly enough, it does seem as if the developers are working on this. It isn't plainly obvious to everyone, but evidence is there. If you were to veiw the developer's posts, you will find that the developers are commenting on people's comments that question whether they are working on the game. The commenting on these questions are always along the lines of yes, they are working on the game. The developers have notably hinted that they have a community manager, and that this manager seems to have gone. So, this is supposedly the reason why we hear so little coverage on the progression of this game. Also, they hinted other complications such as some sort of problems with jobs and 'life intervening', as they say. They have stated that they are currently working on the next patch/update, but that it will take longer than expected by us, the gamers, and them, the developers. Still, though, I can't really recommend the game until I know for sure that the game is being worked (waiting for an update)...MY REVIEW:Do I reccomend this game? Well, in it's current state... it's a no from me and I think you'll find it's a no from- now quite a numerous amount of- other players.The game Undead Overlord pleasantly suprised me when I first played it back in 2014; upon first glance of the game I suppose it isn't difficult to mistake this for a really short, unresponsive, ugly, glitchy and really not fun to play game. I bought this game with an open mind, a mind open to the probability that this game is what could have been what I mentioned just before. I played the game and find out that the game ran smootly, apart from only a few apparent glitches and the occasional unresponsive zombie. Most of all, however, it was fun. The game looked, and still is, rough around the edges and has quite a bit of content that is not present yet (I say yet, but some things may never be added). Despite this, it was FUN. One thing I enjoyed was commanding the shambling, blood thirsty and brain hungry zombies to attack the puny human meatsacks which attempted to run away in fear or dared to stand in the mighty Overlord's way by trying to eliminate my increasingly growing horde. There were other aspects which I enjoyed also, such as sacrificing a percentage of my horde to create a bigger badass zombie and breaking the lid (doors) of a lunch box (building) to get to the delicious food inside (the tasty human flesh) and upon entering, indulged upon a free all zombies-can-eat buffet and left with a bigger horde and a fuller stomach. In all seriousness, I liked this game.Though however, this is ruined by the sheer lack of updates and and the fact that the developers seem to have abonded this game. This makes me concerned for the wellfare and playability of this game in future. A update hasn't been released since around Christmas, which is about over four months ago I think. If an update hasn't been released in four months, what honestly is the probability of this game being complete at all? The developers will have to pull some sort of miracle in order to complete this game, let alone repair it's reputation. The only thing I can hope for- that anyone could hope for- is that the game is due an absolutely giant update that will give players something to play for a long duration of time. Either that or the bigger stuff is only coming when the game is complete/released fully. In which case, the game would be more a demo than a game. But shouldn't a demo be free? But then again.. the don't the developers need money for development? Is this game really just a demo, but rendered a Early Access game so the developers can get money? There a few questions which can be asked about this game, but likely will not be answered.I'm not one to decide wether the developers should be or should not be working on the development of this game, but I think that they should work on this; this game seems unique and seems to be few of a kind. If they aren't working on the game, it would be common decency for them to announce this, rather than just take up and leave without and indication in the slightest. Also, maybe even a price reduction (if they already have enough money to develop this if development is still continuing). Maybe even an apology for quiting on the game, or opposed to this an anouncement that clearly states the game is being worked on. I believe that the game probably is being worked on; community silence doesn't mean they aren't working on the game.It kinda makes me angry how players are flaming over the fact that progress is taking too long, people need to realise developers have lives too. They are probably occupied with more important matters, or they could even be doing a really good update and are perfecting it as we speak. Still though, it is kinda likely that the game isn't being worked on.With that said, players do still need some sign that the game is being worked on, and some new content needs to arrive eventually. Only then can I and other players properly recommend this game. The game has, or had, a lot of potential, but unfortunately potential alone is not success or a deciding factor to buy a game. I personally think that it would be worth investing time and some money else where, in another Early Access game that you know for sure is being worked on.			"

If not you just prove my point.-------------------------------------------------------------EditSo the dev's are coming back so there is still a possibility for improvement for this game but until then my review will remain negative. Hopefully it'll become a yes rather than a no but time will tell.--------------------------------------------------------------Second editIts been over a month. This game is as dead as dico. The only thing alive are the people on the forums badgering over refunds and how dead the game is.-------------------------------------------------------------Third edit 1/27/2016So the team is still working on this project, however due to the nature of how things have been, I will wait until the game is fully released to create a new review.

								This game can be great. Instead of killing zombies you controll them witch is fun and you don't see many games that do this.Its in alpha but shows a lot of potential to become a great game. I'm hoping for new levels to come as soon as possible. Obviously there was some stuff that i didn't like. Such as the way the zombies behave. For example when you tell them to attack someone even tough they are getting their♥♥♥♥♥kicked they completely ignore the person thats tryng to kill them. So pretty much what you do in this game is to tell them where to go and they handle the rest. The heart beat when your chaos meter gets filled up is really loud and annoying... So on. I am writing these of the top of my head so i probably will froget about some of them. Played all the current levels. First 3 was a blast to play. Skirmish map however is really really hard.The last map is only for alpha players and it basicly lets you spawn any npc you want and just do as you please witch was the best map for me. I dont think there will be anything like a map editor/creator. At least i havent heard of it. If there is and i think there HAS TO BE a map editor. That would give the game so much replay value.So AI acts stupid sometimes. Both zombies and humans. Haven't come across any bugs. The existing levels are pretty good but there is room for improvement. Other than that this game is really fun to play and it has an idea that we don't see in games very often. I cant say you will like the game but i certinly love zombie games and this was one of the best i played as far as the gameplay goes...			"

If it was updated its an easy high score for me but because of the lack of content for a huge period of time and the fact the devs arent even giving us a single report explaining problems a day or two after it happens I cannot give it a high score the concept deserves.

								Just got the game. It's got a very unique feel to me. You can definitely tell undead overlord is still in alpha stage, but i also see a lot of potential for this game, it's crazy short right now is my only problem with it, other than that i enjoy it immensely and look forward to seeing what they do with it. My only wish with the controls at the moment is the ability to hotkey a small group for better flanking of the uninfected, the pesky humans run so fast, and there is no escape from shotguns. All minor complaints aside, this game is fun, and i look forward to what it turns into. Keep up the good work.			"

								The game concept i find truly thrilling however these guys didnt do it right, the odds to even gaining a powerful enough horde to take on 2 guys with shotguns is literally 3 zombies to 1 gunner, double that and you need to triple the zombie count so 4 gunners 18 zombies because they just get slaughtered and even the tank zombie gets gunned down by either 2 guys with machine guns or shotguns, should call it the hey kill me the toughest zombie/ useless mofo my team has.I know this game is early access but ive played indie games with little backing and for free with a better setup than this, dont spend your money on this game its a waste, i was browsing looking for something quirky instead i got a heap of crud.Save yourself money and dont buy this over rated scrap!

								Well, before I tell you what Undead Overlord is, let us first cover the basics of what it is not. It's not finished for one thing. A second key point that is worth mentioning is that it is not a game with femiliar gameplay. Both these 2 things are being said not in a negitive sense, not at all. They are just worth being noted before i go into what the game is.Undead Overlord, I saw this awhile back on Kickstarter. The concept of being the zombie-leader-commander was a very good hook, and still is. The game never made it to being fully funded. But now its been out for early access, which is cool. Gameplay is unique a bit clunky on a few things, but taking into account the game isn't finished yet should put some minds at ease for the time being. The game plays like a RTS but most of the time I feel like i'm always starting out with a infantry-flood tactic, which I suppose is to be expected (because you're zombies). All things considered, the game does show alot of promise, weather it can get rolling is up to funding and a whole lot of drive to see this through to the end.			"

Were you really expecting a whole 10 levels and HD quality graphics? Those are pretty rare on greenlight.			"

Early Access Review
								You already know it's beta so don't get too super hyped right away it's going to take time but so far from what ive played for the few hours it took to get my fun out of it, it's pretty good zombies feel close to how you'd expect them to, humans aim for the head.. so using you abilities help you out in some tight spots. At the time of this review there are only three missions which are okay but the human ai isn't too realistic they stand in one spot usually waiting for you, but the actual zombie part feels a lot like infectionator with direct zombie control. The mission map could be bigger for sure, but as a learning tutorial grounds i'd say it fits pretty well in getting you started. The skirimish map is the next thing you can do after missions, (or right away like i did) where you have to destroy the human base with the starting zombies you get, where you have to get past mines and seemingly random human placement in general areas ( different people spawn in the same spots sorta) That was only really difficult if you didn't use the mutants, if you're a fan of the normal zombies however using the action skill it has usually can help get that beat. the map isnt super well made but its long and has tons of people and all the mutants unlocked for you to try. The last part which i found to be awesome as hell is the alpha mode where you get a large area full of destructables and a building where you can place in mines, civilians, militia/gunmen, goats and zombies and test out scenarios or have a huge person zombie war... I wasted so many zombies on a wall of survivors.... so far 3D infectionator-like game is pretty small a couple of hours long for me but it's alright maybe the zombies could have horde animations rather than just single zombie ones so that in a horde it looks more like an attack rather than single punches			"

								I love the concept of this game, I have always wanted a game where I can control the zombie side and take on the humans. Despite the concept here, the execution is rather lacklustre. This is an early access game, however I don't think this should relieve it of any criticism whatsoever and the really unfortunate thing is that this game is bad. the graphics are awful, dull and featureless, which is evident from the loading screen at the start, which isn't just ugly, it also looks incredibly stupid. The gameplay is entirely shallow, all you do is run around chasing civilians who run away (which is pretty frustrating) or run head on at armed forces until they die. There seems to be no strategic depth here at all, all the missions involve just killing everyone on the level, even the skirmish maps, which are slightly larger versions of the campaign map. This game is really disappointing, especially given the intended features are pretty sparse and patches are few and far between. I would not recommend buying this game until you can see it in full release.			"

								for 15$ it gets boring after like the first lvl. all u do is run around as a zombie killing/eating people till u get a nice size horde...   then u attack an objective and hope u can overrun them. it has good potential but its not being all it could be. i know its only in beta but a 10$ price tag would have made me feel alot better. not really worth the money in its current state. keep in mind its still in beta tho.

Early Access Review
								This game sounded interesting and fun at first, before I actually tried it. Not really worth buying at this stage, and it might not be worth buying at all. The gameplay is really bland and I couldn't play for more than 15 minutes, but hey, maybe it'll be better in the future. But for now, DO NOT BUY.EDIT -Wow, a little under a year later and this game is STILL as bland as ever. The devs have not updated this game in a very long time with little to no communication with the players. I want my money back. My only regret is that Steam's new refund system came out after I bought this game, so it was too late to get myself a refund. DO NOT BUY.EDIT 2 -Jesus Christ they actually updated it a few months ago. But the update was the SMALLEST PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥TO EVER. Especially because of the amount of time they had us wait (nearly under a year) for the next update, and the fact that it was a very small update just makes it all the more insulting. You'd expect that there'd be a large update after so much time with an apology, but no, it was a very small update. Now they've gone under the radar AGAIN. See you all when the next update comes out in the next year or so.			"

								Its a good game with modest goals, but severe lack of updates gives it a feeling that it will never be finished. I enjoy the game for what it is, but I think the money i spent on this game will not be worth it in the end. Get this game if you just want an RTS with 3 missions and 2 skirmish maps, for it will never be done and your money wasted.			"

								This Game has such high potential. The Release date says ""July 18, 2014"", so I'm not sure if they're still going to release it or not, but I fully think they should. It's a fun little RTS game, and could eventually have an unlimited campaign / skrimish options.The graphics are obviously on the low end side, but it doesn't take away from the game itself. I like the over view AoM / Sim City game play style, although I think it needs better map navigation.It's unique, and powerfully addicting. Or maybe that's because I have a weird Zombie Addiction.But to wrap this review all up, I really think this company needs to push forward and release this.- I I I			"

								Undead Overlord has some potential to be good fun once some more missions and features are added but right now their is really not a whole lot to do.the zombie mechnics are fun and the idea of swarming fortifed locations with an undead horde is compelling and if this game were to ever feature some from of VS multiplayer with one person as a human and the other as the zombies with a fog of war system added this could prove to be a fantastic little title.in its current state i cannot reccomend it but i dont want to give it negative feedback because what i did play of it so far (alpha 1.13) is fun			"

								This game is still in early access, so although the gameplay is short and somewhat lacking, the potentail of this game is amazing. It would be awesome if you could control a zombie directly, so your zombie army has a general. This is a feature in a flash game i like,and it was the key to some of the harder battles. I dont want to rate the game yet, as it is not complete, but i hope it will be at least an 8/10.			"

So, I replayed the last mission just for practice before moving on to the skirmish.  Good thing too because it is where this game's potential is truly shown.   This is just a teaser but it has done its job....want more!  I'll be first in line to get the beta.			"

								let me say when I purchased this game over a year and a half ago I enjoyed it the few missions and undone game that is, so it is with regret that I change my review to negative as the devs have had ample oppurtunity to turn the game around, either sell this game to another developer with the source code or really get to work on finishing the game a sale and new positive reviews will help you as devs also offer to refund all gamers who bought your game early on, This is an example of where early access can go seriously wrong I hope the developers can come to a good solution between themeselves and the gamers			"
