												Its one of those stupid wait-in-real-time for stuff to construct/unlock deals. Its 23 MBs, download it and see for yourself. Its clear in the first 10 mins. Also no music or sounds.Pay-to-win/not grind.Avoid like the plague.2015 Edit: I believe sounds and music has been patched in now. Too bad the fun hasn't. Still a piece of crap.			"

												Typical browsergame style city building game. This means: Everything takes ages. And then more ages. And then a lot of ages. And then you decide to quit before everything takes even longer. DLC is far too expensive. But for that price you get some bonuses that make the game a bit less unplayable... timed bonuses, of course! Yes, you can invest roughly 500 Euro (without the initial 75p discount) to get bonuses that last for up to a year. For that price you get over 40 times the Skyrim Legendary Edition on sale, or still 16 times without a sale of which each one lasts for up to a year also if you play for several hours every day. With the difference that Skyrim actually is good.An example: You build your building in a minute. Then you upgrade it in an hour. Then you upgrade it in I think three or six hours. Then in 24 hours. And that is only if you have enough people.Wait, what? Yes, you need free people to upgrade buildings. Which you get - surprise - by building and upgrading certain buildings. If you have partial people, the upgrade takes longer.Then there is science, which works pretty well so far, except everything takes ages. The first science thing is done in an hour. Then if you upgrade your buildings science goes faster, but you can't upgrade enough in a reasonable time to make it worthwhile.The ""innovative"" system that makes you not grinding is - you guess it - resources trickle at a ridiculous small rate (since you'd need to upgrade buildings to get more resources) while you're offline. You can use them then to upgrade buildings and build armies. At which point you probably rather want to play through Ride to Hell: Retribution, Secret of the Magic Crystals, Rambo, Kane & Lynch 2 or even E.T. 2600 because you have more fun there.EDIT: Just found an official screenshot that demonstrates how long this game takes. You need ONE YEAR real time for a research later:http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/290730/ss_7fd489353b52c1ff006af97340b652cbca85c70f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1410965823EDIT 2: I received a developer reply in the comments on 8 October 2014 which is reproduced here:Arbash  [developer] Just now  As proceeding in the game you will be able to accelerate science not only by building and upgrading more alchemist labs, but by applying various magic items. And keep in mind - the objective of the game is not to build and to study everything there is, but to fight and/or ally other players.EDIT 3: I just found you can't even get all achievements without paying a lot of real money or completely ignoring quests. Things like completing 150 quests in a row extort you by adding timed quests where you need to buy stuff with the real money currency. So you either farm that ingame, completely ignoring quests until then, or you pay with real money. The instant you click on the quest menu, the timed quest is started. Very annoying!			"

												this is my first reviw of any game.. and i have been around steam for a few years...i rait NO to My Lands Black Gem Hunting.. for several reasons.. and i have over 145 hours on this game1) the player base is 75% russian.. that in it self is not a bad thing... but 90% of the in game mails you send to people.. answer back ""no english""... ok as i speak only english that is my problem i know.... but as a vast majority of the high ranked players are russian... when you finaly claw your way to the top ranking....you dont stay long.2) i played on both servers... at one point soon after steam release... there was  aprox 9000+ players on each server..now there is aprox 3500 and at any given point 700+ online... and the stats for active kingdoms keep falling..3) this game was released back in 2011.. it is 2014.... it almost plays like a Face book game... without the face book.. the cost for Black Gems. if you buy them in real life cash..... is heartbreaking... the devolpers claime that the Rank 7 ruins have up to 100k black gems in them.. i am at the stage where i can kill rank 5 ruins (with about 5% losses and much planing) i have not found a rank 7 ruin yet... but the rank 6 ruins have about 3x the troops that a rank 5 does.. and about 20-30 Black gems in them....THEY WANT YOU TO SPEND REAL LIFE MONEY on the game....so yes... i am a bit upset that after finally making 5 star rank... i get totaly destroyed by a whole allaince attacking me ..they send therir lower ranked people to kill buildings and defensives.. and as a higer ranked player you cant do anything to stop them but hide your troops and try to rebuild... but  that is a loosing proposition... so when you try to fight back.. the players that are the same rank as you.. (remember thy lower ranked has alread devistated your defenses) the attack and kill off all your troops... now you have to rebuild EVERYTHING all over... since this game is based on ALL attack... all rankings are based on wining attacks... there is nothing based on trying to defend... no defensive states... and no real defensive stratagies except for staying small and not letting the ranked players attack... at that is the real reason i give this game a NO.... the game has no balance			"

For example, the guy who played it ""for over two years"" has all the playtime in it over past two weeks:


All the playtime for ""over two years"" has been idled in less than two weeks. Nice job, man.

The only reason I can think of that would explain all the simple ""I recommend"" reviews would be some sort of review reward campaign they did (Which steam should do something about...).  Didn't play it much, but its very poorly designed, another one of those pay2win (And from reading up and looking at prices, its pretty insane on the amount their requesting) games where in order to build anything late game, you have to wait 2 weeks unless you want to put down some money to have it done instantly.

												Shameless pay-to-win.This is a ""time management"" game. You acquire basic resources over time, use them to make buildings and troops that allow you to get and store more resources, build more buildings, and continue the cycle. It has the typical limits to building construction, and a research system that is required to unlock everything from adding other users to your contacts list to building defenses to hiring troops.Black gems are purchased for real money. This is where things get ugly. You can technically acquire black gems through playing, but if you're really lucky you might earn 1 or 2 per day. Research and building upgrades typically require black gems for the higher tiers. Hero equipment and general buffs can only be purchased with black gems. The cheapest thing you can buy for black gems costs 10 of them, and prices quickly escalate to the hundreds, thousands, and even hundreds of thousands of black gems. This means that you're required to spend thousands of real dollars if you want to do well. Many, if not most, of the quests are simply to buy a buff for black gems, and have a time limit that will cause you to fail the quest (and some of the achievements) if you don't pay real money immediately.Quests and other actions are not explained well, so players have to guess what most actions do, and what different values mean.There isn't any action in the game. There are attacks, but they're simply calculations and RNG that happens behind the scenes. You never see a battle.There aren't many bugs, but there are some game-breaking bugs. For example, my hero was killed on a mission, and didn't become available to respawn in the place where he was supposed to. I tried hiring a new hero to replace him, but couldn't because the game said I already had a hero, so I became permanently stuck without a hero.If a player who is stronger than you decides to attack you, they can destroy almost everything you have, and leave you unable to retaliate. You can normally only attack players who are the same level as you, but paid buffs can allow you to attack any other player. This means that days or even months of effort will be destroyed any time a P2W player decides that it would be amusing to destroy a non-P2W player. This can also undo any progress you've made with the help of the extremely overpriced DLCs.The graphics are very plain. They're not great, but not bad either.There isn't much audio, and what little there is gets repetitive very quickly. Luckily, you can mute it.If you leave don't play for 4 days, your resource production and research will stop, and your units will begin leaving. If you go for too long without playing (they don't state how long) then your account is deleted. You can pay to prevent your account from being deleted for some time, but that means that you're paying to not play this game.On a positive note, there is an official wiki, which is linked to in-game. Unfortunately, the English version is very lacking.			"

												I like this game, it is basically a FB game as everyone else's reviews have been about. The thing I like most about this one though is you control how long or fast the building will be produced, higher population equals more workers/builders which means faster time to produce resources or a building. The only thing that seems to take forever in real time is research which again the more you have buildings that produce research and people to run those buildings the faster it will be. I don't know about it being a pay to win game there are gems which is RL money but people have been saying you'll be able to find them in game however not that far yet. Only thing I can truely say is if you want something to pass the time and like fantasy time games try it out. If you're more of the now a day generation where if it doesn't have a Frostbite 3 engine you won't try it....well then don't try it..			"

												Well thats the first time i see a browser game in Steam.Ok i've played it long before it found its way here and let me make a few things clear.1. Its not Pay 2 Win. If you're actually good at the game you're going to make more prepaid currency (Black Gems) than you'll ever need from fighting NPCs.2. You can then turn the Black Gems into real cash and send it to your PayPal. Yes, you can actually get money for playing it... this is as far from Pay 2 Win as it can get. Ofc you'll need to get good at the game in order to do that.. and a little lucky.3. Its by far the best game of its type (the browser massive online strategy games). Its pretty deep in terms of units, development, managment, movement etc.4. What i dont like is that they didnt rly seem to bother much with the transition from browser to launcher. Theres no music, no voiced dialog or any of that stuff that you would expect from a downloadable game.So all and all i would reccomend it IF you're into this type of games.			"

												I do not inherently have a problem with flash-based browser games making their way onto Steam.I can forgive a lacklustre presentation where none of your buildings are animated, yet buildings is 80% of what you'll be watching.I can even tolerate a game moving at a glacial pace through unlocking its features, with waiting research times of over two days in the early game.But if your game is this threadbare then I'd at least expect it to consistently start, which this does not.No error messages, no server maintenance notification, just gets stuck on a loading screen.With the slew of free to play titles available on Steam there is absolutely no reason to play this one.

												TL;DR: Play this game if you like spending 5 minutes in a loading screen, hitting three buttons (Far less interaction than even clash of clans style games) and then waiting 10-20 hours for a task to complete.This doesn't belong on Steam. It doesn't even meet the standards of Facebook, or most mobile games. It rips off many games of the genre and therefore it is, objectively, garbage and shouldn't exist. It's soulless trash that was not made by anyone with a love for games. I cannot stress how much higher quality Facebook games are than this. I think this might be the worst 'game' I've ever played.Some of the screens look like it may get more interesting later, but the introduction is absolutely abysmal and unfun (Edit: 7 hours in, still not interesting). This game consists mostly of waiting and loading. Once you're actually in the game there's about 5-15 seconds worth of activity and then you're waiting hours again. At least with most waiting games there is some stuff to do after you log in.Pros:-Excellent torture device-Showcases how garbage can get through the Greenlight system-Showcases how the Review system cannot be trusted. This game has went from listing mostly negative reviews to suddenly being highly rated due to an influx of positive Russian ratings. I wonder if the developer offered some reward for posting good reviews. (Edit: They did)Cons:- #1 issue: Not fun. I don't see how anyone could enjoy this. It's like some social experiment to see if people will play utter garbage. I can't tell if this is some magnificent trolling.- Mostly derivative garbage. This follows the exact route of every other 'pay to not wait' game, but somehow is so much worse than what you expect from Facebook and mobile. I've played games similar to this, such as the web-based Might and Magic. I didn't like that, but it was much better than this.- Extremely poor translation- Long load times. Takes like 5 minutes to open on a mid-high range computer.- Extremely poor graphics. Worse than most Facebook games. 1995/99 era graphics.- No Audio- Much lower production quality than most Facebook games.- No Steam Overlay- Poor pacing. Only played for like 10 minutes before the game made me wait an hour to play again. After that, I logged in, hit two buttons and was told to wait 10 hours for the next task. Why on earth would I want to when I can spend my time doing something fun instead.Edit: 7 hours (Played) in and it's still the same boring thing.			"

												This game is all about building & strategy & waiting and/or paying.I started playing this because i got a free DLC for this.PRO:- Building design is nice, skill trees are usual for a strategy game.- The game guides you when doing missions (the game tells you what to do).- There is an active community ???, but I don't know why.- Makes me want to play an Age of Empires/strategy game.CON:- You can't build 2 buildings at the same time, forcing you to wait for the 1st to finish.- Same goes for upgrading buildings, I upgraded 1 and now the game forces me to wait 1h before I can do anything else.- Pay to play, or pay so you don't have to wait and you can click and wait again, or pay of course.- Background map could have better graphics, looks like a cheap browser game.- You can't actually play this, you can, for example, play another game while waiting for a building to finish.- The game has lots of spelling mistakes for my language (Dutch).- The game forces me to play under a wrong flag, only based on language ?- DLC is getting more resources or 'quicken' the waiting times. & they are overpriced.So, play an Age of Empires/another strategy game instead, happy gaming.

												So this is an MMO stratedgy game: you make choices about how your fantasy kingdom developes and expands by setting research and production goals.  Then you construct armies that fight NCP and player armies automatically.  You try to expand your territories until you are in a state of constant war with your neighbors, who did the same thing but maybe with a different stratedgy.This isn't an terrible game of this type, but there were much, much better games of this type, with far more to do, before the whole ""F2P; P2W"" trend started.  I've played games of this type that let you do more things, more often, earlier in your cities developement (because they weren't hoping you would pay to speed things up) as well as games that just had way more you could do (such as games that let march heroes around your territory fighting little monsters while your were waiting on research, or games that had big books of spells and such you could cast).  Ultimately. this game is ok, but there are deeper, more invovled games of the same type you could play for free that would be more fun.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of strategic diversity--its not like you can focus on magic, espionage, your military, or your economy to create a unque play style--everyone is going to be be playing more or less the same way.  If you like the general concept of this game, google around for a bit and you'll probably find something you'd enjoy more.			"

												Seems to be a good F2P real strategy game;Unique graphics, I quite enjoy the style. No music (I don't really need it as the longer you play this game the less you have to be on because building times and such get higher and higher)Some people are falsely claiming that you have to wait 3 days for a building to go from Level 2 to 3 what's totally wrong. You can adjust the laborers you have who build your city and adjusting the amount of laborers changes the build time. I have to wait about 2 hours with 320 builders to achieve level 3 Castle.Microtransactions; Seems to be evened out quite nicely, no massive P2W stuff except that you can buy higher production rate what gives you an advantage over other players. I have yet to explore the attacking part of the game.			"

												TL;DR : Nice Concept, Poor Execution. No Sound, Microtransactions. Quite fun to play as a break. 7/10FULL REVIEW.This game is interesting to say the least, but somewhat lacking in it's delivery.Let's start with me turning the game on, quick download, quick start up, Simple graphics, but not terrible. However, no sound.I first thought it was a bug or something but after checking a few times, this game dosent have sound files. At all.This game looks and sort of plays like a Facebook game, but it is more easily compared to Travian, in which you create homes, on a hexagonal area, build up resources and expand to different areas. At time of writing i have only played about an hour.The game is ported from a mobile game (as clear in some text documents) but they have changed the interface to make it more PC gamer friendly, and I commend them for that. A nice simple tutorial quest system that goes on for about 20 minutes before you were considered to be in charge of what you were doing, which is nice. The combat system is good at a glance, simple RTS but on a longer timescale. Creating troops and having them fight on a different area. It reminds me of the Total War series, but backwards. You manage a city and what buildings appear, but then have a larger map view to move armies around a hexagonal area. These hexagons have different boosts to different units and make an intresting combat system.Like all facebook games it seems plagued with micro-transactions. Which in my opinion are not an issue. They are not predominant on the screen and you have to go through several clicking to speed up a process. It's there, but not directly advertised. Besides, a free to play game has to make money somehow.As I sit here waiting for my population to rise so I can build more buildings to gather more resources, I am pulled in by a strange charm to this game. It feels a bit like alot of other games, but has a much better combat and fighting system. I can only reccommend you at least try this game, just to see if it intrests you.To see more Free-To-Play reviews visit my profile and check out my other reviews.www.twitter.com/Xelforce "

Could be true, but I doubt you can actually do this, as the game is so P2W that to achieve anything you have to pay, a lot. What's the profit then.	Feauturing 4 absolutely same races (with different pictures), typical browser-based gameplay with battle reports only, premium currency 'Black Gems' which can make ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING in the game harder/better/faster/stronger, heroes with unique artefacts and sets (for Black Gems only).	The biggest fail imo: when Steam version was launched (4 years after release), they didn't actually transfer or merge anything. Just 2 separate Steam servers were created with no possibility to even transfer existing account from browser version to Steam. Of course dedicated people who played this game for years and invested a lot of money didn't want to start again with new empty accounts. Also, (hilarious but true!!) Steam servers and browser servers run different version of the game, with Steam being several patches behind!!! It even lacks some important content as I've heard. So obviously, Steam version, as some smart guy said, is literally 'playing with itself', while browser version (if to trust developers) still keeps several thousands active accounts. Yeah, the game was popular when just released. Too bad I didn't play it back then, people say it wasn't P2W yet, and was pretty damn fun.	Abusive monetization starts with the very first quest and keeps getting harder and harder, you see this 'Black Gems required' everywhere. Yeah you can actually mine those in mystical 'Saline Lakes' in very very lategame, but from what I heard they are extremely hard to keep control of. Or you can buy BG on auction for tons of gold.	Can't tell anything about strategic (military) depth as I didn't play it that long. What I have seen is pretty big amount of various buildings (as for browser game), 6 resources, 8 units (again, same for all races, with different pictures) and sheet-ton of artifacts and sets for heroes to purchase.	Tell you a story. I spent good time once (not so long ago) searching for a good quality BBMMORTS. Most of that time went into filtering these countless 'facebook strategy' clones for 10 y.o kids, reetardedly simple and bright and with same awful money-sucking monetization. And my guess is, these genre just outlived itself. NOTHING of OGame-quality (or at least close to) was found. Just Travian, which I won't play because I hate its comical-style. And this one, My Lands.	Not sure what this game was before, as it was pretty popular (and not only in Russia). But right now it's just a money-sucking machine. And not captivating at all. Perhaps focused at draining funds from existing playerbase. Just don't play it. Play OGame (or don't, if you care about your nerves and lifetime).Class: II - CrapVerdict: NoReviewed: 1.20.2016DLC: Age of Prosperity - Premium DLC Pack, Hero Courage - Starter DLC Pack, Miner’s Luck - Starter DLC PackServer: Arhon (Economic) - SteamApproach: Steam - PCTime: Several Dozen HoursDeeds: 1 Achievement 90% Researches 35 Alchemist Labs Level 5 In 1 City 1 City Full Of Max Level Buildings Without Opening Gate Once "

												This game makes a nice break to the day and doesn't require heavy micromanagement.  There is no endless clicking of buildings to collect resources like other games; resources automatically collect in your warehouses.  I prefer that much more than other RTS games where you have to log in exactly when buildings are full to manually collect resources.  While the game is light on the micromanaging, it is not light on strategy.  You need to think and plan in advance to outsmart other players that want what you've got and are scheming how to take it.   You might find yourself staying up scouring the internet for strategies and guides, and each one leaves you with multitudes of ways to achieve your goals, but not all of the ways will be best for your race, hero, and play style.  The best thing I enjoy though is the hero system.  Each hero class is unique and customizable at higher levels.  The NPC monster ruins that pop up provide an addicting hunt and kill component, and if you are good enough, eventually you will find and conquer ruins with monster bosses which can reward you with hoards of loot.

They happen to pull the timed quests on you that forces you to pay money to complete.There is nothing of merit about this game.

												There must have been something to reward writing positive reviews for this game. The amount of ""awesome game"" (without any reasons / points) - reviews is tremendous, which also explains the ""very positive"" rating it has. Trust me: it is NOT!The game does poorly in almost every way and a lot of browsergames in the past did almost everything better whiel still being cheaper. The prices are insane (1$ for speeding up a 1-minute-construction, are you serious? o.O), the graphic is neither good nor aesthetic, there is not a single tone of sound played in the whole game and the tutorial is made in the worst way. I do not see any reason for anyone to play this game and I am pretty glad I can remove this one from my library with a good feeling.			"

												 Played this few years ago via browser. Back then, they were telling, and i guess they still do, that it is a first game you can make money on.  I'm actually surprised this... product have made it that far. Make no mistake, it is not a game, it is a product. Made in CIS, it follows a very simple, yet surprisingly effective creed of most CIS-online developers: ""Hello, we have a product to offer you. It may look like a game, but it's not. You can't fully enjoy it untill you give us alot ot money. By ""alot"" we mean, say, 10.000$... Even 100.000$. Even more! We don't care, more is better, right? But, to be clear, you won't enjoy a game even after such a considerable investement, because it's not a game at all, you see! Clever, eh?"" It's not even P2W it's P2N, means pay for nothing. Content? Poor. Ingame progression? Eternal. Costumer support? Nonexistant! You've stumbled across a problem? We don't care. You want any service for your money? Why even would you? You want to play a game? Huh, you've certainly came in a wrong place.   While i admit that gameplay is somewhat attractive, after all, i BEG you, PLEASE, at all costs, DO NOT INVEST ANY MONEY! Remember, it's P2N.			"

In fact, it's almost a poorly executed clone. So it inherits all of theirs flaws.- w/o real money forget about queue jobs, scans, attacks, etc.  Get used to thought you are just a dummy to be raided all the time- you put money to get queue and think you're good? no. now buy some middle currency to speed this sh!!t up!- no sounds- weak plot, if any- poor map overview. if you played LoU you would just laugh- prices are insane. if combine all dlcs with -75% it's 126$. EA just disappears in shadows- i cannot even close steam. it says this game is not closed- it's real time, so it will consume your time in exponent, from 10 min to 8 hours etc+ browser game, not heavy on pc resources			"

												The good side of this game is that it acctually reminds players how old strategy games use to look like and produces a nostalgic feeling and also the music is very good in the game. Unfortunately the downsides of the game go above the its initial quality feeling. The gameplay is turn based like in most Facebook Games but here its prolonged to waiting days and days to make a next move wich makes the achivments rather unobtainable since you have to waste like literary years to do some basic ones. Story wise the story is poorly constructed in means of effort -since when were elves befriended with demons? :) Usually the motive is that they fight them. -And another major flaw story wise is the implementation of slavery as a cathegory like ""it aint no thing"" its just there- which i find very distasteful to say the least. The graphics are naturaly horible and the buildings are generic. And the quest system is based on luring you into microtransactions and it has even sugestive roads sings on how you should behave to get into the consumerism of it deeper and deeper. It can be apealing to most people becouse the goodsides i mentioned. But as a friend of mine commented about this game ""not even the people that made this game play it""-I agree with that, and i do not recomend this game. ;-}			"

												This is a barely-translated pay2win browser game with a 48 hour tutorial. I don't mean the tutorial is available at all times, I mean it literally takes that long to build and research what you need to complete the tutorial, assuming you check in at the appropriate times (queueing research items is for premium players only). The only reason this could be considered a Real Time Strategy game is because there are no turns. The only obvious Steam integration is the achievements; there is no overlay and I imagine it uses the same servers as its browser counterpart. There is no fullscreen, graphics and animations are minimal, and the music manages to be forgettable and annoying at the same time. The game's entire plot revolves around fighting over the in-game currency, which is also mentioned in the title (black gems). The developers have only put in the bare minimum amount of effort needed to keep this scam afloat; the mountain of fake user reviews have better spelling than the game itself.Literally the only positive things about this ""game"" are that it does everything in its power to keep you from actually playing it, and that it serves as a vile example of how not to make a game.

												Ohhh.... it's one of THOSE ""games"".I'm not going to bother giving a full review of My Lands: Black Gem Hunting. As you can see, I barely have any playtime on it as I went in, ""played"" a little, and closed it and came to write this.My Lands is a browser-based game that made its way onto Steam, but it seems like it started out as a mobile game before hitting the browsers. It's a city-builder with some strategy, as you can play against other players as well. However, everything requires time. You have to wait however long for every building to be built, for every technology to research, and unlike other strategy games the wait times were intentionally increased to make you pay real money to make everything faster.In essence, this is Clash of Clans or Age of Empires: Castle Siege but on Steam and without the interesting graphics those games have as their only positive. Basically, stay away. Unless you're into this kind of thing.			"

 My Lands: Black Gem Hunting Over all this game has a good chance at earning a spot at the best strategy/role playing games so far. It's just that the game is a bit  slow . And the thing that got me all riled up was the BG or the games premium currency. It sucks when I accidentally clicked on buy with BG without a confirmation pop-up. I lost 99% of my BG meaning, I've only got 1 BG left on my account. If you fix these problems then there maybe a positive result to come.And so my rating for the game is 7/10 with a bonus on creativity resulting 8/10			"

												Playing this game for about three years, the nickname v1m. The game is quite interesting, but demanding at the time of the player, especially at high levels need to go into it at least a couple times a week. Allows for a variety of game scenarios from active war to innocent farmers. Actively used social composes - you can find a lot of new friends from different countries. Without the donation you can play, but difficult enough.			"

												It's a good game to pass some of your free time, per say at work.Pros:-You can't loose your cities.-Enemies can't force you to move away from territory.-Level-based enemies ensure, that you won't be attacked early on.-Level-based enemies ensure, that you can't attack much weaker players.-It's not a P2W. Buy-able things aren't going to help you win against others that much!-Usage of Closing Gates prevents enemies to attack you!Cons:-Researching does take quite a lot of time.-Research does cost much at high level, which brings the game to a halt, unless you pay.-Large armies requiring time to feed.-At maximum level you can be attacked by the top players.-Equipment for your heroes are OVER-priced. OVER-priced. Only the best can afford them.-Equipment for your heroes cost so much, that is not worth the irl $. Totally OVER-priced.Suggestion: Worth to try it out! If it's magic captures you, you'll be liking it. A nice way to spend 30 minutes of the day.			"

												Хорошая игра. Первое время больше играл в одного... развитие, руйки, внешние владения. Но после того как игровой стаж перевалил за 6 месяцев, перешел на новую ступень: общение. Однозначно, это командная игра. Что касаемо вливаний денег. Это дело каждого. Конечно, интереснее играть когда все есть и сразу (такой принцип действует во всех онлайн играх). Но и есть возможность без вложений получить удовольствие от игрового процесса. Good game. First time played more in one... development, ruuki, external possession. But after gaming experience exceeded 6 months, moved to a new stage: communication. Clearly, this is a team game.With regards to injections of money. It's everybody. Of course, fun to play when all there at once (this principle applies in all online games). But there is a possibility without attachments to get pleasure from the gameplay.			"

												This is a boring flash Pay2Win game. Construct buildings takes a long time, and  upgrade a building takes even more time, hours to be precise. Of course, you can accelerate the process... paying for it.    If you really want to make progress in the game, you have to buy black gems, otherwise it is impossible to even try.On average I had to close the game 10 times before I could play, because it gets frozen and unresponsive.Also, I noticed about many reviews made by users with a single game in the account, and even users without games; all them created a Steam account just to say beautiful things about this game.Do not bother, there are many better games, even paying for them you would spend much less money than playing this terrible scam that devs called ""game""Not recommended. My score: 0/10Update 1: I can't connect to the server from 2 days ago. The game freezes on loading screen.Update 2: Servers works only on certain times, 2 am Buenos Aires time to be precise. Also, game achievements are broken. I upgraded my Main Building to the 5th level and it never gave me that achievement unlocked, so if you are playing this game for the Playfire rewards, you are wasting your time.Update 3: I can not connect to the server from 4 days ago, even at times in previous days I could connect without experiencing problems.

												This game is another Evony clone, while I played a lot of this game early on, as I got to the lategame, I realized that accomplishing anything in your quest list required massive amounts of black gems (the p2p in-game currency). If I didn't get these black gems, I would lose huge bonuses that I already worked towards, which was incredibly frustrating. Black gems make this game too easy, but the lack of them makes this game nearly unplayable. You need premium to queue sciences and black gems to build above certain levels for buildings, that's ridiculous.Sure, they claim you can get black gems from raids, but you won't see more than one here and there until you're raiding level 6 dungeons, which require tens of thousands of troops to accomplish. In the end, this game is just a cash grab filled with guys named Boris or Stanislav.			"

												My Lands very closly resembles a popular mobile and web browser called Kingdoms of Camelot. However, it is a poor example of a mimic and is hard to call it htat, but it seems that is the only way to explina this game. Sadly, the game has failed to do several things every game NEEDS...Audio, and Consistability. The game forces oyu to wait hours for a simple upgrade early on. I found myself stuck waiting for two hours after ten minutes of gameplay, this brought tears to my eyes. I do not reccomend this game, it is slow, ungoldy slow at that, and failed to meet many aspects that should naturally have been developed especially for a finished product.

												Unfortunately, this game is not really free2play. Here's why: ""You should complete 150 tasks w/o loosing over 6 tasks in a row"". Seems easy enough when you start. You develop your castle, no hassle, everything seems to be fine. But then ""Bang! you have 24 hours to complete blah-blah-blah"" and that ""blah-blah-blah"" requires investing real money - ""choose your subscription plan"". Even more - the benefits the game offers in return doesn't seem to be really the needed ones. After 3 such occasions, with ever growing demands of investments - I can only say ""Booo!!!"". If you really want to play you're likely to find yourself spending sums comparable to AAA titles or even exceeding them. US$399 for some ""black gems""...What's good in it? Support for multiple languages, works in win10, doesn't have any powerful 3d graphics, and probably that's all.Such games are typically run in web browsers and don't have dedicated client.The bad? It'll try to grab way over $10 out of your pocket.			"

												At some point after getting most of the city upgraded to ""max level"" aka until the point you need to spend gems on upgrades.After that point it is pretty much P2W to do anything.Can't even finish main achievement that they had for this game which was 250 quests without failing cause they will just give you quests that you need to pay in gems.Not sure about others but most of the stuff you fail to do because it takes to long since you didn't pay or you didn't pay and what like your population capped so low you can't do anything.If there was like no Free dlc from some website for this game i wouldn't even started this.But as a test and review the finally say would be:If you want a game that at browser level, very p2w, you can spend a lot of this one. ""why would you do it?"" no idea i see no reason.*Cough* i read some of the reviews that already on the store just before writing this one,it seems like there are a lot of people who spend way too much on it to enjoy it or it got positive reviews boosted.

												Zdravím, líbí se mi hra jako taková, hráč začne od nuly a postupně se zlepšuje, jak to ve strategických hrách bývá, jen nesmí stoupat příliš rychle, jinak na to brzy doplatí, páč Vás rychle sundá nepřítel - jiný hráč. Jediné co se mi z počátku nelíbilo, že je hra strašně pomalá, byl jsem spíše zvyklý z jiných strategických her stoupat nahoru rychleji a snadněji a tudíž pro netrpělivce tato hra moc nebude a brzy ji opustí, jak to dělá spousta hráčů, co nemají potuchy do čeho jdou. Jakmile ale člověk u hry vydrží a přečká to, pak myslím, že je to dobrá hra pro zaplnění nadbytečného času, kterého ovšem v současné době může mít člověk málo. Dalším záporem pro občasnějšího hráče může být, že pokud se po určité době nepřihlásíte, hra Vám skončí a prodloužit dobu nepřítomností můžete jen za černé perly. Na druhou stranu je to též pochopitelné, protože někdo už hru opravdu nechce hrát a tím by neumožnil hrát zase jinému zájemci... přeplnila by se akorát tímto mapa... Takže za mě hru vřele doporučuji i přes některá menší omezení :-) a víc nechci prozrazovat, na vše postupně přijdete sami....			"

												Greedy as ♥♥♥♥. Even the tutorial constantly mentions things like ""our castle will take 28 hours to complete, but there's a magic way to make it happen immediately! Buy gems from the shop.""The prices are three times higher if you don't spend €60 or more for a huge pack.Also, all construction takes ages (but buy gems to make it instant, wink, wink) as for example one of the first quests is to build 100 carriers. They require 20 minutes each. That's over 33 hours for a beginner quest.Lastly, the translated English text is full of small errors and inconsistencies. Units are called differently in quests, differently in build screen, etc.			"

												Though I am a fan of this genre I was disappointed with My Lands. A large part of this is simply because My Lands doesn't belong on steam where its effectively tied to a single computer. You need the ability to connect from a browser and your mobile devices, but according to a post from the Devs in the google play store the steam version is on a different server so it cannot be accessed vie the web or mobile devices. This could have been mitigated if it had a better queuing system, but you need to pay Black Gems to get any sort of queues, and there is no building queue. You start with a small number of Black Gems and they can be earned within the game by destroying ruins and harvesting the proper locations, but unless you are really patient there simply aren't enough of them without paying money. Since the game is already free on the web, I would preferred to have the steam version cost money but include the premium benefits and share the same servers as the browser version.My other complaints are that everything takes longer in My Lands than in similar games and the interface could use some improvements. This type of game relies on an active player base but the build time ramps up so quickly that new players don't have time to get hooked. As for the interface there is no sound, scouting is instant but the information isn't saved anywhere, and you can't see at a glance where you explored or attacked or even who is a legal target.The game DOES have potential and I may continue playing the browser version. The different races are interesting, you have a high level of control over your city, the tutorial quests are helpful and most importantly it is entirely up to you when you open yourself to PVP. These are all strong benefits but are outweighed by the flaws. This is not a bad game, its just a bad _steam_ game. While you can successfully take a browser game and put it on steam, you need to make sizable changes for it to succeed.			"

												Granted, I'm not really giving this game much of a chance (only several hours).  But do I need to?  I've spent 99% of my time waiting for things to happen.  It says, ""Here's a quest: click that thing and build it.""  I do so.  I wait several minutes to hours.  Then it says, ""Here's another quest: click that other thing and build it.""  I do so.  I wait several minutes to hours.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Realize that progress in this game is P2W, and incredibly tedious.  Quit and write negative review.I don't know how this game currently has 88% positive reviews, because it definitely isn't that good.  Somebody may have rigged the reviews.  My guess is that with time, that'll get down below 50%.The mentorship system seems to be a broken one.  Mentors gain rewards when their apprentices accomplish quests, but there is no motivation for the mentor to actually do anything to help the apprentice.  You can request resources from the mentor, but they don't have to give them to you.  I'm not sure, but it seems like you can't fire your mentor, either.  Once you've accepted them, they own you, and leech off of you.You should also be aware that no matter how much progress you've made in the game (even if you've been playing for years), they'll delete your kingdom if it's inactive for between 7-30 days.  So... basically, what's the point of playing this?How many more terrible design decisions are there that I'm not aware of, yet?It's just too bad, because there's something very tempting about the slow-growth style of this game.  But why waste any time on it if you'll just lose it all when real life happens?			"

												Play 3 years. Advise!(if you have at least $ 200 to donate from the start))) The main advantages: 1) Multiplayer with real people. 2) Strategy, with different options and approaches to development - that affects the result. 3) Possible withdrawal. 4) Periodically adding new functions and features (characters, artifacts, clan castles). 5) Drags on for years. Main disadvantages: 1) Excessive time reference - the mandatory presence (about once a day to once a couple of days). 2) The structure of the game figured on killing time at the office workers - some aspects are very tedious and tightened (excessively). 3) To make it interesting to play - you have to periodically invest (or a once but a lot). 4) To be in the top - you need to invest excessively, and be online at least 10 hours a day. 5) The failure of the administration actually observe and monitor ""multovodstvo.""

												Now, I don't mind a few of these minimal-graphics RTS games coming to Steam. I enjoy these sort of low-effort games since I constantly feel like I'm accomplishing something even though there's really not much to do but click ""Build"" and wait. Valor, Haypi Kingdom, the more recent Clash of Clans and Battle Islands--I've played them all.Not one of these games has been as cash-grabby as this one. Oh, we'll give achievements and powerful in-game items to those who can complete 150+ quests without failing? Let's throw in some quests that REQUIRE the purchase of gems. Oh, we might get complaints about this system? Let's make gems also obtainable by fighting monsters in the ruins so that we can just say ""There are in-game methods to obtain gems. You just need to play more."" What's that? It's nigh-on impossible to farm enough black gems to do this when your building are at low levels because you need gems to upgrade higher without failing quests? Well, ♥♥♥♥ it, your lack of disposable income isn't our issue.			"

This is convenient when you don't always have time to play. It does take quite a bit of time to do some thingsin game -- like open the gates of your city, upgrade buildings, and learning sciences.

												A money grabbing, Facebook game which has been ported to Steam, apparently without sound. There is nothing noteworthy about this game, that isn't a negative. The art is poor, the mechanics are drawn out and obtuse, and the game has literally no sound.  There's nothing fun about waiting 10 hours to finish a building, yet that's about all you'll be doing here. And waiting 10 more hours for research to finish. Want intrsuction on how to play? Just go to their website! Who needs in game information?Ugh, I give this game two tomatoes out of a fruit salad.			"

												Okay....Well, the game wasn't much of my taste, I didn't really like it. Well, I completed basics, fought some people, upgraded my land etc. I completed the basic quest and some others. But the game just isn't my taste. Well, I'd reccomend it to click&build gamers. Still, the game had nice graphics, and had many races: Elves, Dark Elves, Daemons, Knights.... Which I liked. I was daemon. I wrote letters, played for nice time, but didn't have much fun. Still, as I said, game was really nice with graphics and the story. Even If I don't like it, I know some people will find it great. As I count all my good points of this game and bad, the score is:6/10. Which means: I reccomend this game.			"

												Not a fan of pay to win games that use annoying mechanics and long waits to get you to pay to win.If you had items that were interesting and not just paying to end queues... well I still wouldnt pay to obtain them, but I would enjoy grinding them the hard way.This game is exactly what you hate from pay to wins.

												The game requires the use of Black Gems that require money to purchase. There is achievements and rewards for completing 150 quests + in a row without failure. You can actually fail 6 quests without consequence but I only made it to 35 quests before being asked to complete SEVEN quests demanding black gems. These quests were to unlock a weekly boost in certain categories. I can only assume the quest will come back after a week if I did purchase the service. There is three total achievement affected by this.The science track lets you research new things. One of these is the ability to get a hero. It is researchable 3 times and you can get up to 3 heroes. Only after you research rank one do you see the painful black gems appear as a requirement for rank 2. While you can estimate 1,000 black gems to cost 15$, you cannot purchase in blocks of 1,000 gems. You must purchase 650 gems (10$) or 1500 gems (20$). This essentially means that in order to get a second hero you must pay 20$. I do not wish to even know what rank 3 will charge you.			"

												I've played this game for the last three years online. That probably makes me a bit biased, but I still think that this is a great game. It's the best FTPMMORTS I've ever played, but I have a few issues with this port:-There are too many Russians. We need location based servers like before.-External links (encyclopaedia, forum) don't open-Can't add any BG to anywhere; I click on the amount and nothing happens-The Steam acheivements require money input, which is not right. Steam acheivements should always be possible to complete with the base game with something like this.-The game only appears fullscreen windowed rather than full screen. I cannot change the resolution or make it fullscreen.Other than that, this is just as good as the flash port! I would definitely recommend it. If anyone wants to start an English clan, then my username is O99o99 in-game! Please send me a message so I can avoid the Russians!			"

												The game is okay in the background, but it's designed too much around require black gems to succeed. I honestly don't mind buying gems but there wasn't anything really worth buying them for. But it gets to a point where you need to buy Gems if you want a chance at finishing the quests. Quest purely using Black gems don't make sense I understand these type of quest for the purpose of training but not appearing on a regular basis...			"

												in this game you must be prepaired for support to ether ignore you , give you the wrong awnser , or call you a liar. and this game is all about the cash and big paying player, a lot of the quests require black pearls and lots of them.so dose the buildings and sciences. the salt lakes are only for the russians and super high power players. black pearls from ruins only give one each so it would take 50 to 4000 ruins to compleate a black pearl quest which would take several months to do and you get 24 hours for most of them. so if you are ready to spend 200 to 400$ a month it is great if not you will find they dont care			"

It's a very simple RTS. Nothing too complicated here.			"

												I find this game interesting normally I do not care for RTS but this game you can set it and leave.  With select a choice of races to pick from, giving you the ablity to go at it alone, or later having options to join a clan or make your own clan and setting out on missions to explore or take the road as destroyer of kingdoms and taking the spoils and enslaving the villagers.  This a game of time and patience sometimes days will pass before your science study is finished so keep that in mind.  You can pay and speed up your progress but where is the fun in that.  The Steam Community Group is mainly in Russia which it makes it difficult to get information so I am listing the english forum which is not part of steam for more infomation click the link My Lands: Black Gem Hunting My Lands Discussion Board[mlgame.us]  hope you enjoy the game!

												My lands is a good time killer at work, or while travelling.You need a great amount of patience to play this. Its not for everyone that's for sure. The pacing of the game is very slow, especially at the start. If you like to skip steps and jump to attacking etc. you won't have a chance. The game requires a lot of diplomacy and time consuming city building/planning. Once you get all your cities setup and reach the final level (suzerain) you will notice a huge change in strategy and realize theirs a lot more to it than what meets the eye. To all those who say its pay to play. Your not true strategy gamers.This game does give an advantage to players using real money. BUT if you play smart and take your time you can easily overcome that. Using real money just helps you to skip some steps and quicken your growth			"

												I started playing it about two years ago. I put in about 80$ on russian version of the game. I like it and dont mind making ""micropayments"" because I enjoy concept of the game. Also, if you feeling like you can't sustain peacefully, then you need to be ready to pay in far more than ""micro"" donations. Good game.			"

												Game is slow to start and requires reading tutorials or you may get stuck, but once you get your first city to 5* and open the gate it runs smoothly. Game is requiring less and less time as it progresses because buildings require more time to finish. I love the game and sense of community and a need for cooperation.			"

												Well, this game WAS fun until I got to a dead end. I can't do more than one click a day. I am surrounded by super mighty and all powerful players who I can't attack. I don't find any mine or ruin or whatever. No clan let's me join them (it's hard enough to find a non russian clan... I simply don't speak Russian).A lot of quests require you to buy Black Gems. Of course, you can find them ingame, BUT I found like 20 Black Gems in total and there is nothing you can buy with this amount, plus it took me like forever to get them. You can ignore those Black Gem quests but then you can't accomplish the 'Complete 150 quests in a row' quest which will grant you an achievement and a super mighty item. So I would say, this game is definitely p2progress as with Black Gems you can get ruins and mines uncovered, you can accelerate your science study rates, every production rate and so on...			"

												Lots of negative reviews about this game, which I can understand some of the reasons, but completely disagree and think they've not played it long enough to give it a fair chance.The game is fairly slow at the start. The quests guide you through the very basics and then you basically take your own route.Black Gems are the ""special"" resource in the game. They allow you to buy buffs and get the best things. They can be bought for real money, or you can earn them in the game. At first, you won't earn many in the game unless you're very lucky. But by the time you've built up to attack ruins, which takes about a week or so, you can bring in several a day and eventually working up to thousands a day. They can also be bought with gold in the game which is a standard resource.The ranking system stops the top players attacking the smallest ones, so you're safe to start with. There are 5 ranks and you can only attack people of the same rank or above what you are. The battles are just a calculation, but the beauty of this game is calculating all the buffs you have vs your enemy to be successful. Finding ways to outsmart people is the joy of this game.You have to pay a salary to your army, so there's a balance between having a big army and being able to manage the salary.All in all, I've played lots of online games and never found anything that I enjoy as much as this game. Yes, it is slow to start with and takes a lot of time to build up. You can substitute that for money, but I know many people who have succeded in this game without paying a penny			"

												I'd suggest finding a mentor asap! They really are wonderful guidance while you're first learning your way around. A nice, relaxing game, however the waiting periods can be annoying (as with most things). In My Lands however, the difference in time from the first upgrade to the next is surprisingly long. So it's not particularly a game for people who don't have patience.			"

												Играта е добра. Ако се развиете до 5 звезди, изисква доста време, за да изхранвате армията. Разбира се, ако искате да имате голяма армия, с която да биете или да се защитавате от други играчи. Би могла да бъде и по-добра, но това е друга тема. Успех и късмет на тези, които я играят.			"

												This review is about my experience with My Lands: Black Gem Hunting. I spent many hours on this game so I could tell you just about everything about it but I will shorten it to how I feel about the game overall. First off, I do not like RTS games at all. I had played a few online browser and app RTS games in the past such as Travian, Combat Grounds, and Game of War (btw do not ever play GoW). They were fun sometimes but got old after awhile and once you start to become powerful you always get shot down by higher ranked people in clans/guilds who paid thousands of real world money to get to their level. I have also played the Stronghold series and do not enjoy those games. My Lands was sort of an exception to my experience with RTS games. I started playing this game because I got a free 6 month premium account and figured, why not give it a try? Plus I read you can make money playing the game. Sweet! In the beginning, I really did not know what I was doing but I thought it was kinda fun. The more I started to play and learn about the game, I realised just how much strategy and meticulous, critical planning the game requires. This discovery made the game more intriguing and enjoyable. Once I found an English speaking clan (lots of Russians play, i.e. the majority) I was set. I was a free to play player for a long time and I had NO issues with being F2P. I  was mostly PvE on the Age of Abundance server but I was PvP on occasion, and more so on the other server. Of course if I was super rich the game would be easier, but I learned through reading the My Lands encyclopedia, forums, and from my clan members how to gain power and defend myself from all attacks. The only con I can say about this game is that it requires you to be on every single day. I would say no less than 2-3 separate times EACH day. It is an RTS after all.If you miss a day several things can happen: 1. You get attacked2. You miss a monster ruin (which are crucial to gaining resources and power)3. You lose an auction4. Your clan needed your help but you were afk5. Your mine gets stolen6. If it's your 7th or 14th consecutive missed day (can't remember which) your city gates open, people leave your villages (no resources gathered), then they leave your cities.7. If you are gone a month your account(s) is/are deleted.I was loyal to this game and determined to make money playing it. I was on everyday for months having fun every time I played. That is why my hours are so high. Most of it was not idling. Unfortunately, the place where I was staying had terrible internet which would not allow me to access Steam 90% of the time. I missed some weeks and got attacked but I was still strong in the game and my clan supported me. Basically, it could have been worse... Now I've quit My Lands indefinitely because I just logged on and both of my accounts are gone.If you like RTS games, My Lands is fun. The graphics are nice. The UI is not hard to figure out. The devs added some fitting music after a few months. You can make money playing it by turning black gems collected into money. I believe it's 100 gems = $1.00. Apparently players have made over $2.5million playing the game. It takes a lot of time if you are F2P though. I earned $0.00 in my 650+ hours... I recommend it if you have the time.			"

												I gave up on the tutorial. I mean yeah the graphics were nice and all but it's a tutorial. u dont need to wait 10 minutes untill you actually play the game. All of the ios games I've played have the tutorials starting with a low wait time (20 seconds or less) and even if you get bored with that wait the game gives you a special credit to bypass this. This game? None of that. You have to sit and wait for the tutorial to finish. Then what? Tons of time spent waiting for more things to build and updrade? Slowly getting longer and longer? What a waste of time.			"

												I like this game, it's fun and there are a lot of things, but if they care only about the money and money only I'am going to write a bad comment about them, since they are so unfair and don't stick to they own rules. And here some reasons I don't like, and i noticed while playing:- It's confusing because they allways put many new things and they don't even told you what new things are there and it's getting expecive much more because of that- they take you so much money and much more after- they have a team that they prevent you to be better than them, so you couldn't get any money from mylands or you must be a lot better than them (or/and in one clan one player from that team usualy have up to 5 accounts and plays them all by one player)- they cheat and are organised with admins - In their rules it says that in the forums and in game must admin write in that language as the server is meant for, but noooo not in my language we have an English writer,, and then we  must translate to other players who can't speak english, and they refuse to get us our native language writer or even if we volunteer they don't mind, I mean WTF??SO don't you start play this game because it's waste of time and money, and money=time, so you spend much more, if you start playing for money(and you hope to get something from that) and you are first time here to play rather go get a second job. (you must play at least 4-6 month to get the gameplay, and even then if you're not smart you will get nothing)			"

												Nice enough game. But the mission that gives you a helm for completing 150 missions seems impossible unless you pay. You can get 25 or 30 done but then eventually missions come up that require black gems (those useless quests IMO) and obviously  if you don't have the load of bg's =fail. and they will come one after the other. Until you failed 5 and then you fail that 150 mission quest because of p2w. I'ts fun exploring and finding ruins, pits etc. But the hard part is keeping the pits you find. And with 6 hours to close a gate (yes, really, in the middle ages it seems they did not know how to close a gate) you can sometimes lose that which you found because some greedy♥♥♥♥♥has a bigger army than yours. Otherwise fun.			"

Whenever I've had problems at all, one or the other is always there to aid me.And, if your like me and don't like to interact much, it's also very well balanced for solo players as well. Whilst the waiting gets a tad bit irritating, the over all game is worth it, and I HIGHLY recommend it.			"
