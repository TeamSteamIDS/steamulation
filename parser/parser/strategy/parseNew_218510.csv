												Planets Under Attack,Pros-Easy to learn.-Nice cartoony style.

												""Planets Under Attack"" is an addictive little time consumer that reminds me somehow of ""Megalomania"", because it's gameplay is mainly focused on massive realtime tactical movement of your units between different positions. The different positions in this game here are the many different planets scattered around each map in the huge  campaign mode. After playing a bit into the game you can even begin to set different types of planets, one for the bank (it produces money), some for battle planets (they function as big defensive artillery bases ... well ... sort of) and the rest for breeding more men and producing taxes.There are three different classes to play in this game, although until now - except the robot tutorial mission at the beginning - I've only played the human species so far. But it's clear from the campaign matches and the many hints in the manual that they even have different play styles. Robots for examples don't collect taxes, they use their bodies to upgrade planets and so on ...This game features deep tactical decisions lying under a neat and easy to lern point and click interface. Most of the time you have to act under pressure, be it time that runs against you or enemies attacking your reaches of space. There are many different mission types during the campaign (or in local / online multiplayer) only interrupted every so often for a special boss battle stages that can differ from the normal gameplay by various intriguing ideas ... but I don't want to spoil you here ... ;)So whats left to say for me is that this is one of these mostly overseen strategy pearls you in theory just can play for a break during yourr office work. The only thing is, this game gets so amazingly addictive in a very short while, you better tell your boss it could take a while for him to see you again ... :)In my oppinion you should totally get this game. It's fast, it's deeper in strategy than it looks and it's fun either in small bites or equally for a couple of hours at a time. Give it a try and at least download the demo. And if you tend to like the game (like I do - just in case you didn't mention yet), maybe we could get together sometime and meet up for a few online matches as this game really deserves full servers.

												I really enjoyed this game for the first two hours or so, but then it gets much too hard. The first boss level is ridiculous - I get stomped every time I try, even on 'easy' difficulty, despite doing fine on all of the previos levels. All the posts I can find online are people saying the same thing. It's clear from the achievements that most people quit about the same point that I quit, maybe for the same reason? It's sad because I really enjoyed the game at first, but it is just far too hard and thus more frustrating than fun.			"

												This game makes me sad. I love it so much but the campaign is impossible to complete. The problem is that the ai can multitask infinately but you are simply a mere human. There's only so many hundreds of tiny ships you can keep track of on screen at the same time. The skirmishes add a lot of replay along with the leveling up but, honestly, if you like this game save your money and get Eufloria instead. It's not as visually pleasing but it's a much better game, hands down.			"

												Got this game on an awesome special so I don't have many greviences. It's a fun game when you are winning but fairly frustrating when you aren't, the reason this is, is not because the game is too hard but rather the game doesn't allow for much variety in strategies. You will restart over and over untill you find the one strategy that works. This makes it an unbalanced strategy game because you may as well watch a bot vs bot match on any RTS and pretend you are one of the bots. With that said, when you are winning it's quite enjoyable and would be a VERY decent game if this feeling was well maintained. If you find it on special it is likely worth whatever experience you get but I would not pay full price.			"

												Planets Under Attack is a simple RTS, very easy to get into, but it actually gets really challenging as you progress. This is not a bad thing as games these days normally hand-hold you to the end, I liked the challenge on offer here. Graphic wise, I actually quite liked the style on show. The comic book style art really suites it well. The story is pretty pants, but thankfully it's not all about the story here, it's the gameplay. It does have a very addictive side to it, I found myself being hell bent on getting the three stars available on each level.  I have yet to try the multiplayer mode, hopefully there will be a player base out there, that will make finding matches easy enough. This is more than likely to be included in bundles, so keep your eye out.			"

												The basis of this game is to take over planets, and then using those planets to build up more jets to take over planets with, and to eventually overwhelm your enemy with your jet ships to eliminate them.  You really only need the mouse to play.  You take over planets by clicking on them.This seems quite cool.  However, amongst all the awesomeness that is this game, the controls feel laggy.  When I click on a planet, I don't immediately get a response from my allied planets.  And I feel in a game that requires those split decision making choices, it allows my strategy to easily fold.  I am suddenly clicking on one planet.  The exact controls are also slightly vague.  It took me a second to figure out how to upgrade, but the reasons for doing so felt almost pointless.  I could either send out ships to take over planets, or spend time upgrading them.Overall a good game.  I have better games on my game list of 200 games, but this one is still pretty good.  It just needs some touch ups from the developer.  I felt there was too much useless information on the screen as well, and the important information was placed on the same level as some of the useless stuff.  I am really on the fence with this game, but I am recommending it out of the hopes that other people will see the positives come from the negatives.			"

												Planets Under Attack is a real-time strategy game.The gameplay mechanic of Planets Under Attack are simple and not very deep, but it's good, not too easy and need some time to master. You start with a planet, build up fleets and then set out to conquer neutral or/and enemy planets. But you have to make the right decision which planet to attack first and use tactics. The first level of the game could be easy, but when you play deeper into the game, there's when the fun begin.The graphics of Planets Under Attack is cartoon, but that doesn't make the game a children game. The UI is good and well designed.Planets Under Attack is another good and fun game. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												The game concept is good enough, especially for the price point of $0.99 USD (Steam sale).However, for those looking for cooperative mode vs. AI, in an online capacity, know that the game does not currently support it.  Despite advertising it as such and asserting that it offers this capability, the game does not at this provide it.  A lengthy thread on the forums has also gone unanswered by the developers so no clarity has been shed on the subject.  As such, no online coop campaign OR skirmish options exist for players vs. AI.

												Planets Under Attack is a nice take on the swarming type strategy genre. I really enjoyed my time with it until i got close to halfway through. At this point the game becomes stupidly difficult even on the lowest difficulty levels. I was forced to give up on the game because of this, and a quick seach of the internet indicates that I'm not alone. The developers say they lacked any outside play testing which ended up in them ramping up the difficulty because they, themselves, found the game too easy. Most indie studios do end up making rookie mistakes that lower the quality of their game. It just so happens in this case that it completely ruins the game altogether. There is no way i can recommend this game to anyone based on this. Unless you're some strategy genius, or are willing to put in 10s of hours into the game to figure out the perfect strategies, you'll just be wasting your time on a game that you'll never be able to complete, let alone enjoy			"

												7.5/10 - Exciting, Planet based strategy game!I usually don't like games under TopWare; but this game is a gem! For a highly discounted price I would highly recommend this game. For $10... Maybe not. I really love the campaign. I've completed 12 of the 36 levels in about 45 minutes. The degree of difficulty is increasing at a rapid rate. With 3 levels of difficulty I see some good replay value ahead. There are some easy to impossible achievements, card drops and more. I didn't find a multiplayer game yet, but I have a feeling during popular hours it will happen. This consists of 4 players building defenses and conquering the solar system. It's a calculated numbers game which I am really enjoying!Worth $6-7 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												I really enjoyed Planets Under Attack with its pseudo-RTS elements. The player is the commander, sending swarms of ships to take over other planets. This increases your revenue and ship production. It's a very simply concept yet Planets Under Attack manages to add a deep layer of strategy and challenge with its various scenarios. The controls are great, they are very intuitive and flow well with the gameplay.My enjoyment of the game came to an abrupt halt when I reached level 10 of the campaign. Wow, what an immense difficulty curve. Even on easy I can't manage to grasp how I'm required to play in order to win. It started feeling a bit like insanity creeping in, I'm utterly powerless during this level where before I was able to multitask and annihilate multiple enemy forces at the same time. It feels like the enemy A.I. is cheating at times.I quickly went from being optimistic to annoyed.			"

												Depending on the price point you are going to aquire this game I would recommend or not recommend it. As I bought this when it was at a good price point I choose recommend.The gameplay itself is nice. Although the game mechanics themselve to concur planets isnt really deep. The decision to where to send your armies give enough choice to allow for some tactical fights. Blindly sending your troops to a planet might work in the first levels but after a while you'll notice some more thought will need to go into deciding when and whcih planets to attack.			"

												This games premise is simple, so if your looking for something super complex it's not here. Strategy and tactics do exist though as taking which planet and when to attack and when to defend becomes extremely critical. One move can cost you a planet and sometimes if your not quick enough to react, the game. The premise is your a certain colony of either humans or robots, and you start conquering worlds one by one. Some battles can take place with one or up to three AI's. Of course, each sector is it's own game, so don't look to go Star Wars and try to conquer an entire galaxy. You start the game, and you are able to choose linearly which sector to attack next. Once you are at the in-game screen, the battle begins. Planets can be upgraded and can be selected to either defend or allow for attacks. Some planets when properly upgraded have some self defense mechanisms... although I wouldn't highly rely on it. Game types vary (which is always a good idea in any game) where one game may be domination where you need to take ALL planets whereas another game may have to do with monetary means to win - meaning more money you have the more powerful your units are. Send an attack wave to an enemy planet though and watch your assets freeze as your at war. Small divot game-types such as these keep the game interesting and want you to play more.This game is good, however NOT RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE! If you like space games and a casual indie territory take-over game this may be for you. If your looking for Star Trek Online keep it movin'!INDIE RATING 7.6/10RATING : 6.9/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

												The quickness of a Flashgame but the strategy of a full-on wargame.Pros:-small game >> quick to download and not much space used.-simple to learn and gets you in the action fast.-several different game types: Elimination, King-of-the-Hill, Gold-Mine, Target-Capture, Debt-Collector and a few others up to 4 players at a time.-several skirmish maps, single player or multi-player (would be excellent on a game system).-Decent Storyline.-Decent music.-several Steam Achievements as well as in-game rewards that give you quick cash when you need it.-general technology upgrade sysem-Strategy is simple, yet deep.-Difficulty setting matters; not only is the AI stronger but they're smarter.  The higher the difficulty, the higher the rewards.Cons:-If you're use to over-complex strategy games this will seem overly simple (possibly even boring).-As far as I know you cannot play as the alien race, but maybe I haven't gotten that far yet.-though planets do have a population, it is used only as a form of limiting currency in warfare.  There is no real economic strategy except ""make money >> spend it.  Build population >> spend/send it.""All this said:Nice, Quick, Simple yet Challenging.7/10			"

Not only are the computers all on the same team, but they generate both ships and money faster than you ever will.

The multiplayer is fine I think but the story is terribly unbalanced against you. Like not even like normal challenging unbalanced, like so unbalanced that would have to start mission over and over and over because the AI is far better at multitasking and also they started out with three times the population and they generate more money/energy. If you're thinking about getting this to play multiplayer with some friends it's great but the single player is extremely difficult and past like level 10 is near impossible without having mastered the game.TL;DRGreat for multiplayerStory becomes too difficult too quickly			"

												In the beginning, I enjoyed this take on a strategy game.  A tad bit similar to Mushroom Wars, but adds in new elements via the different race types as well as choosing various advantages for each mission.  Unfortunately the fun suddenly stopped quite early in the game.  It went from well balanced to crazy tough, even on the easy setting for missions. If you enjoy strategy games that may require you to play the same scenario 15-20 times each until you figure out the magic scenario - and get a little bit of luck - then you will enjoy this game.  The mechanics are fun, but I found the difficulty curve to be just plain ludicrous.			"

												there are sections that are EXTREMELY difficult and frustrating to beat - even on easy difficulty!!! not because of clever AI but because the setup and positioning makes it near impossible to gain advantage over the AI and quite often you have to figure out THE strategy to beat a certain level -  just bad balancing imo. i think it's the idea of making a game difficult to the point of impossibility in order to get more hours of gameplay out of it due to replaying the same level over and over and over... however it's no-fun-replay!got stuck at a level with a [mild spoiler ahead, but not really cause it's featured in one of the preview pics]  zombie star boss battle (maybe the final battle? who knows, who cares), and after the nineth or tenth attempt i passed caring to beat that level, on easy...so in essence, you get a complete game (i guess) that you probably won't/can't complete due to unbalanced difficulty, which means it's incomplete after all !?thumbs down.

												I'm a big fan of GalconFusion so I was hopeful about this game--it seemed like the same thing only with some added complexity. However, I found this very frustrating by comparison: one has less controll over unit movement (being unable to specifically select where ships are moved from) and what is happening seems somewhat inexplicable even after messing around for an hour. Even things as simple as how many ships I actually have at my disposal to attack with isn't clearly explained either in the tutorials or in the built-in help--which is infuriating when the margins of error, apparently, are very slight even at low difficulty.I may come back to this at some point in the future, but for now I'm going back to Galcon. It's a shame, because this is promising, and quite atractive looking to boot.			"

												This game is awesome. The tutorial is easyy to understand but the game is hard to master like several other games!The missions are challenging and addictive and there are different game modes to play. Time is fast running whileplaying this game. Just want to clear some missions and whoop several hours passed. Due to it's easy control withonly you mouse needed it's a perfect game to lay back and rethink you strategy. Absolutely enjoyable!Graphics: Cartoon style - ships are some kind of retro looking which fit for me - 10/10Sound: All char voices are beautiful spoken as I know them and the music isn't annoying for me - 10/10Sys Perfomance: Small download size, no hardcore graphic card needed, only mouse needed - 10/10Overall fun: Some missions need to be played several times but that's ok. Challenging for everyone - 10/10No I'm not kidding, I really love this game =) "

												Casual Strategic Fun with a dash of Comic Comedy?Well it's a strategy game however its controls are of a casual game as well as its mechanics.Basically what you do is send ships (space ships) to a planet to conquer it. Story mode is quite fun, There's also multiplayer, you have a good amount of maps to play on.Grab it if you're into Strategic games, Casual games or both. It's not that easy to beat and not that hard to understand.My suggestion is ""GRAB IT ON SALE TO HAVE MAXIMUM FUN AND LESS WALLET GOUGING!""			"

												Really fun little lite strategy game. Something fun to play while I listen to podcasts/audio books. Clearly crafted with care and love. Some suprisingly nice voice acting :)If you are experienced with strategy games, its not particularly difficult, but it eventually throws some suprisingly complex levels at you.Requires a mouse scroll wheel (hard coded) which I don't have on my laptop, which is annoying. I would really appriciate the option of mapping the scroll wheel to some other buttons (but I'm not sure how much of a pain that is from a coding perspective).			"

It's a well-done space strategy and resource management game (I'm sure there's some popular acronym for that or better classification). Gets increasingly harder as you progress (damn mean AI).

												It has a very simple concept: Conquer and defend planets. Also has very simple mechanics: As you conquer planets, you increase your maximum revenue and rate of revenue increase, using revenue to move ships from planet to planet. When attacking a nuetral or enemy planet you don’t generate any revenue. That’s pretty much it.I enjoyed the hour I played with a nice cartoony, yet 3D art style complimenting the simple style of game play. The way you attack other planets was a bit annoying with simply holding the left-mouse button, usually resulting in roughly the right amount of ships, but never accurate.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/01/23/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-planets-under-attack-demo/ "

												First things first, its a nice game, but it has a fatal flaw, the control are very obnoxious.Normally in this kind of game dragging from planet to planet would select the planet to send ships from.However in this game all planets send ships unless you flag them as defending.Which means that you are constantly managing which planets should send and which should not.Overlooking will have ships flying through defended space and get shot down, or have planets which are still building up send all of there ships and be left defenseless.Also the ammount of ships send is determined by holding the mouse button longer, which is very inaccurate.Just for that very important reason i cannot recommend this.

												Now this game you probably have never heard of before but I think it is a very simple to play RTS game which you can pick up the basics in no time at all.The gameplay is very simple, no special units or so forth, just upgrade and out-populate your rivals with a rather minimal but somewhat entertaining campaign with the human faction albeit would be better with other factions such as the robot(My favorite unit in the game).If you have friends playing this game with you then it can be quite the fun game that everyone can get the hang of in due time(Done it multiple times).If this game goes on sale and you're feeling bored perhaps give this game a try?It's a 9/10 in my bookGameplay is simple to pick up albeit UI can get frustrating(Downgrading accidentally).Story is rather minimal although expected due to the RTS line of gaming.

												Bought the game to play coop with a friend but there is no coop mode and no way to add AI to an online game. According to a random jackass on the forums the game -is- coop because you can ""play with a friend against other people."" Using that logic, every multiplayer game that is not strictly free-for-all qualifies as a coop game. It seems that Valve cannot be bothered to address false advertising on their platform, even when 1/4 of the people that bought the game complained about it. Maybe it was a simple misunderstanding or maybe it was a language barrier but regardless of the reason for it, theres no excuse for it to still be advertised as coop 3 1/2 years after people started complaining.

												It is nice simple strategy game. You start with some planets and sending ships between your planets is free, however sending them to conquer planets costs money and you have to manage between sending enough ships and having enough money so that the ships you send dont become too weak because the ships power is based on the amount of money you have. The robot race is slightly diferent but you can only play it in multiplayer or play in the same multiplayer maps but agaisnt bots.You also can change your planets between space stations, banks and normal planets with cities and each have their own utility but that is the extent of the game complexity.On the singleplayer campaign your will face a few bosses and three races: the humans, the robots and a mutant insect race. There is few game modes presents in the game and the campaign early on teaches about the various modes and it has a robot race tutorial. I had fun playing however some of the late game levels are absurdly hard to the point where one of them I simply stopped trying to beat it on hard mode and even on normal thay are quite dificult. Also the capaign is 20 hours long at most.I have over 50 hours on record because I played some multiplayer matches with people on the foruns to get the achievements however the last achievement is kinda bs because it requires you to kill an absurd amount of enemies that is only achievable by playing over a 100 hours of this game.In regards to multiplayer is lacking in game lobby listing and there isn't a proper game matching system the only way to play it is with friends. Also this game doesn't have Co-op it is just PvP.In conclusion, you can find some enjoyment in this game however I only recomend picking this up on sale.			"

I by all means welcome challenging games but when I send 100 ships to attack a planet with a population of 20 and their spawn rate suddenly gets amplified 10,000% followed by loosing the fight and then suddenly their spawn rate drops to normal. This isn't a challange, it's outright cheating. As noted by more than one review, this game is won more often than not entirely on luck and not strategy or skill. By all means give it a go for multiplayer if it's on sale but never buy it for its single player content.			"

The base tech is far too over powered. Many times it takes like triple the amount of ships to conquer a base and this just adds frusteration rather than enjoyment!!!The AI is awful, esp. in later levels. Don't even get me started with the final boss....literally impossilbe/cheap/ down right redic!!!The game needs a solid patch for it to be enjoyable as the beginning of the game was!-fix bases! I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SEND 40 SHIPS TO CONQUER A DAMN 10 POWER BASE! -Fix the final boss....even the youtube video isn't helpful, it is just some guy playing through it...no hints are offered-make the game more fast paced or at least make ships travel faster for more distant planets...honestly I gotta wait 342354354 years for the ships to reach their destination only for the planet not to be conquered because magically the planet has way more power than before-races are unbalanced, esp the robots.

												 It's a nice solid game, the first few level were too easy, then came 2-3 decent levels, then instantly the OMFG difficulty. The concept is nice, the game is ever changing, you can lose it from the top, but can win from the bottom with good/bad decisions.the controls aren't the best, but innovative I'd say. (It sucks to hold the mouse key for a certain amount of troops, while the APM would be essential...) Overall, it's a good game, and if youlike challenges, it's for you. PS: The AI is a b.tch, it'd rather attack you than defend against the other AI, it's like some maniac kamikaze.			"

												For anyone who played Mushroom Wars on the PS3 and enjoyed it, this game is for you!  It is the very same capture and defend game with a great twist - the map orbits!  It's very well put together with clean, fun graphics and a leveling system to keep you engaged.  Perks to unlock, achievements to strive for, and badges to obtain for display, creates a game environment that offers something for the completionist and gives the casual gamer a reason to keep coming back.You should buy it.

												No, its not Unstoppable Gorg, but it is interplanetary warfare from an RTS angle. PUA offers more than just a tower defense rehash. You get to go on the offensive against other planets in your solar system; taking them over and reaping their resources for your own benefit. There is no individual unit control here, but a more overarching system of command, simplified all the way down to a couple of mouse clicks. Dont expect the keyboard flurry of micromanagement that comes with starcraft, red alert or the like. This game is aimed squarely at casual gamers who will come back for more in short bursts. No story, simple controls, but enough achievements and a steep enough learning curve to make casual gamers feel rewarded. recommended for tower defense / real time strategy fans.			"

												Fun little title but I think the £7.99 is high for this title and would recommend ony buying at £3.50 or less. This would be much better if you could customise race, ship design, player color, gender and even upgrade your ships. Much more could be added to flesh out this game and only minor things too but in its current form its simply not worth the asking price in my opinion. But it is a good game and there are worse out there...			"

												While clearly inspired by Galcon, Planet's Under Attack adds some much needed depth to the formula. Your planets produce units as in Galcon but attacking requires money. While you attack you don't generate money. Also, the closer you are to your money cap, the more powerful your ships are. Also, sending ships to defend a planet you already control costs nothing. This creates a wonderful risk/reward balance where you want to commit to attacks you can win, and only with just enough ships to take it.Now add in 2 other races that each have modified rules for production (think the races in Starcraft 2 and how they are similar but unique in how they go about it) and you have not only a fine single player game but a great multiplayer setup. The campaign unfortunately only features the humans.If you liked Eufloria, Mushroom Wars, or Blue Libra 2, there's definitely something new to like here.			"

												Rating: 7/10Review: I bought this game while on sale, and with a coupon, which made it around $2-3. I figured that I would give it a try, and I am glad I did. Though this game can be very frustrating, especially when the difficulty increases a lot (Was stuck on levels 7-14 for weeks), it's a very fun game to play. It has multiplayer, skirmish, and campaign.  In campaign, your goal is to capture all of the planets, the enemy's home planets, or hold the 'flag' planet, using your force/army. You can upgrade your character/force, and gain money/energy.  In skirmish, you face 1-3 enemies and do the same as campaign, except here you can play as any character and can spend time practicing if you're having troubles on a level. I have not played multiplayer on this game, but I plan to soon!Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good, challenging game, and has patience and time on hand.Pros:-Multiplayer (haven't tried it)-Challenging-Good graphics and color-Fun, upbeat music-Multiple characters to play-Campaign-SkirmishCons:-Difficulty increases a lot after level 6-Robots are harder to play as-Almost sure it's impossible to complete the campaign, at least for me			"

												Meh. I bought this for a dollar and I'm glad I didn't pay more for it. I didn't really enjoy playing it.I didn't enjoy the game play mechanic very much. As the humans (the main campaign team), you don't gain income when attacking. While I understand that it's meant to penalize constant attacking, I found it annoying. I would have preferred to have more control over my ships, rather than just directing them to a specific planet.The difficulty level in the later missions is way too high, apparently due to lack of playtesting (apparently the devs didn't have anyone outside the company give it a try). The campaign missions put you at a huge disadvantage and trying to beat the AI is more frustrating than challenging. Maybe the multiplayer would be more fun (playing against a human instead of the AI).I'm not a big fan of the graphics. I find it looks garish and cartoony, though I do see what they were going for. I feel like this type of game is better when the art is more abstract. I experienced a lot of random slow-downs for no apparent reason when playing the campaign, which was irritating.I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												♥♥♥♥ this game. The enemy gets an unlimited cash supply and just swarms all of your planets no matter what you do. I give tower defense games that make you play a very specific way bad reviews because that is not how you do a good TD game. This one takes the cake. If you do not play a very, very, exactly specific way and do things exactly and specifically on a timer, you will lose ships, and the enemy will gain a unlimited supply of money and neverending troops. And no matter how many ships you send to whatever planet, the game is programmed so that the very second you release the mouse button to send your ships, the computer is programmed to know exactly how many you sent and at that very exact instant sends an instant counter attack to that planet at the same time you are trying to capture it. It does not have bad gameplay it is just a bad game by design. If you like playing games where you do not have any freedom at all in how you can strategize and play, then this is for you. If you want a real game that is made by people who know how to make a ♥♥♥♥ing strategy game, try Starcraft 2 or something else. Anything but this, my God anything.This game blows and so do all the people who are going to get butthurt and downvote my review. 1/10, go f--k yourselves.			"

												""Planets Under Attack"" is a strategy gem: very simple concept, yet has just enough depth to the gameplay to make it not just addicting but weirdly satisfying, especially after playing tug of war with the AI over a planet for what seems like forever and finally ripping it from their hands at the same time you attack their last planet. A quick summary of the gameplay: you start with usually one planet in one of multiple gametypes, including a deathmatch type, king of the hill type, and a gametype where you vie for control of specific planets ( the first to control all the marked planets wins, regardless of how many planets the other players have). You click on another planet and hold the mouse button to determine how many ships you want to send; neutral planets/your own planets dont cost any money to invade, but enemy planets do--at least for the human race, the only race i've played as so far, but i've read that the robots play differently--and you go from there, upgrading your planets to increase taxes and building up your defenses by transferring ships to increase the population. Again, on the surface, simple, but a game can quickly dissolve into chaos requiring quick thinking and quicker clicking to turn the tide.Definitely recommended if you get a coupon, but for $10, its a great strategy time killer that also has a fun multiplayer. Check it out.			"

												This game is something to consider, as it converts a relitavely simple strategy mechanic into a fun and easy to learn concept. However, there are a few things to consider:1. With limited strategy decisions, the possibilities of achieving victory fall short but it can be argued that the several game modes contradict this.2. The difficulty quickly drops from introductory tutorials an onslaught of difficult levels that may need to be repeated severl times.3. There is a lack of change in scenery as there are layout choices but the overall visuals never deviate from what is seen on face value.Aside from this, there is potential here for a great party game and a quick mini-game if you're running out of things to play. At the price it is now, I would definitely reccomend it but don't expect a large amount of content for the origional price.P.S. I have a low play time as I have played this offline.			"

Not to many games i dumb it down to easy but i had to. The multiplayer is a ton of fun, i havent tried to find a random game but getting a few friends together is a good time. A risk style rts with a few different game modes. I like it.			"

Take control of your mighty space armada, and wreak havoc across the cosmos, but choose your targets wisely! Conquered planets will net you income to expand your forces, but you must carefully weigh the pros and cons of attacking each planet, as timing and available resources are critical to victory. Above all else, you must keep a cool head. Enemies race to capture your territory as you hone in on theirs and multiple battles will rage on all fronts. You must make tactical decisions at every turn, from scouting your enemies and deploying units, to shoring up your planets’ defenses and knowing when to attack and when to defend. Strategic multi-tasking and a keen military mind will lead directly to unrivaled glory…while careless play will reduce your army to space dust.			"

												This game is a really good strategy game. Although the screenshots are somehow confusing, Planets is a lot of fun. Each mission can be replayed in three difficulty modes - and the hard mode is really challenging... Beside the campaign the game comes with a Skirmish mode with several different match types (King of the Hill, VS,  etc) In that mode you can play the robots, too. Like it.			"

Defend a planet until reinforcements arrive, fly into uncharted space, conquer planets and set up defenses before rivals attack - the list goes on and on, as there is no shortage of objectives in your struggle for interstellar dominance. Start out as a novice and learn the ropes, or ramp up the challenge with three levels of difficulty.

												Excels at bringing more life to the ""send the units to their death"" genre. There were some places for improvement where things were not introduced properly while other things were annoyingly overexplained. My biggest problem with this game is that there are tons of in-game unlocks that were not relayed into steam achievements. I would have loved to see this title toward the top of the achievement scoring systems some of us use. Doing so helps sales and thus populates multiplayer, and well - just makes me play♥♥♥♥♥♥longer. I haven't found a MP partner yet, so I cant comment on it tho even some of the AI skirmish maps can be intense. Graphically this is the best ive seen in this genre. passing eufloria which had its minimalistic charm. Its not mind blowing, but a lot of extra work was done to mix things up that could have been written off. Overall, highly recommended - but as most of the unlocks in game dont amount to achievements I will sadly move on to a scoring game without bothering with most of them. Non achievement meta gamers shouldn't have any problems.			"

If anyone knows Gilbert they should probably check up on him, cuz I worry about the well-being of my homies, ya dig?

												Another cell game, but with arguably the worst UI / combat interface I have ever seen. Clunky, unwieldy and unintuitive. Imagine having the bulk of your army on a single planet and no way to send it out without manually switching every other planet to 'guard mode' first. One at a time. Oh, and there's no way to send ships quickly. You have to hold down the left mouse button on a planet, and the slider slowly goes from 0 -> 1 -> 2 .... -> 10 -> 11 ... -> 19 -> 21 -> 23 ... you get the idea. Sending medium sized fleets (only medium, mind you!) can require you to hold the LMB for several seconds, an eternity in action games like this. Wanna attack multiple planets simultaneously? Wanna get a bunch of planets to attack / defend a nearby planet quickly? Not gonna happen.Conclusion: Bad interface. Very bad interface. Stay away. Even free flash games have better UI design. Check out Galcon 2 (which is free, even!) instead if you're into games like this. Now THAT's how this game should have been done.			"

												This game is similar to Risk. Each player begins with a planet (or multiple) and some $. The object of the game is to conquer your enemy either through genocide or by acheiving certain objectives. It costs $ to attack other planets. $ is built up over time with greater amounts of $ accruing with increases in controlled territory.You have multiple missions and difficulties to choose from. My only complaint is the soundtrack is decent but a bit repetetive. I choose to mute it and plat iTunes in the background.  Beyond that, the game's aesthetic is pleasing with rich, bold coloring, and crisp detail. The campaign missions are fun but the multiplayer function is much better and offers unlimited replay value.I would recommend this game for adults and children as it can be easily played and enjoyed by both.

												Planets Under Attack (PUA) is one of those fast RTS that has a very simple interface, yet has more complexities hidden under the simple rules that makes things interesting. You've probably played many games like this before: send ""units"" from one ""base"" against an enemy base, or send units from all bases. Bases are different sizes and controls their build rate. The bigger the base, the faster they build. The idea is to conquer all the enemy bases. Galcon, Spacecom, Archipelago, they are many variations out there. PUA added several wrinkles to the game, as well as made things simpler. When you order an attack, ALL planets that's not in ""defense mode"" (which you can quickly toggle) will send ships to attack. However, your attack size are subject to your ""budget"", which controls how many ships you can send, and your budget only goes up when you are not busy sending ships. And planets can be upgraded (from level 0 to level 3) with the budget as well. Then there are ""space fortresses"", which shoots down hostile ships that flies near it, but not fast enough to deal with a large fleet. When it's neutral it shoots everybody. If you capture it it shoots enemies, and upgrading them increases their firing rate (but still not enough to handle a large fleet). Then there are different game modes, from simple conquer (kill all enemies) to king of the hill (hold one special system for 3 minutes against 1 or more opponents), to domination (hold special systems that generate domination points, first to 300 wins) to special conditions, like enemies that stays dormant for X minutes, There are also alternate starting race. Instead of a human, you can play as robot with a very different starting rules. Each ""mission"" can be played at regular, medium, or hard which yields 0 to 2 stars. Some missions can only be unlocked with X number of stars. Some of the missions can get pretty tense. A king of the hill battle can be tense when you are trying to keep the two enemies fighting each other while you try to pick off the unprotected systems while keep both fo them equally weak and focuses on each other rather than ganging up on you, while making sure you can take away the ""hill"" before the timer expires to reset it. It will take a while to whittle them down and keep them weak enough for you to take the ""hill"". The actual user interface is a bit weird. You can't set the exact number of ships, but instead you hold the mouse button until you got to the right number of ships, which is obviously not precise at all. Remember it's also subject to your ""budget"". However, some of the missions are impossible, or at least not explained well. There's one about repaying the ""loan"" but I can't seem to find the button to replay, and I don't accumulate money fast enough to repay it. Still, for people who enjoy this genre, the color graphics (slightly cartoony) and not quite serious attitude is a bit of fun. For more tactical challenges in a similar gameplay, you may be better off playing Spacecom instead.  "

												7/10 It is a fun game to play, with beautiful graphics and humor.The multiplayer gives the game a lot of replay value,making it a bargain for only 10 euro.			"

												What feels like a mobile port, with the strategic depth of a puddle and lots of fancy window dressing in the hope you won't notice. It would be forgivable if it were fun, but I struggle to play it for more than 2 minutes at a time.			"

												When I start up the game, the menus and all other stuff flicker. When I open a menu or something else, the old and new screens are shown simultaneously which makes it impossible to navigate through the menu. Starting a mission it shows the same broken issues.

												By far one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game combat ever thought.  the AI is specially programmed for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ , making the most brilliant solutions useless. All enemies target you down even if that means some will be destroyed in the process for no meaning....			"

												Excels at bringing more life to the ""send the units to their death"" genre. There were some places for improvement where things were not introduced properly while other things were annoyingly overexplained. My biggest problem with this game is that there are tons of in-game unlocks that were not relayed into steam achievements. I would have loved to see this title toward the top of the achievement scoring systems some of us use. Doing so helps sales and thus populates multiplayer, and well - just makes me play♥♥♥♥♥♥longer. I haven't found a MP partner yet, so I cant comment on it tho even some of the AI skirmish maps can be intense. Graphically this is the best ive seen in this genre. passing eufloria which had its minimalistic charm. Its not mind blowing, but a lot of extra work was done to mix things up that could have been written off. Overall, highly recommended - but as most of the unlocks in game dont amount to achievements I will sadly move on to a scoring game without bothering with most of them. Non achievement meta gamers shouldn't have any problems.			"

												I enjoyed the single player mode!There is a little story and the missions are setup in a way that you will get better and better with each mission you fullfill.The only thing that was a little bit annoying is the fleet management with the ""click & hold"" mechanics but well every game has its flaws.I bought it for like 5 Euro and I guess I would buy it again.

												Another cell game, but with arguably the worst UI / combat interface I have ever seen. Clunky, unwieldy and unintuitive. Imagine having the bulk of your army on a single planet and no way to send it out without manually switching every other planet to 'guard mode' first. One at a time. Oh, and there's no way to send ships quickly. You have to hold down the left mouse button on a planet, and the slider slowly goes from 0 -> 1 -> 2 .... -> 10 -> 11 ... -> 19 -> 21 -> 23 ... you get the idea. Sending medium sized fleets (only medium, mind you!) can require you to hold the LMB for several seconds, an eternity in action games like this. Wanna attack multiple planets simultaneously? Wanna get a bunch of planets to attack / defend a nearby planet quickly? Not gonna happen.Conclusion: Bad interface. Very bad interface. Stay away. Even free flash games have better UI design. Check out Galcon 2 (which is free, even!) instead if you're into games like this. Now THAT's how this game should have been done.			"

												Super addicting and fun game! It is a real time strategy. Only drawback is the campaign ending sucks!!!!!!! It gets really good and upon beating the final boss it just abruptly ends ..... kind of discourages me from playing more ...... But anyway for under 5$ this is a must buy if you like strategy games.			"

												I'm conflicted about giving this an up vote because while I did enjoy it I feel the difficulty level is so high that most gamers will quickly quit out of frustration.It's a micro-managing strategy game in which you control planets that give you money and ships over time. The money can be spent on upgrades, attacks, or hoarded for a combat buff. The ships are sent out in streams to conquer enemy planets and defend your own. This genre of game is not new, and variants of it can be found for free on sites like Kongregate. But this game has much better graphics and sound/music compared to the free versions.There are various tech upgrades that you can earn and equip in a limited number of slots. There are different game types to keep things fresh such as Elimination (kill everyone) and King of the Hill (control a certain planet for a set period of time). There are different kinds of planets and opponents to fight as well. For example, one planet is an ""infested"" planet which is covered with alien eggs. This planet will remain neutral while a timer counts down. When the timer reaches zero the eggs hatch and the previously neutral planet suddenly becomes a major threat. The player will have to weigh the pros and cons of destroying the infested planets before pursuing the main objective, or hoping to rush to victory before the eggs hatch and the situation becomes untenable.The story is about an entrepreneur who goes looking for riches in an uncharted area of space while being hounded by intergalactic debt collectors. It was mildly entertaining but the ending left a lot of loose ends.Multiplayer seems mostly dead, so I played only single player.The controls are simple, actually a little too simple since there is no pause button I could find. Things get hectic very fast in this game with streams of hundreds of ships criss-crossing the map at any given time. A delay of even a few seconds in terms of not attacking or upgrading can spell defeat for the player. The AI is quick to notice any opening in your defenses and pounce.I went into this game thinking it would be casual entertainment that wouldn't make me think. Wrong! It starts out easy enough with some generous tutorial missions. After that the difficulty level starts ramping up exponentionally. By mission 10 I figure most casual gamers have been blown away. By mission 16 I figure all but the most die-hard strategists have been wiped out. I'm a glutton for punishment though, and I like a good challenge, so I toughed it out and beat all 30 missions of the single player campaign. Even the Easy difficulty level was ludicrously difficult. You have been warned!If you're a casual gamer looking for an easy game, look elsewhere. If you're a hardcore strategist who isn't afraid of fast-paced micro-managing this game might be for you.			"

												Animations are nice and campaign is fine (little hard though). But don't expect you will play multiplayer because it is dead. Also this game could have been better if only it was updated with more content (it is obvious by design that developers intended to add more campaigns but they never did).			"

												Planets Under Attack,Pros-Easy to learn.-Nice cartoony style. (a patato can run it)-Almost fully voice acted singleplayer.-A Surprising amount of Depth to the gameplay.Cons-Only 2 Factions. (Humans and Robot 2.0)-Glitchy Multiplayer.-Game maps can become Extreamly messy and crowded.-Only 4 Game modes.Planets under Attack is a strategy adventure suitable for both inexperienced and hard core strategy gamers,The game offers 18 different Multiplayer Maps for 2-4 players.And a Singleplayer thats almost fully Voice acted, its also a Good way to prepair for the multiplayerThe Game offers the player the choice between 2 Factions : The Humans and Robot 2.0 (Both these factions act Differently)Its the most fun with Friends ofcourse (what isn't?) And it The has a Really Nice art style in my opinion. (Who doesnt like SPACE )			"

												picked this game up for like a buck... totally worth the buck.the game is pretty easy, other reviews make the game sound harder than it really is.the game is pretty fun and interesting, totally worth the buck, dunno if i'd spend the full price on this game though.  (10$ seems a bit steep.... maybe 5$)i got the game last nite and played it for a few hours, i'm about to boot it back up, if your looking for a game you'll play more than once, then i recommend checking this game out.
