												The port of this game is incredibly poorly done. Besides next to no graphics settings, the only resolution it has leaves at least 50% of my screen blacked out making the game absolutely unplayable. Thank god for refunds.			"

												Garbage moneygrabbing port.PROS:- Really satisfying design aesthetic- Can play with some childhood icons- A lot of the same, fun gameplay of the previous games in the seriesCONS:- Dissapointing lack of freedom of movement when playing ground characters- Only real unit improvments are in the form of currency-locked minor upgrades as opposed to new units.- My system is more than capable for a game that demands twice what this does, yet FPS peaked at 20.- More faction selections and yet no meaningful variety that forced different strategy choices.- Might be a personal issue, but my mouse moved at ♥♥♥♥ing light speed and none of the options changed it.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing microtransactions on game that is ALREADY 15 ♥♥♥♥ING US DOLLARS for sweet mericful jesus' sake like you didn't already take enough of my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ money why not try to mind♥♥♥♥♥♥me into being willfully robbed- Ubisoft's garbage Uplay garbage- Ubisoft ruined this game- Ubisoft- UbisoftI believe two things. One, that Signal is still capable of exciting, quirky, and captivating games. And two, that Ubisoft took what should have been an improvement on the series and ruined it with their insulting brand-proprietary style of end-user ♥♥♥♥ing and no amount of hyphenated words could express how earnestly I encourage the divorce of these two companies.

												First: I am a HUGE Toy Soldiers fan. I played the last two titles extensively. Now, hearing about a sequel to two of my favorite games with Assasin's Creed and G.I. Joe? I was pumped. Like, puking rainbows pumped. Then, I bought the game.It came a full day after the promised release date, was twice the price of the base game to buy a third of the game's total content, and immediately required me to install Uplay. These issues were hard to overlook, but I managed. After they'd dropped the ball out of the gate, Ubisoft threw Microtransactions at me. On a $30 game. The game has a 12 mission story, compared to it's predeccesors which both at least doubled that for 2/3 the price. The armies are just shy of retextures, and content for the game was unnervingly hard to find. I've requested a refund, despite my computer being left on for a day (mind you, I've spent maybe an hour and a half tops,) and I desperately hope I get it. Save yourself the trouble, and buy the last two games combined for a third the price.			"

												So the tutorial was fun and worked fine, but when i tried to play any other level i got these black boxes on my screen in spots and in the corners some ranbow lights. Now i know this isnt an issue with my graphics card or anything else in my computer cause i tried play a few other games and had no issues. Besides that issue i have nothing else to complain about beside the 30fps lock but considering this is realease date i am not too overly upset about it. If these issues were fixed the game would be great. I would not recommend this game at its current state but when issues are fixed from patches be sure to get this game.			"

												Omfg where do i begin. First off i am a huge fan of signal games, but like all hard-core toy soldiers fans, we saw the decline of customer loyalty starting with toy soldiers: complete. Toy soldiers: complete was a god aweful port from last gen consoles, bugged to hell, and was ""protected"" by the early access seal. By the time it was released on pc, all of the fans starting to buy big red ♥♥♥♥ing whistles because we knew something as wretched as this would be spewed from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of capitalist hell itself. As for this ""game"", its a piece of trash. It might as well be a MOBILE GAME. The first thing that stood out when i booted up the menu was that there was A SHOP! No complete, well made game ever in the history of man has had a ♥♥♥♥ing in menu shop where you can buy coins to unlock units and weapons for your army, that should have been unlocked in the first place or at least, by completing the campaign. Yet again, like mobile games. Instead of unlocking items by skill, you are subjected to a slot machine that randomly gives you upgrades etc. Or you can pay $5 to unlock the units and upgrades yourself. The textues on high, looks like they are from 2007.The gameplay itself is fun and engaging. Although, besides all the bad♥♥♥♥♥♥that is included in this grotesque, morsel of a game.   You ready? Dun dun dunnnn,,, The game is locked to 30fps! Jesus christ on a bicycle! Its borderline unplayable! Its only playable if you like to watch slidshows of the game you are playing. So overall, this game is a piece of digital garbage and is not worth your time of money in its current state. Not to demoralize you guys but signal doesnt like to patch or fix their games. *cough* *cough* Toy Soldiers complete. *cough*Clash of clans/10-IGN			"

												It pains me to say this, as I was so excited that Toy Soldiers War Chest was out as I have long wanted a good game with G.I. Joe in. I'm still waiting, it's a buggy tedious piece of crap that is fugly as hell.Even though it took me 3 attempts at loading it to get to the main menu, freezes on the character select screen whilst it checks the uplay servers to see what characters you have brought, I can forgive that♥♥♥♥♥♥if it is fun but it isn't any more fun than any one of the countless free games out there.    Waves are long, numerous and repetitive even for a tower defence game, and the DLC armies which are the only reason to want this game, don't improve it enough.  There are hundreds of characters they could have used to man different placements but instead you spend most of your time controlling the greenshirts/cobra troopers in turrets/bunkers shooting the enemy canon fodder to unlock your special character which is the only reason you want to play the game. Maybe there's unlocks to speed it up as you play, I don't know, there is something super disappointing about this game, and I don't just mean the 30fps, sluggish mouse controls (use a joypad) and micro transactions.Just ignore the licences, it isn't a particularly good game anyway and is a waste of the G.I. Joe, Cobra & MOTU brands and those brands are why I was probably hoping for more.  I expect a lot of people will play it and be perfectly happy but I don't feel it does them justice and certainly doesn't do the price justice.  In a few months when it is patched and on sale it could be a lot closer to a recommendation but for now I couldn't be bothered to try multiplayer as you only get a limited time to get a refund and that is exactly what I have done.  I just can't see them patching it to the extent I feel I got £25 worth of game.			"

												While not a horrible game itself, I'd still recommend you get Toy Soldiers: Complete instead. This is one of those odd cases where in the future, it will seem like the newer game was actually older then the older game. Gone is a lot of the whimsical charm that Complete has, or the excitement of the bonuses, or the finding lost objects, or... well... you get it. Basically, some people re-made the original and thought they could do better.. but ended up doing worse. After playing Complete.. and then this.. your constantly thinking, this is worse but ok. But after awhile.. the worseness wears on you.. and you start getting bitter.. and your like.. DID THEY EVEN PLAY THE OLD GAME!? I loved the bonuses, the set pieces, spending all night finding hidden objects and the... well, I guess you didn't? I dunno.. it's like making the Wizard Of Oz part 2.. but skipping the musical part and the witches and the whole technicolor thing. You'd be like, WTF did they like about the original to then even bother making Part 2? This feels like that. Skip unless you loved Complete so much.. you want to marry it. Then maybe buy this.. like I did and do. But be prepared to be crushed with utter disappointment.			"

												I bought the game thinking that since I enjoyed the first one this one would be good. I experianced long load times, microtransactions, and paid DLC that is part of the game. Each 'army' that you pick has it's own grind to get through. So if you like more than one army I guess you are investing a good amount of time just to get them leveled. The upgrades for each army are locked by microtransactions or in game currency and is all random. There are way too many problems with this game for it to have been released this year and they expect you to pay $15 for less than half the game.			"

												First the Good:This game is lots of fun. If you are a fan of the last few toy soldiers you will love this one. Every army is simmilar enough that its not a challange to pick up another one off the bat but they all have a flavor that makes them worth playing and experamenting with (armys have different powers, strangths ect...)Now for the bad:Kill Uplay. For god sakes If I wanted to buy the game on Uplay I would. DRM protection is a joke, This game was up on the torrents within the first day of launch. All Uplay has done is create another problem for your normal buyer. Dump the platform.Forceing me to pay for DLC that is in game is horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ Day one 15 bucks worth of DLC is bull. I understand you need to make up for the licences (He man, GI Joe...). But passing that on to the buyer is poor practice in todays buissness. Make up some other armys, you can do it...*The game is not locked at 30 FPS anymore, it is now set to 60 after recent patch.When you make a port to PC, you dont get to just shove it in laughing to the bank. Make sure it works. Look at the system EA had going. Bad company practice WILL lead to lower profits and hire piracy rates. Respect your buyer and they will respect you.I never had a problem with GFX. Everything looked fine for me and my FPS was fne, but thats just me. Im sure others are not as lucky. Some myths:Some are saying that this game has micro transactions. The in game method of unlocking tower upgrades is threw an in game coinage. You beat levels and you get coins. Every time you win a level (or loss) you get free stuff and coins.  You can pay to get coins but this is stupid. After I played the campain once I had all but one army fully unlocked without spending a cent in the micro store..In fact I did not know you could pay to get coins untill I found it on accident. Its Simply a way for the lazy asses to get ahead.  Dont spend a cent on the ingame micro, Its exactly like the past games if you dont.Over all its a solid game. Not a work of art or ground brakeing but its still a solid game. If you love the past games, buy it. If you are unsure wait for it to be on sale. Id give it 7/10.			"

												Initially game is fun- but as you get further in it is disappointing.  Biggest disappointment is when you get upgrades"" when your main character gains levels (not even sure levels do  anything outside of getting a ""box"" with 3 upgrades that are always duplicates). If you get a repeat upgrade - it turns into coins that you will already have too many of. Game just gets very stale very fast.  Very limited turrets / weapons choices.  Taking over your character is also limited. First you have to kill a lot of enemies consecutively to build a ""bar"" to allow you to release your commander.  But it's limited since it has to have ""battery power"". 90 or 60 seconds total.  The batteries(to gain additional time) are found on the field  to extend the ""play time"". These do not respawn and the levels where you can get high number of consecutive kills is limited.There is a customize army option that I assume is multiplayer only. If you are just looking for a towerdefense singleplayer - seems a lot of features may be useless.			"

												UPDATE: Since the latest patch things are going smoothly. There are still some resolution bugs but nothing too annoying. The 30fps cap on SP has been lifted. The only thing I still have to do is try a co-op/MP game (those are still locked in 30fps as far as I know.)ORIGINAL: Honestly, Im finding this game to be a blast. The 30fps thing is a little annoying true, and certian resolutions don't show up correctly yet, but all those issues seem to fade away once the fun of Toy Soldiers starts ramping up. It takes a little bit to get used to the upgrade changes that are in place, but almost everything is obtainable through play progression. The microtransactions are only there if you want to speed things along. But then of course your just cheating yourself out of playing the game aren't you?All this being said if you didn't like TS before, you won't now. But if you did and are yearning for more TS action, give this one a look. You just might find yourself enjoying this a bit too much.			"

												I was really surprised by this game, Signal Studios and Krome Studios have definitely stepped up the offering from previous games. I love the maps, lots of foliage and open terrain, with beautifully designed structures. The eight armies all have something different and unique to offer, the game IMO is a good complement to owners of Toy Soldiers Complete, love the new look and design. I have this game for PS4 and PC, PS4 is more colorful and cartoonish to a degree than the PC version, though on a good rig, PC looks more intricate and detailed, it's a preference thing, some will like one version over the other. The graphics and unit designs in this game are infinitely better than previous offerings of Toy Soldiers games, by far, this is the best looking game in the series to date. Sound effects on headphones is great, and when playing on my Logitech Z-5500s, some of the anti-personnel weapons should be more defined and powerful sounding, though they still sound great.The progression map and unlock of unique units and traits is a great approach, you can pick a faction and level it up throughout an open progression campaign map, nice touch. Overall, I highly recommend this game, seeing the Joes, He-Man and others battle it out on beautifully designed maps and levels is a joyous sight to be had. Hope to see more content added to this game in the future, want more of it, it's that good!I've played mostly on console, just picked up the PC version, playing on an i7-920 stock, Gigabyte G1 970 at 2560x1440 all video card settings and in game maxed with zero issues so far, Windows 10 OS. Of note, some of the troops on the turrets do odd things I've noticed, I'm mostly using Phantom and I noticed some of the individual troops on your turrets are not even firing at the enemy, they are just randomly firing off into nowhere, a little disconcerting, more of an immersion breaker, than anything else. Another thing, the difficulty spikes up tremendously at times, especially with bosses, so be prepared.			"

I wonder why?-It didn't really cater to me because of the toys used. It felt stupid with toys being thrown against ww1 era toys...

It will annoy some people like me. -alot of dlc content on day one just asking for your money. *throws out money* ..this also really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.Time will fix the bugs but I already got a refund because I didn't really think it was as good as toy soldiers complete.

The unit upgrades are fun and creative. The enemy's are enjoyable. the maps also look fun and creative (well, some of them do) But over all i have to say my first expereince with this game is not that bad. The micro transaction are just a option. I am playing as the Kaiser in the game and i have NO trouble unlocking any of the weapon upgrades. I did not encounter any glitch yet. What i do have to say is that the textures could really be updated.This is just a game you like or hate.			"

Posted: August 13, 2015
												I was very dubious about this game given the luke warm reception from reviews and let's play videos, not to mention the cheeky first day DLC which costs more than the game does, but eventually I caved into the nerdgasm induced by He-Man and G.I Joe armies... no homoerotic tone intended; I'm an 80's kid, had some of the toys and watched the cartoons.Anyway this is my review. I have almost 4 hours on this game at the time of reviewing so already I feel that I am in a better position to review this game than people who have 0.5 hours in it and such.First I downloaded. I was expecting Uplay but it hadn't been installed since my latest format, so I sat there for the better part of 30 minutes while it installed. Once it did I tried to login. It had been a while so I sat there thinking of the passwords I normally use but none were correct. I was then locked out of Uplay because I had tried to login too much. Not being given an option to do anything about it, and the password reset not working at all, I went onto the website to try to send a support ticket and guess what? That's right, I couldn't access the site because I was locked out. ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious right? In the end I had to call, yes, call Ubisoft and ask them to do something. The guy was helpful despite me remarking about how terrible Uplay is, he even said ""We get a lot of complaints about Uplay."" He couldn't insult the company that employed him of course, nor would I expect him to, but it was funny none the less. ""Can I help you with anything else today?"" He asked. ""Yes, please tell your bosses that Uplay is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and to please stop making us use it."" I laughed, he laughed and in a diplomatic tone said ""I will certainly pass that information over for you sir.""I digress. The game! So first impressions; what a crappy port! The resolution works fine of course but the menu feels quite akward, almost as if the game just had mouse support slapped in with a bit of digital tape. Still, it's not horrendous.I watched a Let's play video earlier of a guy reviewing it and he hit the roof when he saw the shop with microtransactions. Erm, mate? You can grind that money and it's really effin easy too. So scratch that as a con off of your list if you are thinking about this game. Microtransactions are purely for impatient/lazy people. They are not necessary!The framerate. Yes most people have an opinion of how choppy it feels being locked at 30fps. Well I didn't, it felt fine to me even on full graphics. I'm not going to say that people who are going on about that are snobs or anything, but it's no where near as jumpy as they make out. If it is, I would maybe suggest that it's their rigs...maybe lacking in ram or up to date drivers, I don't know. Update: Been playing for 11 hours now so far and not had a single problem with framerate. Just a bunch of snobs complaining about something which isn't even noticable then.I do have a couple of problems with the performance though: you can't alt+tab. Well you can, but if you do, the resolution will reset to default (1280x768 iirc). In this day and age, inexcusable. Also when I was doing the tutorial I was given these TINY icons on the screen telling me what key to press; so tiny that I couldn't see what it said. I'm assuming this is because the resolution was never meant to go that high on consoles and they just didn't bother to make the icons bigger to compensate... but otherwise the resolution is fine.So the gameplay. It's a tower defence game with toys. It's actually a lot of fun. The graphics are a little dated looking and the controls quite basic, but that's by no means a horrible thing. The gameplay is alot of fun. You can unlock upgrades and each army feels quite unique if not in it's options but in it's feel. Campaign seems only good if you want to unlock stuff but gets quite annoying later on. The weekly thing seems quite fun. I want to try co-op when I convince my friends to get it, but for now my experience is in single player.The controls are fine for the most part, but now and again you are given control of a map defined flying unit.... the controls are screwed for those and that needs to be fixed asap.It's a good game, despite it's shortcomings. I have read a post from a developer on another review saying how they are looking into the framerate cap, so they at least haven't given up on it. A few fixes here and there and it will be great. It's really up to you if you want to pay 25 pounds (or $30, whichever currency you use) for everything; You only really get half a game if you get the vanilla and not the hall of fame edition. It's really cheeky of them to do that but I still think this game is worth that price: providing they add some general fixes to make the game more PC friendly. The only real gripe is with Uplay. I hate it, it doesn't work well, slow, and it's just more unnecessary processing power with everything else I'm running			"

												If you read my other review for Toy Soldiers: Complete, then sadly this review is going to be the complete opposite. Toy Soldiers: War Chest is simple not worth the money that it asks for £11.99 (for the standard game) and £24.99 (for the hall of fame addition). Although it includes characters from different franchises you have to pay £3.99 for the privilage of owning that character - such as GI Joe and Cobra which is a real kick in the teeth! But the game forces you to do this as the basic armies are crap! The only playable basic army is the WW1 German Army, the rest are boring, stupid and a waste of time. On top this the game is meant for a console, you can't control aircraft because they do a million flips if you sneeze or move around (plus they are so weak!), the gameplay is repetative and boring, additionally none of your friends have the game or players who have the game don't do multiplayer.To Conclude:if you are looking for the following items in this gameNo or limited funBad/Mediocre reviews (check out gamespot or ign if you don't believe me)Expensive (£11.99 standard or +£3.99 for DLC or £24.99 for FULL Game)Lacking in gameplayLacking in friends and other human being who play this game!4 base armies - Only 1 playableMICROTRANSACTIONS -game currencyUPLAY the most pointless and worst system if to be invented by mankind! Which you need in order to create an account and play the game!UBISOFTOne massive leap for mankind and the franchise going backwards!Then this is the game for you!0/10 would never play until the day i died - IGN*Note i do like the game, it is fun but unless you are a Toy Soldiers fan and are willing to put up with these pull backs. Then unfortunatly this game is not for you, and for this reason i cannot recommend it unlike Toy Soldiers:Complete which is the best game of the franchise.			"

												Abandonware?  The last news/update was August 20th, 2015, shortly after it was added to Steam.  Since then, nearly everyone (myself included) who purchased either the Deluxe edition or the DLC, cannot access them.  There is no response from the devs nor company.   Some have speculated that ""you must reach level X to open the DLC,"" but it is not confirmed, nor is it posted anywhere useful, if that is the case.  If you're thinking about getting the game, I'm not saying that you shouldn't.  I'm saying you should wait until the issue is resolved...but it's been eight months (so far).			"

												This is why I don't buy Ubisoft games.  I purchased the Hall of Fame edition and found that the DLC was locked and the token store marked as unavailable.  It did not believe that I had an internet connection after just downloading the game from Steam.  Ubisoft support was unsurprisingly unresponsive.  Dealing with Uplay is bad enough, but this was simply defective, and there was no solution.  So I got a refund.			"

												Uplay is not the issue here with this game. I bought the game because my friend told me that it was pretty good. He had the ps4 version. So the plan was to purchase the game so we could play co op but when I goto start playing I notice that I have none of the dlc that was supposed to come with the hall of fame edition. Since that was a big selling point for me to play as heman and gi joe the 2 biggest toylines from my childhood. So I went to the discussion boards seeking help with my problem and thats when I heard that people who didnt even pay for the dlc were getting access to it and the people that did pay were not. With things like that goin on best thing to do is hit that good ol refund button, which I did.  Thats about all I can recommend on this game is the refund request			"

												I don't care about the FPS issue. I care about game play. This game has it in spades. Part Castle Defense, Part Battlefront, Enough Collectibles to keep you busy for awhile and a new take on a tired genre all up to a lot of fun. The combat is fast but manageable, the graphics are clear and fairly easy to see, the armies are distinct from one another - Honestly I can;t find much to gripe about. Not crazy about the DLC armies, but the fact that you can buy a ""complete"" version and not have to mess with that part is a MAJOR BONUS. Having to unlock them in game is a little less thrilling, but I can understand the decision to do so. I have yet to play Multiplayer so this is only for the Single Player. I'd love to see more armies added in the future.			"

												Game has potential, however can't recommend in current form. Bought 'Hall of Fame Edition', which includes Legendary Heroes DLC (the main reason for purchase). However, on playing, DLC wont unlock in-game, despite being recorded as unlocked in Steam. Support for this game is appalling. Ubisoft doesn't appear to be responding to this issue in forums. Tried to get a refund from Steam, but because I've played for longer than two hours (larger to work out how to fix this), they wont provide a refund (despite the game actually being broken).Therefore would suggest not to purchase until issue with DLC not unlocking is fixed.

												Everything great about the first two games in this series has vanished.  If I had known Uplay was included, I would not have purchased this game just because of that.  There are less turrets than before, less vehicles than before and the maps are crappy,  The campaign is the exact same for all heros, so it has no replay value.  By far the worst hero is Ezio, just worthless.  Once again Ubisoft turns a great game into garbage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!!!!!			"

												There's a good game somewhere underneath the pile of 'bleh' that is War Chest.  It's almost as though Signal made it functional, then Ubisoft took it off them and went ""Good enough!!"".It essentially plays the same as the preceding instalments, with some good ideas and bigger scope, but there's just so many elements out of whack.  Games modes flat out don't work, conspicuously missing turrets, no difficulty settings (defaulting to 'easy mode'), plus you get all the most powerful turrets from the get go, and have almost all upgrades unlocked after a few levels.  The only challenge seems to some from endlessly completing the game with each army, which would be an absolute drudge.  Ironically the last 2 levels border on interesting.  It's a shame the rest of them require little to no tactics.Barring the game design choices, even the basic functionality seems to be unpolished. The game freezes, enemies refuse to die or fly through the air, and it goes into a distorted windowed mode every time you tab out.  I really hope whatever deal they struck with Ubisoft doesn't mean they have to publish ALL of their future games through them.  I'm still hoping for a proper sequel to the first 2 solid games.Toy Soldiers: Future War anyone?			"

Yes you have Uplay here, so far the only bad points by this game. Well online the did a slight change, in previous version you did send waves, units and protect in same time, now is more a round system so one is protecting the other is sending waves.

												This game has potential yet just entirely ends up short of what it used to be.  I was naive and thought ""hell, I loved all the older games so might as well enjoy this one too,"" so i spent 30$ on it.  the first time i tried to open it, it redirected me to Uplay, which disgusts me that ubisoft even tried to make.  After 15 minutes of setting up a Uplay account, I was ready to get started on this game, And it crashed and wouldn't work what so ever. then i finally got working, I went to play the tutorial, but the frame rate is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ and my mouse sensitivity was out of the ♥♥♥♥ing roof.  The different armies are not enough to spend an additional 15$, they make any difference.  The turrets are reused and retextured to make them look different but same sounds and damage as older models, and when you go to shoot the turret itself the mouse sensitivity makes it nearly impossible to even shoot at the target. Even though I spent 30 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars they still try to rip more money out of me with mircotransactions.  Ubisoft has ruined another good game franchise in it's money-hungry ways to tear money out its fans.  Uplay is utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I made a mistake downloading.  Ubisoft has my thanks for spending more time on writing on a sad, slow game then actually playing the game itself.			"

												Controls for PC / Mouse are very poorly implemented.When using keyboard and mouse, the UI elements that tell what what button to press are so tiny you cannot make them out.And most importantly, i bought the Hall of Fame Edition which includes all of the DLC....and the game did not give me access to any of that DLC. In-game store and all dlc characters were ""unavailable"". This is a decently common problem many people are having, and Ubisoft support will only try to shift the blame onto Steam saying that Steam should have given you keys to enter to access the content. As it stands, THE DLC AND HALL OF FAME EDITION ARE COMPLETELY A WASTE OF MONEY BECAUSE YOU CANNOT USE ANY OF THAT CONTENT IN GAME until such time Ubisoft decides to fix it.tldr: Poor controls, Bad port, and the DLC is currently a scam. DO NOT BUY.			"

Posted: February 8, 2016
												Introduction:    I have played the other two Toy Soldier game(Xbox) and enjoyed them a lot. They were very close to perfect and the second one was a clear step forward for the series. Toy Soldier War Chest falls shorter than either of those games to perfection and I feel it doesn’t grow the series at all. General Thoughts:     War Chest is a lot of fun it uses the formula that the other two games built but does do all that much different from the other two games. The hero mechanic has been expanded where you have a kill-streak like bar. As you get more kills in the turret that you’re using the bar will go up unlocking hero, vehicle, and then super weapon for you to use. Each race has unique turrets animations, models and has some slight differences in rate of fire and range. Heroes have unique and fun weapons but the dlc heroes don’t have as many as the base game heroes when it comes to weapons. Heroes also can’t jump this is a flaw and really should have been added. Other than those features the game plays the same as the other to titles in the franchise. It has weekly invasions(challenges) which are fun and will expand the gameplay slightly.The Bad:      Having a sequel that doesn’t grow the franchise isn’t always bad if they improve what’s there. War Chest doesn’t, it plays like the other two but now heroes are harder to control. It’s annoying but not 100% bad when it comes to the hero’s controls although I would highly recommend a controller. The other two toy soldier’s games had a unique fun war theme with them. War Chest is fun but that war theme is no longer there really, so if you wanted that feeling you won’t find it here. There is a in game shop. This does have micro transactions, but you can unlock anything with coins you will earn in the game. You get the coins fairly and I feel they added just of those that are impatience with getting unlocks.The Good:     It plays as well as the other two games(excluding heroes) with fun level design that will give you a challenge. It’s a fun game and you’re looking for a good tower defense game with some third-person components you will find it here. The upgrading for turrents have been sighlty improved now you can upgrade different parts individually. (range,damage,armor)The Meh:     Uplay, it’s here, it isn’t as bad as I thought it would be. It took only about 5 minutes to set up and I have had no problem with it when in game. It does take a couple extra minutes for the game to start though. The menu is bare bones its only what you really need and not much else.Final thoughts:     Even with its flaws it’s a fun and good game in the series. I would recommend it to you on sale. If you like tower defense games and need something to scratch that itch this will do it for you.			"

												The majority of negative reviews have less then an hour of gameplay.granted i haven't played since it first came out, i binged this game, and had never played the previous titles.Pros-one of the best looking tower defense games-graphics and animations were great.-quick to learn but still challenging-child hood toylines were a great add-the little details are great-hours of fun-contray to other reviews the fps and load screens were fine, dependent on your hardware, i ran it on a dell insprion laptop with a nvidia GT650m and was getting a stable 58-62fps.Cons-this game was originally meant for console and the use of a controller, using mouse in keyboard is hard to get used to-the dlc pack launch, but that's a problem with many games now, in the old days you had to unlock characters, now you have to buy the dlc and often still unlock them in game.-at launch there were problems with the multiplayer which has also become common-not adding more to the game since release, this game could of used more (i hate the concept but lets be honest) dlc packs of classic toy lines.generally if you were a kid of the 80's/90's and remember some of these toy lines and remember your own house plays then this game will bring back happy memories.  If your a kid born post 90's era then you'll likely hate this game while not understanding what playing with a toy was like since you likely grew up in front a touch screen gadget.			"

												I was worried about buying this I won't lie, I got it on Humble Spring sale and saw also of the HOF ED error with the extra DLC chars so I bought the War chest and DLC sep so there was no issue. I found that you need to first DL this to steam with the Key then open Uplay and it will auto verify the credentials then launch it from Uplay while Steam is still active. Note: The 1st time load up could vary based on your system specs. I found myself stuck on the 1st bootup for approximately 15 mins and my rig isn't a slow one. After the first time bootup has finished it gives you the option to launch the tutorial and I reccomend to do so. It will take a long time to load that as well for the 1st time it took me approximately 10 mins. After all is said and done with the horrific 1st time boot up of the game it runs fine and now when you run it or start up it is standard load times. I avg 15-30 sec for my load times.This product is not broken and have to be patient with the 1st time you load it up on your system.			"

A uplay account is required to play the game. Please restart the game to login to Uplay"" and I did restart the game but this message keeps appearing.)2. Hall of Fame Edition is $1 more expensive than just buying the normal edition with the Legendary Heroes pack.3. ♥♥♥♥ing expensive DLC that just adds only some little army.4. I actually got it on PS4 with the Hall Of Fame Edition Code and the system doesn't even recognize the code saying ""This code does not exist"" such a scam....Ubisoft.5. Sensitivity so high, I couldn't aim properly to hit enemy units. And you couldn't change it.6. Unchangeable resolution, which made my game laggier.

Although my system meets recommended performance levels, with resolution and graphic settings set to conservative the frame rate is dismal. In addition, movement and aim with the mouse is fidgety and uncontrollable. I suspect that this is a poor port from a gaming console.

												I really liked the previous games on Xbox 360. I don't have an Xbox One, figured I'd get this on sale and watched it on wishlist for awhile.It's not ready yet, it may never be.  Pros: Great concept, it looks like it will be alot of fun, toys from my childhood, a few minor tweaks to the basic gameplay I already noticed, good sets, can't wait to play.Cons: I can't get through the very first mission without the game crashing.  4 times in a row, and with no saves I can see it'll be an exercise in futility.  BTW I'm using a gaming laptop and pretty much everything runs flawlessly, haven't had one Steam game crash constantly like this.  Disappointed, I'll put in for a refund and maybe next time it's on sale they will have patched it to playability.			"

												Love the concept of being able to play with action heroes from different franchises and gameplay is a blast.  Disappointed however by the clunky interface and display issues e.g. keyboard control hints are too small/blurry to read and the game forgets it has been set to fullscreen mode on each startup even though the mouse control behaves as if it is, making it difficult to toggle the options to fix it.Also not a fan of being forced out of the game to login into uplay or the microtransactions. Actually wouldn't have a problem with either even in a paid for game IF the user experience was up to scratch. Instead it just feels like I'm ripped off for a poor quality console port.			"

												I'm a huge fan of both prior Toy Soldiers games and having Hasbro licensed armies seemed like a dream come true.  It's breaking my tiny heart not recommending this.  I can get past the 30 FPS lock.  At the end of the day I'm not playing some super high end RPG.  I can even get past Uplay although it makes absolutely no sense I bought this from Steam only to have it added to my Uplay library.  What I can't get past is a poorly explained RMT model to unlock upgrades and just a general lack of optimization for the PC.  This is a port, which is fine, but even with a gamepad I found things buggy and difficult to utilize.  I realize the sheer effort it would take to improve this and the ROI probably isn't worth it, but I dream of the day I can play this again.			"

												Prelouge: This could be a great game, really really super great, but its not worth your money, here is why:1: This is really a stripped down console version, No local multiplayer! No splitscreen(!), no couchplay. (all console versions have this feature) 2: Lots of bugs! The game keeps changing resolution(!) - by it self mid game - and jump out of fullscreen about every 20 minutes.3: When you download the game from Steam, it forces youplay on you, DRM hell. (and they wonder why people download pirate games, well i wish i didnt buy this game, the developers deserves to go broke)4: Gamepad (and mouse) controles are AWFOUL, way to sensetive, with no way to adjust sensetivity.5: The game asks you to pay for way to mouch: 5,1. the game (stripped down ver.) 5,2. content starved expantion packs 5,3. real mony for ingame-coins to upgrade your equipment.

												COME ON!I just bought this game and all DLC on the Xbox one a couple days ago. GREAT GAME! WORKS PERFECT!I got it on here since it was in my wish list and 33% off. I can't get full screen to actually be FULL SCREEN and it doesn't let me chose a different resolution. Not to mention the game is glitchy. I want to love it like I do on the Xbox one but this is a big letdown! And now I have TWO games from steam I have to have Uplay for. REALLY STEAM?! Steam should force the developers to fix bad games immediately or not let them be in the store, PERIOD!  This is unacceptable! I will not ask for a refund because I'm a glutton for punishment and I want to wait to see if this gets better. I really hope it does.			"

												I played this game for all but 10 minutes due to lag. While an awesome idea, it suffers from horrid frame rate on my computer (despite dozens of more taxing programs running beautifully. It feels clunky, unfinished and childish, and that's saying alot for a game actually based around children's toys.The previous titles were wonderfull, fantastic value and replayability for their price. What caused this one to not work??Lack of diversity and turrets, uplay and ubisoft, as well as poor execution made this title in the series worthless.			"

												As a self proclaimed veteran of the series i was looking forward to the series and i will get straight to the point about the games pros and consPros-Still has the original core gameplay of tower defence and action which is still fun- Three interesting new factions to play as rather than just different iterations of the same style (Germans/British or Russians/Americans)-well designed enemies and maps-Multiplayer is very fun as it incorperates offensive attacking rather than just defensive-All factions have commandos that can be customised in terms of weapons and abilities.-Nice graphics but I expected that from a game published by Ubisoft.Cons-UPLAY-Lack of AI to play against in multiplayer which is a shame since no one is playing this bloody game-The bosses in this game are poorly designed and are often just much larger versions of an enemy with a reskin- I know I may be ranting here but The Kaiser boss is such a let down, the boss is less interesting than the first boss from the first game (Tsar Tank) seriously it is just a hunk of metal on treads with a throbbing erection for a cannon.- Map layouts are rather boring.- You only get 4 turrets rather than 5 plus barbed wire.-Day one DLC? really?-the DLC commandos cannot be customised in any way.- Some genius decided you should be able to upgrade your turrets individual stats (health,range and damage) but this makes the turrets just get some♥♥♥♥♥♥tacked on design wise, rather than in the first two games where the turrets would have completely different designs and playstyles which was much more fun and interesting.-Much less vehicles than the previous games.-You can play as Ezio if you buy the DLC, wait you mean that character from the long dead series that should have finished long ago but you still keep writing the same terrible story over and over again but you keep doing it so you can feed your kids but you are riddled with guilt knowing that you are milking your series and beating a dead horse? yes Ezio is boring to play as.-I can understand He-Man due to its cult following but why G.I Joe and Cobra Commander? most people did not grow up with these toys.-Short and boring campaign that becomes a slog to get through as near the end, the game gives you 20+ irritating and long waves rather than 10 challenging ones. I actually got so bored on some missions i would look at the wave counter, noticing I have spent 10 minutes and I am only on wave 5 out of 20 then say ""♥♥♥♥ it"" then quit the game.In closing I would like to say, Signal studios please find another publisher this game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to the previous entries; i also want you to go back to your roots play the previos games and think ""why is his better than war chest?"" then make a new game free of charge to those who bought War Chest .If I were new to this series I would give it a 7/10but as I have played the others i give it a 2/10			"

												First off, I hate micro transactions as much as anyone, That being said, IGNORE IT, you earn enough of the same coin needed to unolock the higher teirs of stuff with ease. Hell, I was averaging 1k worth or more per a mission in single player. Thus micro transactions is ONLY there for the impatient and need it all.Now about the game. Calling this a tower defense is really missleading. It's a tower defense that finds itself becoming a first/third person shooter. Once you get to mission three or after doing the survival for a while you'll realized you MUST go into a tower to control it. This is also a great way to earn more money needed to upgrade your stuff via combo kills and even head-shotting.Is it worth $15, sure. Is it worth buying the DLC, ONLY if you love genre He-Man, Cobra, G.I. Joe, Assassin's Creed. Those all cost about $5 each and have their own style of play to a degree			"

And can indeed skip the loading screens for the campaigns by just simply pressing the ENTER Key, so don't worry about the comment where somebody hated on the game for the fact that the game's loading took to long. It's a great game so buy it already!			"

												Toy Soldiers War Chest is made by Signal Studios and published by Ubisoft; this means it uses UPlay, so if you have some kind of aversion to UPlay, be advised. The game also features a 60FPS cap because the game's physics are calculated via the frame rate.TSWC comes with 4 armies to play as by default:- Kaiser (WWI German Empire)- Phantom (Sci-Fi Space Marines)- Starbright (Fantasy Girls' Toys)- Dark Lord (DnD-esque RPG themed set)In addition, there is day-one DLC that adds up to four more armies:- GIJoe (1980s)- Cobra (1980s)- He-Man (1980s)- Assassin's CreedSignal really dropped the ball by not including Skeletor as a faction and instead including Assassin's Creed. Although I am sure the inclusion of the well-known Ubisoft franchise was purely a contractual obligation and I understand it.The game also features shortcut-micro transactions. While these optional payments may save you an hour or two of game play earning the in-game coins used to unlock turret upgrades, I cannot say it's worth it.The game play is much more solid than Signal's previous game, Toy Soldier: Cold War. Cold War is bundled with the original Toy Soldiers game in a port made by Chrome Studios; Signal had nothing to do with porting Complete to PC, so keep that in mind.Why is the game play better than TS:C? Let's start with the biggest game changer: The turret upgrades.In previous Toy Soldiers games, the turrets had only a level-1-2-3 upgrading system. In TS:WC the turrets now have three trees to upgrade: Attack, Defense, and Range. This allows the upgrades to be diversified. There are several types of turrets as well. These are based on the GIJoe army, but the turrets have the same archetypes across all 8 armies:- Anti-Infantry- Anti-Vehicle- Anti-Air- ArtilleryThe game features two different building pads, large and small. AA and artillery turrets can only be built on large pads, while anti-troop and anti-vehicle turrets can be built on any platform.The game also features a 'hero character' system which can be a game changing aspect.For instance, in the GI Joe set, after filling the kill points bar up to a certain level, you unlock the ability to play as the GI Joe character Duke, complete with screw holes and action figure joints. Duke has a few weapons, like an automatic rifle, a rocket launcher, and grenades. However, filling the bar more without using Duke will allow you to use the Dragonfly attack helicopter, which has machine guns and missile launchers. Filling the bar all the way allows you to call in a Skystriker bombing run. All the armies have their own unique hero units; Cobra has Cobra Commander and He-Man has the titular hero, and such.However, these hero units rely on batteries to use. The character and mid-tier vehicle use battery power, and the bar depletes over time. You can fill the bar by picking up the batteries scattered across the level, but these batteries are finite, leading to you being mostly dependent on your gun turrets. This is a smart move from a design perspective as the hero units can pretty much face roll all enemies on the playing field.So the turrets; at first, all the upgrades are locked. The first few levels as you first begin will be slightly challenging without the needed coins to unlock the upgrades. However, you earn a very large sum of coins in each level which can unlock one or two upgrades per-successful level completion, which means unlocking all the upgrades is just a matter of maybe an hour or two.The game measures your progress in 3 area, on a scale of bronze, silver, gold, platinum:- Aggression- Profits- Toybox healthAggression is how long you wait between waves. In order to obtain the platinum medal for aggression, you must skip the wave wait times on every wave almost instantly. Profits are how much resources/money you have leftover at the end of the level. This is also easy to get if you are frugal and don't mindlessly upgrade turrets. You can also earn more credits back by selling anti-air turrets after the final aircraft waves have finished.Toy box health is how much of the health of your base, or 'toy box' has left. In order to make platinum, the toy box MUST end the game with 100% health. In several levels, there are multiple toy boxes, which means you must cover all angles of attack.The main game's campaign does not feature the DLC armies; however, at certain points after playing through the campaign, you will unlock 'survival' levels that are based on the DLC armies. These survival levels are never-ending waves of enemies with increasing numbers. Even with a perfect defence, the turrets will take damage over time and will require repairs or they will be destroyed. It's a war of attrition, and it goes on as long as you are willing to put up a fight.- GI Joe Survival- Cobra Survival- He-Man Survival- Assassin's Creed SurvivalThe game has a randomly chosen 'Weekly War' campaign that changes each week. The war includes several levels where you fight one random army in the game and by beating the campaign you unlock coins and upgrade boxes for the turrets.The game has multiplayer listed on the store, but I haven't tried it, and as such I cannot pass judgement on the multiplayer aspect.Overall, if you like 1980s GI Joe or He-Man, and you want to have an afternoon of fun rolling in nostalgia, I'd give it a try. The upside of UPlay is that if you unlock the UPlay achievements, you earn UPlay credits which can unlock cosmetic skins for the default four armies, as well as the soundtrack and backgrounds.If you have any concerns or questions about the game you want to know before buying it, leave a comment and I will answer it and append your answer to my review.

												Im a big fan of toy soldiers(I played the first two back on Xbox 360) and a even bigger fan of GI Joe, so even though it was twice the cost of the base game, I bought the hall of fame edition.The base game ran...poorly, Im fairly untrained in the art of being bothered by 30fps, but even I could tell the game looked and felt ""off"" in the performance department. Otherwise it seemed fun, after a hour of gameplay however, I began to wonder when the dlc content unlocks so I could play as cobra commander?It doesnt. The DLC for 90% of people flat out does not work, the system in place in the game for it to check with Uplay and confirm you are online and own it, is completely broken, so the content you paid for, cannot be used. I spent a hour troubleshooting this, and what is Ubisoft supports statement on this?""Contact steam and try to get a refund""They are so unwilling to fix their broken content, that they would rather lose a sale, than deal with it. So thats what they did, lost a sale.			"

												Cons:THIS IS CLEARLY A PORT and not a GREAT port either. The controls are kind of effed up in a lot of ways but for the most part they are fairly minor. The game is still 100% playable and only causes minor frustration and makes aiming a little harder on some units.Micro transactions are in the game but you do not NEED them by any means. The amount of coins you get from doing content more than pay for the things you want to buy, getting coins from the store is IMO a total waste. I still put this as a con though since it makes handing this to your kid/younger-anything not perfect since you might need to make sure they don't drop $200 on your card buying dumb stuff.Pros:Really fun game, built a lot like the past iterations but with a lot more options and gameplay.

												It's a really fun game. There are some bugs and things to iron out, but I don't regret my purchase one bit.A lot of lemmings are throwing around a bunch of entitled gamer cliches to disparage the game, but let's look at the complaints: 30fps lock.So what? This isn't CS or some other twitch shooter. The game looks good and plays smoothly. Day 1 DLC.Look, I think there is something wrong with forcing people to pay for a map or weapon pack Day 1. That stuff should be packaged in with the base game. But that's not really what's going on here. They released a very cheap game ($15) and are simply asking you to pay a little extra money if you want to play licensed IPs such as GI-JOE and He-Man. Being able to play with classic IPs is one of the main attractions of the game, and you can't do that without paying for the IPs. That costs money, which has to come from somewhere. Either play the base game with in-house IPs or pony up and pay an extra $15–not an exorbitant price at all–to play with licensed IPs. Seems fair.  Microtransactions.I haven't found anything in the game that can't be purchased with tokens that you gain by simply playing the game. The game isn't P2W; it just gives you an option to save time by purchasing rather than farming tokens. You're not forced into microtransactions, and microtransactions allow the game to be released at a lower price point. It's a win-win: People can pay money to accelerate token accrual and people who don't purchase tokens benefit from a cheaper game.TL;DR: The game is fun, and people are getting their panties in a bunch for no reason.

												Let me clarify why you did not recommend the game. It does not allow you to play as a common tower defense, you are obliged to put specific type of towers in specific places in which not some of them are released. The part you were most anxious to have available might be the hardest to get you to play with your favorite character that needs to fill up an action bar in which gradually it is consuming, alias all the special troops in the game are deteriorated by time and If you leave the exact 15 seconds to build a tower you also lose your troop.

												I am one of the few people in the world who has not heard or ever played any of the Toy Soldiers games ever. This is my first. Personally I very much enjoy this game, especially when on the attack. But there are some cons as well as pros, so here comes a list.Pros: Good gameWorks for me (sorry other people)Has weekly challengesruns decent, not 10/10, maybe 8/10The bad key bindings can be remappedCons: Has a lottery systemHas a very odd resolution, about 1200:76830fps (which I dont mind, but for some this is a big problem)Used to be in full screen, stopped for whatever reason.So in short, graphics seem a little weird, but gameplay is good. I hope they fix the graphics eventually, but as long as core gameplay is fun, I can recommend it.			"

												Say what you like and don't like, this game was worth my HYPE.I admit it, I'm a fan of Assassin's Creed. Didn't care about this cameo at first but I took a closer look. I was drawn in by the colorful army of Starbright looking at the trailer for the first six armies. Took a look at the other trailer and I was hooked. I was looking forward to getting this on release day! Too bad I had to wait a few days (and suffer bloodwork) to get it here on Steam. Eventually it was for sale on U-play (I understand, Ubisoft, you gotta fix up the platform compatibilities).You should've seen me. I was NUTS!""ALL ABOARD THE TOY EZIO HYPE TRAIN""""#EZIOHYPE""So yeah, this game has earned my official Essention Seal of Approval. Can't wait to fix those crashes.			"

												First off, I don't understand the hate. Sure, there are a few things that can be worked on, but so far I have only had fun.I have absolutely no problems with the FPS, and I have a stock Lenovo Ideapad Z710, no uprgrades or anything special about it. I had one slow down to like 5 FPS, but the game runs smoothly for me.It's also just a lot of fun. Sure, day one DLC is total BS, but the game is still fun and the in-game currency is not hard to earn. You can get like... 5000 just from doing the first four missions, and you can get anything you want with 2000 coins, so I don't understand anyone's complaints about it being ""unplayable."" I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing this game, and I haven't played the others so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think this is very fun. The only issues I've actually had are the UPlay launcher, which is just annoying, the UI is incredibly small and I at least haven't figured out how to increase the size, but It's kinda guess/check for which buttons to press to control movement of a character/turret, at least for me. The only other problem I've actually had is that flying is absolutely awful, and the mouse seems too sensitive on any setting above .25.What's good about it are pretty much everything else. It's easy to learn, and mostly intuitive. The multiplayer is actually very fun, if you can find someone else playing the game. What else are you even looking for in a tower defense game? In any case, I would definitely reccomend the game. The hate is unnecessary and it's a very fun game.			"

												Alright first off let me address some main issues people are having than i'll tell you why you should buy this game.Edit: They have recently removed the 30fps framerate cap and have fixed a few bugs sooner than I thought so god job signal studios. MICROTRANSACTIONS: They are a non issue, they are done incredibly well and are only there for people you don't want to play through the campaign. You generally get all of the upgrades by the end of the campaign by either unlocking them by leveling up however, it is randomised meaning you can get 2 of a kind but this problem is solved with silver which is the stuff you get after EVERY MISSION, atleast a 1000 each time i'd say which is more than enough, along with stored silver, to buy the cheap upgrades. Maybe if your just in it for the multiplayer and not the progression than the microtransactions would be used but they really are a non issue.Now to my list of pros,cons,and mehs Pros Good Gameplay with good animationsVery good multiplayerGood SurvivalUpgrading system that allows you to invest more in turrets than beforeUnique hero characters with strengths and weaknesses 4 armies(8 with the dlc) that are all unique and all have different strengthsGreat graphicsLots of variety in the main armies(not dlc ones) Meh Uplay which has gotten better with age but it still isn't easy to swallowMicrotransactions in game Cons LONG LOADING TIMES especially for multiplayer DLC with DAY 1 DLC and future dlc's coming up which I found (including many other people) in the files, stuff like power rangers,war of the worlds,and the armies from the previous games.Framrate drops usually just as a wave is launching which can be annoying for the few seconds they lastLack of Variety in the dlc armies mainly with the heroes. Poor pc controls/UIno options for in-gamechat like volume and stuffLack of care, it is obvious the pc version was just an after thought and that way less care, in the future, will be into this version rather than the consoles which is a shame. In Conclusion I reccommend this game to evryone who is a fan of tower defense games and has a few friends who they can play with, hopefully the game will be better in the future but right now it is money well spent.

												This game is definitely worth the $15 You start with four different heroes you pick one and along comes their army (per map) Each plays unique and completely different from the other. You earn coins per game that allow you to purchase upgrades. The upgrades are also randomly unlocked after each win. You can purchase coins but do not need to. There is four additional armies costing $15.00 which are toys you know and love (He-Man etc) It's kind of upsetting they charge for this but quite frankly this is well worth it, There is way more than $29.99 worth of content here. Also there is online multiplayer versus and co-op my only issue is there isnt enough playing to get a game going but I'm sure that will change in the near future. With that being said it's worth the purchase add me GGandC on Steam or DummpyMonkey on Uplay so we can play together			"

												So far the only problem with this game that i have had, is UPLAY. Bleh. Fun game, filled with nostalgia and strategy elements that i richly enjoy. Just wish there were more factions. And as for the microtransactions, you actually dont need to use them, the grind isnt as bad as games like World of Tanks or War Thunder. After 2 hours of play, i have unlocked nearly all that is to unlock in the He-Man faction. And those 2 hours of gameplay includes the tutorial where you play Wilhelm for a while. The 4-5 things i lack i can easily buy with silver tokens i have earned in-game. But i prefer to save them for now. But if many are having huge game breaking glitches, then give the game a few weeks. But if such things gets fixed, give it a try. It is an entertaining game.			"

												I was a big fan of the previous titles in the series, even though I have been anxiously awaiting numerous updates for the complete edition, but now with seeing this title I guess I can understand why it's taken them so long. The game is tower defense with heavy empahsis on action and actually controlling the towers to mow down the incoming hordes. You build in limited places, upgrade and control the towers at your pleasure.  So how does this compare to the previous Toy Soldiers...1. Obvious one here. Instead of just 'realistic' toy soldiers you do battle with different toy sets. One of the charms of the first game for me was the existential battle of fighting another army in a child like, mass destruction/killing for fun sort of way. With the fantasy elements obviously that dynamic is a little different. 2. Unlike the first game where you progress through stages to unlock upgrades for the overall towers, here you unlock different indivdual tower elements (range,power, etc) for the towerswith coins or random drops at the end of the level. This means a lot of grinding which was present in the previous games as well. But now with 7 or whatever sets of characters, that's a lot of playing maps over and over. And again although they are asthetically very different, as of now I don't see much variation in the actual functionality of the towers. 3. Every time you level up your different toy sets, you recieve these things that look like pogs. They are the individual upgrades for the turrets. You can also purchase boxes of the random upgrades as well. 3. There is a new weekly challenge mode. That's cool and helps with the grinding aspect. 4. Day one DLC. Yeah pretty lame. Be aware that even though the DLC packs are for Heman,♥♥♥♥♥Creed and whatever...Those character sets are available to play in the vanilla game. Purchasing the DLC packs just offers additonal toys as part of that set. For example with Masters of the Universe one of the things you get is that bad♥♥♥♥♥tiger thing for He Man to ride. So far I am enjoying it. I will update the review later once I have put in some more hours and (hopefully) get to play some online co-op.			"

												Update: Haven't crashed yet, I'm sorry if you're having those issues.More of the same. If you liked the slight humor and fun of the original Toy Soldiers and Cold War then this will be right up your alley. You defend your toybox using the hero and Army of your choice which can be customized as you unlock more and more stuff from the campaign by murdering the 'evil' everyone else forces. There is actually a crap ton of unlockable stuff like gas shells, barrage balloons and freaking Unicorns that fire laser beams out of their heads. Unfortunately, there are a couple of port issues that should've been fixed by the devs such as 30 FPS lock (caaaam on), button layouts for Xbox Controls and text resolutions so small that some keyboard controls are impossible to read. I also notice that sometimes the controls can be awkward and flying is ungodly sensitive... thankfully you can adjust that in the menu. Also, 20-25 bucks of DLC on release day? Caaaaam on! All in all, I suggest the base game, it's fun and it's more Toy Soldiers. Hopefully, they will iron out the port issues soon.Gameplay Footage:

The co op is oodles of fun and the themed armies are more than just silly reskins: the units actually perform somewhat differently, and the licensed soldier groups relaly brings it home.  Just a shame you can't mix and match from playsets for your army!Also: if nobody told me I would not have even noticed a 30FPS lock.  it's smooth and does not stutter, so quit whining you whiney babies.

												I was never into RTS games but, watching the trailer and gameplay for this game made me want to get it and I do not regret it.  I've been playing this game all day and have been enjoying every second of it and having the ability to control your units, artillery and leader make the game all the more enjoyable.  While I currently don't have any friends who own this game, I could see this game being a whole lot of fun to play with 3 other friends online.  My only two gripes about this game are the 30FPS lock which I hope is patched soon and the 4 other armies being DLC from the start.  I did buy the Hall of Fame Edition as $15 more to me personally wasn't a big deal but, they should have included the 4 other armies in the game from the start.  If you are an RTS fan or if you are looking to try out an RTS game, I would recommend getting Toy Soldiers: War Chest!			"

												It's playable and i have not experienced any crashes or issues with the game. HOWEVER, IT IS LOCKED AT 30 FPS! I would like to see this patched to go over 60. The other problem is the microtransactions BUT the coins are pretty easy to learn at least from my experience so the microtransactions are pointless.Mutilplayer is a step up from Cold War (played that ALOT on XBLA) with attacking and defending rounds swapping around, making things more interesting.Of course there are problems including reports of crashes and buggy gameplay, stiff performances on high end computers, etc.*UPDATE* Im digging through the files and found some interesting names like Power Rangers, War of the Worlds, Ghost Company and some armies from the past two games. I dont know what they are, they could be related to the Campaign mode but i thoguht it was interesting.*Update 2* Glad to see the Developers of the game are acutally trying to fix most of the known bugs and issues with the game. Give Props to Signal Studios for this! By the Way i Might ReWrite this review.Please comment if you have any questions. Trolling and abusive comments will be deleted.			"

												It's Toy Soldiers again, so you probably already know if that is a good or bad thing for you as a person.On the downside, of the 8 armies, 4 of them are at best forgettable (and 3 of the better factions are DLC) and at worst, sort of garbage. The game is also a bit on the homely side, and performance seems a touch* unoptimized. To the games defense, most of the toys' real life counterparts were also sort of ugly and cheaply made, so +1 for historical accuracy.*""touch"" meaning in this case, ""really not at all""			"

												Amazing! If you’re a fan of the Toy Soldiers series such as me you will love this. The heroes are great, highly recommend COBRA Commander, and now you can customize the load out of each one. Also co-op is a great feature in the game since you can do every game mode co-op which you could not do in the last two.The integration of brands is fantastic as well; I’m really looking forward to see what brands they get next. (Hopefully transformers)The only negative thing is UPLAY, which everyone knows sucks.And finally who doesn’t want to see GI.JOE and COBRA fight it out in the toy box?? "

												I'll admit I have next to no time in the game yet, but it runs smooth as butter and so far seems like all the fun things from previous games I enjoy are present here and in my opinion better. Cry about Uplay but whatever, get over it. It's not going away because you wish it would.30FPS will eventually most likely get fixed in the future.I'm fine with a $30 price tag for a game I really enjoy playing and will probably sink WAY over 30 hours into.EDIT: Holy cow, after logging more hours into this puppy I've gotta say, still the Toy Soldiers I loved.Cleared up by a dev you have to buy the other armies which is a little bit of a bummer but still, $15 for a great game and more content if you feel like paying for it. I stand by my $30 isn't much to ask for the play time I'll get out of this.The Microtransaction side of things is not bad either, you earn tokens to upgrade stuff at a nice rate and I've maxed two armies almost by the time I wrote this.TLDR;Stop crying and have fun already..

												If you enjoyed the older games then you will like this, the maps are cool and all of the different toys you can play as are awesome, y only gripe with the game is it takes a little while to load and the in game voice chat has no easy way to turn it off, or at least i havent found it. uplay kinda ruins the game but over all i think it is worth it's price.

												Never played toy soliders before but this game is great. Very addicting. Graphics don't define a game people. Stop complaining about 30fps lock. The game hasn't crashed once for me and is very playable.			"

												Overall amusing, but I agree with another reviewer: why couldn't they get the original He-Man theme?			"

												More of the same good TD fun from Signal Studios. I'm not some PC elitist who can't deal with a 30fps lock, I mean get real. Not a deal breaker and runs fine as it is. Uplay is fine also, just like Origin. Sucks you gotta run it while playing, but it's not that big of a deal either. Plus, Uplay works great nowadays. Heresey!			"

												The game looks fun and its a really Cool idea but my game has a LOT of problems like my controlls get locked and cant do anything els unless i exit the game compleetly and the Tutorial need to let you know how to use sertain things because it was telling me to do things with out giving me any explanations on what key to hit to do such action  so over all  the game is good concept is great! and thoes were the only two things i found wrong with the game but im going to let it slide since the game just came out todayand i am recommending this game because i really want to see it fixed			"

												A TD game where you take control of hero units or the towers you build.A game throwback to several playable franchises like he-man and gi.joe.Simple you build towers, upgrade towers take contro lof towers and destroy the enemy.It is quite shortlived as a game and only worth i would say on a sale and as a casual game. Once you figure out which army you like and what and how their towers work can easily take down any wave of enemies. I kept choosing and having a certain play style with Cobra and found that was getting quite easy with my stragety so after playing it few times after beating the game i lost interest, BUT i still had fun with it and if I used it as a casual game rather than pump few hours into it straight away it may have been more long lived.

												The game is fun, with a lot of amazing characters. Playing with He-man is so cool. This game has a taste of childhood and it is amazing. It is challenging too. The problem with the DLC has been fixed.  So i can now very recommend this amazing game. Try to pick the hall of fame edition in a sale though .			"

												 A twist on the classic tower defense game. Ideal is solid, but the executon of it is lacking at times, especially in some major points within the game as most of the levels are repeats of levels you already have completed or the odd slow down on a high end machine. But, overall its good time killer and especially a one to be looked at especially if you grew up playing with some of the additional armies, like Cobra, G.I. Joe, and He-Man.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR PCif you have a gamepad (but not the steam controller) you will be able to play this game ok. The user interface, menus, and controls are HORRIBLY ported from console. The frame rate is slow and choppy. Everything is either jumpy or completely out of whack. I was a huge fan of toy soldiers and TS cold war, but the gameplay in this one is a step down from those. Go play cold war instead.I refunded this game within an hour of play.			"

												Game is great, classic characters that are fun to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up with.Fixes have been applied that corrected the color mode issues and constantly getting kicked to desktop. Only thing missing is Borderless window mode but It doesnt stop you from enjoying this title.			"
