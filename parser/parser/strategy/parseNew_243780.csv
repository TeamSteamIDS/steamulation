												One of the first and best tower defense titles I've ever seen and played. Thank God it was finally ported to PC because this is one game you all should own.[Rating: 87/100]			"

												I love this game so much am high on it. Am not that crazy about steam games but this one is just awesome! Where do I even start, it is cute, fun, easy mechanics but a challenge after a few levels. I love how it is always a new experience and how easily you lose yourself in the game after playing it for 5mins. You have to move, think, build, upgrade, destroy and collect coins fast. So if you want a fun co-op game or single player this is one of the most entertaining games on steam. "

												PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate is a tower defense game that requires constant attention from the player. You play as a Tiki guy defending a hut from waves of monsters. On the surface, it seems like a cheerful casual game... but looks can be deceiving. There are almost never any lulls in the action, so you always have to be on the move, planning ahead. Resources (used to build towers) come in the form of coins dropped from enemies. However, you actually have to run around and collect the coins yourself before they disappear. Similarly, in order to build towers, you actually have to walk to where you want them first. Towers can also be upgraded by standing on them, a process that takes time. Enemies also sometimes drop crystals, which can be spent to quickly upgrade towers, or saved up to purchase other types of towers. So gameplay boils down to a test of multitasking skills - you have to balance anticipating what towers need to be built (and where), while simultaneously collecting dropped resources and upgrading. It gets pretty intense.Most levels can be completed easily enough in 1 or 2 tries, but the challenge comes in trying to do so perfectly (not letting even 1 enemy get to your hut). Perfect-scoring levels unlocks more levels to play, and so on. And that's where the challenge (and unfortunately, frustration) comes in. The main down-side to this game is that it can sometimes be very unfair. While there is an indicator that shows what types of enemies are coming up, it's not always clear enough (for example, a blinking red icon sometimes means ""weak to cannons"", and other times ""on fire and 3 times as fast""). Also, sometimes enemies take completely different paths with no warning. These types of things are frankly just bad game design and complete BS. The best TD games allow you to deduce the path enemies will take and plan ahead accordingly. This game doesn't always do that, which leads to having to sometimes rely on memorization rather than actual skill. Thankfully, it doesn't happen a lot, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating when it does. That said, this is a small complaint when compared to how good the rest of the game is, but it is a noteworthy enough issue that it needed to be mentioned.The main game consists of 47 levels, with an additional 24 challenge levels that can be unlocked. The challenges are levels that have to be cleared while also fulfilling some sort of special criteria (completing challenges unlocks concept art, videos, music and more). The game also has a 2-player co-op mode, which I haven't tried (but it seems like it would be really fun). All in all, between the main levels, challenges, and co-op, the amount of content available is pretty substantial. I've sunk around 60 hours in already (though technically, most of that was spent replaying levels over and over again trying to get perfect clears), but still, the fact that I put that much time into it speaks to how good the core gameplay is. Despite my rant above on the few down-sides that sometimes make it frustrating, overall, the game is solid, and lots of fun to play. If you like tower defense, this is a great one. The price seems a bit high, especially when the original version on PS3 was cheaper, but there is also more content in this version compared to the original release, plus the added multiplayer component... so I suppose it is probably justified. If you are into TD games, definitely pick it up in a sale at some point, if not at full price.			"

												This is a tower defense game that has each map consisting of one screen. The basic plot is that you are an island native that has to defend your babies from monsters that will eat them. In each level / stage you have 20 babies, meaning no more than 20 enemies can get to your home base. how do you stop them? You have the ability to turn trees into towers. Arrow towers are quick and shoot far. Cannon towers do damage to a lot of enemies, but they are slow and short ranged. Anti-aircraft towers will take out flying enemies pretty quickly from a distance.Enemies drop money and jewels / crystals. You can use the jewels to research three more towers, such as the tesla coil that will zap several enemies at once in a shot range. The laser tower that will shoot several flying enemies at once and finally some sort of giant cannon tower that will destroy a big radius, but it is super slow. With the crystals you can also use them to upgrade your towers, but you don't really micro manage upgrades like I'd prefer. Each tower can only be upgraded a certain way, like arrow towers can only have their firing radius improved. Cannon towers can only have their power improved. You can also upgrade each tower by standing next to it and you will see a bar go to 100% when its done with the next level upgrade. It is a nice feature and fills any sort of idle time with work.Waves of single enemy types arrive, mostly spiders, natives and flying pods. There are different varieties like giant natives, fat bee like creatures, and stronger glowing enemy alterations. You see how much time you have before the next wave along with what enemy type is coming next, so you can sell your towers for coins to buy more towers. This is a must in some levels.You can't really block the enemies. If you get hit, all of your coins will go flying ala Sonic from the 90s. Coins fly in the water and disappear in time. It will really keep you on your toes. The controls are nice and extremely basic. I think you only need to use one button and the thumbstick or mouse. Super simple and easy to use. If you want to research, just return to home base. If you want to build a tower, click a tree. That's really all there is. Oh and at the end of each level is a giant boss, but they seem less threatening than 100 spiders.The levels are long and meaty. Each level will take a while to complete and there is always a chance of failure. Your 20 babies get eaten and you have to restart the level. The world map is broken up into several different levels and there are different islands to explore. The levels are clumped together and to progress, you need to have a certain amount of rainbows to leave the level cluster. To get rainbows, you need to complete a level without losing babies. Its more difficult than it sounds on regular difficulty.Its a really nice game that you can sink a lot of time into, but if you're not into tower defense, this game won't make you want to play tower defenses. I've always liked PixelJunk games and they make this one stand out in a sea of tower defense and micro transactions.			"

												This is without doubt the best Tower Defense Game ever!I've played this game ever since it came out at PS3 PSN and i have waited so long for this Ultimate Edition.Now that it's out the madness has begun!The most fun is playing local COOP, but now with steam you are also to play COOP over the internet, also playing as two dancing dudes makes the game a lot easier.You have 4 islands where you can do the stages to get further, the game gets proressively harder and harder until you wish just death among those little suckers who want to kill your babies!If you're looking for a real TD game, which is addicting and also fun, then get this f*cking game and live happily ever after.Dance for peace and release the BEEEEEEEEEEEEEES! (yea there are towers who release beeeeeeeees) "

												I recommend this game, and here is why.PixelJunk™ (don't forget the ™, it's important)  Monsters is a Tower Defense game, with unique twists of its own.  Having to base off the fact that you can only build towers depending on the layout of the course makes for varying plans to prepare for the next wave. Purchasing new special towers each mission that do not forward to the next creates choices that as a player, or two, will have to make in order to protect the Tiki-men from waves of monsters with various attributes. Not just monsters who can fly, but even monsters that are resistant to fire damage or monsters that move faster but are even more vulnerable to slows when hit.The learning curve is well received by new and experienced players. Trial and error is less punishing until playing on the later and harder stages. WIth the addition of new towers and an island in the Ultimate mini-expansion, players who had the console version will find only a few reasons to go back to the game sadly. It's also multiplayer enabled, I had a satisfying time playing with my friend online, Speaking of which, there is nobody playing this online. It is justifiable, a game like this should not be enjoyed with just the public, having a friend to think through every single mission makes the game not feel repetitive some of the time. Another plus is the RNG area which generate random stages based on algorithm outside the quests by inputting a 5 digit code. (like minecraft's seed)Overall, I recommend this game but only to players who are looking forward to a Tower Defense game that plays different.To those that had played before, please put a second thought to this. This game came out a little less than 7 years ago, but the art style is truly of this date. Mechanics are still familiar, and with new towers it might bring you back to try new techniques to overcome the same or new missions. It may just be Monsters, but it is still the one you know and love.Also, 1080p!! (Like that matters)			"

												PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate is a fun game in the tower defense genre, but if you’re new to the genre I’d recommend sticking with Casual difficulty for a while as you’d likely get overrun on Regular difficulty. Still, if you’re looking for a fun tower defense game, this is one worth picking up.			"

												PixelJunk Monsters is the best tower defense game of all time. I put a very large amount of time into the PS3 version.This game is incredibly challenging. Controlling a unit on the field which can upgrade and build towers adds to the immersion. The visual style and music are very vivid and peaceful.There is a very nice degree of balance between all the enemy units and your various towers and their upgrades. Each level has a different path to victory, and comes with fresh visuals.			"

												Easily the worst tower defense game I have ever played:1) No game speed control. You get to watch as the enemy sluggishly meanders their way through your towers. 2) The above would not be so bad if the only way to progress in the game wasn't tied to earning perfect scores (no mobs get through). One mob slips through on the last of 20 waves? Have fun watching the crawl again. 3) No indication whatsoever of where enemies are going to come from or path through. Sometimes enemies will beeline for your base, only to suddenly take a U-Turn seconds away from taking a villager. Other times, enemies will decide to take a path that no other mob has taken on wave 17/20, leaving you scrambling to cover that path. This normally results in a restart of the level.4) Little to no time to prepare for the next wave. See that enemies that are resistant to most of your towers coming? You'll have about 3 seconds to prepare for this, and since towers take about 10 seconds to build, this normally results in having to restart the level.5) You control a little tiki man top-down MOBA style, and you must walk around placing towers and upgrading them through this avatar. For some bizarre reason, they decided to add latency to his movement, so that when you change direction, your tiki skids along before changing directions. This is especially troublesome in the more crowded stages as you need to be able to weave in and out of waves to upgrade towers and pick up gold. 6) The above wouldn't be so bad if touching a mob didn't stun you, and make you drop a huge chunk of your gold. Additionally, some enemies have hitboxes that extend past their model, making this even more frustrating. The common theme of this game is memorizing exactly what is going to be coming at what wave, and in what direction, which means mindlessly repeating waves until your towers are pre-placed to deal with that nasty wave that's going to be coming 5 waves from now.Don't even get it on sale.

												Absolutely cute tower defense game for 2D. Or so I find it cute and relaxing. Even on casual it is more challenging than some TDs out there, which I like. It's bound to give you and co players (same PC or CO-OP online) hours of fun, without being too hard. You are bound to the lay-out of the map so you can't just place those towers anywhere. You got to think strategy here! (otherwise it wouldn't be a good TD would it?)			"

												I'm not a big fan of the tower defense genre, but PixelJunk Monsters has a unique appeal that kept me coming back for more.The system of unlocking, building, and upgrading towers is simple, but not so much that it becomes boring. All necessary information is clearly conveyed to the player, which is very helpful. In addition to currencies and remaining villagers, you can see upgrade statuses of all towers, and their ranges. You can even see which type of enemy is attacking next, and how long you have until they do.Unlike many tower defense games, enemies never attack your towers, they only go after your villagers. This makes the game less stressful than other tower defense games.Towers get experience from kills and from you dancing under them. This experience will upgrade them over time, or you can pay gems to skip to the next upgrade level. Each tower starts at green, and upgrades to yellow, red, purple, and finally black.The campaign is fairly long; it took me around 20 hours to complete all levels on the three main islands. Replayability is decent, with challenges, Steam achievements, higher difficulties, co-op mode, and a fourth island that includes randomly generated maps.The downsides are the occasional difficulty spikes and the clunky tower selection spinner. The game also doesn't do a good job of explaining how towers are upgraded, which is why I explained it here.Don't let the cute characters and pleasant music deceive you, this game can be tough.			"

Not to mention that the game is full of great music and original characters. The game can be difficult at times, but that's what makes it so engages!			"

												This game is the only reason I ever owned a PSP.In a world with countless tower defense games flooding the mobile market this one..Will ALWAYS stand out.  Be it on PSP, emulated on an android (or now streamed via steam!)Simply flawless in it's mechanics and replayability.  It's really the only tower defence good enough for me.And I can't even exactly pin-point what makes it so beautiful..The music might make you go happy crazy after a while, that could be part of it.(That's a good thing, it's so weird... Off-beat, out of time but not..   Puts you in a trance.)But you can totally turn that off if you wish. : PThis new Ultimate edition actually brought a whole lot more to the plate.Co-op, multiplayer.  Way higher resolution game assets, improved effects.The ability to now stream this higher quality version via Limelight to any android, with a nvidia game stream enabled pc..  (So good..  So good....)They do need to rework the controls slightly but it doesn't interfere with the gameplay.Just, they felt slightly more responsive on PSP, and PSP gave you the ability to run faster..Which I've yet to figure out in this version but perhaps they are working on that still.Basically, buy the game for 10 bucks and be super happy you did.You will get addicted.       Or wait for a sale for a buck like when I was lucky enough to catch it.And then get really confused inside when you feel like they actually deserve ten bucks.Pixel Junk Monsters FTW 4 Lyfe.			"

												My experience with the game:For me this is one of the best tower defense games ever made.I used to play it on PS3 (Encore version) and often co-op with friends and family.Got it on sale for Steam for a price of 1.19€ which is a steal.About the game:Trial and error tower defense game where you need to think ahead, and strategically plan your defense.The game appeals to casual players and hardcore tower defense fans alike.The good:- Fluid relaxing gameplay, nice graphics, zen music, awesome towers, playable character.- Most of the levels has it's own gameplay feel to it.- Buy, place, upgrade and sell towers in order to match incoming attacks.- Can be hard and a bit frustrating, but at a level where you just want to do better the next playthrough.- In co-op you can actually plan and work together. It's fun.- Good replay value.The bad:- It doesn't have a map/level editor or Steam workshop.Verdict:If you like tower defense games, even just strategy games, I can only recommend it.It is worth it's original price. 9,5/10.

Its a pretty simple game but the added player influence with upgrading towers, placing bombs and etc. makes it a much more enjoyable experience.When I played through the game I did friend and we had a blast throughout the whole thing, playing it multiple times on different difficulties and it didn't get boring, the game makes it pretty easy to say ""just one more level"".The ultimate edition of this game is packed full of content with 2 full islands, challenges and a randomiser island.I highly reccomend this game and it's truely a shame it isn't more popular.

												I enjoy me some tower defense, but this one isn't so great for me. It's hard for me to tell how much of a path a tower will cover. Tower upgrades aren't that interesting. There are only five tower types, two of which are anti-air. Creep pathing is oddly unpredictable, but not in a smart way.I do kinda like the mechanic where you can dance at a tower to help it level up, as it makes you balance your time between that and tower construction and loot collection. I am not, though, enjoying having to jog back and forth across the map to pick up the loot before it expires.			"

												 Ok so I've spent a little time playing this game, and so far, it's pretty good.  You have no idea what kind of game this is from the title though, right?  I mean, you know it's a PixelJunk game, you know it's got monsters, and it's apparently the ulitmate for some reason.  So what is it?  It's another Tower Defense game!  So what makes this game different from any of the other thousand tower defense clone games out there?  Well for one thing, you've got a physical avatar/character to move around the map placing towers.  That's interesting I guess.  You're limited in what you can do by how fast your character moves.  That can be really challenging (and really annoying).Another feature is that the path is pretty much already laid out for you.  All you have to do is build towers out of the trees in the background on the maps.  If you were hoping for a more free-form tower defense game, that would be disappointing, but considering there's often just one optimal path anyway, I don't really mind.  You're really limited enough by the fact your character doesn't move that fast.  No need to make it even harder by allowing the monsters to rush straight for the base.Most tower defense games I've seen allow you to pay to upgrade your towers, but this game gives you three ways of upgrading.  1) Experience through kills 2) Paying ""gems"" to upgrade and 3) Your character does a little dance that gradually adds to the experience bar of the tower, eventually upgrading it.So these gems I've mentioned... when you kill a monster, it drops some coins (usually) and a green gem (rarely).  You use the coins to buy new towers and you use the gems to either upgrade your existing towers OR apply those gems to unlocking a NEW tower for the level.  Sometimes the new tower is more valuable than having upgraded towers and sometimes an upgraded tower means you actually survive the level.Oh and one other thing I forgot to mention: You have to pick the coins and gems up, however you're powerless against the monsters so you can't touch them at all or you get stunned and you drop some money that you have to pick back up (think sonic the hedgehog's rings).  I don't think it's possible for your main character to die but I haven't tried really hard.The graphics are what I would call ""quaint"".  Nothing super fancy but it seems to fit in with PixelJunk's style pretty well.  The music is OK, but kinda forgettable.  Nothing stuck in my head after I closed the game, so that's neither good nor bad.  The sound effects are passable too but again, nothing memorable about them.  You get some cannon boom sounds, crossbow ""thwack"" sounds, etc.   The sounds your character makes while upgrading a tower sounds like a native dance, but that totally fits because your character looks like a stereotypical  witch doctor. You can use a controller with the game, and in fact, that's all I've ever used.   I don't know if mouse/keyboard would be better since you're moving a character around on screen to do all the building and upgrading.  I haven't had any troubles using the controller so if you want to just kick back while you play then this game is good for that. Basically I'd say this game is just casual enough for someone to enjoy while still maintaining a level of challenge for people who get bored easily.  Otherwise if there's any flaw in this game is that it feels too generic in some ways, and ""offbeat"" in other ways.   It could have been so much better with more impressive sounds and music, but it's not a bad game by any means.Overall, if you're looking for a good tower defense game to spend some time on and you've already played Defense Grid, then get this.

												I recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles, playing with friends, or old school concepts such as 2D sprites, quirky monsters and coin collecting. PixelJunk Monsters can be hilarious yet still challenging (double the laughter in 2 player mode). Although Pixeljunk Monsters can be frustrating, it was never too much. It never made me want to stop playing. Anticipating what the next map will look like, the new stage's music, and if there will be any new monsters or tricks kept me coming back for more. Personally, the music has stuck with me and it really became a favorite of mine. I also enjoy how you dance on things to make them stronger. When it comes to tower defense games PixelJunk Monsters has a special charm to it that you won't find elsewhere.I did previously play through the PS3 version when it first came out but that was 5 years before picking this one up. I played both games with the same friend and it actually still felt fresh. The newly added island in this version was fantastic and really extended the game's life for me.Happy pixeling!			"

												As a big fan of Tower Defense, this is my absolute favorite. It has the most natural learning curve, and the end levels are probably some of the hardest in the genre. The game truly shines in coop, however even in single player you often take just one more go to perfect the level. Scoreboards also make you want to go beyond just finishing the level flawlessly, and instead you try to make it through the level using only the necessary resources (as you are scored based on resources left).In summation, this game is all about speed, planning ahead, and spending resources wisely. And it's oh so fun!Don't let my played time fool you. I've played this game mostly on PS3 and PS Vita, where I can estimate around 100 hours played. Also, don't listen to most of the negative reviews here. It seems they have only played the first couple of levels, which are basically training levels. "

												Nice Graphics and surprisingly steep challenge curve (played on normal) you wouldn't expect from that cutesy looking game. Yet it's quite unsatisfying to play, no way to speed up waves, grinding trees for extra money just seems too tideous but seems to be required for perfect level scores. The tower ranges seem to be quite unpredicteable when placed on corners. Maybe this this can be patched up to pass as ok, yet for now there are better alternatives to this game which just feels too unevenly paced.If you like constant action, this might be for you, but if you think that collecting money by constantly sweeping up coins behind your fallen enemies is too much of micromanegement give this one a pass.Coop mode was not covered in this review.

												Quite a difficult and highly unforgiving tower defense game. Even on Casual difficulty and borderline cheating by using two controllers, I still had major difficulties. Things have a tendency to very quickly get out of hand. You might think you have a well-planned defense, but the game will throw a wave of monsters at you that you're completely unprepared for, negating ten minutes worth of work (no, there is no fast forward feature in this TD game).One particular point of frustation is that the game absolutely forces you to perfect levels in order to unlock progression, unlike most TD games where you can always go back later to improve your score. This leads to a situation where you'll feel compelled to restart if you lose so much as one point (even if you've already put ten minutes worth of work into a level), as there's little point to finishing with an imperfect rating.I'll recommend this, but with the caveat that this is really for those who are interested in a co-op TD game, or those who really relish a challenge.

												A cute, fun, and challenging tower defense game about a Tiki man protecting his 20 Tiki kids from the hordes of monsters that traverse the forest aiming to make lunch of Tiki man's kids. 20 kids, whew! Perhaps the monsters in the game are after Tiki man for overpopulating the forest with his spawn. Anyways, Monsters offers multiple modes and difficulties. Difficulties ranging from Casual, Regular, and Hard-core (once the game is beat on Regular) provide hours and hours of entertainment for anyone from the newbies to the veterans of tower defense games. There's single player, local co-op, and even online co-op. Complete levels in single player or co-op and unlock up to 24 Medal Challenges in the Tiki Hut, which upon completion of each level will net you an achievement if the challenges restrictions/rules were met. Completion of special levels will unlock various rewards like the Speed Potion, Bomb, and things that must be purchased during levels like addition towers or bonus interest between waves.Once one finishes with Tiki Island, Toki Island, and Gati Gati Island, there's Tum Tum Island which generates a random level based on an up to 5 character word, number or combination of letters & numbers.Monsters has high potential for replay value thanks to Tum Tum Island, but out of the dozen or so words I've tried I ended up with the same stages too often, most of them very easy. Highly recommended, even to those that have played the original release of Monsters as there is enough new content to keep the game feeling fresh.  "

												I've spent so many hours on this game and I still keep on coming back to it, I figured I owed it a review. So here goes.PixelJunk™ Monsters Ultimate is a tower defense game. Um. That's it. You play a Tikiman defending his offspring from wave after wave of nature monsters by transforming the surrounding trees into weaponized barrels. I couldn't say that there's anything particularly special about it as a tower defense game, if only because I don't play enough tower defense to make sweeping statements about the genre. I guess that's the thing. To me, this game IS the tower defense genre: it's an intuitively designed, visually and musically appealing, simple, challenging game. Easy to understand but hard to master. I haven't beaten all the levels, 70 hours in at the time of this review, but I definitely want to.I want to logic out a reason why this game and not other games in the genre has become my go-to when I do get the itch for tower defense but I don't think the logic is there. Just visceral enjoyment. It's just a fun and relaxing game. I mean, there's some annoyances, yeah. It's definitely not mapped with common PC users' standards in mind. People say, oh there's no fast forward but it wouldn't make a lot of sense when many levels require you to change up your towers on the fly. Though I do feel bad when I get up to the second to last wave and it's something that none of my towers can handle, speedy armored flaming bees or whatever. It's never the kind of frustration that stops me from playing though. I loved it when I originally played it on the PSP and I love it on Steam. Considering it continues to pop up for super cheap in so many bundles and so many sales, I feel like it's become kind of a standard, there's-no-reason-not-to-have-it Steam game. It's a good game, has every reason not to be, but it is.			"

Easy to learn but takes patience to master.I bought PJM for PS3 many years ago and it's easily one of the titles I've played the most on PS3, especially co-op. I instantly pre-ordered PJM Ultimate as soon as it was announced on Steam, mostly because of nostalgia. Even so, it has still managed to attract >50 hrs of playtime. The difficult lies not with completing a stage, but with what margins. I think this is a game you either love or hate. <3A simple and good concept, well executed. High replayability, great value.

												This game will scratch your tower defense itch, but when some levels have pathing that doesn't make any sense and is borderline random, it lessens any strategic input you can make on a level. Because of this, the game boils down to tower placement that needs little thought and just hoping for the best. However, actually having a character to move around placing towers and collecting coins is a nice twist on the genre. And just like the other Pixeljunk titles, the game has responsive movement and crisp visuals.			"

												Fantastic tower defense game.  I've played this for well over a hundred hours between PS3/Vita and PC versions.You play a little tiki guy (1 or 2 player) and you use trees to build towers on as ground units/flying units/shielded units/fast units/etc try to get to the end and eat your friends.  Your towers level up by killing monsters but you can dance on them to level them up faster.  Guessing: there are over 30 stages included in this game along w/ a bunch of challenges (stages with unique requirements to win).  When you complete the game a new island unlocks that is basically a random stage generator.  It will randomly generate a stage and monsters for you to play on.You should buy this.			"

												The positive-Overall, PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate is a good game. Unlike most tower defense games I've played, this one lets you control the main character (Tikiman) which makes it so that there is always something to do during gameplay. The islands on the world map are well designed and the levels have simplistic yet very well-implemented environmental effects. The best part is that it can be played co-op or online, which is a rare feature for a tower defense. The game is hard but certainly not impossible and well balanced.The negative-Bosses are a bit redundant. They're good for the first island but then get a little old. Also, although there isn't much for story in this game, the ending could be expanded upon to make completion of the game more rewarding.			"

												PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate is a tower defense game. But it has a few interesting little catches. Along with the standard assortment of enemies that have varying characterstics and towes to counter those characterstics, this game has you playing as a character. You character moves around the screen and must be in position to build towers. You build them over trees, so there's a limit to how many you can have and where they can go. By standing on them, you can slowly uprade them over time. So is it worth it to stand on a tower for a long time, or run off to build another? Which tower is important to upgrade first? How much should you upgrade it? It makes for a more frantic, involved experience and a new way to strategize. You can also upgrade towers with gems that enemies sometimes drop. These can be used for instant updrades to tower, or can unlock more bonuses and tower types by going back to your base and purchsing them. More strategy to plan out. Fallen enemies also drop coins, which you use to purchase the towers you build. Sometimes running through trees will have them randomly drop coins or a gem. Another cool feature is multiplayer. This allows each player to have their own pool of coins and move about on their own to cover more ground. You share your gems though, so be wise with them. This is a nice mode to make those trickier, more frantic levels a little easier to handle. And basically, you have another body out there to camp on tovwers to upgrade them.The problems I have with this game are the waves, the difficulty, and the art direction. The waves are nonstop. So you never get any time between waves to rest, collect fallen items, or set up towers. You have to do it all on the fly. And if you had a rough wave prior, you'll be starting the next wave before even a moment's rest. It's just not the kind of tower defense I like, but I assume it's to account for standing on towers to upgrade them. Still, they could've disabled that betwen rounds but... maybe it's for the flow. The difficulty seems to ramp up really fast. You need to make new strategies I supposed, but I was getting destroyed a few levels in. Maybe I'm just bad, so consider that as well. And the art direction is... nice at first but samey after a while. Seems like a lot of reused stuff copy and pasted around. Not a big deal but can wear on you spirits and your eyes after a bit. At least the music is cool and soothing to help counter that a bit.I'll honest, I got this game in a bundle for free. I kept it and played it for the trading cards. I don't mind the single player, but multiplayer really made me enjoy this game a lot more. It is worth the ten dollar price tag? I'd say not. Maybe wait for a sale to get it cheap. A few bucks wouldn't be bad but... I think at most you'd want to look kat about 3. Just my opinion though.PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate gets a 5/10 for being a decent tower defense game with a few neat features, but lacks a bit of effort and polish in areas. Worth checking out if you're into the genre.			"

												I'm not a fanatic about tower defense games, but I can enjoy a few of them for a bit. This TD game, however, has some characteristics that caused me to grow tired of it pretty quickly.When you start a round, one minor nit I have is that you actually get almost no prep time. No biggie, but there is a bigger issue: there is no clear indicator of where the monsters are coming from or where they are going to path. After about 10 stages in or so, I had played a few stages where it seemed as if monsters could enter the stage from more than one area or path differently but didn't (maybe I killed some too soon?). Maybe the stages become replayable at a higher difficulty where such things happen? If so, that seems even more of reason to indicate entry and pathing.Critically absent is a variety of towers. You get 2 anti-air towers, 3 ground towers, and 1 all-purpose tower. No slows, no damage-over-time, etc. This may shorten the entertainment value of the game more than any other aspect. Coupled with this is a very short and linear upgrade path per tower. Each tower type gets its own set of 4 upgrades in serial that are sure to induce even more yawns (range, damage, etc.).The mechanic in which you can use your avatar to actively help give experience to a single tower is interesting and a bit unique (at least to me). Unfortunately, this mechanic competes with collecting loot and building towers (i.e. you can only do one of these at a time). So the game involves you having to move around the map a lot. And what makes this less forgivable is just how crappy the movement controls are. For some reason your character has an intertia that causes a sliding as if you were always running on ice (despite being in a forest). And one downside to this loot-collecting mechanic is that if you cluster your towers and kill the monsters in a single area, then often you have to either try to get the loot and risk getting hit by the monsters still pathing through, or wait around for them to all pass or die and pick them up before they fade away. Honestly, why does the loot fade away at all? How does that make the game better?The character sprites and animations are fairly simplistic and boring. The aesthetics are consistent in their style, but most sprites only have a couple of frames for their movement animation. They show no signs of damage taken nor do they react to any attacks. These are things that could be added that show detail while maintaining a minimalistic style. Without them, the game shows a lack of care or polish and instead something seems rushed out with low effort. A similar thing can be said for the music and sound effects.			"

Awesome!On lowest level I had fun playing this game with my 4 year old and on the higher level with my 9 year old. Both really like this game as much as they like flowers versus zombies (another strategy)+ simple controls+ not to complex types of structures to build+ does funny dances to improve your structures+ co-op+ lot different kind of enemies+ big end level bosses+ not to fast game play for kids/my parents (sorry mom)- graphics are okay, but could be better- gameplay feels a bit slow for younger adults (not you mom... sorry again) "

												PixelJunk Monsters is a tower defense game set on tropical islands in which you play as Tikiman who is tasked to defend his home from the onslaught of various monsters. While this sounds very appealing, PixelJunk Monsters is riddled with a myriad of serious problems that will only frustrate and bewilder you.It pretty much plays as a classic isometric tower defense game, the only notable difference being that you only directly control Tikiman, so you have to use him to do pretty much anything. Tikiman has the ability to cut down trees and build towers in their place. The tower selection is abysmal and the game will force you to use three or four towers most of the time. To unlock a few towers more, you have to collect gems which are randomly dropped by defeated monsters. You can also use these gems to upgrade existing towers.The first thing you’ll notice is that the controls are surprisingly wonky. Tikiman will almost always sort of slide just off the point you designated him to stop. Unfortunately, a small thing such as this becomes a major problem simply because Tikiman has to be in the exact spot of anything you need to interact with, be it a tower or his home. When you finally do get him into place, you will find out that you usually have to click several times on the tower before the game registers your command. This becomes a huge problem when there are several towers very close to each other. He also has to manually collect every single coin and gem dropped by the destroyed monsters. All of this leads to incredibly monotonous, frustrating and completely needless micromanagement.The true incompetence of the developer failing to understand the appeal of tower defense games is best evident in the game design. When you fail a map in a superbly designed tower defense game, you always know why and how you failed and you can devise new tactics on your second try. That’s what makes you keep going and repeating a level until it is perfect. In PixelJunk Monsters, you will repeat levels because the game will punish you for not being psychic. Most maps have multiple routes, but you have absolutely no idea which one the monsters will take, you cannot affect or change paths in any way and you don’t know anything about the upcoming monsters and their abilities until they actually show up.Speaking of monsters, the difficulty spikes are absolutely insane. All bosses are incredibly slow and boring making them complete pushovers which makes each and every final wave disappointingly anticlimactic whereas you will get completely trumped by a random low level monster wave. All of these bewildering design choices result in constant soul-crushing trial and error effectively destroying any semblance of strategy so inherent to the tower defense genre.The game looks nice enough. It sports simple 2D graphics, but the art style is vibrant and colorful. The tower and monster designs, however, are rather poor. Upgrading the towers will only change their appearance when they reach the final level and even then it only adds a golden outline. Until then, the only way to differentiate them is by looking at the ugly colored flags. The animations are pretty bad and the sound effects are lousy. The only redeeming quality is the lovely and surreal electronic soundtrack.Considering the stiff competition within the genre, PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate has far too many problems for it to be considered anything but a complete and utter failure with frustratingly poor controls and absolutely awful trial and error design.2 OUT OF 10 (BAD)			"

												This game is boring.It is not a normal tower-defense game but you have to control one unit and build different towers out of trees.The lanes where the monsters spawn are not always visible and clear to the player, so you have to restart several levels again and again once you know where the enemies walk and fly.You get money for killing enemies but you don't get it right away. You have to collect it with your building guy. This is terrible because you are not allowed to be in the way of the monsters or else you lose coins and you are stuck for a few seconds. How am I supposed to collect coins and eggs when there are monsters?The building guy is also very, very slow. This makes the levels even more difficult. Most of the time you don't have time to build or upgrade towers because you run around on the map and collect coins and eggs - which despawn quite fast if you don't collect them.I mentioned coins for building towers, but there are eggs as well. With them you can upgrade towers or buy new kinds of towers. The upgrades are increasing in cost (1 egg, then 2 and 3). The cost is okay but the new towers are way to expensive. The most expensive mortar tower costs 15 eggs; too much because the upgrades are more important.The maps are bad designed. Apart from not being able to distinct which paths the mosters go, sometimes the monsters take a path exactly at the edge of the range of the towers. Most time you have to restart the levels because the range of the towers is too low even when places exactly where you think it should be placed. Upgrading the range is only possible for one tower - the cheapest and worst one. Maybe the others upgrade as well but if so, then I didn't notice it.You can upgrade the tower either with eggs directly on the tower or they gain experience by killing monsters. The experience gained is too low, so at most times you have to upgrade with eggs rather than saving them for more powerful towers. A nice touch is the dancing at towers: with your Builder you can stand near a tower and he begins to dance, slowly giving the tower experience to level up. Have I mentioned slowly? This is very slow and is only worthwhile if a tower is near leveling up and so giving it the last edge.It is not possible to manually upgrade towers or the builder. At the end of some levels you are rewarded with an item that gives your builder a boost. (I only found one). Maybe there are further upgrades - but they are rare and don't have the impact you'd expect from an upgrade.I cannot recommend this game. I received it from GameStar (a German video game magazine) as a subscriber. This is not worth your money. Play a tower defense game at Kongregate and you have more fun.			"

												One of the worst Pixeljunk games and very weak tower defense.

												I bought this for like 2€ thinking it would be a good tower defense game. What it turned out to be was perfective RTS that has stages which you learn AFTER failing. Trust me when I say this: I've played rather many games to know if this is worth it.The monster pathing is rather weird (doesn't tell you where the minions move) and it can make you lose quickly because you have no idea where the monsters are coming to. think of it this way : 90% of the monsters go on top lane and 10% of them go on bottom lane. so you probably build your defenses accordingly at first. but then you notice that every wave is tougher and tougher, so the 10% of your defenses that are on bottom of the map gets up to 6 monsters out of about 15 per wave. Your 10% dmg defenses can't be upgraded unless you've been saving up fruits (you won't, because you have to perfectly upgrade everything with fruits and your ""dance""). So you end up losing lives from that as well as from enemies you had no defenses ready for (think massive spider wave, you'll most likely not kill them all).If you lose a single life you won't get a perfect score .. and without perfect score you won't unlock necessary things to get abilities that help you progress better. Maybe if you follow a guide so you don't spend so much time failing stages you can tel l everyone how easily you got through the game and how great it was.7/10 buy it if you like to waste time learning enemy patterns			"

Achievements within the game keep it interesting and challenging; making you want to perfect the fat baby 100% level completion. Although there are limited towers, the upgrading capability of the tiki man allows the player to maintain balance in tower power. The use of nature in the game also adds another twist for the player in terms of tower placements. Overall a very enjoyable game with potential for a relaxing afternoon of gameplay with a co-op partner.			"

												I got frsutrated within minutes of playing this. No speed up button? For a TD where the enemies literally crawl towards you and even when you beat the wave you have to allow the wave to time out before the next is sent?, No send wave button? This is basic stuff for any TD. Add to that that it's difficult to click on a tower once built in order to upgrade because it's one button for moving, same button for upgrading. Most of the time you'll just move tikiman away from the tower you want to upgrade. And - to top it off, holding down movement slows down the game, so in order to run round picking up coins you have to do lots of clicks, which is useless when avoiding monsters.This doesn't just fail at the basics it doesn't even attempt them. Doesn't matter how interesting the concept, a TD without a speed up button or send wave button is an instant fail. Everything else just adds insult to injury. I got this in a bundle. I'd be unhappy if I'd paid more for it.			"

												This is a cute time waster, but ultimately a pretty terrible tower defense game.The map design is organic, and this is not just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dad joke about your tower emplacements being trees: you're not playing on a grid with well-defined, narrow corridors, the paths your foes traverse can be quite large.Also, enemies don't always follow the shortest path, and there is no way to display which path they will take.In case you wonder how the above works in a genre that's all about planning ahead, well, here's some trivia for you: did you know that ""antergy"" is the antonym of ""synergy"", which is corporate speak for ""work well together""? Two guesses as to why it's relevant here.So unlike better entries in the genre like Defense Grid or the underrated Defender's Quest, where clear rules make each victory/failure your own, in PJMU sometimes an enemy just slips through unharmed because it decided to use a slightly longer path, just beyond where your towers can reach.Oh, and new levels are unlocked by getting perfect runs, because hey, couldn't devise a system where the fuzziness of the mechanics could just be overlooked -- nope, gotta be OCD if you want to make progress. No checkpoints during levels either, so if a wave 15 guy decides to take the scenic route you'll have to do it all over again.Not wanting to trial-and-error my way through this, I dropped down to Casual and I'm just treating the game as a slightly interactive screen saver now.Looks/sounds cute though. Turtle Dad got some moves.			"

												This game gets overly hard very quickly, but this isn't a fun kind of hard or a challenging kind of hard, this is just frustrating. The game's PC controls are wonky odd and annoying, it felt much better with a controller than with the mouse and keyboard, so if you do choose to buy it, it's better if you have one.The main issue with this game is randomness and lack of information. The paths the monsters follow are really not well defined and even will be different between waves as they go up and down in the lane. This means towers that worked for you perfectly might just not shoot anything the next wave. The ranges of the towers are circular, combine that with the strange monster pathing you'll see towers aiming to shoot a monster but never actually fire just because they didn't enter the range long enough. What do upgrades do exactly? What are the base damages of the towers? How much range is each? How much damage does the upgrade give? This information as well as the monster pathing itself I suppose you're just supposed to learn through a lot of trial and error, which in a tower defense game where you can't directly interact with the monsters a calcualted defense is all you have. Bloons gets away with this by simplifying the ""monster"" hp, everything dies in one hit, pop it and it will change color or turn into more. In this game the monster HP doesn't even have the decency to stay consistent, the same tower that just killed a monster might leave the next in the same wave at low hp. The mechanics that trees will randomly have coins or gems as well as dancing to slowly upgrade towers, and needing to collect the coins to get money. to give you something to do really just make the whole experience feel more drawn out.Just... yuck, there's very little redeeming this game, play ANY other tower defense, and likely it will be better than this.I really liked pixel junk eden, but this wasn't anywhere close.

												Really liked this on the PS3, but it seems that was ages ago and the genre has evolved quite a bit since then.  As it stands, this is still somewhat enjoyable if you've never played any modern tower defense games, but if you have played any, then this will seem rather boring in comparison.			"

												Why even bother making the millionth tower defense clone if you bring absolutley nothing new to the table? It looks different, sure. But it plays just like all the others. It's probably more fun in two player coop mode, but I won't be playing another minute of this. If you love all things tower defense, then you should have fun with this one as well.			"

												Not me, I thought it was one of the worst tower defense games I've played, and I've played a lot.Whoever thought it was a good design to force the player to get a perfect scorse (no villagers lost) on most levels to progress ruined the game for me. If you want to see how it should be done, the iBomber tower defense games get it right - award more upgrade points for perfect scores, but close to perfect does not prevent you from progressing in the game.The terribe graphics and horrible sound seal the deal.

												I didn't like this game. The controls are imprecise, the graphics are plain, the sprite animation is static, the music is tinkly, and the gameplay is boring. I also didn't like having to chase around after coins as if it's Super Mario Brothers or something. Chasing coins is a distraction from forward-planning the placement of towers, although there seems to be plenty of time for it. Tiki Man plays like a toddler at Kindergarten who finds it difficult to slow down once he's trundling along in a particular direction. Overall, I would say it's easy to tricked by the cutesy graphics into thinking this game is cool and funny, but the artwork is really the only thing this game has going for it.			"

												Knowing only that Pixel Junk Monsters is a tower defense game and going in with the dreadful experience of all the tower defense game regurgitated out onto the Google Play market, to say that my expectations were not high is an understatement. In most ways this game was everything I assumed it would be, but there was actually a nice little twist to it that really piqued my interest.Now a nice twist does not mean a nice game. I think Pixel Junk is pretty rubbish, but the way that the tower creation mechanics are done has some serious potential. Instead of just clicking a spot and picking a tower, the devs decided to make the whole process more organic. You control a turtle looking creature and you navigate the board in the same manner as you would an action RPG, hunting for loot and transforming trees into deadly turrets. I think the idea is just awesome and makes the stale tower defense genre much more engaging and potentially complex enough for serious PC gaming.Sadly everything falls short in Pixel Junk Monsters. The navigation, while so cool, is slow and cumbersome. Instead of using this mechanical twist to up the complexity, it feels like the whole game was dumbed down 12 notches. Such great ideas for one of the most stale genres out there, but the execution just isn’t there. Pixel Junk 2 could be a big deal.			"

												A competent but very generic tower defense game, if you've played a decent number of flash TD games or Warcraft 3 TD maps, you're not going to see much new here.  Has an annoying issue where it doesn't tell you which path the monsters are going to take.  Reasonable purchase if you get it at a large discount, but I cannot recommend it at full price.			"

												I love TD games. Played dozens of them on sites like Armor Games and Kongregate. Played several on Steam, too, and recently 100%-ed Kingdom Rush.This game is quite possibly the worst TD game I have ever played. Don't know if I can add anything to the negative reviews that have been written thus far, so I'm probably going to repeat everything they already said.You build stuff by moving the tiki builder to a tree. The builder moves like it's on ice. Mouse, keyboard, doesn't matter - it's not precise, it's slow.Once you get to a tree, you need to select what to build by clicking the mouse or pressing a keyboard button. The trees, since they're dense, have small ""hitboxes"", which means you have to be positioned precisely. Coupled with horrible movement, that's hard to do.When you select what to build, you aren't given an indicator as to what the tower will cover. You have to wait until the tower is built, which is like ten seconds. Once it's built, you might find that it's not what you've been hoping for. Is there a wider pathway the mobs will travel through? Well, in one wave they'll be on the left side, in another wave they'll be on the right side. You are not going to cover the entire pathway with a single cannon, for example. So you have to build two.Anyway, monsters come, they hopefully get killed. Then, unlike every single other TD game that has ever been made, this one requires you to manually pick up gold left after the monsters die. If you don't, the gold vanishes. There's a catch: you can't be touched by any of the monsters. So you go to pick something up, or you think you're close enough to be safe (the coins can also be gathered through close proximity; you don't have to be exactly on top of them) and then you die. Wonderful. Have I mentioned that the trees hide some of the drops, due to perspective? No? There's also that.Occasionally, you get green gems/eggs/whatever, used to research new towers, or upgrade existing ones. To research something new, you have to go back to your starting area. Then you have to position your builder precisely so that it lights up exactly like the trees. And guess what you can research? Just a couple of new towers. But if you're researching, you're not collecting the gold and gems dropped.If you want to upgrade your tower, you have to move exactly to the position it's been built on. Then you choose one single upgrade, which will be range for arrow towers, or damage for cannon towers. Can't upgrade damage on arrow, or range on cannon. How great is that? Hint: it's not. What's the new range going to be? You don't know. What's the new damage going to be? You don't know, either. And you also don't know what the current damage is. I even managed to sell my first tower instead of upgrading it, because the icon was unclear, and I thought I could upgrade it for gold instead of gems. Nope.Upgraded towers have different flags. They don't change in appearance. Is a purple flag better than a red flag? No idea.A yeti comes along? Your arrow towers are useless. They don't do anything. Other TD games will tell you the armor level of the opponent and its hitpoints. This one tells you nothing. You find through trial and error. Kind of. Because mob X in wave 5 will have less health than the exact same mob X in wave 6.The graphics are glitchy. The tower turrets move in large chunks, like 15-20 degrees or so. Watch them spaz out when a large column of mobs are passing in front of them.Maybe you manage to finish the wave way before the next one is due. Can you call the next wave in? You can't. You have to wait. Maybe 10 seconds, maybe a minute. But you have to wait.Now there's a boss. It thumps veeeerrrryyyy slloooowwwwllllyyyy towards the trees. As in, ""it takes half a minute until it reaches the first tower"". It thumps annoyingly. Then you kill the boss. Then it drops something that looks like a pig snout. What's that? I have no bloody idea. Is it even a pig snout?!This game was made by someone who heard something about tower defence games, but has never played one and doesn't know what exactly they are, much less what makes them fun.To even ask money for this game is insulting, because it wouldn't be worth playing even if it was free.Verdict: 0/10			"

												A very simplistic tower defense game with a few unique twists which unfortunately don't manage to make it any better.There are six basic towers, three of which you have to unlock again in every single game you play. Tower upgrades are done with speciality drops which then change the flag color on your tower and give it more damage (were the devs too lazy to create upgraded tower models?). Building is done with a builder guy and can in fact only be done that way. Your builder also dies on monster contact and can pick up some left over coins from killed monsters. This makes the game hectic and kind of annoying, because you have to pick up the coins and upgrade drops quickly before they vanish, at the same time you also need to keep track of your towers. It's not a bad idea, has been done before for sure, but it only turns out to be a chore.The game's graphics are ok, very simplistic but that has a slight charm to it. Same with the sound effects and music. The biggest shortcoming here is the lack of a speed up button though. Maps take forever to finish and given that you only have 3 or 6 towers with the upgrades doesn't make this any fun. Especially since you have to run around the map and frantically collect drops without touching the spawned monsters. You also can't call monster waves early nor are there any rewards to play in an ascetic style playing with as little coin spent as possible. This could be an ok flash game I guess, but even then it would be playing in the smaller leagues as there are plenty of better tower defense games around, even the free ones.			"

												A much more difficult version of the original Playstation 3 game, in fact there are various balance issues in the game where you can only beat most boards a certain way if at all (in terms of rainbow clearing a board where no villagers die). The original game was easier and somewhat more enjoyable where you can elect to beat certain boards with different towers. In this game you don't have as much freedom (and time) to experiment due to the added features like balloon monsters, flaming monsters and crabs.The best way to enjoy the game is switch to casual beat the game and then play again on casual or normal. That way you have the two most useful items in the game (the Hive and the Land Mine), you will also unluck arguably the most powerful tower and gain a bonus to gold each wave. This will make the game slightly less difficult and more enjoyable in my opinion.Recommended for those fans of the original as well as new players for something difficult but more simplistic than other games.

												I love tower defense games and have played my fair share of them. This is among the worst ones I have ever played. The builder you use is so slow I want to tear out hair. Clicking things is hard to do because apparently you have to be in the exact spot the game wants you to be in order to upgrade towers, pick up money/eggs, avoid being hit, and build stuff. There are only 6 towers and I liked none of them. You have to learn much of the game by trial and error. Does the green flag mean it's level 2 tower or level 3? Whatever, I'll just build more towers. You never know what range your towers have or the damage they do until you build them and memorize which ones do what to which monsters at what levels. You can't even speed up the game! I could go on more, but I don't want to waste any more time on this. This is terrible, please buy almost any either Tower Defense game. 2/10 It's just pretty awful.			"

												It looks cute and all. But the gameplay is slow, brainless and boring. he game comes down to spamming towers all over. Upgrading a tower only gives you a single option: the game decides if the next upgrade will increase range, damage, etc.What kills the game is the slow pace and weird difficulty spikes. One wave is easily cleared, on which you have to wait an obnoxious amount of time, the other wave just runs past your towers taking some of your life points.All with all this game needed more fine tuning in the gameplay department before release.

												Game is too hard (even on normal) for a tower defense game, sometimes the towers just choose not to shoot even when the target is clealy in range and well within the 'reload speed'.  It is just blind luck in pinches if your tower hits or not.  Upgrades do not make towers stronger, all it seems to do is lower attack speed.  Just a cheap indy shovelware.  "

												It's a neat little TD game once you start, but quickly turns sour once you play enough. I wanted to like it. I really do love a good TD game, and this one looked charming. However, the flaws in this game turned me away from playing much more than an hour.There are certain features that make absolutely no sense whatsoever, such as losing coins when touching enemies. The only purpose of the little guy you're controlling is to either build towers or slowly upgrade them manually. Other than that, it can't really do anything to the enemies, which then raises the question of why must I be punished for touching enemies then? It stops me from collecting valuable resources, and makes it even more difficult to get across to try and build more towers if there's a large swarm of enemies. This adds no strategic value, and only ends in frustration with the enemies.The enemies, from what I gathered from the little I played, are pretty bland. Your anti-air towers are basically useless except for a few instances later in a game when the enemies get a little harder. Others are just frustrating because of the game's lack of balancing for quantity vs. quality of towers. Spiders, for instance, are very fast and come in great swarms, but easily crushed by cannon towers. The problem is, they move so fast that you can only get one, maybe two shots in from the cannons, and are difficult to kill fast enough with arrows. Golems are pretty much invincible execpt for cannons, and although they're a bit rarer, these ones you're definitely going to need some heavy upgrades on your cannons. Air enemies are basically a joke because as long as you have a decent amount of arrows, which you're going to need from the start, they're easily taken down. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't exactly add to the challenge.So, as I said before, the design of the game really hurts the balance of quality vs. quantity, because you're either going to have to throw an enormous amount of cannons everywhere, which is difficult as it is because their range is so short, or pray that a few heavily upgraded ones and a few other towers will do the job. Because of the angled perspective of the game however, half of their range is nearly useless because it will be blocked by trees or other towers. So the one tower that is incredibly useful and powerful without needing massive upgrades is half useless because of the perspective and range. On top of that, and this is another major point, the enemy paths on this game are going to frustrate you to no end. You have little-to-no indication of where the enemies are going, nor even a small arrow at the beginning to give you an idea of where they'll start. You basically have to guess how close they're going to be in the middle of the paths, or if they hug the sides. Because the overall paths are so wide, it makes it hard to gauge where you should be placing certain towers, such as the cannons. This is severely debilitating, as it can force you to have to restart a level simply because of finding out your towers are far off from where the enemies are going, so all that happens is they fly by and leave you annoyed.I hate to review a game with so little play time, but with so many major flaws right out of the gate, I don't think curiousity really warrants trying more of it. Maybe if it has a major sale I'd say try picking it up to try, but other than that, I can't say I would recommend it. Considering it's a year old, I wouldn't expect it to get any better any time soon.			"

												 Here at Retro 101 we are long-time fans of just about everything that the Pixel Junk team has produced. They just seems to have a way of taking a genre that has been done to death and then adding something new to make it fresh and vibrant again. Now Monsters is making its way onto the PC and we are absolutely delighted to have it around for those lunch time sessions.What we have here is effectively the original game and the extra content added through Monsters Encore and the PSP version. The game also has online multiplayer modes and a lovely higher resolution graphical style. The island that lets you create random levels by typing in words is also unlocked right from the start. So if you’re a fan you can stop reading this review right here, log into Steam and purchase it.  For those that want a bit more detail then read on.For those new to the series this is a tower defence style game where your little Tikiman must run around the screen upgrading trees into different types of defensive structures. And yes, you do still move the Tikiman around rather than just point and click on trees with the mouse. Wave upon wave of monsters then pour into the level from various points and head towards the village hut (normally located in the middle of the stage).  Around the hut are a number of baby Tiki’s and once the monsters have made off with all of them you lose.It’s a concept we’ve seen many times before but it’s hard to remember when it has been accomplished with so much style and flair. You start off with three basic towers which covers attacking land monsters, air monsters and one that does both. The towers all have different damage outputs, speed of fire and targeting radius. Once a monster enters the targeting radius the towers will fire on them automatically. Killing monsters provides gold to upgrade more trees and gems which are stored in the village hut and can be used to upgrade the strength of towers or unlock new types to use.The extra towers do all sorts of weird and wonderful things. You can get ice towers to slow monsters down, mortars to cause massive damage, lasers to knock flying enemies down and electricity pylons to hit creatures with area effect attacks and the list goes on. It’s with these towers that the game begins to come into its own as you will need to know the strengths and weaknesses of them all in order to succeed. You can’t just lay out your defences and hope for the best here, you have to continually move around the field and change the type of towers to win the day.PixelJunk Monsters can be a bone crushingly tough game, especially for newcomers to the genre. It takes time to learn that you really should be selling certain towers at certain times and changing from anti-air to ground and back again for certain waves of attack. It’s the sort of game where you may be stuck on a stage for ages but then have a breakthrough and clear three or four in one go. You have to constantly think about what you’re doing and constantly keep an eye on what the next wave of marauding nasty’s will be.One memorable level ended with a frantic scramble around the stage to clear all the anti-air guns as the final boss stomped on and proceeded to be able to almost walk straight to the babies without taking a hit. Stress like that is what you’re going to have to deal with to come out on top and it’ll happen all the time.Away from the main game there are a host of other options and things to do. You can play Co-op in online modes and this allows two Tiki men to run around to defend the village. There are also tons of challenge levels which require you to complete stages under certain conditions. The criteria is always different and can range from anything from only using a certain type of tower to making sure you don’t let monsters cross certain parts of the level. As if the game wasn’t difficult enough this will test even the best strategy fans out there.We’ve established the game is hard, but it always fair and the funny thing is it doesn’t really seem to matter. The sense of achievement from completing a level will always have you coming back for just one more go. You’ll find yourself thinking about levels in your everyday life and coming up with strategies while you should be doing other things. Then you’ll return and try it out and maybe it’ll work and bring you onto the next challenge. It’s perfect for formulating a strategy during the morning and then testing it out in a lunch break.Overall, this is the definitive version of an already excellent game. The core mechanics are strong and work wonderfully when added to the flair and charm of it all. There is very little reason not to recommend it to fans of genre and gamers looking for something a little different. The difficulty may be too much for some but it’s a great version of a great game and it should really be in your collection.Overall 8/10			"

												Cheery little game with relaxing soundtrack and charming graphics.I already played it on PS3, but I felt obliged to get it once more, simply because it's so wonderful. While it tries to do some things originally you won't find any revolution here. But it is more than solid Tower Defense game that will keep you entertained for long time.			"

												I originally played this game on the ps3 with my brother doing local co-op. it's very fun trying to rainbow each stage and then rainbow each stage again on hardcore. Being able to play online on the steam version is just icing on the cake because we can now play whenever, whereever. Highly recommended!			"

												I remember playing this game way back when in 2010 back when it was released on the PSP. It was a great game then and it doesn't fall short now. The simple hand drawn graphics are still great and the game still holds to the test of time. The game itself in terms of gameplay isn't that great, nor does it standout, yet if you are a competitive individual you will be spending a lot of time with it in order to get a perfect across all the stages, which can take a good deal of time. Unfortunately this is also where the game falls short, sometimes strategy turns into memorization of what enemy comes from where and on what wave. It is with this in mind that the game can become dull at times as you are repeating a level for the third or fourth time trying to get the rainbow and each time takes 30 minutes. I would recommend this game if you are looking for some time to kill, but I would definitely recommend getting it on sale.			"

												Pros: The game has some new takes on classic tower play. Instead of building on preset paths, you can build towers on any tree. Your Tiki man can dance to help level your towers faster. Worth a couple of dollars. Cons: The game could use some general tightening. Sometimes the trees look like they are in a good spot but90% of your attack area will be in the woods instead of on the path. Some of the areas are so wide it's impossible to really cover them, even with a decent setup.			"

												Great game, but I bought this game purely to play with friends online as I had previously played this game solo on ps3 and psp. The online mode is broken. unbearable lag makes the game absolutely unplayable, massive lag spikes, huge delays, frequent drops. If you plan on playing this game on single player it's a great game. If they ever fix the lag problem that has been an issue since launch I would give this game a positive review. Until then I can not recommend this game.			"

I've owned this on four different systems and would gladly buy it a fifth time if they release an improwed version.This game is challanging and will probably requie some trial and error on a lot of maps. But the balance is really great and you have to be active and prioritize what you're upgrading during every wave. There is no other tower defence game I would recommend more than this.			"

Every level can be perfected and there are plenty of towers to try! Highly recommend for anyone new to tower defense, or anyone who wants to play another.			"

												BLECH, this is a completley uninteresting, unimaginative take on tower defense games (which I already think are terrible and embarassing to play).  After playing for about 10 minutes, I realized that there was no reason to continue... boring, played-out mechanics, a clunky interface (you use a character to walk around and service towers, rather than just clicking on them), and just nothing enjoyable about it whatsoever.  The only reason I picked it up was because I wanted to play PixelJunk Shooter (which was great, and NOTHING like this piece of garbage!), and I'm going to be uninstalling it shortly, as I don't even want to see it listed in my steam library.  Two thumbs down.			"

												This is hands down one of the best tower defense strategy games in existence.As tower defense games go, Monsters has transcended several of the plain-old features that players will usually find.For one thing, your tower-building *self* is on the field, and you can get *knocked out* by the monsters swarming for your treasure. As you are moving around building towers, you are also *leveling up* the towers you have already built. So there isn't a moment of sitting there watching monsters just die. There's always something to do.What makes the game phenomenal is that it *feels* like it has been tested to the extremes. No matter how good you think you are at tower defense games, you will be restarting many times on levels you haven't played before. As the game progresses, you can unlock new towers that do interesting things to help you win:The Hive - Sends out small dragonfly-like critters to your location that then kamikaze themselves into both air and ground units.Tesla Towers - Shoots out shockwaves that take down swaths of ground units moving by.Lightning Tower - Hits every monster on the screen once in awhile. Very strong when leveled up to full.The graphics are unique, the music is excellent, and each map is custom designed. It's a 10 out of 10.			"

												One of my favorite defense games to pass the time ever. I had first played it on PS3 while at a friend's house. I got attached to it. When I found on they had a port on Steam, I had to get it.Casual, yet somehow intense (especially when you become obsessed with having to clear with a rainbow or starting over) strategy that is obviously geared towards co-op. It adds a few new twists to your traditional ""tower defense"" genre game.The game looks simple, but polished and unique... the music is calming, even if it does get very repetitive. The game's ""basic"" and stripped down art and audio theme gives off the vibe that it's made for children, but there's a lot of challenge to be found here. Pre-planned strategy and, in many cases, pinpoint timing are required.There's a lot more to this game than meets the eye, and it's easy to get addicted to.Often overlooked, definitely underrated.Check it out if you're into defense games, or just want something fresh to experiment on that won't break the bank. Totally worth a sale price of 5 bucks or less. It's actually worth the regular 10 to me, but I will recommend you buy it on sale just in case it ends up not being your ""thing"". Definitely go for a 2-pack and play it online with a friend if you don't have a local co-op partner.			"

												Wow! Just glanced through the negative reviews for this game and they're incredibly unfair. I was addicted to this game on PS3, and I bought the VITA edition as well. I figured I'd try to get all the achievements in the steam edition too, but this version is a bit harder than the PS3 version due to some addtional content added.Ok, for this game the first thing you need to know is that it can be extremely difficult. You could be doing great on a level and then get destroyed by a wave out of nowhere. This game does require multiple retries to get a PERFECT CLEAR on a lot of the levels. When you retry, you start from the beginning of the level and there is no way to fast forward like some TD games let you do. I have some pretty basic advice for anyone who wants to do well:*Don't worry about getting a PERFECT CLEAR on every level before advancing to the next level. You'll unlock new towers and abilities thtoughout the game which will dramatically help you. Go back and get the PERFECT CLEARS when you have the extras unlocked.  Main item here is the Mine ability. This will save you very frequently *Don't spam the Anti-Air towers. A single AA tower upgraded to max level is probably more effective than 10 AA towers at the lowest level. Plus it's ""free"" to upgrade rather than buy new towers (Free in the sense that it costs no gold)*The slow down (frost) towers are too expensive and are rarely needed. I can rainbow almost every level without them. HOWEVER -  Some enemies are animated as being on fire and they have insanely super speed. Using a frost tower will permanently remove their speed bonus with one hit (and the frost tower can have a big splash radius as well). There are a few waves in the game that are almost impossible without this tower, so keep that in mind if you're having a brutal time with the fire guys. Those would be the main 3 things I think everyone should be aware of. Everything else you can figure out. To summarize the 'review' aspect of this:-This is one of the best TD games ever made. It is extremely balanced and every level can be mastered with practice. -Two player co-op is a blast! -No IAPS or DLC. Everything is included here-Lots of levels and challenges and achievements. Loads of playtime and replayability "

												Monsters Ultimate is a pretty addicting game. I play it over and over just to see if I can get rainbows in each level. It's fun building up towers and seeing just how much money I can make without spending it. I do however have some grievances with the game. The tiki man has sliding movement akin to that of a console game (it probably is, I only just heard about it here on Steam) which really should have been altered for PC. Not only that, but monster proximity is TERRIBLE. One moment I can be standing on top of a monster and receive no penalty, the next I can have about enough space for another tiki man between me and a monster and suddenly get hit, losing all my coins in the process. That kind of inconsistency really hurts on the beach map, and it really needs to be fixed. Otherwise, this is a pretty decent tower defense game.			"

												This game is #1I started playing this back on PS3 with my brother. We both had a blast and became quite obsessed with ""rainbowing"" every level. Once you start playing this game, especially with a friend, anything less tha 100% completion just wont do. Very addictive, challenging and fun to play! I highly recomend this game to anyone, even if you dont like tower defense games.			"

												If you want something casual but at the same time challenging and fun this is the game for you. Its a tower defense game that is simple and beutiful at the same time. The co-op is fun and great if you are looking to play it with a younger sibling. If you want a good tower defense game this is it.			"

												A really fun tower defense game with a lot of replay value. Multiplayer is a lot of fun if you've got a friend to play with and some form of voice chat. The in-game ""chat"", a mostly picture based chat, isn't the best way to communicate but it gets the job done.			"

												I love this game! I've stuck many hrs into the PS3 and PSP versions, and when I seen it for sale on Steam I knew I had to get it again. Pixeljunk Monsters is a tower defense game, but instead of just placing towers down and upgrading you have this little dude that runs around and puts towers down (in place of trees). Towers upgrade faster when you stand over them, and they also upgrade by killing enemies. Enemies also drop coins and gems when defeated and you must run over to them to pick them up. There are different towers, and more towers unlock as you progress. Use strategy to figure out what works best against what, and for tower placement. There are a lot of challenging stages, so if you enjoy TD games you're in for many, many hours of fun. The only TD game I prefer over PM is Defense Grid (also on Steam).			"

												There is no doubt in my mind that you need this game, if you're into tower defense games.If you don't like tower defense games, then avoid this at all costs, because that's what this is, but that's not /all/ this is.A set wave of enemies will spawn and attack your home base where your children are helplessly hoping they make it alive from the Monsters, but not unless you save them, then peace will be restored (a typical layout for a tower defense game, but Pixeljunk takes it further than that). You get a large variety of bad-a$$ towers to choose from like fire towers, ice towers, laser towers, arrow towers, cannon towers, and much more to take down your enemies. Around half the towers you use are to be unlocked by beating other levels. A rewarding experience to unlock the new towers and watch at how powerfully you can blast through a previous level to try to obtain a perfect score, unlocking new levels to ultimately, unlock even more content. The amount of replayability to this game goes on a whole 'nother scale of ""awesome"". What Pixeljunk Monsters does, is it gives you a standard tower defense game layout, and create an enlightening charm, creative ideas, and personality that cannot easily be replicated. Just like I like to tell people about Serious Sam (very unrelated game) is that the enemies and sheer creativity given to them makes the game memorable. Another trait that both games have in common is that you learn to acknowledge the sound of your enemy. Whether it be knowing what's coming (Serious Sam) or knowing what you've just killed (PJ Monsters) hearing the sounds of your enemy is only accomplishing if you begin to love the characters you're decimating. This Steam release does feel rather lacking, now here's where things get more in-depth. PJ Monsters feels more like a Steam port than an ultimate HD re-master. There's a new map that ""randomly generates levels"", but this is actually nothing more than the game on ""shuffle"" as it gives you a random map from the game and changes few things like enemy spawns and location textures. The maps are exclusively the same otherwise.The game does look remarkable in HD on a monitor, and saying this without playing the original PS3 version, I feel as if it's probably not too different from how it looked on there. In fact, the game being in ""HD"" should be a given, and not an announcement. The game isn't old. Regardless of their showing off ""High Definition"", the game looks nice, plays nice, plays right, and plays fair. They do give you Steam trading cards, which is probably the best feature added to this Steam port. They include descriptions of what you're fighting, and if you collect them all you can share your love of the game to your friends by showing off your pride with your PJ Monsters badge.Did I mention co-op though? The co-op feature to this game on Steam is undenyably the best way to play. Get a friend to buy the game, or purchase the two-in-one bundle and blast through these baddies with strategic planning, mapping, and basically any other skill you can accomplish in a game of tower defense, with a friend! (I think the maximum was eight players at a time, but I don't have enough friends who play this and the Steam page doesn't explain co-op for the game too well as of this review, so I cannot say for certain).Overall, I feel like with this release there could have been a little more content (I think if they revised the randomly generated levels to actually be randomly generated that would be enough for me) would have been nice. The game delivers what you'd expect and the charm of this game is enough to play it alone. It's not scary, it's not hyper, it's not angry, it's just happy and fun. 9.6/10			"

												Easily the most rewarding and entertaining tower defense game out there!  Each level is extremely well crafted and balanced, with extreme attention to detail commited to every enemy type, tower upgrade, and level layout.  There's a perfect amount of strategic leeway that rewards both careful planning and spontaneous innovation, allowing every level to have designed and meaningful strategies without restricting player freedom.  An almost perfect balance of challenge and fun!  Also, the well-drawn visual aesthetics and relaxing musical score make PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate a pleasure to experience.			"

												I recommend this game for people who are looking for an easy, casual tower defense game. It's very slow pace to strategize where to place your towers and upgrading them. I played this game back on the PS3, and it still has that same addictive gameplay. Time to put more hours to getting everything again. haha This game has local co-op, so you can have two people on a keyboard, or one person on a controller and the other on the keyboard. Fun game. #NostalgicPoints			"

												Played this game for a solid a couple of hours now, and yes, this game gets hard very fast and by i mean very fast is, after playing 3-4 map it gets really hard.after configuring it out, it went smooth from there, but for getting a rainbow, sometimes it's pain in the a**, you have to be perfect to get it and levels & island wont open just by winning level, you have to have a specific number of rainbow.The unit interface felt console like, very simple, in other tower defense game like defense grids or defender's quest are very detailed, this one is simple. If you've played swords and soldiers HD, the interface felt like that (the interface, not the gameplay).The gameplay is fun, but the graphic might turn you off a bit. IMHO, it could go a more detailed version than right now. for an android or iPhone game, it's okay, but for PC, i wish it could be more.The really awesome part is, there's a 2 players mode in one screen, tested it, one with mouse and the other with keyboard, it went smooth but i didn't have anyone to play it with, there's also an online option but haven't test it yet.I'm guessing there will be more hours of gameplay for me, because i barely scratch the surface. There are about 60-70 level in this game.TLDR; Yes, the reviews out there are right, the game is fun but the graphic is a bit turn off for me.			"

												BLECH, this is a completley uninteresting, unimaginative take on tower defense games (which I already think are terrible and embarassing to play).  After playing for about 10 minutes, I realized that there was no reason to continue... boring, played-out mechanics, a clunky interface (you use a character to walk around and service towers, rather than just clicking on them), and just nothing enjoyable about it whatsoever.  The only reason I picked it up was because I wanted to play PixelJunk Shooter (which was great, and NOTHING like this piece of garbage!), and I'm going to be uninstalling it shortly, as I don't even want to see it listed in my steam library.  Two thumbs down.			"

												This is hands down one of the best tower defense strategy games in existence.As tower defense games go, Monsters has transcended several of the plain-old features that players will usually find.For one thing, your tower-building *self* is on the field, and you can get *knocked out* by the monsters swarming for your treasure. As you are moving around building towers, you are also *leveling up* the towers you have already built. So there isn't a moment of sitting there watching monsters just die. There's always something to do.What makes the game phenomenal is that it *feels* like it has been tested to the extremes. No matter how good you think you are at tower defense games, you will be restarting many times on levels you haven't played before. As the game progresses, you can unlock new towers that do interesting things to help you win:The Hive - Sends out small dragonfly-like critters to your location that then kamikaze themselves into both air and ground units.Tesla Towers - Shoots out shockwaves that take down swaths of ground units moving by.Lightning Tower - Hits every monster on the screen once in awhile. Very strong when leveled up to full.The graphics are unique, the music is excellent, and each map is custom designed. It's a 10 out of 10.			"

It's decent, but the novelty of the hero walking/upgrading mechanic wears off quickly.  It makes the gameplay seem just way too slow.  I'm borderline on the recommending it or not vote, certainly glad I didn't pay more than roughly $.75 for it in a bundle.			"

Gameplay is that boring that we nearly fell asleep after 0.3 hours. You can upgrade your towers by doing exactly nothing - amazing. the stategic aspect of the game: there are 3 kinds of towers anti air anti ground an for those who dont have a clue anti both. All in all you got 6 towers where 3 are exactly the same as the ones before - amazing.Totally recommended if you are sick of life or your time.			"

												Wow! Just glanced through the negative reviews for this game and they're incredibly unfair. I was addicted to this game on PS3, and I bought the VITA edition as well. I figured I'd try to get all the achievements in the steam edition too, but this version is a bit harder than the PS3 version due to some addtional content added.Ok, for this game the first thing you need to know is that it can be extremely difficult. You could be doing great on a level and then get destroyed by a wave out of nowhere. This game does require multiple retries to get a PERFECT CLEAR on a lot of the levels. When you retry, you start from the beginning of the level and there is no way to fast forward like some TD games let you do. I have some pretty basic advice for anyone who wants to do well:*Don't worry about getting a PERFECT CLEAR on every level before advancing to the next level. You'll unlock new towers and abilities thtoughout the game which will dramatically help you. Go back and get the PERFECT CLEARS when you have the extras unlocked.  Main item here is the Mine ability. This will save you very frequently *Don't spam the Anti-Air towers. A single AA tower upgraded to max level is probably more effective than 10 AA towers at the lowest level. Plus it's ""free"" to upgrade rather than buy new towers (Free in the sense that it costs no gold)*The slow down (frost) towers are too expensive and are rarely needed. I can rainbow almost every level without them. HOWEVER -  Some enemies are animated as being on fire and they have insanely super speed. Using a frost tower will permanently remove their speed bonus with one hit (and the frost tower can have a big splash radius as well). There are a few waves in the game that are almost impossible without this tower, so keep that in mind if you're having a brutal time with the fire guys. Those would be the main 3 things I think everyone should be aware of. Everything else you can figure out. To summarize the 'review' aspect of this:-This is one of the best TD games ever made. It is extremely balanced and every level can be mastered with practice. -Two player co-op is a blast! -No IAPS or DLC. Everything is included here-Lots of levels and challenges and achievements. Loads of playtime and replayability "

												This game is basically a must-play for everyone. Highly addictive, and very fun to play with another person, as well. The only real negative in this game is there's no way to speed things up, which makes making a small mistake near the end of some of the levels that much more annoying. But yeah.			"

												Great, unique tower defense.  A few things about it are irritating (like having to walk around to pick up money & gems), but I still love it enough to play 180+ hours.  Online co-op works great and rewards coordinated teamwork.  I've played it on a few different platforms, but for me this is the best version.  If you like tower defense, give this a shot.			"

												Probably my favorite tower defense of all time and I've been playing since launch on ps3 several years ago. Monsters is a difficult but rewarding game solo, but really shines in 2 player mode. My only qualm is the game not saving progress for 2 player online when you join, only if you host. That said, once you get the hang of the game in 2 player, replaying earlier maps alone becomes so much easier.6 out of 5 stars.			"

												I own this game on PC and PS3 and I've purchased multiple copies to gift to friends. No matter what, I just keep coming back to it. The gameplay is fairly straightforward tower defense, but it's wrapped in a aesthetically pleasing package with a fantastic soundtrack. I used to use it all the time as a de-stresser. Just sit down, bust out a controller, relax and build some towers and dance on them until they're upgraded.It's a nice simple game, but well-balanced. The difficulty scales really well to challenge even experienced players.			"

												This game is a bit slow, but it is also relaxing and challenging. The slowness helps with the learning curve, giving you more time to figure it out. Sure, some parts can be trial and error, overall I think this game is worth 10 bucks. It's fun, it has co-op, anyone who is a fan of relaxing tower defense games you can give it a try if you want. Maybe you will like it, maybe not. Hit or miss, but hey the soundtrack is pretty good by itself. Complements the play style. Also i bought this game when it was on-sale for $2.49, so it was worth it			"

												Look, there's one type of person who will never get off this game until they've beaten every level with the rainbows, and it's the kind of person who loves learning through trial and error until you can perfect your strategy. I can never get off this game it is simply too addictive. I don't mind repeating the same level over and over again, building only the necessary towers to complete a wave in order to maximize income through interest. If it weren't for this mechanic, I would probably only get 15 hours out of this game, but thanks to interest, I can reach for that fantasy of completely breaking a level to the point where the last 5 waves are nothing. And the boss? Well, the bosses are always weak. That's something I think could be improved. The bosses could be a bit stronger, particularly considering its the last wave and you can sell your used towers for extra cash. Would also love to have an item/level up system that could make your guy move faster, level up towers faster, or makes towers more powerful when you stand around them. Not saying this game couldn't be a bit better still, but it's probably the most addictive TD game I've ever encountered. Totally worth anything you've spent on it.			"

There are many challenging levels in this game, and though it can sometimes become repetitive, it is my favourite tower-defense game. Overall, it's great and I would recommend it.			"
