								     WARNING!!!!!  WARNING!!!!!  WARNING!!!!!  WARNING!!!!!  WARNING!!!!!  WARNING!!!!!  WARNING!!!!!  WARNING!!!!!DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT buy this game.  This game IS broken.  it does NOT work.  It HAD potential but NOT anymore.  If you read the forums on this game the people who got royally screwed like myself, haven't been able to play a full game.  The S.O.B. took our money and didn't come through with the updates.  At one time I remember Interplay Software was one of the best PC video game companies but not anymore.  The yahoo that tried to get it back up has forever tarnished the good name of Interplay.			"

								I have had it with this game.  I bought the game in July of 2014 without reading any reviews.  Boy that was stupid!  This game would be the phatest chess game since I was a kid, but the devs obviously don't care about the game or their customers.  After buying it, I was unable to complete one game without it crashing.  So despite all of the aggravated comments, I thought I'd hold my peace and wait for a patch.  So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and OH the devs promised a patch.  So I waited, and waited, OH the devs had a death in the family.  I couldn't hold that against them.  So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and OH an apology for the delay with another promised patch.  I can't remember what the last excuse was for the delay to that patch, but I waited.  Sorry for the drama, but I'm trying to get across how the purchasing of this game was a complete waste of my money.  It is now the end of January 2015, and I have played my first game since last July.  Ten minutes of gameplay with the lowest graphics settings possible (which I shouldn't have to do b/c my system is top notch) and CRASH!!  If you've read this before purchasing, you've been warned!!

								I really WANT to like this game. I have played the old version and I enjoyed it a great deal. This? Well, it isn't finished. Not even close enough to finished that it should be out in the open, it only brings shame to the people behind it. Is the shame deserved? You be the judge of that but :I have owned this for quite a while, I have never managed to finish a single game. It was so when I got it and back then I there was the problem with the textures going away leaving solid black models on both sides of the board. I looked away from the game for a few months hoping to see some improvement.I came back today, started up a game and after 7 turns it crashed. I can forgive the somewhat clumsy animations, I can forgive losing textures midgame. I can't forgive a chessgame that won't let me play chess. ""BUT I am sure it can be played in 2d"", you then hasten to say. Yes I am sure it could be but there are as good or better freeware options if that is all I wanted to do.			"

								When I noticed that Battle Chess was re-released (this time for PC), I was pleasantly suprised and immediately purchased the game. I've been a fan of chess for thirty years and enjoy the usually quiet, but ""personal"" interaction with other players. Unfortuantely, if you're looking for online multiplayer action, you won't find it here because there's never anybody in the online multiplayer server.			"

								Unfortunately this was a complete waste of money. The game hasn't been finished and is showing no signs of ever being finished and relased -- have a quick look in the Forums and you will see all the complaints (along with 2 or 3 faithful fans that keep saying ""STOP BEING IMPATIENT!"") Well I'm tired of waiting (How long has it been? 6 months? 12? I cant even remember!)  and I'm done checking the Hub every month to see if any announcements have come from the Dev. The Dev can't even be bothered to keep her paying customers informed on the state of the game? Not impressed. I'm done with this game. I recommend you do not buy it.			"

												A horrible game that pretty much sums up what video games have become these days.1. The game is very clunky and wastes a lot of time with unneeded messages. ""A castle is available!"" ""You've completed watching all the animations for X unit!"" It's very annoying.2. Bugs. Glitches. Crashes. This game is full of em'. Do you like the game crashing in roughly 50% of your games? The dev certainly does, because this game does just that.3. The dev has promised several fixes in the future. Well, at least he did A YEAR AGO. Nuff' said.4. Full 3-d animations seem pretty cool until you realize that there's only 3 animations per fight. (Pawn vs Pawn, King vs Bishop, etc.) Would be nice if more was added but that's hoping for a lot from this dev.5. Did I forget to mention that this game crashes a lot?6. Some of the animations make no sense at all. I lost all hope when the my Knight and the AI Queen got into a dancing contest.7. Sonofa... THE GAME JUST CRASHED AGAIN-9,223,372,036,854,775/10 would not play again4/25/2016 EDIT: Played a little today out of sheer curiosity to see if this game got any better...+The game runs MUCH smoother. I actually reached about mid-game this time.+Fewer glitches, thank god. I think all the maps work now. Well, mostly...-Out of the 3 games I played this session, 2 of them crashed when I moved my Rook a couple times...-That stupid ""colorless glitch"" is STILL HERE. What, is this glitch permanent or something?-Needless messages pop up all the time, and they waste a LOT of time. You can't skip them, either.-Animations for battles (The biggest thing about this game) are slow and more ""annoying"" than ""cool"". It'd be better if the animation was just a quick stab or brutal slash with a sword, but no it's instead a long goofy battle between two expendable soldiers...VERDICT: I think I'll wait another 2-3 years before trying this again. That is, if the developer, you know, even cares about this anymore.			"

								I bought this game in Early Access and after many months, it seems like a year now, the pc version is still in about the same state as when I purchased it. Shame on the one dev (Becky) team for even pretending to be working on this game. Game has been dead since day 1.Pros. Game has changed little since its original release in 1988. Graphics are OK until the pieces start disappearing (turn solid black.)Cons. Game hasn't improved much since its original release in 1988.I'll be honest, take a chance only if you like single player and if you can buy it on sale for under  $3, otherwise skip this game.			"

												Although the game still has a few issues, I wanted to give a contrasting positive recommendation.  This is because I've been able to play and enjoy several games of it myself and also to hopefully encourage further development on it.  I can understand and sympathize with the negative reviewers as it was problematic for a long time, but I was glad to see the developer did come back to improve it to the point where it can be an enjoyable experience.  So first, remaining problems I still see:- still see that odd error message but not until I'm finished and exiting the game, so it doesn't affect play anyway- except for the dungeon board, still occasionally see a piece blacken - I've seen knight and bishop do this, but now I'm still able to finish the game even then.- combat vault not activated yet, but not a priority to me- don't find anyone in any to play in the online rooms, so if anyone wants to, let me knowI would love to see:- the above remaining things fixed- trading cards!- maybe some add-ons with more battle scenes, higher levels, etc, more puzzles, new piece sets, boards, etc- online activityI was a big fan of the old one way back then and this is a great update!

Early Access Review
								This is definately the best 3d chess game currently available, and I have tried most of the popular ones.  The pieces are detailed and easily recognizable, the online multiplayer works well (have played 4 online games so far), it just needs a few more players in the lobby.  I have only played against the AI on the 2nd skill level (out of 6), as I am only a beginner at chess.  It's not too difficult as to be frustrating (as some chess engines are), but still somewhat challenging as a way to improve.  I am happy I saved $10 by buying the early release.I recommend disabling the battle camera, setting it to windowed mode, increasing movement speed, disabling the post-processing filter, and adjusting the resolution.  After playing many games, I prefer to have battle animations disabled, although an option for shorter, simpler animations would be very nice.Please add me to friends if you want to play a game (since the lobby is often empty)There are a few minor issues which will hopefully be fixed soon, none of which break the game however.

								FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Not a polished game but what do you expect from early access? I was pleasently surprised with the art direction and how humerous the animations can be and like the variation in them, it can make playing Chess all the more funnier. A major fault however would be how the camera is warped and awakwardly placed at the beginning of combat animations. Also I don't know if it's me being good at this game or not but the difficulty seems rather easy and predictable, even on the higher levels.I wouldn't recommend this game to non-Chess fans, but on the contrary, would to fans alike. Having said that if you're new to Chess or looking for an entry point this may not be a bad place to begin, if you can get past the price tag, but what you're paying for is more than wooden pieces moving across a board.

Being Early access I find this game to be a winner at 9.99.  I would like to see more animations with more humor in future updates.

Early Access Review
								Regretfully, I do have to say, I'm very disappointed about the turnout of this newest version of Battle Chess. My opinion is besides the multiple bugs rapant during Early Access which render the game frustrating to use. (On this side note, the game has only very recently been released, and so bugs are understandable; assuming that they'll be fixed in due time.)Let me start with thegood. The graphics are great! The silly-at-heart battle sequences, as Battle Chess has been known for, are creative and hilarious, and there were a whole lot more of them than in the previous versions which played the same single ones over and over again. The design for the skin meshes is very fancy. (My personal favorite's the Bishop.)And now, ""onward"" to my stark critique.I feel as if the proud traditions of Battle Chess has been spat on and  replaced with a mocking version which claims to know BC's history but doesn't show it well in its performance. This is speaking especially in regards to the programs ability to play chess; its ""artificial intelligence"" (""AI""), if you will. The ability for BC to calculate moves has been severely dumbed down in GoK. Anyone who has played BC from its beginning (I myself grew up with the 1992-3 version, which I hold very dear to) will know just how damn hard the thing is to beat, even at its NOVICE level: Battle Chess's AI saw EVERY possible move and, more so, every possible opportunity to gain and save material points 5, 6, 7 and more moves down the line; it knew how to schemingly find skewers, pins, double-checks and silent evasive maneuvers that no average good player could humanly find within a few seconds (or even minutes) of thinking. BC has beaten several other excellent chess computer programs, including ChessMaster. It was freakin' frustrating as hell! Such frustrating superior ""AI"" has given BC its reputation. Obviously, such a hard e-opponent is designed to teach you to become a more prominent chess player, even if the defeats are diabolical. On the other hand, it was sandbox-easy to beat the Game of King: the powerful tactics as described above simply weren't there. Rather, GoK's tactics, juxtaposed to BC's, were hind-sighted, unholistic and predictable, if not simply lunkheaded. For instance, in a game played at “Nobleman” level, the Black queen captured my pawn on g2, which is undefended by the Bishop on f1 since I moved him out to check the King, and my right-side knight on g1 hasn't previously been moved; an extremely dimwitted blunder on my part; in fact, Battle Chess 1993 was the one to harshly teach such a lesson to me over and over again. I can't even believe that, after years of experience in chess, I would make such a foolish mistake. My restricted undefended Rook on H1 was DOOMED for capture without any immediate opportunity for me to capture back!! Or, was he? The next move Game of Kings played was pawn on f7 to f5 to threaten my other knight on e4. This equally foolish move played by the computr opened up a diagonal line for my own queen on C3 to capture ITS Rook on H8!!! It's almost as if GoK deliberately DID this because it didn't WANT me to lose material points easily. Battle Chess would have never allowed itself to make such a move: unless there was an opportunity to cleverly steal more pieces from me, it would have immediately and mercilessly captured my poor Rook on H1, while leaving none of its own pieces up for danger without re-capture. I thought for a second that perhaps it was some sneaky way to expose my own queen for capture. Hey, after all, Battle Chess is known for its surprise attacks, right? Unfortunately for me, surprise attack against my queen was rarely the case. After I did indeed move her up to H8 to capture its Rook, Game of Kings didn't even seem to bother to try to capture my queen back after 4 or 5 moves. Worst of all, and this is the best part, ladies and gentleman: the black queen never took my easy defenseless Rook on H1! All of this was the ""Nobleman"" level, which was supposed to be Game of King's 4th level of difficulty. I simply closed GoK in dire frustration, knowing that I wasn't playing against Battle Chess; I really wasn't.I haven't played GoK's hardest level, but I can only imagine that it's barely as good as the original BC Novice level, let alone their level 1, and BC had 10 levels excluding the novice one! I understand that there have been negative reviews in regards to BC's extreme difficulty, pointing to the fact that it's been TOO frustrating that players could never beat it. People obviously want something playable so that they’ll actually buy it. Understood.  On the other hand, I don't think that should be any reason to take out all those difficult levels altogether. Those original difficult levels 1-10 should still be there, in addition to the incorporation of easier playable levels. Again, I can't emphasized this enough: they were what defined the Battle Chess series!!I've covered the main part of my review, but the ""AI"" is far from the only thing needed be mentioned.The tutorial is a rather cheesy duplication of the one made in the 1992-3 version. It offered nothing new in explaining chess, and then the mediocre voicing of the characters were pretentious, trite, unenthusiastic and simply uninteresting. The ""sumo-""sized rook, for example, spoke in a rather superficial European accent (Italian?), and one would not feel the threat of his almost-monotonic dialogue, ""If you don't understand, I'll smash you."" (In the original 1992-3 tutorial, the rook had a rasp, crass and intimidating voice that varied in pitches as he emphasized the different words of that same dialogue, which excellently portrayed the sense of threat that he means to.)Speaking of which, isn't the Rook supposed to be a tower that transforms into a wretched stone beast, not a tactless obese ""Sumo"" guard?? Again, another proud tradition of Battle Chess which has been broken, since in all of its previous versions the rook indeed was a stone beast.Finally, another BC tradition broken, minor though not insignificant, is the color coding: it appears that OldeSkuul has switched the colorsaround so that red is assigned the BLACK pieces and blue the WHITE pieces. I contactedtheir FB page, and BurgerBecky responded that she will create an update with the option to switch the colors around. So far, no such update was made. (I'm guessing it's on queue to be worked on after the bugs.)In conclusion, while it's pleasantly enjoyable for a pastime, Game of Kings is as good as any decent chess program and is nowhere near as good as the Battle Chess it’s supposed to be an upgrade from. To save my pride for the chess program that has taught me so much about chess since I was7, I can't call this Game of Kings version ""Battle Chess"". The 1987, 1988 and 1992-3 versions are the ones I feel rightful to call Battle Chess. However, take heart, my word is only the unofficial opinion of one user in the minority, and it's not to discourage folks from buying it. As far as anyone's concerned, it does after all do the job nicely. Furthermore, most of the younger generation will probably not be able to relate to anything I'm saying, since this is probably their first exposure to the BC series. Finally, I'm aware OldeSkuul is putting much effort in making updates to the game. There's always a chance to turn an unofficial negative opinion around. ;)p. s. I want to extend a note of gratitude to Olde Skuul and express how much I appreciate them having taken on the project to finish Game of Kings when it couldn’t be finished by Subdued Software. I was aware what financial trouble they had to go through to finally gained enough to open the option for online play. Thank you greatly for the time, effort and devotion!!			"

												I so wanted this. I loved the original, and the second I saw this I stupidly bought it without looking into it. Well, don't, it's not finished. The menus dont do anything, whether it is changing volume, speed of movement, or something as unnecessary as taking back a move, none of them do anything. Music plays constantly over the top of fight animations, even with the music for the fight playing underneath it. Not that that would make too big a difference as the frame rate issues cause animation to be jolty and out of sync. The clash of metal after swords are drawing back for their second strike is a little off putting to say the least. Still it would be worse if the continuously over the top music didn't nearly drown it out, and as the afore mentioned menus not working issue, you can't quiten it down.Thank goodness Steam now offer refunds, as that's the best part about the whole experience of playing this game.I so hope they fix this to be playable. I want to play this, and what I played of it, it looks like it could be fun and humourous. If they do fix it, I will probably purchase it again. In its current state, however, stay away. Go and play the original in all its 8-bit glory in too high a resolution to be able to see what on earth is going on instead.			"

												This is a great game but still buggy.  Although I have given it a thumbs down I do recomending it based on the potencial it has.  As chess is a game one tends to put time and thought into it can be very troubling when the system fails.  Anyone interested in the game should keep track of this feedback thread as means of deciding weather or not to purchase it as I did. It tends to ""stop working"" periodically so you have to save freequently.  I have noticed that when you save and exit the ""Battle Chess has stopped working"" window will comes up as you exit the game.I have been playing with the traditional peices as the animated figures did not work the last time I tried them.  They had a tendancy to fragment or vanish.  They are fantastic when they work so this is truly a shame.Devs.  Fantastic game!  Pleas keep working on it.			"

I still remember getting my copy of the original Battle Chess as a young boy and being fascinated by finding out what all the different animations were ... being amazed by the humour behind it (not knowing at the time how much of it was basically Monty Python-esque) and playing against my friends for hours ... Some of the combat animations still make me giggle today when I think of them .... ahh childhood memories ... I bought this early access over the weekend with hesitant optimism ... I spent a while playing around with it and the game definitely has promise ... some of the transitions bug out a little bit ... and some of the cuts are a bit jarring ... but the foundations are there for a faithful sequel to the original ... the humour is there (even if some of it feels a little bit forced) ... and there are now multiple combat animations for each 'combination' of pieces! ... What I would love to see is them making it a bit more adult (more blood! more brutal combat animations) even if that is an option you have to select ... and also additional character sets (medieval is already there ... but what about fantasy, futuristic, etc ... how awesome would that be!) ...I can't comment on the AI yet as I played a game on easiest just to have a look around at how the whole thing fitted together ... but all chess games live or die by their AI so I hope that in this day and age we have a great AI ...All in all I think they are headed in the right direction ... and hopefully they will be able to smoothen out the bumps and make this a game that I will be playing in years to come ...

								(original review) it's a fun game already, and i've only played it like an hour or 2.  however in that 2 hours it crashed twice, no glitches, only problems i had were crashes and the white chess pieces turned black after a turn or two. (months later review) well, now i'm here about 8 months later if not longer, this being my first early access game, i am very disappointed. after burger becky stealing all of our hard earned money not thinking of anyone but herself, she has abandoned us all. saying oh my mother died, (next week) oh grandpa died (next week) oh had to clean up mothers death (next month) oh had to help grandpa and in his coffin. give me a ♥♥♥♥ing break becky. after 8 months or longer and no word, none. not one, you say oh well i will patch it up, yeah okay. (towards the end of 2015) oh burger becky gave us a patch? yeah i was dreaming. Too bad she's just a common thief, well becky, since everyone died, who are you burying now?

								Crashes often. Graphics are mostly good, but some things (such as the rook's hammer) have notoriously low-resolution textures.Game engine is quite stupid, which is inexcusable for a modern-day chess game. I made a few egregious blunders while playing on the second-hardest difficulty, and the computer ended up with a king, queen, and rook versus my king. I gave up getting it to checkmate me, and maneuvered myself into a position so that the computer could checkmate me in one move. It didn't. You've got a queen *and* a rook, how hard can it possibly be to finish the job?! I ended up resigning since the computer seemed incapable of actually performing a checkmate.Hopefully they clean it up before release, but as it stands it's only a pretty toy.			"

								REVIEW EDIT: After six months, there is ONE developer remaining on this project, and an update hasn't been publically released in close to three months. The game itself is still fun as I posted below, but it's FAR from a finished product. I would advise everyone to stay away until Becky and the team release a COMPLETE version. While still in its beta stage, Battle Chess is a great throwback to the classic 3D0/Dos classic game of medieval strategy. The 3D pieces are well-animated, with a variety of animations for each capture (my favorite being ""Boogie Knight"", where rather than engaging in outright combat, the knight and queen engage in a dance-off, after which the knight snaps the queen's neck), rather than the single one offered us by the original, or by recent attempts like Battle Vs. Chess. The music fits with the medieval atmosphere, and the voice acting is... okay, though I honestly miss the whiny pawn from the original. At this moment there are stil. a significant number of bugs and crashes to deal with, but as previously mentioned, the game is still in beta, and the developers are taking input from the community as they address each. If you can look past the relatively minor bugs, $10 is a GREAT price for this early access game, especially if you are, like I, a fan of the original Battle Chess.			"

								Saw this, had to buy it. Great game! Couldn't find an online opponent but I'm sure that'll change once Steam (pun intended) picks up. Game has crashed on me a few times, sometimes the chess pieces turn all black (losing defining colors, kinda looks like Noob Saibot from Moral Kombat) but it is fun to time travel back and think of Interplay's original incarnations of the game, and see this. I hope this does well, as I can tell that, while there are some kinks to be worked out, master craftsmen were at work putting this together. If you like chess, get this - Good buy. Also found that crashes occur when you change the stage to anything but inside the castel :\			"

This game would be so awesome if they fixed the characters turning black... so far I've played three games, crashed once (on a draw, king vs. king); but every single time I play the characters turn black (seems related to another piece of that type being taken). I played this back on DOS in the 80s and it was awesome; I would hate to see this tarnish the legacy in an unfinished state. Also would be great with mods and additional animations + character themes / styles.			"

I could be wrong about that, the Dev was silent from November 2014 until the last updates earlier this year......Don't waste the 10 dollars, the game is cool and brings back memories of chess games past, but I have yet to be able to finish a single game.  From my understanding there is something that eats up memory till your PC has none left to give and then the game crashes.Dev updates are months apart, Dev goes completely silent in between updates, so you never really know if there is going to be a next update.

Just check the ""View Stats"" section of anyone who has gotten achievements in Battle Chess: Game of Kings and you'll see what the result of the problem is: the game awards the individual achievements not as you get them, like 99% of games on Steam with achievements, but collectively after you exit the game or switch to online mltiplayer (almost all of the time, nobody is online for multiplayer, either, so good luck getting those achievements any time soon). Also, it is currently impossible to get the Masterful Monarch achievement after completing 300 games against the computer. It just won't award it.			"

								I grew up playing Interplay games and out of all of them the Battle Chess series was my FAVORITE! It captivated me when I was young because of the animated fights and the queens using deadly magic. It also taught me critical thinking, planning and how to read opponents (usually my little brother bwahaha) and so on.This game, even in it's early stage, is a fantastic representation of the Battle Chess series and how it's evolved into a beautiful 3D chess board it is today.Ok enough ranting. I'm just so happy it's alive and here! PS - I'm so glad the animated tutorials are back! So hilarious and informative about how to play and the history of chess! That's what got me into it as a kid when I played the CD-Rom version for Windows '95!			"

								There isn't anything to love about this game. The game description advertises that ""it took 2,000 years for someone to make chess better!"" If this is the case, I'd rather be stuck in the stone age than play this game for an additional hour. Save your $10. What's to hate about this game? The animations seemed like a great opportunity to introduce some gruesome carnage to the game - however, this is a completely missed opportunity. It's quite slow and the combat scenes leave you wanting for something more - more blood, more action, more... everything. Within 20 minutes, you'll probably be pressing the 'skip' button for both the character animation walking scenes and combat scenes.I purchased this game with the thought that it might introduce a storyline - something that would make this unique. Wasn't to be found, or I completely missed it all together. I played the game for 20 minutes - maybe, I didn't give it the chance it deserved - but within that time I found a bug: my characters clothing were changing colors to the opposing team (from white to black) which made it difficult to distinguish my pieces. I love Chess... but this game... at best is terrible. Suggestions might include: allow the use of the ESC button to quit the animations (fast-track) in game and to exit out of the menus. This is a poorly designed game from the ground up. Wish I had my money back. I'm not even sure if you could pay me $10 to play this game again - regardless what 'version' or build stage this game is in.  "

								While I realize this game is still early access, there are many issues which the devs need to address. First and foremost is that the game crashes frequently; I have yet to finish a complete game without it hanging and crashing. Less catastrophic but no less annoying are the instances where the textures do not load on pieces, rendering them in all black, and the fact that the music volume slider in the options seems to have zero impact on the actual volume of the music.For a game I loved so much years ago, I had high hopes for this return and modernization. So far, it has been a disappointment.			"

								The updates are so frequent that I have forgotten when the last one was.  Game appears to be at a standstill with no update from the developer as to what is happening with it.  There are many bugs that have not been addressed with no support for quite some time......has potential but not sure if it will even be finished.*12/6/2014Four months later...........my review still stands. Not a single update has occurred since my review of this Early Access full of broken promises. Twice the developer has said update coming (with dates) and nothing ever materializes.  Then we get another delay from the dev......if the long awaited update was in the hands of beta testers, what's the holdup?  The dev is running out of lies!*1/28/2016Been uninstalled from the library for a while.  Decided to give it another go because there was news of updates and  game had moved from Early Access to retail for a whopping $30.  Got my first achievement in a year and a half and BOOM...game froze.  I dream of Battle Chess Game of Kings and have nightmares instead!			"

												Don't buy this game. It's not ready to be sold. As much as I wanted this game to hold promise and be my goto client for online matches. It is too buggy and does not work right. The developer appears to be doing nothing to fix the large amount of bugs that are still in this game. When you play white and your chess pieces turn black it gets very confusing quickly. Musical bugs, UI bugs... Some of them can be played through if you are patient, but a lot of them cannot.			"

Early Access Review
								I love old school Battle Chess and this is definitely promising, but it's currently plagued with crashes. I'll update this review as performance improves.[Update 4/15/14] Still crashes every game. Gets further with blue/red than black/white. Cannot recommend.[Update 1/26/15] Decided to give this another try. Game ran very smoothly at top settings, then in mid-game individual pieces would start losing their textures and turning black, then... crash. This has been in Early Access for a rather long time with little to show for it.[Update 2/12/15] Signs of life! After the latest patch, the game can be completed without glitches under some setup conditions (primarily as Blue vs Red in the Dungeon setting). However the game still suffers from a variety of crashes, especially when playing Black/White, or starting any game with CPU as first player (unless character models are disabled and regular pieces are used.... but that's not really Battle Chess). This is a start, however, and if the fixes start coming in a more timely fashion my recommendation on this could turn around.The Nice: Nice aesthetic, mostly true to the original look. 3 varied environments. Smooth animation with good options for movement speed. Simple effective in-game interface.The Meh: Mediocre graphics. Animations have some variety but still rapidly become repetitive. Music is ok but animation music sometimes clashes with soundtrack. All 4 colors have identical faces and wardrobes, varying only in color, which is a lost opportunity in my view. Pieces have impatient shuffling animations to try to add some life but the sounds become annoying.The Crap: No controller support. Needlessly slow and ugly menus. Lacking in customization options. Crashety crash crash crash.			"

								I got this early access game as part of a gift.### Pros:- Nice graphics (3D environment, animations) for a chess game ^^- Single or multiplayer game- Training area (but the latter should contain more puzzles)- Steam Achievements- I love the sneaky/sly Queen behaviour when capturing pieces### Cons:- It often crashes during a game on my windows7-x64 PC … a really bad point for chess software since a game can be very long in theory- It should be nice to switch between 3D and 2D piece depictions during a game (e.g. 2D for thinking and 3D for capturing pieces, if desired)- As many others, I don’t like the design of some character (knights look like other pieces, the rook is quite singular but please remove that ugly beer belly)- More skins should be available for the 2D (standard) pieces, and the latter are not exactly centered on the cases- I can run most recent games but I have to disable features (anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering) on this game => optimization problems that should be fixed in future.### Conclusion:There are currently too many cons to recommend this game … but it could become more interesting by fixing these issues.10/20/edit : the crash issue can be solved by disabling anti-aliasing & anisotropic filteringhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/200150/discussions/0/616188473109203291/ "

								I won't lie, I had second thoughts about this game after I read some of the other reviews and heard about the lack of updates and such.  But when I saw how short the creators fell of their Kickstarter goal, I felt pity and decided to buy the game anyway, figuring my money might help out in some way.As it turns out, the game is actually pretty fun... most of the time.  Sure... the computer is agonizingly hard to beat, even on the easier difficulties.  And I found it a little awkward at first, that they switched the sides of the red and blue teams.  And certain pieces tend to turn completely black after a while, for some reason.Nevertheless, I've still managed to have a pretty good time playing this game and have only had it crash on me once so far.  (That particular match wasn't going so well for me anyway.)  I don't even mind the lack of updates either, as I know how hard it is to make a good 3D game, and what it feels like to not be able to do as much work on it as you want to.  (But that's kind of a long story.)So, yeah... it's got problems, but it's also got potential.			"

However, I have renewed hope in the games future due to the fact a new update has gone in about a week ago. Because of this fact, I am also thinking of buying another copy for my brother.

								Battle Chess: A Game of Kings  is an impressive remake of the original battle chess released back in 1980 on the Nintendo Entertinment System. The 3d graphics are appealing to the 3d eye. There is no movement animations, but there is battle animations. My favorite animation, is the one where the pawn acts as Geoffery, and is poisoned by a drink in a golden chalace. I appreciate on how the game depicts its pieces. The knight, is actually a knight. My only problem with this game is that, it is very unbalanced in the way that it is turn-based. Meaning whoever gets the first move has the upperhand. This game has been out for about 30 years, and no one has fixed this. The ♥♥♥♥, nintendo? Also, the only female character, the queen, is a ♥♥♥♥ing mary sue. It can move in any direction, whereever it wants. Overall, it's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ 9/10			"

												I'm recommending this game based on what it sought out to do and how well it performed despite certain circumstances with the developer. Bugs aside, this game brings an air of fun and visual appeal much as the original did. The art style is excellent and the aesthetics make for the most enjoyable experience I've had playing chess in a long while.While buggy, it's important that projects like these are fostered and supported. I encourage others who have tried this game to take a moment to give it a recommendation. This will send a message to the developer and others that risks like this can, and should, be taken.			"

								I'll give it a thumbs up but it's a weak thumbs up.  The cutscenes are painfully long and once you've seen one once you may just feel like skipping over it to get back to your game.  I only played one full game with the animations on.  After that I turned them completely off an just played chess.  These terribly long animations take you out of the game.  I would suggest some short animations on the board which do not require a cut-scene.  I love playing animated chess but i don't want to watch a short film everytime I take a pawn.Also the game crashes in about 1/4 of the games I play.  From what I understand this issues is getting better.I only weakly recomend this game because it's still fun to just play chess without animations, and it's early access status still excuses the issues.  However if there is no method for trimming down the cut-scene times implimented in the final release, I will change this to a thumbs down.			"

Early Access Review
								The battles between pieces are entertaining, and the graphics are acceptable. It is a true sequel to the original AMIGA classic, in name and in spirit. As it is in early access it is a bit rough around the edges...there are a few crashes here and there but it all works surprisingly well. There are several animations for each piece and side, and some are hilarious. The queen is just as cocky as she was in the original =) Hopefully there will be content updates, maybe new skins etc. All in all, though, it is worth what they are asking for sure.			"

Early Access Review
								I remember playing this game on my first ""real"" computer which was a Tandy 1000 EX.  I loved it!  As soon as I saw this released on steam, I budgeted the cash to pick up two copies (my son LOVES chess and as a chess club member in school, I figured he'd really like it).  This game does not disappoint.  I love it as does he!  About the only issue I have is that it seems to crash for both of us on a fairly regular basis.  Given its early access, I can’t really consider this an “issue” as a big part of early access is to get community input into the development of a new game while it’s still being actively worked on.  I’m sure the bugs will be ironed out and the game will be stable and provide for plenty of hours of entertainment.If you like chess, I strongly recommend picking this game up, you won’t be disappointed. :) "

Early Access Review
								I loved the idea or remaking another battle chess as I feel this genre has so much untapped potential. So far with this I only saw a couple battles and they were not as fun as original even with the new graphics (personal opinion). I mean remember when the guy in the original got pretty much all his limbs cut off and was hopping on one foot. Anyways they also seemed to be a little tame in the kill factor in my opinion. I'm not a big fan of the big fat rook peice and the queen poisoning him wasn't my favorite battle. I found the music got a bit annoying and also when other music came on like the battle of the knight verses queen they jumbled together. I miss the castle peices that used to smash people and leave their brains on the floor but hey can't fault them for trying to be different. I would love to give a better review but after about 12 moves the game crashed, and I got a little fed up. On the other hand I had a taste and ended up buying battle chess on gog.com and steam has a pretty sweet game called check vs mate which was really well done. I will check back on this game from time to time and see if i can complete an actual full game and maybe get more of a chance to view more battles.			"

								Very good chess game, Bit of variety with the skill challenges that are included, however would be good to have a few more, or even something to do with historic chess matches such as the matches versus the deep blue computer. Looks great with both characters and traditional pieces. Less and less crashes which is good. Highly reccomended to any chess fan.			"

								Very nice to have the old Battle Chess back. I am sure everything will be smooth by the final release. I have had a few drops and crashes, but it still is what it is, Battle Chess.			"

								Keeps crashing during game play (at least 6 times within an hour). Also the graphics go gray several times while charaters are walking on the dungeon board. Other than that the game looks good and plays good (except previously mentioned). Loved the 1st ver. alot played it for years. Glad I came across this one. 4/10 for now 10/10 if they all the bugs out. Will be a really cool game when it gets patched and all the bugs worked out.			"

Early Access Review
								While still in Alpha I have had quite a bit of fun with the game.Pro: The animations are fun to watch (I hope more come out in the future they are awesome)  Due to the animations I have been able to get friends who know how to play chess, but are meh about sitting down playing, to actually play again.Con: I've had one crash so far and the Vault is not working properly yet.Thoughts: They can likely do very well in the future offering up alternative DLC for skins & animations, ex: Civil War.  Although that would require almost as much work as the game so far (due to all the animations) so wouldn't expect it to be cheap, still might be worth it for more variety. "

								I know the game is under development. But as many have said, don't use cutscenes. Rather just make animations.Make a game like Battle Vs. Chess (Steam) but with the multiplayer part.I still haven't played an online game in this game, so I guess not many are playing online atm.			"

								After 18 months of waiting for this game to be completed, I am giving up.  This game has been abandoned and I am forced to change my recommendation to stay away.  It's a shame that this game was never finished properly.If the DEV ever finishes this game and it works, I'll change my review back to positive.			"

								Battle Chess--why did you crash mid game?  Was it because I had just captured your destitute queen?  Ohhhhh how dirty you play, Battle Chess!  Hmmmm---will this review ever be completed?   I guess that depends on if  Battle Chess can make it through a round without crashing!  I'm ready, Battle Chess---the question is, are you?			"

								Ok, Whats up with the computer doing the same move back and forth over and over when it has dozens of possible moves.  Is that a programmers attempt to force the player to give up in bordom?  Really lame!			"

Early Access Review
								The Game brings faith players back to MS-DOS Battle Chess and puts a modern touch to the game. There are some key features to the world of Chess that is missing such as a option to request/offer a draw instead of having to force the draw. It came down to King and Rook vs King and Rook which is a draw any computer should take. Instead it forced it for me to exchange the rooks to force the draw.  The game design is nice textures smooth except for a minor glitch and one game crash.  The game does everything that chess player would want, Yet there needs to be more meat to the bone, After seeing all the fights the characters become annoying and old fast and just get in the way and I found my self switching to the classic pieces to avoid confusion. There needs to be more of a challenge as the AI seems to be the same on all levels, It grabs what it can and has no ambition and the AI certainly is no Deep Blue.  So once you get passed the New feel, beat the AI and compelete the Skill challenges there is nothing to keep a player from coming back, the multiplayer feature is empty of players, I left it on for a week and no players came in except for 1 admin to see if I was a bot.  So although this game as a lot of sentimental value to me and I'm sure to so many others, unless some major re-vamping is done to the AI and more added to the game, I stick with my chessmaster 10 to tutor me further,  It will be perfect for beginners and new players however more seasonal players and above will just see it smile play couple of games and move on.The AI never tries to win and just always pushes to draw - and that sums it up for the game. It does the bare minimum leaving a game with a lot of potential, left wanting...I love Battle Chess but feeling Dissapointed  - 7/10			"

								This game has great potential and I strongly encourage you to purchase it and support the developer. You don't see actual effort put into things all that much these days. And I'm glad to witness an exception now and again.Battle Chess, at least for now, feels like a strictly newbie-oriented chess game. The emphasis is mostly put on model/animation variety. It sure does look pretty, animations flow well enough for the most part. Fully-animated tutorial gives you some basic ideas about the rules and history, as well as an actual impression that enthusiasm is strong with these ones. If the developers aim to keep adding new piece textures, boards, clash animations etc. this may one day become the best casual chess game on steam. Not that there's all that much of competition, but you get the idea. What I'd really like to see added to the game is two things - chess-puzzles and some reenactments of history's professional arena matches. Or at least the first one - easy enough to implement, serves a clear noob-friendly purpose, all that good stuff.Some of the minuses I've encountered so far:1) Music volume slider doesn't seem to be affecting anything. Sound FX, on the other hand, does.2) Bishop's voiceover work in the tutorial sucks. A lot. Coincidently, it's also the shortest one of them all. Was it really so hard to get some old dude to do the role that you had to keep it short with what you got?All in all - you'll get about what you'd expect. Once again, I strongly encourage you to support the developer - it sure is worth the money.			"

								Looks great and I also loved the original. When it works plays great too but constant crashes, and have yet to complete a single game. Save feature also requires you to exit each time. Crashes are so bad its barely playable. Appreciate its under development but think it is wrong to charge for something that is currently not fit for purpose in my view. People flagged these crashes 12m ago, and here we still are.			"
