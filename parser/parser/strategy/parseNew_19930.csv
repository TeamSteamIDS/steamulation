												The negative Steam reviews here are mostly about the technical issues, but my problem is with the game itself. It's a competent little city builder with a nice art-direction and animations, but the gameplay is unfortunately just too simple, repetitive and unchallenging, especially if compared to the previous Settlers titles. It's not a bad game, just ""too casual"". Definitely enjoyable for many, especially younger gamers, gamers with lives or those who actually prefer the simplicity.

												The Settlers - Rise of an Empire is one of my favorite RTS games and it is a prominent part of the game series.I am the ""builder type"", and this game lets me play my style: mine all the resources, upgrade everything, create the biggest army possible and crush the enemy. After the overcomplicated The Settlers - Heritage of Kings this may look too simple, because you only need to care a few basic things to run the economy well. The game also took away the control of the settlers, you only can move your army and your hero. I like the idea to place a building, and the people will do their work automatically. It's logic: if I place a mine, I would create miners anyway. You still can explore the map with the hero of your choice, they both have passive and active capabilities. The game is well balanced, looks beautiful IMO and I also purchased the OST because it is a masterpiece. The multiplayer is completely dead, but it still worth buying because of the campaign, it has a great story. I could play hours on each map and with the Gold Edition you also get the expansion. 10/10 would buy again.			"

												I like this game, it lets you build your empire the way you want it to be no fixed postions for buildings the only thing i really hate is the mouse edge scrolling its really bad and pretty much none existant when you get through the campaign abit. the campaign seems to have good missions and they are pretty good and long although im not to sure about the time it takes to do some missions.So to sum it up this is a good game its just that the camera that is the problem.

												Adore this game except for the thieves. They get caught very easily and the enemy thieves always manage to avoid my guards somehow. On the plus side, I really love building up my little towns to bustling cities and going out to claim land for my kingdom. I don't see the point of the citizens getting married, as it doesn't seem to affect population in any way, but if it keeps them happy, I'm willing to throw a festival every now and then. I think this game has a great blend of strategy and warfare coupled with governing a town. Overall, I really like this game.			"

												Rise of an Empire is my favorite release from the Settlers series. From the resource gathering to surviving harsh winters to creating armies & conquering territories, this game does it all very well. There is much to do within the game including multiplayer, custom scenarios and a rather intruiging caimpaign.  If you are a true City Builder/Strategy fan, I highly recommend this classic.			"

												Updated: I was able to up the amount on default video memory thru the BIOS to 512MB. This has allowed me to play the game now.  If you are a well versed computer user running windows 8 then you should be able to manage this fix. If not i would stear away from this great game until a fix is released to the masses. 20 Dollars down the Drain. I really was looking forward into getting back into this game played it allot back when it came out.  Well after installation when I went to run it I was unable to even load into the game. I constantly recieve a memory issue. This was the first and last time i will not check the forums before a purchase of an older title.  It looks to be an issue to do with windows 8 and any video card over 2gigs of memory. If they fix this i look forward to enjoying this game as I did in the past. If not i only hope they will refund those of us whom cannot run this game on a newer system. They should also put some kind of warning into the description so newer users do not run into this issue.			"

												It's good, but it's not quite ""The Settlers: Heritage of Kings"".While I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good stratagy based game, I would probably point them to Heritage of Kings first. For replayability, I got to the final level and beat the game and enjoyed the time i played up to the point that I beat the game. After that the very thought of going on the play the expansion pack was enough to drive me away from the game.Purely based on the fact that the game is good... But it's not THAT good that I would want to go back to it after completing the initial game.			"

												The original? Fun. Fun, fun, fun, fun. Great Stratagy game: fluid game play, looks good, a good hearty amount of castle sim with albeit sloppy, chunky, painful, but ""bearable"" combat. A definate play atleast once, but it falls very short of what the they ""said"" it would be. The Expansion? Dumb. Stupid. Actually gets RID of content. Adds very little. Gets rid of ""Free play mode."" There's almost no online community and the two games are seperate of each other and there isn't any map editor provided.Overall? An on sale purchase. It's really good, but why would anyone buy an expansion that TAKES AWAY content? Horrible. Dumb. Stupid.			"

												Don't buy this game if you plan to play it on a Laptop.Most gaming laptops have 2 graphics cards.If your BIOS doesn't let you disable the integrated one completely you can't play Settlers 6.Setting the right graphics card in the graphics card software will on some laptops (f.e. MSI Gaming Series) for some reason not do the trick.Otherwise you will only get an error popup that tells you that your graphics card has less than 70 MB Memory, because it automatically uses the onboard graphics chip wich has of course no own memory at all, but uses shared one.Thank you Ubisoft for another dumb annoying thing... As if your DRM Addiction wouldn't be enough pain in the ***.			"

												You are mostly gathering resources, growing your settlement, expanding your territory, and fulfilling various scenario tasks, all within a usually very creative map that includes valleys, river crossing, mountain passes, and other fun strategic stuff. Maybe half of the scenarios end with you destroying another faction, but this is definitely not a military-focused game.The good:-Very solid game engine: never a bug or crash after 5 months of playing on Windows Vista 64-bit with a GeForce 9800GTX and graphics settings maxed-out-Immersive period graphics and another solid ambient period music score by Dynamedion (Best German Soundtrack 2007)-Creative maps/scenarios that are generally not too difficult and typically take around 3 hours each-Vegetarian rating allows you to replay old maps using a different strategy-Active user community creating custom maps for youCons:-Somewhat restrictive camera angle-Less complex than other similar games (Anno 1701), although what it lacks in complexity in the game engine, I'd say it makes up for in the variation and creativity of the maps/scenarios.

The people have personality and your heroes are (often) useful. Combat is simplistic but satisfying. The story is solid enough without being melodramatic. Runs solid as a rock. I also enjoy the map variety. It's a great game!			"

												Played this 8 years ago when I was a young kid. Bought it a week ago on Steam. Had to cry because it reminded me of my childhood.Its a very good game. The graphics are wonderful for its release date (April 2008). The Settlers 5 was more like an military simulation but Settlers 6 brought back the wonderful Settler feeling, also introducing territories which make the game more complex and even better. The mechanics are nice, but the settler limit and the military limit is a little low, making it difficult to conquer enemy bases sometimes. It features 3 military units: Swordsmen, Archer and siege machines, which are divided into siege rams, siege towers and catapults, each of them featuring a special ability (Rams are effective against gates, etc...).All in all it was a great game when it was released and is still a nice game. Performance is also great (I run it at 3000fps :D)!I would totally recommend buying this if you like the ""the settler""-series!			"

Instead you just have resource buildings which are still quite cool and what i excspected but there are No HOUSES IN THE GAME AT ALL! (That is bad for a 'City Builder) but you may be wondering ,why has this game rated up , well i did that because i like the game even if it doesnt have ANY HOUSES.i Like This game Allot Because It Has a simple but alright army system i love the map because i rarely see anything like that anymore and i like how the game works. but still im gonna do good , bad and in the middlegood: nice map's good trading fun campaignquite allot of things to do and fun!In The Middle: alright graphicsalright fighting mechanicsalright soundBad;Ai Can sometimes glitch a bitmultiplayer is emptyNO ♥♥♥♥IN HOUSES FOR A CITY BUILDER			"

												This game is by far unique in its own way, perhaps it even deserves its own genre; it contains elements of complex economy and simplified military in a reasonable ratio for a player seeking to focus on economy challanges with minor military role to make the game more realistic. The graphics are nicely done in a cartoonish style compared to other games of the series. Campaigns are fun, but needs more scenarios; I only wish there were more community maps or a steam workshop if the game was more famous.			"

												The game doesnt work on most laptops, and Ubisoft is a company that could care less about their customers. They will never release an update to make the game work, its a waste of money, like most of their s*** games.			"

												Pretty good, but needs more freeplay maps, and just more features when it comes to rule your kingdom (like mass genocide). 7.2/10			"

												I'm sure the game is very nice, but if you have a graphics card with more than 2 gigs of memory it won't allow you to raise the model texture above the lowest settings since the game engine can't recognize values higher than 2gig. So if you're cool with cruddy, fuzzy textures then go for it. If not, then save your money.			"

												Ugh I was so excited to play this game because I used to play it along time ago that I downloaded it without reading the comments. Now everytime I try to start it an error messege appears. Ive tried every solution to try and fix it to make it work but to no avail. What a waste of money that i could have spent on a game that actually works.			"

												I came.  I saw.  I mastered this/these game(s) in an instant.   Not a good thing.Appealing visuals are about the only thing going on for this one.  After that it's just straight up repetition.  I honestly don't know what else to say other than that it has zero replay value.			"

												CoolI did such a lame review cause I didn't feel like putting a massive paragraph, but you need to write something for it to work :/.EDIT:I will warn you that if you have anything better than a toaster, the game is so old that it will think you can't run textures on Ultra... So it won't let you.			"

												New to the Settlers series, very disappointed.  This is all the zoom out I get?  Be prepared to spend your entire game scrolling around trying to figure out what's going on.   UbiSoft's recommendation is to play on the lowest resolution so you get more zoom.  really?  Even then, it's still barely enough zoom out to see your marketplace and part of the castle.  Are all the Settlers games like this?			"
