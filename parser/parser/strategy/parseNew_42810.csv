												You have in front of you the final update and ultimate achievement of the Europa Universalis I/II formula. You see, when in 2007 EU3 came out, it was... bad. I mean, REALLY bad. It was broken. Featureless. A big step back from EU2, that came out in 2001. The first big expansion of EU3 came out THREE MONTHS later. And even after another one in 2008 (when the game was repackaged under the ""EU3 Complete"" name) it was a disappointing game, coming after the historical flavour of EU2.So in 2009, 8 years after EU2, the team behind the AGCEEP mod for EU2 released this ""sidequel"" to EU2: it had widescreen resolution, it had 10,000 historical events, it had major tweaks to the rules and the AI, it had a better, more streamlined UI, it had better mod support. It was, in that particular context, the ""real"" EU3 (more like a EU2.5).So, it's a great grand strategy game. But.BUT.But in 2010, EU3 saw the release of another TWO expansions, and the game became good at first, and excellent after the last one (now it was repackaged again under the ""EU3 Chronicles"" monicker). Yes, the historical flavour was still lacking compared to For The Glory, but in every other aspect, it was now a superior game.So I still recommend For The Glory in 2014, when even Europa Universalis IV exists? Yes, even just for a trip into history of strategy gaming. If you want to try Europa UNiversalis I or II, skip those and get For The Glory instead.(UPDATED NOTE: The last patch is actually from the 29 December 2013: link http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/ftg-1-3-beta-patch-unified-thread.670289/#post-16633623ORIGINAL NOTE: last patch is a 1.3 beta ""23 February"", available only in the Paradox Plaza; the last AGCEEP release it's the 1.59b4 with a hotfix. Both aren't included in the Steam release)			"

												For The Glory A Europa Universalis Game is a very aptly named game. It is, essentially, a collection of advances made in the Europa Universalis II modding scene bundled together and sold as a full game. And while For The Glory is a great experience it is also an experience you can get from playing regular Europa Universalis II and installing a bunch of mods.From the standpoint of an un-modded Europa Universalis II all the advances in For The Glory will look tremendous. A massive increase in the number of events you will receive, both as a historical player or as someone that thinks the Reconquista should be going in reverse. The AI is smarter, focusing it's forces much better, new map modes makes conquests much easier to plan and a ton of general balance changes makes everything feel sharper and better. Even graphically there is some improvements.One place it goes backwards however is in the multi-player department however as without Valkyrie-Net it is horribly unstable and neigh unplayable.As much as For The Glory advances the regular Europa Universalis II game it does very little to advance the modded gameplay. If you have the choice between buying this or Europa Universalis II then I'd recommend getting this every time. If you already own Europa Universalis II however then there is absolutely no reason you need to own this.			"

												This is an updated version of Europa Universalis 2, and is unfortunately not in serious development any more. The most recent beta patch is from December 31st, 2013. While this is an update to the predecessor game to EU3/EU4, they are quite dissimilar. Paradox had a distinct vision when creating EU2 compared to EU3/EU4. A lot of time was spent on trying to model historic events in EU2(FTG) and this is enhanced with the included AGC-EEP mod. While EU3/EU4 are designed from the ground up to be mostly dynamic, FTG has a lot of reliability built into what will generally happen. Specific events that mirror history will pop up and a lot of times history will repeat itself. That is not to say that the game is not dynamic and that everything happens the same way, as the AI has some freedom of choice and the player is limited only by their own skill. However, if you play as Russia, be prepared to face the Time of Troubles, as a German a radical Reformation, as an indigenous American tribe a lot of technological disparity, etc. While the engine does not have anywhere near the polish of later EU games, it is fun and has a separate appeal of its own.

												This game, this series, is a lot to take in. Grand strategy games can be a ton of fun, but you have to be willing to put in the time to learn how to play the game before you can truly enjoy the game.  Europa Universalis basically allows you to reshape history, starting from somewhere in the 1400's up to the early 1800's (Although mods can make it so you can go on indefinately). My first game I tried to take over the world starting as England. I ended up getting conqured by France and whoever that is at the northern border of England at the time within a few years.  And that's how learning in this game works. You're gonna get a basic tutorial, to give you the general gist of how to do things so you're not going in completely blind, and then you've got to go in and get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you learning. I spent four games trying to figure out what to do when you're at war(♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ portugul, taking the land for my work...) and how to annex or gain land.  The game can provide alot of fun for those who have the apptitude to learn, adapt and conquer. I'd say this is one of the good Paradox titles to try out if you're looking to get into the Grand Strategy genre, mainly cause it's the cheapest in the main series of thier games.  But despite it's age, it's still a really good game.  So if you're looking for a good, deep strategy game, and you've got the time and patience to learn, this is a game you should consider.			"

												For those megalomaniacs who love Grand Strategy games and want to change to try out some 15th-18th century alternative history; this game just can't be beat.PLVS VLTRA mod comes highly recommended - comes with a whole new world map, with 3x the amount of provinces, and includes the AGCEEP mod too - which gives you quite literaly - 10,000 or so historical events covering this time-period. Serious amount of replayability here.			"

Historical accurate events for the major nations that will give you a feel of the nation history.

												This is the best version of the oldschool event-heavy history europa universalis games. PLay with AGCEEP enabled and enjoy history (and alas also a bad UI). It's better than EU3 or EU4 because it's got more history in it but worse because eu2 is very dated. THat's it.			"

												After trying out EU4 for a free weekend on steam and my being unable to purchase a 40 dollar game, i was starving for some Europa Universalis action... And then i found this for only 2 dollars...And while i made this purchase on somwhat of a whim i do not regret it (not just because of the price i got it at, which is practically nothing). For the Glory is a pretty good spin-off game and it has a few mods built in which you can enable or disable. It's a bit slow on new systems. It also tends to crash every so often SO SAVE EVERY CHANCE YOU GET, MULTIPLE SAVE FILES ARE YOUR FRIENDS!I think the reason it tends to crash for me is because i'm playing on Windows 7. I'm told this game works best on a machine with Windows XP, but the game still manages to run fine despite the occasional crash. When it does get crash-happy though (something i've only encountered once as of this original posting of this review), that's probably a sign from the universe telling you to stop playing and go back to sleep, though on average, the same only crashes once or twice and my game-session is usually smooth the rest of the way (and i play my games without mods). According to the small community for this game, it's almost impossible to run on Windows 8 which is a real shame. I'm also unsure of what'll happen to you Windows 10 users who buy this game and may not be able to run it. Then again, modding is a thing so you may be able to run it with some help from the community, so if you have a newer operating system don't be afraid to ask around on the forums first.Compared to the new EU4 i find For The Glory a lot easier in comparison. It doesn't have as many menus as EU4 and it's pretty simple, especially if you're new to Europa Universalis. It's the same level of addicting (you'll spend hours and lose sleep over your nation expanding and surviving the test of time), the graphics are a little dummied down compared to the newer games because this was a game made for XP afterall, but it's nothing too bad to look at. The game also has a number of cheats and mods that can be used in the game if you feel like giving yourself an advantage.The only flaws i really have to complain about with the game is the crashing and that it doesn't have any steam interface built in (so if you want to talk to your friends while you play, that's out of the question because you don't get any pings to indicate that your friends are trying to talk to you). The crashing probably comes from the fact it was made for Windows XP and i'm lucky i can run it on Windows 7. Another complaint i have is the fact that i can never seem to get Windowed mode to work and the game will refuse to run unless i play full screen mode. If i try to set it up to play it windowed, the game just refused to launch period. But it's not a big deal for me. I can however imagine that scenerio sucking for someone with a lot of chatty Steam friends though and because this game doesn't have Steam interface and because of my experience with Windowed mode not working, you may just wanna ping your Steam friends and tell them that you're going to play a game that won't allow you to talk to them for a while...Still, if you want some EU and don't wanna shell out any big bucks (especially if you're just starting to get into EU as a series), For the Glory is a good start and a good alternative. It's also the cheapest. I only got it at 2 dollars because it was on sale (which is extremely lucky) but the normal price is around 10 dollars. Still, if you like the EU series or grand strategy games, i can totally recommend this one.I give For the Glory 4.75 shields out of 5And if you do want cheats, i also have this guide:

												I really wanted to like this game, but can't recommend it.A simplified EU with a focus on history sounds great, and in some ways it is. You'll learn a lot about history in this game and I find the core game much easier to pick up than EU4.That said, the events are sometimes too inconsitent with what you can do in game. For example, I got an event that told me how Christopher Columbus  sailed across the ocean to found colonies. The game gives me an explorer, Christopher Columbus, but not any conquistadors, which is a unit necessary to explore uncharted land. In this situation, I'm just sailing the sea discovering new waters, but I can't get on any new land and found any colonies. It really negates the selling point of this game and I'm afraid I can't recommend it becase of this.Also, although this game supports modern resolutions, the text scale way too small and you'll likely find yourself playing on a 4:3 resolution anyway.

												I got hooked on EU II back in 2002 and played it almost constantly until the release of For the Glory. so I bought it... twice :D This is Europa Universalis II as it was supposed to be. Well, except for one thing: the promised new map that was never made. Fortunately, that can be easily fixed, as there are 2 or 3 community-made map mods and several mods for either vanilla or modded maps, and that makes For the Glory the EUII as it was supposed to be. So, don't get me wrong, even without the new map this is the game worth recommending and worth playing, no matter what. This is a game that will grab you and hold you for a long time, and if you get involved in modding (as I have) that hold will only get stronger and longer lasting.			"

												Short Version: Europa Universalis II: But with the bugs ironed out and better mod compatibility so it's VIP QUALITY from that alone. I liked Vanilla EU2, I did not like the occasional CTDs and complexities with using mods. For the Glory irons out both issues, so it's that experience but better. My one issue was lacking the original OST, but I copied that over and solved it on my own. Definitely get this, fam. It's not EU3, arguably the pinnacle of EU I/II/III but if you have a toaster it'll run even smoother. f you like PDX games but can't afford all the DLC of their modern titles get this. Just get this in general since I'd like to see Paradox do something like FTG for EU3.			"

												The game simply refuses to run properly and crashes as soon as I try to start a scenario. I've tried all proposed fixes and it still doesn't work. And guess what - I'm not the only one. To anyone interested in buying this game: Don't do it, you'll get sort of scammed. A broken game shouldn't be on Steam, especially when the publisher doesn't give a damn about it (and FTG isn't the only Paradox game with this issue).			"

												I did not like this game at all. I thouht it was a bit bland compared to the other Grand-Strategy games out there.However, some dedicated Europa Universalis players may enjoy the game due to its overwhelming similarities with Europa Universalis II. I may not be pairing the games correctly, but when I bought the game I was looking for something like Total War. I chose it because it was a more recent release of 2011, but the game grandly failed to graphically compare to most other current games of the genre. I played the game for about 45 minutes and maybe thats not enough for you but im just doing this to get a badge. So,in my opinion unless you LOVED Europa Universalis II, this is not the right game for you. However, if you are graphically impaired, and this was the best choice for your low-end PC, I would highly recommend Imperial Glory.			"

												For The Glory is a grand strategy game spanning ~400 years of diplomacy, colinization and war during the middle ages. Despite the new name, the game is an improved version of Europa Universalis II which was released back in 2001. Although nearly identical to an 16 year old game, FTG is a real joy to play as EUII was great already and they have managed to improve it in all the right ways.			"
