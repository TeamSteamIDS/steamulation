												I remember when World War 2 games were king back in the old Medal of Honor days; To such a degree that people were sick of them, no matter the quality, like they are now of Military Shooter X and its various clones. Well Company of Heroes took the WW2 setting and built a fantastic, modern RTS around it. What they made is easily one of the best RTS games ever, and maybe even the best game set in WW2.			"

												I love this game. I love it so much. But first the basics. Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game in the times of WW2, directly after the D-Day. It features 1 campaign for vanilla, but you can expand that number by buying the really good DLCs. But the best about this game is the mp. All the factions (America,Commonwealth,Wehrmacht and Panzer Elite) are really well balanced and if you loose, it's only your fault. Every faction has 3 different trees of abilities, but you can only choose one per game. The abilities reach from little boosts or infantry drops to V1 Rockets or mighty king tiger tanks. Thanks to the ""new steam version"" the mp still works and many people are still playing it (up to 4000 people peak, source Steamcharts by 21st of february), so there's no reason to not get it. Thanks for reading and i hope you endorse this little review of me. ^^ And now go ahead, scroll up and buy it. I'm not kidding, go, there's nothing more to see here.			"

												(Something to quickly note first - Don't let the amount of time I have put into this game misguide you. This review was actually meant for Company of Heroes (New Steam Version) which I have put over 120 hours into but for some reason, you cannot do reviews of it and can only do reviews for COH itself as well as its two expansion packs.)Alright, enough dilly-dallying. Let's get this show on the road.When it comes to games that try to capture the hard, bloody and steely conflicts of World War II then one game usually comes to mind (my mind that is) and that is Company of Heroes.A game I would easily consider to be one of the greatest RTSs of all time alongside the likes of Age of Empires II, Rome: Total War, Men of War and Dawn of War (So many wars!). I would also say it is one of my own personal favourite games of all time. Set in the western front of the European Theatre of World War II. Company of Heroes sees the US Army (As well as the British Army with Opposing Fronts installed) and the Wehrmacht (As well as the Panzer Elite {Waffen SS in reality} with OF installed) battling each other for the control of France and the Netherlands in the numerous conflicts and engagements of that era.Company of Heroes is a game that just does so many things right when it comes to strategy. It has a user friendly interface and easy to learn controls which are key to any strategy game in my opinion – both real-time and turn-based – and gives a really realistic and striking depiction of the war. It has easy to understand game mechanics and it is quite literally a blast to play as it takes little time before the action begins and gets intense real fast when there is so much happening at once in devastating and explosive fire fights.When it comes to its gameplay, it seems fairly simple enough. You start off with a single building for a base and a group of engineers (your builders in the game), a big map to explore and expand into as well as using what resources you can secure from the area to use so you can try to build up your base and call in what units or support options you need to attain victory, such as infantry, paratroopers, special weapons teams, armoured cars, medium and heavy tanks, artillery barrages, P-51 strafing runs and V1 Rocket strikes etc. It’s your standard RTS mash up.This game is the epitome of how a strategy game should play out; rather than just the usual strategy game method of having larger numbers than the other guy (Although that certainly helps in this game). COH requires you to utilise your given surroundings, putting soldiers in buildings and environmental cover to give them an edge in the fight while also attempting to use your units special abilities like throwing grenades and sticky bombs or using flamethrowers to try and maximise enemy casualties. Maybe trying to exploit certain tactics like flanking maneuverers, suppression of an enemy squad, going around the back of an enemy tank and hitting it in its vulnerable sides and rear armour or trying to hold onto a strategic position with well-placed fortifications, traps and emplacements. That is what real strategy and tactical prowess is about and COH does it beautifully. This means that you must be cunning and always planning for the unexpected, always being one step ahead of the opposing commander. Be ready for when the enemy comes charging at you with everything they have while calling in whatever long range assets they can muster against your forces.Graphics are decent, they may not be all the way up there when compared to the likes of StarCraft 2 or the Total War games but they do the job as far as I’m concerned and still hold up pretty well to this day. When you see an artillery barrage devastate a patch of land, turning it into a series of craters while a nearby squad of soldiers gets blown apart (literally) by the shrieking shells all the while screaming that “They don’t want to be there, they just want to go home, man!” then I would definitely say that the graphics and audio department have very much done their job to the nth degree.There are problems with the game though. The AI is questionable at times with enemies running entire platoon sized forces into fortified positions without trying to soften up the defenders with artillery or anything first, more often or not I saw the spamming of the same unit over again from my AI controlled enemies also while not trying to diversify their unit types to counter any certain units I had. The AI also cheats sometimes, knowing exactly where to call in an artillery barrage on your units despite that the fog of war would prevent them from knowing their exact location. The campaign(s) are quite scripted and often don’t present much of a challenge, even on the harder difficulties. It’s not a perfect game by any means but I still recommend it for all the good I have mentioned above and hope this review can help your perspective should you think about purchasing it.On the side as well, I just want to say that this game has some of the best voice acting I have ever heard with soldiers spouting some really emotional and funny dialogue with professional voice talent provided from the likes of Steve Blum and of course, dear old Nolan North. Somehow the creators even managed to work in some humorous fourth wall breaking dialogue as well, my favourite having to be from a British Infantry Section, “Excuse me, sir, would you mind not clicking me anymore?” or “Oi! Get your bloody hands off the mouse!” And if you do ever think about getting Company of Heroes then I highly recommend that you download the Blitzkrieg mod which amplifies the game like 10 times in terms of gameplay and player choice, making it even more gripping and awesome to play.So there you have it. Sorry about the length of this review but I simply had to put down what I liked about this game, which unfortunately was a lot….sorry. Have a good day, sir or madam.Quote of the day - “We’re f*cked, crew! Command is drunk again!” - US Artillery crewman.			"

												Most Innovative RTS Game of all time.Company of Heroes is unlike any other traditional RTS games. Many have tried to innovate the RTS genre, but none that has been more successful over Company of Heroes. Relic has always been in the forefront of innovtive RTS experiences, But I have to say CoH is their ultimate masterpiece, not even its sequel, can beat it.Everything in CoH is realistic without compromising balanced gameplay mechanics and fun. I have yet to see a new RTS game to beat this game as of this writing.In CoH, massing units do not work when a horde of infantry is halted by single tank, or even worse: face a hail of mortar strikes. Your seemingly unstoppable tank column can be put to a halt with well placed gun enplacement in a superior position  . Simly put, you cannot steamroll to victory in this game like you would in any other RTS games. Technically speaking CoH revolves around tactics, resources and base building is still a major mechanic in the game, but superior maneuvers and positioning is everything. Resource management is a zero-sum tug of war as the only way to secure more resources is to hod more teritorries, the more territories you hold the harder it is defend. The units are consisted of infantry squads or singular tank units. These units are very accurate to its real-life counterparts,  a US rifleman squad armed with M1 Garrand rifles will defeat KAR98-wielding german counterparts at medium to close range, but the opposite happens in long range engagements. Heavy Machine gun emplacements provide supressing fire that reduces the target's ability to fight or maneuver well. Long range artillery is inaccurate but deadly when it lands home - tanks are impervious to anti infantry weaponry giving them free reign to dominate an opponent with no proper anti-tank response. Furthermore, as the game progresses, every action in the battlefield earn you commander points which allow the playerto level up and gain access to special units, powers, or even superweapons such as the V1 Rocket strike or even call out powerful german Tiger Tanks. This allows the player to adapt apidly varying battlefield conditions.There are many more innovative gameplay mechanics such as Directional cover, retreat mechanic, triage, battlefield destruction and many more. It also has a very compelling single player campaign - long enough for you to grasp and master these mechanics. And if that isn't good enough for you, gimping and gore in this game is fantastic. Nothing more exhilirating and satisfying seeing your opponents army's flying limbs and smoking scrap by a well placed artillery barrage.Coh is an absolute get and an instant timeless piece - I seriously doubt anything coming out sooner or later will top the bar this game has set so high.

												First, I wanna say that if you do not already own this game, buy it. It is definitely one of the best RTS games for the price.  The Campaign takes place at the beginning of the Normandy D-Day invasion, and is really immersive.  I really enjoy playing the multiplayer skirmish mode with my friends.  The graphics, by todays standards, are a little lacking, but the game more than makes up for it by having a good story, a great interface, and excellent battlefield mechanics.  I have never played a WWII game that is better than Company of Heroes.PROS:-Good in-game interface-Great Battlefield Mechanics-A wide variety of units, which make for interesting battles-Good, in-depth story-An excellent multiplayer skirmish modeCONS:-Graphics are dated by today's standards-DLC units can be overpowered-AI can be extremely frustrating (They do spam you with overpowerd units)Overall, Company of Heroes is an excellent buy.

												Company of Heores... wow where to start. This game is truly amazing. I remember when I first played this game. I said ""holy sh*t, this game was made in 2006?"" This game has a very fun campaign with about 15 missions. Command the US Forces landing on the beaches of Normandy, then the Airborne Infantry. This game combines realism with fun arcade style gameplay. There is so much to do in this game; upgrade your riflemen to have BARs, give your Shermans Mine Flails to get through minefields or build a machinegun nest to keep sneaky Germans out of your base. The other great thing about this game is after you beat the campaign, it doesn't end. Multiplayer, skirmishs, 2 huge DLCs and a German Army to command in skirmishs or multiplayer.I would easily pay 60$ for this game now. 10$ is a steal.			"

												The benchmark for all RTS should be, and have been, set by this game. Beautifully crafted mechanics and an attention to detail make this game phenomenal, the maps are varied, some are large, other like Achelous River contain various chokepoints that will make you scream as you watch your Shermans be blown up as the bridge collapses. The modding community has also had its hand in making CoH fantastic, my favorite being the Blitzkrieg Mod which makes the game brutal and glorious. All in all, a fantastic RTS, one that everybody should play and one last note:""JESUS CHRIST CONRAD TIE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING LACES""			"

NOTE:Also see my:Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts reviewCompany of Heroes: Tales of Valor reviewTL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Company of Heroes is a 2006 real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). The game boasts an authentic World War 2 RTS experience with a squad based infantry mechanic, tactical and strategic map control, realistic armored combat and intense battles that will leave players at the edge of their seats.STORY (No Spoilers):Much like other World War 2 video game stories, Company of Heroes lets you take the role of an American army company called 'Able Company' who takes part in some of the biggest operations of the allied forces such as D-Day and the Falaise Pocket.PROS:+ Great graphics that looks good even in today's standards;+ Great sound effects;+ Amazing voice acting that gives life to the battlefield (probably my favorite PRO);+ Dark humor from the units “Main gun is out, we're screwed, we're screwed!” - Allied tank when the Main Gun is disabled and low on HP “I don't want to die...in FRAAANCCCEE” -Wehrmacht Soldier when low in HP;+ Intense action packed combat;+ Great atmosphere (A PRO I rarely put on an RTS title);+ Great core game mechanic;+ Faction versatility: Each faction has 3 'branches' where the player can adopt different bonuses to better suit their play style; and+ Fully destructible environment that leaves the battlefield deformed after each match.CONS:- Low quality textures when zoomed in (probably because of the game's age);- No melee or close quarter combat like Relic's other series 'Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War';- Relatively long load times; (Patched)- Occasional pathfinding problems;- No Axis / German Campaign; (unless you bought the expansions)- AI could use some improvement; and- Relic Entertainment Account (DRM).CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Excellent game mechanics, great graphics, environment design and voice acting makes this game one of the most authentic experiences I have ever gotten on a World War 2 RTS game.WORTH IT?:It is a MUST BUY for RTS and World War 2 fans whether at full price or on sale.If you're interested in the game, then I highly advice the 'Complete Pack' (which includes the original game and the 2 expansions) to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Note: Do not let the 0.3 hours fool you. I purchased the complete pack on Steam that contains the original copy, which I had a non-steam copy that had over 100 hours, and the new steam version. To play this game, you have to install the new steam version, which I have 40 hours on.Company of Heroes is a great game set in World War II with Nazi Germany and the Allies. It is a strategy game with a overhead camera in-game. The game features six different campaigns if you own the base game and all expansions. Each campaign allows the player to either play as the British, Americans or Germans through a rich storyline. For example, the Invasion of Normady campaign is self-explanatory. Each specific campaign has a good story that cover various aspects of that timeframe. For example, the Liberation of Caen campaign has missions such as attempting to take Hill 112 prior to the invasion of Caen to help the allies with supplies. Some campaigns are better than others such as Tiger Ace and the Invasion of Normandy compared to ones that do drag including Operation Market Garden. I got about 35+ out of all six campaigns. All in all, all campaigns are good enough to hold the interest of the player and are fun to play.The graphics are really good for a 2006 game. The sound is perfect to what the game is about and the setting it is portrayed in. The dialogue is varied and is strong to negate the feeling of repeatitive dialogue. The gameplay is really good. There are multiple relatively minor glitches including the pathfinding system and the population system that add up over time that affect the overall approval rating of the game. All in all, these four catagories are positives.The multiplayer is excellent. There are various modes tha help with variety in the game from the Operation Stonewall mode to just normal 1v1, 2v2, etc. The population of online is at a reasonable amount currently. Nothing more to say, just a typical multiplayer that excels.Overall, an excellent game. The campaigns are diverse and entertaining, the multiplayer is superb and the graphics, dialogue, etc. is great. There are some minor issues as I said with the gameplay but it doesn't hurt the game that much. Highly recommended game. 9.5/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												Company of Heroes  is a strategic hard and pure, clearly intended only for those players who eat and breathe tactics lead. Accessibility is close to zero, but those with the necessary basics behind who have the courage to jump into the fray will face a work frighteningly accurate and deep, which abandons the simplifications to propose semi realistic battles and forces them to calculate the perfection every single move.

												Pretty awesome game; came out a decade ago, but still a lot of fun to play. The online community is still active and if you want to play against other players, you don't have to wait long for a match. The single-player campaign puts the player in the major American operations during the Battle of Normandy (if you don't know about it, think of the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the TV miniseries ""Band of Brothers""). All in all I'd say that this is a must-have for lovers of RTS and/or games set in WW2

												Why I bought the game: Huge RTS fan, followed the gameWhat I liked about the game: This is an amazing game, it was so good in fact I bought it twice, one disc set and another no steam for convenience. This game broke the build up a base and stomp routine, you had to pay attention to individual battles, and it's fantastic while doing so. The music and graphics at the time in 2006 were top notch, and you had to have a nice pc to run this game on full settings, the destructible environments blew me away, watching shells bounce off enemies tanks, or ricochet off the ground and into your own team, watching the ground scorch over time, and trees up rooted by tanks. Even writing this review makes me want to play right now, i've put over 600 hours into this game easy, and multi player is edge of your seat action the whole time, constantly changing strategy.Two primary modes, destruction and king of the hill esseintialy, resources are spread out on maps and you must take them with units, keep them and hold them.What I didn't like about the game: The game stopped updating and CoH2 was dissapointing, this has nothing to do with this game though this game is must own. Would I buy at current asking price of 9.99? Must own game, all time favorite list.**Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant. The current date of review 12/5/2014.			"

												Company of Heroes is, quite simply, the best RTS I have ever played - I would even go as far as saying that it's one of my top five favourite games of all time. The visuals are excellent in spite of its old age; though there are several mods available that improve upon these for those of you who enjoy super close-ups of your units.The campaigns are enjoyable and offer a solid amount of single-player gameplay. However, I personally did not find them to be particularly replayable. The meat of the game is in the excellent skirmish and multiplayer modes, which offers up a huge range of maps - though there are only two game modes (point capture and good old fashioned annihilate), no two matches ever come out the same. The scale of the action is just right; small enough to allow for tactical squad gameplay while being large enough to feel like an actual battlefield, unlike Dawn of War II (which was oddly enough inspired by CoH).As for mods, there are many very high quality ones available. Want the Eastern Front without the pain of CoH 2? Sure! The Trenches of the First World War? Of course! More 'realistic' gameplay, North Africa, shedloads of new historic vehicles, weapons and infantry? There are mods for all of that. There's even a mod for German prototype supertanks and exploding donkeys with rocket launchers strapped to them, if that's what you're into.In short, Company of Heroes is a superb game that I cannot recommed enough, whether you're already into RTS games or looking for your first one. It has given me dozens of hours of entertainment and I am sure that it will provide dozens more. As it's a relatively old game now it's very cheap for what you get; so there's no reason not to buy and install it right now!			"

												Literally reinstalled the Old Steam version to play for 1 more minute and write my review. Here goes.So, to better understand my review I have to give a little about me.I am a history buff, and a HUGE World War 2 enthusiast. From televised media like games, movies, documentaries and interviews, to written literature like stories and reports. Since I was a wee little tyke I've been taking in and absorbing as much as one can about this bit of history. Strategy/RTS games are my favorite genre and to finally see a World War 2 game executed on this level has my heart exploding from the rooftops of sheer excitement and nostalgia. The amount of depth and complexity in this game still astounds me. I need to position my armor right to score critical hits, I can move my rifleman squad on to that previously occupied PAK 38, and use their own weapon against the enemy team. Cover comes into play. There is just so much here to love, compared to the right click to win of other RTS.I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												This game has been in my library forever and it's still one of the best.  It was so far ahead of its time, it still seems fresh and as fun to play as any of its modern counterparts.I am so happy that Steam saved this game and released an updated Steam version because once every few months I have the urge to play a campaign again.5/5  This is one of those 'perfect' games along side Evil Genius and Nation Red.  There just is nothing they could have done better.			"

												Definitely one of my favorite RTS games.The Company of Heroes series offers many great campaigns to enjoy, different factions and a true to history feeling.The Squad-based strategies are easy to get into yet are challenging to use correctly.Upgrading and equipping your troops with specialised weapons is an essential part of the game, and the balance is nicely achieved; you can counter the biggest tank rushes if you use the right units, use cover or hide in buildings.Great franchise, amazing value!

												Remember old strategy games, where you would just amass more units than the enemy and because of that you would win the game in the next attack? Well, ""Company of Heroes"" is not that type of game. In this game a simple move can change the whole outcome of the match. You don't have to amass thousands of units in order to be strong. Actually, the game can support very few units per player. But that it the beauty of the game, because with the units that you have (this game includes infantry, armor, light armor and emplacements, such as artillery etc) you can make smart moves and change the tide of the game to your favor. You've got to use your units. You've got to use the environment. You've got to use your brain!The game includes 4 factions (2 in the original game and 2 in ""Opposing Fronts""), all with their unique set of units and abilities. All of them have their own strategies to lead you to victory. I believe they were all carefully made, are absolutely balanced and very interesting.The single player includes 6 campaigns (2 in the original, 1 in opposing fronts and 3 in tales of valor), which are absolutely outstanding. You can never get bored by those campaigns, simply because you don't have just to destroy the enemy's base or defend your base against the enemy's attacks, but you sometimes control only the units and you have to make careful decisions in order to execute a mission. The game itself makes you live the moments! I mean it! You have to try it!The multiplayer is also fantastic. The main idea of it is that you have to defend some key points and the enemy starts losing points until their point reach zero (starting at 500). The multiplayer system has the ""Play now"" function, which finds you a game almost instantly (even in the new servers, I'm now encountering no problem at all). You can also create and find a game in the standard way, but automatic mathmaking saves you the trouble. Your stats get recorded and you can download a replay of every match that you play, making easy to find any mistakes that you've done and improve your strategy.Do not be afraid of the recent move to the steam servers. I bought the game 10 days ago and by the time this review is written I have encountered zero problems. I'd like to congratulate  the company for doing so, because most companies would have just quit the project and let it die. By this move I had the chance to experience the game, too, because I bought it a little late (better late than never though).I haven't regret having bought this game. It is a unique, once in a lifetime game. It's one of those games that I will be speaking about when I get older and have nostalgia about. Simply the best strategy game I have ever played.10/10			"

												Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game from THQ and now published by SEGA. Company of Heroes takes place in 1944, Europe, when and after the Allies launch the Operation Overlord.Company of Heroes has good gameplay. You build your base camp and fortify it before assaulting the enemy base camp and destroy it. Infantry unit can take cover on walls, fence or garrison themselves in houses or any other buildings that garrisonable. Unlike many other RTS game, infantry in Company of Heroes is a force to be reckoned with. They can be upgraded with better weapons or even be equiped with anti-tank weapons to engage armored vehicles. Vehicles and tanks also has unique damage system. Their engine can be blown off, immobilizing them. When vehicle unit finally destroyed, they can be ""out of control"" that they will hit something and explode. Each faction has 3 unique command tree with each command tree has its own special ability.Graphics of Company of Heroes is beautiful on its age. Explosion effect, skies, muzzle flash and weapon tracers are amazing. Animation are even more realistic as it can be. Infantry will act based on the battlefield situation and the state of the infantry, like when they are pinned down or retreating. Smoke and fire effect is also great.Performance of Company of Heroes is quite bad. Most of the time you will run the game just fine, but sometimes you will encounter sudden stutters or even lags even on advanced computers. The engine still need to be optimized. AI performance still quite good regarding this, and will give challenge on harder difficulty.Overall, Company of Heroes is amazing real-time strategy game with advanced graphics and decent style of gameplay. With a bit more optimization, the game will be even more amazing. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												Company of Heroes is probably one of the best RTS games I have ever played. The excellent single player campaign is probably one of the best RTS campaigns I have had the fortune to play. In addition the multiplayer is top notch and highly addictive. But probably my most favourite aspect is some of the awesome mods available. The Blitzkrieg mod is probably one of the best, the game is almost entirely reworked which presents new challenges and a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of new units to build and conquer with.Final Score: 90/100			"

												This is an RTS game that focuses on tactics. No need to worry about managing resource gatherers or constructing a base just so. It can all come down to whether you time a flanking manuever correctly or keep your tank's heavier frontal armor directed toward your enemies AT guns. Every death matters, you can't just throw your units away as you might in many other RTS games. It's a game that's fun to play around with, but a huge challenge to master. The campaign is fairly long and varied, but multiplayer is a rush, just don't underestimate your opponents...			"

												Probably one of the most indepth RTS games ever made. The game not only has an intense multiplayer but pretty nice features for an RTS. You pick between the Germans or the Allies in this game. The German you can be the Panzer Elite or another branch of their military or you can be the Allies which are British and Americans. The game has 3 specialities. Air, Armor and Land. Each have their own special skills. The environment is destructable, so mortar strikes and air bombings cause the terrian to change. You can blow up buildings or even use the buildings as cover. You can literally zoom into the battlefield so close that you can see the troops bodies blow up to pieces. The animations are very realistic and it actually makes you feel like you're watching a real life scenerio of WW2. In short- This is one of the best RTS games you can play... It has multiplayer, and a type of multiplayer that you can win no matter what.. Use your brains, strategize, and fight your way to win. It's a 10/10 game and a must buy for any RTS fan!			"

												This is a review for CoH New Steam Version(You'll get it when you buy this game, New Steam Version is the way to play this old game, so that all element on the game would work)I generally suck at RTS game.I think I can count on finger, how many RTS game I played and truly enjoy.I still suck on all of themCompany of Heroes is a RTS game that have element of building production structure and training your army. Upgrade is researchable, and each of your army unit may have an ability.Compared to other similar game like Man of War or Sudden Strike (I have minimal experience with those), CoH is lot less complex on unit micro management.CoH instead play out on the flow of battlefield, where your units are, where the enemies, what should you do after engaging a skirmish. Getting to know this is the way to win, at least thats what I (who sucks at RTS) thinks.CoH have a lot of war element detail on a less unit-management game style. Infantry might get suppressed when they're in no-cover area, vehicle might be damaged on a number of parts that might hinder their performance, and iirc building that's on fire will have it's health decreasing as time pass by.A faction have doctrine subtrees, where a player can specialize on what tactic it brings on the battlefield.The range of infantry and vehicle the player can used spans from the early WW2 to almost the end of the period.It's generally a land combat type unit you can control. Fighter plane exist but only  as a form of commander strike ability.Playing against other player is great, but those who prefer to spend a free time stomping out CPU/AI enemy will find good time battling them out.The vanilla game plays out really well, and if you're already bored with it, there are 1-2 mod out there that brings out new way to play.I recommend to buy the CoH Complete Pack, one that have CoH and its 2 expansion, Opposing Front and Tales of ValorThe full price might shy people away from this 2006 old game, but a discount will help alleviate this.Up to 50% cut is considered a good deal for me, with what the amount of hour you'll dump to this game.

												This game is THE standard for excellence in real-time military strategy games despite it being 9 years old.The campaign alone for the first COH is challenging and requires you to learn fast and hard the use of tactics and gameplay. If not you will get creamed and rushed time and time again.The attention to detail for this franchise is excellent. The graphics and sound editing brings out the grittiness of the game, especially when your troops are facing enemy fire and are ""getting the♥♥♥♥♥♥pounded out of them"". I've had to replay scenario after scenario until I find a strategy that sticks, The game excels where many others fail.Playing this franchise has been a pure joy and I haven't even touched the other DLC/mission packs.The game is worth the full price and right now it is a STEAL for 3$. Buying the entire franchise at its current sale price of 30$ is definitely worth it. 10/10			"

												A WW2 strategy game that has stood the test of time with its excellent set of expansions and an ongoing mod scene 10 years later. A base building, objective based strategy with plenty of skirmish style combat. The campaign is well constructed with a selection of different style missions ranging from an all out assault on an enemy occupied city to disabling a V-2 rocket facility with a detatchment of Highly trained Paratroopers.The Skirmish multiplayer mode is great for small/mid-scale battles that can last you anywhere from 1/2 an hour up to a couple of hours depending on your choice of scenario and map.  The base game seems fairly broken looking back now after being spoilt for choice on the realism and variety that the 'Europe At War' mod offers. But I would time and time again recommend that you enjoy the base game first to appriciate just how far the game has come.Check out the EaW mod, some people have had issues with it but I haven't had many so check it out for yourself.

												An absolutely essential edition to your library if you fancy RTS or WWII. This game highlights focused strategy in an amazing way. You are required to be quick and responsive and need to worry about where your guys take cover, where they're shooting, where they can go. Never have I found myself so closely attached to my unit as I find myself when it comes to my men in COH. It's strategy on a small focused scale that still requires you to look at the big picture.The main thing that might throw you off is probably the outdated graphics during cutscenes. Don't let that detract from the great experience that is this game.			"

												Company of Heroes blends several newer concepts of RTS (such as squad control and effect of terrain) into a single game . It removes resource gathering of traditional RTS games , and replace it with capturable resource points and victory points , which forces players from both sides to constantly fight all over the map . The graphic is good even by nowaday's standard and the sound effect / voice acting are great . The single player campaign will take some time to complete but the real fun lies in Multiplayer once you get used to game mechanics , a match against an equally skilled opponent can usually last over 40mins , its very intense and even more satisfying if you manage to defeat your opponant . Overall this is probably the best RTS I've played and I highly recommend it			"

												A thrilling, brutal, astonishingly intense  action packed affair and the best RTS I have ever played. Set during the most bloodthirsty conflict in human history COH is an astounding effort from beginning (the ferocious Normandy D Day landings) to end. Its the sense of realism which makes it stand out from the rest.  It's a sense of realism we see from the  individual bullets tearing up chunks of dirt and smoke from slowly disintegrating walls as your men clambour for more stable cover all the way to watching entire tank battles engage in titanic apocalyptic skirmishes and  listening to the sound and fury of artillery barrages and the resulting unbelievable carnage. COH is a sensory experience which leaves you shell shocked and obsessing for more. Sound is a vital part of the game which adds immensely to the sense of wartime immersion. Along with the aforementioned, there are thousand of lines of written dialogue for the units ranging from the humorous comments about the enemy from jaded and cynical riflemen to the panicky, terror stricken screams of tank units aware of their pending annihilation.  Multiple factions are available, each one with a different overarching philosophy from the blitzkrieg geared Wehrmacht to the artillery and defence focussed British. Within each faction there are several skill trees or individual philosophies to focus on. A fully researched out army can gain access to powerful missile launching ranger units along with heavy artillery pieces which can cause immense destruction from long distance. It's as savagely fun as it sounds. The missions are varied and include but not restricted to search, destroy and hold based objectives with each step involving access to more advanced units and vehicles. There are clandestine missions involving the locating and blowing up of long distance rockets to defending a hill under heavy attack. Regardless of the scenario you are guaranteed hours of intense gameplay leaving you feeling as though you just partook in a deadly game of desperate attrition, tactical assaults and bloody death. As stated, a truly landmark game which as stood the test of time amazingly well. A true PC classic which everyone must experience			"

												so after putting about 600 hours into this game (the new steam version) i can only give you a list of pro cons and things to rememberPROS:           + fairly good graphics when compared to other RTS gmaes           + dark (still funny) hummor EX:"" i don't want to die.... IN FRAAANNCCE- low health werhmacht soldier           + action packed (somtimes extremely frustrating) combat           + critical vehical damage system EX: main gun, engine destroyed and tracks being blown off           + diverse factions which all have 3 branches that provide extra commander and unit abilities aswell as units or              groups of units asertaining to the specific branches purpose EX infantry armor airbourne and (british) artillery           + additions of two new factions in DLC which is also a con because you have to pay for them but also adds new               campaings           + british are great a great addition to the allies           + panzer elite are a great addition to the axis           + both the british and panzer elite can counter each other with their own units and branches            +cheap pricing and alot of replayability with mods for the core game EX"" europe at war blitzkrieg               battle of the bulge and modern combat. (you could get a new triple A game for the price of two             company of heroes complete packs and still won't offer the replayability that CoH has) and now to do the part i like the least the consCONS:           -path finding problems          -occasionally the AI goes full retard and doesn't really build many defences and puts them in terrible places which            isn't part of going it going full retard thats just how the AI rolls, it does place mines around capture points though          -british can be OP when spaming emplacements especially 25 pounders          -panzer elite don't have a decent buildable medium tank like the Panzer IV F2 and up instead it gets the F1 which           has less armor and a short barrel 75mm gun which has terrible armor penatration but can at least kill stuarts.          -panzer elite players who are smart can use bergertiger recover tank to recover panther battle groups after calling            in more to get ridiculous numbers of panther tanks while going over pop cap (it is a viable strategy but it's costly             and takes alot time)In conclusion if your a RTS fan and like WW2 this is a great game for you and you'll probably want to go with the complete pack but you can get the base game for $10 or €9 and if your still not sure you want to spend money on it there is a free demo. I strongly recommend this game due to the (as mentioned before)  great core gameplay replayability and mods avaliable for the game that can give it an entirely new flavour like BOTB and modern combat or just make the core game it self harder, more extensive or both like europe at war and blitzkreig(yes i do know there are ALOT more pros than cons and thats because it's a solid game but those cons can be game breaking and yes for you veteran players i know i left some thing out but if i included everything this would take up more space than 4 brit players on semois and the people who are reading this and don't have the game wouldn't have anything to find out them selves)			"

												I remember having played this game for the first time when it was released. Being a fan of RTS games, especially the ones released by Relic, there was no way I was going to let this one go. It wouldn't be an understatement to say I was literally hooked from the word go. No RTS before or since has been on the same level as this. The single player campaign was just brilliant. If I had to point out a weakness, the only one I can come up with is that it’s a bit short. I just couldn't have enough of it. But it's not a perfect world. Relic’s competitors can maybe come up with a 20 mission campaign with mediocre results, but this one gave you 13 that were nothing short of brilliant. They were varied in terms of gameplay, offering multiple methods to achieve the objectives. It has been ages now since I last played it, but I still have fond memories of some of these missions, which I had played over and over, on every difficulty setting available. Some of these include a mission where you have to destroy a V2 missile base with your paratroopers, a mission where you have to hunt Panthers in a bombed out town, another hard as hell mission where you have to defend a hill, each amazing in their own right. It was revolutionary on many fronts too, when it came out. The graphics were on par with the best WWII themed shooters of that time, which was no mean feat by an RTS game. But most of all, it was the complete redesign of the multiplayer battles that initially came as a rude shock to me. No turtling anymore! Can’t have 20 defensive positions around your base, sit back, churn out an army, and then go after the opponent. If you want to win, if you want resources, then you will have to move your men out on the battlefield. To the frontlines, no retreat! Oh, but you could retreat if the♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan. These new design features to the basic gameplay probably changed the mindset of many an RTS gamer, who now had to pick his battles, maneuver his units effectively, capture resources, and go on to win the day. A benchmark had been set, which was to a large extent carried forward to the Company of Heroes 2 game. The initial game only had two sides, the US and the Wehrmacht (Germany). And yet, each game was compelling, almost always arriving at a nail biting finish. I still have fond memories of some 2v2, and 4v4 games that I played against friends in a Gaming zone. Although by the time I came on Steam, it had been a year since COH2 had been released. Although the ability to play COH2 online with people from around the world, testing my skills, and making use of everything this platform had to offer was the initial reason why I joined Steam in the first place, there was no way I was going to let the original COH slip by my collection. Pretty soon it was on sale, and I grabbed it along with all the expansions. If only there were steam achievements to go with it, I would have played it again right then. One day soon enough, I probably will again for the umpteenth time, when I finally give in to the dark whisperings of nostalgia. Company of Heroes is for me, and the reviews will prove it, one of, if not the best WWII RTS games ever made. There probably will be none like it. The gameplay mechanics, the design, sound, production, graphics, etc. are all top of the line. If I could ask the developer for one thing, it would be to make another expansion for this. For any of you who are fans of the WWII genre, just get this, and thank me later.9.5 / 10			"

												Company of Heroes is the rope that strings together the classic structure and ressource based RTS and THQ's new style capture points and ability based RTS that is best personified in the form of Dawn of War 2.Company of Heroes manages to mix the two styles quite well, particularly the presence of structures makes the blend between macro and micro much more smooth than in other THQ new style games where it's all micro.The graphics are strong and the music is decent. The single-player campaign is well made although the storyline and cut-scenes are something I could do without.Company of Heroes is a good game, by no means a great game, but a good solid title that can be thoroughly enjoyed by any fans of the genre. The multi-player does get a little stale however.			"

												This game is a must have if you are a fan of WW2 games. As an RTS, it allows the player to view the battlefield from various angles and elevation. The units are very authentic and the gameplay, although will seem slow for an average gamer, the time that creates the feeling of an actual war like scenario and put you in the commander's seat.The storyline is also good and if you cross check with the actual evvents of WW2, the missions are pretty much the story.I also have the DLC's for this game and their expansion packs Opposing fronts, and Tales of valor are equally good. After all these years, the game is still one of my favourite.The game will actually encourage you to know the units inside out and that will actually help you win the missions.All in all, a must have, very positive, educative, and an amazing game.

												Wanna hate your friends? Have them play Company of Heroes multiplayer with you. It's still one of the best RTS games ever made. There's few games that feel as vicious and personal as Company of Heroes. You don't just kill the enemy infantry. You use propaganda to force retreat a huge clump of expensive heavy infantry, timing it in tandem with a V-1 flying bomb attack on their base that vaporizes them just as they arrive.There's no units that serve a redundant purpose. The abilities are also very strong regardless of which faction you pick, especially compared to CoH 2 and you'll be hard pressed to blame the game balance for a defeat. There's also extensive options for bot matches and a pretty decent campaign if you don't do much offline. Absolutely worth it.			"

												The shining example of a genre done incredibly right. I have many fond memories of sitting in a conex in the middle of no where in Iraq in 2006 playing this on a laptop in between gaurd shifts and patrols. Even more than 10 years later, this game is still a utmost pleasure to play. The graphics still look very excellent and the attention to detail is something that still hasn't been met outside of real time tactical games. The squad and unit controls are easy and intuitive, and with many well made mods, there are literally hundreds and hundreds of hours of play to be had in this game. This is a go to for me personally when it comes to RTS and has been one of the few games to be constantly installed and played on all of my computers for the last decade.			"

												*NOTE: Review is based on my 30+ hours in the ""New Steam Version"", which is not listed in the Steam Store.For a game made in 2006, Company of Heroes (and its expansions) still holds up well today. The game still looks pretty decent for our current time, which says something about how well made it is. The environments are very well detailed though the models don't look all that great (by today's standards that is), but that's acceptable as it is an RTS, where players would be looking at the whole map more than getting up close and personal with the units. This game is not just a looker too, it sounds great as well. The units all sound very unique and have their own lines, plus some hidden (and quite funny) ones when you click on them too much. The sound effects are also great and really immerse you in the battle at hand. In terms of gameplay, CoH is no slouch. The AI is pretty decent and can sometimes surprise you, though it does do stupid things from time to time. Many systems and mechanics are also present in this game, such as Cover & Suppression for infantry, Resource Sectors, and even positional damage for vehicles. Besides that, both the Americans and German Wehrmacht differ between each other and confer to different playstyles. On top of that, each faction also has a sub-faction, in the form of its Company Commanders that have its won unique set of abilities and perks. All of these mechanics and systems help in adding more depth to the game, and also makes it all that more enjoyable to play.The Campaign progresses linearly, but its also quite well done. The story of Able & Fox Companies are pretty decent and the missions are very enjoyable, though the difficulty of the missions increase quite fast. Each mission also offers Awards, which are only gained by completing special challenges in the missions, which can range from easy to hard depending on the player's skill level.There are, however, some negatives that must be mentioned about the game. The game is quite heavy on the micromanaging side, so it might be a bit hard for newcomers to the RTS genre. Besides that, only the Americans get a campaign and only two sides are available in the base game (Opposing Fronts fixes this by adding in two newAllied and Axis campaigns, plus two more factions). Also you can't match the same sides against each other, such as Americans vs Americas, or vice versa. That being said, it does not hinder the game from being an amazing title.In conclusion, Company of Heroes is a very good to amazing game that all RTS fans should play, as it is not just fun, but immersive and deep too. It is recommended to get the Complete version, as it adds in 5 new campaigns and 2 new sides to the base game's already solid Americans and Wehrmacht. And for the price that its being sold now, its pretty much a must-have.			"

												Alright, before you say I only have 0.3 hours on record, note that I don't use this version. I use the ""New Steam Version."" You get this version as well as the new steam version when you purchase this product, anyway to the actual review.First of all, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! If you like games like total war, men of war, and rts games in general, then you'll love this game. However I will give you a warning, multiplayer in this game is bassically like this, if you have less than 1000 games played and 500 wins, then your a newb and you'll probably be kicked. Another thing is that there aren't many online games, there is rarely 20+ games availible to join, but hey, you could always host.Skirmish mode is amazing, the AI actually seems intelligent and knows how to evolve to fight you.The campaign is lots of fun to, but I think that anyone that plays this game can agree that the only thing they really play when they go on is skirmish or multiplayer.

Hexalots of fun, Multiplayer works, as well as dozens of mods. and best of all, you don't need no DLC to enjoy the base game. and the base game is only 7.99! (thats like 2 commanders for COH 2) Speaking about the DLC's they add a ton of extra. 2 new playable factions, with their respective campaigns, The british and the panzer elite(opposing fronts) and as well 3 mini campaigns (tales of valor)No need for pointless commanders costing 3.99 here.

The AI is very sophisticated and well adjustable, so even for RTS-newbies the point of entry is feasable.10/10 points; a must-have for RTS fans			"

												This is an RTS of pure genious design. The maps are well done, with plenty of natural cover to take advantage of and the campaign is both intense and full of surprise moments where you suddenly find yourself having to fall back to previously taken areas. The AI does suffer somewhat from moments of herp derp confusion and directional orders to vehicle like the Panther and STUH's can suddenly become ""BONZAI CHARGE STRAIGHT INTO THE ENEMY'S AT GUNS!"" but overall the game mechanics are solid and for the most part balanced between the 4 factions. My personal favorite is the Wehmacht and Panzer Elite for a number of reasons but one of the biggest reasons to love playing the Germans are the Nebelwerfers. Seriously those beasts, although they may seem rather unweildy and insignificant, can turn a battle around in seconds. If you have a line of them outside the enemy's base it's game over. It really it a personal triumph for Relic in it's own right that 10 years later it's still my personal favorite RTS even surpassing C&C Generals, a game I played religiously for many years until I picked up this game a few years back. Anyone who loves World War 2 history and is also a fan of RTS games, THIS is the game for you!			"

												Few games can revolutionize an entire genre of gaming, but ‘Company of Heroes’ is one of them. From the high-quality next-gen graphics to the unique style of RTS gameplay, Company of Heroes should be hailed as the definitive RTS game.It's a brilliant combination of incredibly deep real-time strategy, beautiful presentation and innovative features that make it one of the best gaming experiences of 2006 to date.There's just the right amount of micromanagement to start without feeling like you're ""fixing"" bad AI by controlling every single movement.It’s a gritty Second World War caper that loads the gaming experience to the hilt, leaving players battered, bruised and thoroughly stirred.

												I have played this game for a few hours and, in my opinion, it is great. I have played the original and the new steam version (of which the hours played won’t show in here and if you want multiplayer it is advised you play the latter) as well as its DLC's and all of it was worth every penny, even today. The atmosphere is gripping, one way the dev's have made it so is that units, both infantry and motorised, will speak amongst themselves or at least seem to. Though it isn't a large-scale unit mosh pit like that of StarCraft or other RTS games it still gives you that feeling as if it is large scale. Strategy is very much emphasized as maps are designed to require a strategic mind to claim victory, some maps are large with easily defensible positions provided the enemy does not clear a hedge way or repair a structure that allows flanking such as a bridge, while other maps are smaller and require more fast paced decision makingMechanics wise it is still wonderful to play; the cover system allows infantry to sit behind walls or other similar structures to gain a defensive bonus represented by a shield icon on the unit’s health-bar and infantry can garrison structures for a defensive bonus as well. Each faction has three support trees’ respectively (I’m going off memory here so the naming might be off); The US has Infantry, Airborne and Armour, British have Royal Artillery, Commando and Royal Engineers, Wehrmacht has Terror, Blitzkrieg and Defensive Operations and finally the Panzer Elite have Scorched Earth, Luftwaffe and Anti-Tank Support. Each of the listed doctrines or support trees’ have different support abilities to choose from respectively, for example with the British Royal Artillery is as what is says it is; artillery specialisation for long range bombardment and bonuses while Royal Engineers are specialised in stronger fortifications and can call in three variants of the Churchill Tank for reinforcement.However, there are shortcomings as it is an older game; for example, there is no way to change the keyboard shortcuts, or at least no way that is obvious to me. Furthermore, there are times where the AI will act ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, an example would be when I was playing against two AI controlled Axis factions (having the Opposing Fronts DLC unlocks British for allies and Panzer Elite for Germany), both were Panzer Elite and both had chosen the Luftwaffe doctrine tree and for some reason both spammed the reinforcement power for 1st tier Luftwaffe infantry and - except for a handful of Panzer Elite Grenadiers - nothing else. In addition I have found that you could easily prevent enemy tank movement by placing a mortar or machine gun crew on a bridge, wait the that unit to be wiped out leaving their weapon behind, and chuckling as the heavy armoured Panther’s and Panzer IV’s cannot travers over or around it and getting stuck in the process so none of their infantry can pick it up to move it. Despite these hindrances though the game still is as great now as it was when it was released. I would fully recommend.  "

												2015, the game is almost 10 years old now.... and yet it still feels great. the game looks and plays like a game that is half, maybe even a quarter of it's age. sure, it does have it's problems, like i currently have some kind of grahical issue, still allowing me to play, but i can't see any details or any troops at all, atleast i have multiple PC's, still letting me play it :). I like to use this game as something to calm me down, after playing another game which frustrates me a lot. it's very satisfying to build up a whole assault, and then just unleash it on the enemies. I haven't tried online, so i can't say if the online is any good, but i have played the majority of the campaign and a lot of skirmish battles. I also played most of the ""Tales of Valor"" campaign on my old computer a few years ago, but i unfortunately couldn't save it. TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THE GAME: just note that the majority of battles aren't quick, in both campaign and in skirmish. I personally have had battles that have gone for 6 hours+, so it's definitely not a ""might just play a little"" game, if you want to play and complete a battle, you will have to put in a few good hours.

												2015, the game is almost 10 years old now.... and yet it still feels great. the game looks and plays like a game that is half, maybe even a quarter of it's age. sure, it does have it's problems, like i currently have some kind of grahical issue, still allowing me to play, but i can't see any details or any troops at all, atleast i have multiple PC's, still letting me play it :). I like to use this game as something to calm me down, after playing another game which frustrates me a lot. it's very satisfying to build up a whole assault, and then just unleash it on the enemies. I haven't tried online, so i can't say if the online is any good, but i have played the majority of the campaign and a lot of skirmish battles. I also played most of the ""Tales of Valor"" campaign on my old computer a few years ago, but i unfortunately couldn't save it. TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THE GAME: just note that the majority of battles aren't quick, in both campaign and in skirmish. I personally have had battles that have gone for 6 hours+, so it's definitely not a ""might just play a little"" game, if you want to play and complete a battle, you will have to put in a few good hours.

												one of the best games I have ever played. The story is good and so is the custom battles. but multiplayer is where its at. Don't be fooled at my time.I have over 400+ on company of heroes new steam version which has the multiplayer. This game is simply a great RTS game. I really loved and enjoyed playing this game for 3-4 years now. The online community is still up and running. I bought the DLC as well tales of valor and oppossing fronts. I highly recommend it as it adds more content and armies to play as. I wasnt disappointed in this game. I believe this game is really and i mean it money well spent. P.S. its world war two!			"

The game holds its own wand was a pleasure to play. The single player missions are quite long and challenging. I found it hard to find faults with the game and I believe it is an enjoyable experience for fans of RTS games or those that enjoy MOBAs			"

												Company of Heroes, by far the best World War II strategy game of all time. It contains some of the most intense actionand it will challenge you. It is also a great game even if you don't have any of the expansion packs. I personally recommend you to play with a friend because the A.I isn't the best at all times. Nevertheless, a good game, agood price, and endless fun, I'm glad to say this game deserves a 9/10.			"

												I am only a little over an hour into the game when wrighting this review for Company of Heroes, but I can already reccomend it. The maps for each level is huge so it can get a bit chaotic when you have more than one Company at diferent parts of the map. The A.I is a bit challenging exspecially when their is a lot of them but the game gives you so many abilities that you have many options to defeat them. For $20 you are getting a whole lot of content as their is a lot of missions in the campaign.			"

												Company of Heroes is far more than just another WW2 RTS. It's one of the best RTS's ever made.It's gritty and realistic in its depiction of violence, but at the same time, it's funny from the soldiers' spontaneous lines. It's tactically complex with flanking maneuvers, defensive advantages, and special abilities, but easy to pick up. It's brutally difficult with its extremely tough AI, but ultimately isn't frustrating. The campaign is phenomenal, and the expansions are well worth playing (though Tales of Valor isn't quite as good as Opposing Fronts), so if you're an RTS fan, you owe it to yourself to play this. It really has to be experienced rather than explained.			"

												Company of Heroes (CoH) is literally a ground-breaking real-time strategy (RTS) game that is set during World War II. The game plays with a heavy-hand in squad-based maneuvers, but it also features large armored units and unique aerial strikes which are limited as earnable powerups. The setting and the presentation of CoH is incredible compared to most modern-day RTS games given the quality of the maps and all the interactions that can be seen in the environment from mortar strikes to building sandbags on the spot. The drawback to CoH can be its constant micromanaging as you struggle to earn resources, build an army, path your units to destination while gathering intel on your enemie's whereabouts. However, each game can be quite satisfying where your strategy can shift given your choice of specializations (armored, infantry or engineers).			"

												Excellent game, the visuals, audio, tough AI, intensity of the combat gameplay all excel over others in the genre. And everything getting blown apart is awesome. Evenly balanced, actually has physics. I can't think of anything in this game that isn't good! The best part is the use of tactical moves such as flanking. I'm not even a fan of the RTS genre, so well done. The game requires thinking instead of massing units. It encourages usage of your brain instead.			"

												If you are fairly new to the RTS genre and want to play a game with hardly a learning curve, this is the game for you. If you're experienced with the RTS genre games but love WW2, this is also for you. This game pits you in multiple campaigns containing missions from anything from full-on armored convoy ambushes, stealth missions, to delivering supplies to a certain location. The mechanics of the AI however, are very frustrating at times. Example being, if you're trying to get your squad out of a middle of the road under heavy MG fire, sometimes they refuse to run and just decided to lay there, and your squad ends up dying rather than having a chance of survival for future encounters. The tank movement is a bit gritty aswell, when it comes to rotation. The tanks seem to back up when you don't want them to. Or they will rotate their rears where you do not want them to be vulnerable, and your rear hull armor/engines will get end up getting blown to bits. Besides these two small things, I have found it rather amusing that when one of your units get set ablaze, sometimes they will run towards an enemy squad and attempt to spread fire to the enemy units. Also if you have the Minesweeper attachment for your shermans, you can use it to tear away the limbs of your foes as it is just a bunch of spinning metal blades.Everything in this game is both good against certain things, and weak against others which makes this incredibly balanced, and you find yourself producing a wide variety of units and forming many kinds of tactics. What i love aswell, is that you can position your MG teams and mortars in a specific direction, and they will attack anything in that view which makes it super easy to attack and defend certain areas on a map.I truly enjoy this game, with the combination of epic soundtrack, explosions, and people screaming. 10/10 "

												Its an amazing game!!!!!!! They apply the laws of physics. Remains stay for a bit, and vehicle remains dont degrade over time. Very fun to see people and even dead bodies go flying. Also nice how they added real things like rescuing wounded and cover. Only things that should be added are an anti-tank defence structure, as if tanks reach your base, you usually lose. They should also make it so that infantry can be run over if they get too close and dont move. The only bug is that the enemy is so cheap. Hard to win.			"

												Where do I begin... Well, lets kick this review off by me saying this, I enjoy playing this game whenever I get on. This game is very enjoyable each time I hop on. But there are somethings people who will be getting into the game. #1. You will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if you've never played this game.#2. If your win/loss ratio isn't at least above .500 expect to be kicked for being a noob.#3. Learn the factions:A. Allies- Overall under dogs compared to the overwhemly German Factions of the Panzer Elite and Wermacht. One way to beat the axis, is to at all costs stop them from producing tanks. Get good infantry such as Rangers, or upgrade your airborne.For Britain, I like producing my Sherman Fireflys, and basically using Artillery. B. Axis- My favorite faction(can you tell by my name?) which has the best tanks in the damn game. If you can get panzers with a good amount of infantry to support your tanks call most of the game GG.Overall Grsde of the Game-AIf your new don't expect to automatically get in a game and whoop some butt. Chances are your going to get kicked. Play up to 100 Skirms with the Computer then begin playing more Multiplayer. If you have any questions feel free to comment.			"

												Company of Heroes is by far one of the best RTS game I've ever played. I enjoyed it as it allowed you to immerse yourself in a whole new world full of explosions and bullets going everywhere. When I was younger ( I'm 15 as I'm writing this) I used to play a lot of Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3, and when I found this I remembered those ol' good days. The game starts off slowly with just a few units and by the end of the first campaign you feel like you have accomplished a lot. There were a few sad moments in the game which was a brilliant part of the story. I spend endless hours trying different techniques and most of my playtime comes from a single mission wich I was stuck on. I have just finished the Invasion of Normandy and I felt sad when I finished the campaign.  The developers made the game in such a way that you get attached to it, better say dependent. I still have the two DLCs to complete, but nothing will top the first experience of playing this game. I will forsure replay it until I die as this is one of the bests games I've ever played.N.B.My actual play time for Invasion of Normandy is 43 hours.I suggest buying this game if you feel like spending hours cursing the Germans and their bloody artillery wiping off all your units and the excesive amount of Panzers they have.10/10 would play forever again			"

												Company of Heroes is by far one of the best RTS game I've ever played. I enjoyed it as it allowed you to immerse yourself in a whole new world full of explosions and bullets going everywhere. When I was younger ( I'm 15 as I'm writing this) I used to play a lot of Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3, and when I found this I remembered those ol' good days. The game starts off slowly with just a few units and by the end of the first campaign you feel like you have accomplished a lot. There were a few sad moments in the game which was a brilliant part of the story. I spend endless hours trying different techniques and most of my playtime comes from a single mission wich I was stuck on. I have just finished the Invasion of Normandy and I felt sad when I finished the campaign.  The developers made the game in such a way that you get attached to it, better say dependent. I still have the two DLCs to complete, but nothing will top the first experience of playing this game. I will forsure replay it until I die as this is one of the bests games I've ever played.N.B.My actual play time for Invasion of Normandy is 43 hours.I suggest buying this game if you feel like spending hours cursing the Germans and their bloody artillery wiping off all your units and the excesive amount of Panzers they have.10/10 would play forever again			"

												Where do I begin... Well, lets kick this review off by me saying this, I enjoy playing this game whenever I get on. This game is very enjoyable each time I hop on. But there are somethings people who will be getting into the game. #1. You will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if you've never played this game.#2. If your win/loss ratio isn't at least above .500 expect to be kicked for being a noob.#3. Learn the factions:A. Allies- Overall under dogs compared to the overwhemly German Factions of the Panzer Elite and Wermacht. One way to beat the axis, is to at all costs stop them from producing tanks. Get good infantry such as Rangers, or upgrade your airborne.For Britain, I like producing my Sherman Fireflys, and basically using Artillery. B. Axis- My favorite faction(can you tell by my name?) which has the best tanks in the damn game. If you can get panzers with a good amount of infantry to support your tanks call most of the game GG.Overall Grsde of the Game-AIf your new don't expect to automatically get in a game and whoop some butt. Chances are your going to get kicked. Play up to 100 Skirms with the Computer then begin playing more Multiplayer. If you have any questions feel free to comment.			"

												Amazing WWII RTS game that lets you control the war in Europe. You would never think this game was released in 2007, the graphics/audio hold up to any game today. It has some of the best animations I have seen in a strategy game resulting in realistic and brutal combat. Tons of replay value with its 6 campaigns and active mulitplayer. If you have any interest in RTS games or WWII, get this game!!			"

												This game is, for me, the greatest top down strategy game of all time.With a resource system that requires constant aggression, deep strategic choices in your style of commander, solid multiplayer, highly tactical combat based on cover, positioning and abilities, no game does strategic combat like this one does. Not starcraft, not company of heroes 2, none of them, the closest to this one is the original Dawn of War and it has nothing on this game.Company of Heroes 2 is a travesty from the company that brought us this, accept no substitute, if you want a strategy game at all, and you don't own Company of Heroes BUY COMPANY OF HEROES.Also the campaigns are fun as ♥♥♥♥.10/10, the standard by which all RTS's are judged.

												Company of Heroes is a very interesting twist on the status quo of stratagy. It's fast pace, yet very tactical. Instead of massing units like most ofther stratagies it often requires deploying the right troops, and sometimes knowing when to withdraw instead of dualing it out. It's single player campaign attempts to be emotional, and it does have a realistic side. Unlike Men of War's mechanic of cover however, the troops sometimes like wandering else where when fighting, proving to be annoying if you want them to stay put. The diffrences of three factions, yet being the same is also very interesting.Bases in this game are less of an influence then in others, and in some missions you have no base. The sit coms are nice, and some twists in the campaign is also fun. One problem I have is that there is no way to kill a unit you don't need, or need to remove to get more population, forcing you to suiside it instead...which...ehh... The second problem is that some missions carry over items, buildings, and units from your last encounter on that map. Although interesting, it makes it very difficult to transition from what was once a defense to now an assault. All your MG enplacments are now not as useful, and you end up with rather odd (but funny) situations. For example in the brittish campaign against the german airfield. The second part had me constructing defenses and had my command vehicle on one of the trencthes I had built in the prior mission...it was funny but somewhat troublsome.I got this game on sale and felt like it was a good buy. It might be worth full price, so pick it up if you need something long to acomplish.			"

												Certainly one of the 2 or 3 best RTS of all time. Much better gameplay than CoH2, though the presentation has a lower quality. The gameplay is less convoluted than for CoH2, which is the main flaw of the second version. It is an absolute must. The only problem is that for multiplayer battles, you must use the Steam version. The Steam version is buggy and deserves a patch. For singleplayers, there is no problem, use the non Steam version which is included.			"

												One of the very best II. WW RTS games on the market. Company of Heroes offers countless hours of Campaign, Singleplayer and Multiplayer gameplay.The campaign leads you together with the American Army through France towards Germany and let's you reaply some battles of the second world war. While not being always historicly correct, the campaign is incredibly fun to play and offers a challenge to dedicated players on a higher difficutly.The single player consists of the just now mentioned campaign and the skirmish mode, where you can play with and against AI players on different maps. The Multiplayer Part is the same, just that you can play together with other human players too. What does the skirmish offer?You can play either Germany of the USA and build infantry, heavy weapons, armored cars, tanks, artillery, bunkers [...] to conquer territory & ultimatively destroy your enemy.  To do that you have to build a base, research upgrades, conquer waypoints and logistic spots. You gain ressources thanks to those and can build/upgrade whatever you desire.   The variety of units is totally ok and there are countless strategies on how to win a round. The different commander perks which you can choose ingame add new ways of tactic too. You can drop supplies, call in air support, ask for veteran tanks [...]  The graphics are top notch. If you are not satisfied with the allready existing one you can even use a few HD mods to imporve them even more.  This leads to another topic: Mods. You can download and install free mods to add new maps, commanders, armies (russians, eastern armies [...]) to add even more variety and fun!  I totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games in the WW II setting! 10/10			"

Seeing and hearing explosions leaving behind craters while you crush buildings with mortars or burn barricaded troops with flamethrower pioneers evokes a more realistic image of the Blitzkrieg than ever before.

Originally posted on October 8, 2006Company of Heroes is a very focused and engaging game that plays off of squad dynamics and control point mechanics on a larger scale than seen before. It captures the WWII setting most admirably, with many historical weapons and vehicles, not to mention settings. Lets get to it then. Gameplay- The gameplay of company of heroes is fast paced and action oriented. The only way you are going to be able to sit back in your base and get rich on resources is if you have already taken most of the map. You win though fast decision making and decisive action, and mistakes are costly. Units cost quite a bit, and resource flow is rather slow, so make wise choices. The cover and physics system works very well to make the game feel real, and come alive as you play it. The enviornment changes with your progress.Dynamic cratering provides a new element of gameplay as well.The A.I. is really incredible for this game, both for the enemy and for your men. Anything higher than easy in the difficulty setting is decently challenging, and it just ramps up and up. your men know when to take cover, reorient, to return fire, and take tactical initiative in fire fights. The enemy flanks, counterattacks, uses smoke screens, airstrikes, and even fients. Overall, the squad system works well with single vehicle and upgradable unit and veterancy sytem. This , complimented by doctrine trees, creates quite alot of gameplay variety. The few complaints I have in this game are about gameplay, however. As great as it is, it is very focused. There is no ww2 rts that could benefit from seeing more content like company of heroes. There are only 2 factions (very deep ones, abelit) US, and Germany, and the campaign is entirely from the US point of view in Normandy. If this game had different theatres, years, and maybe a russian or japanese faction. I could see it being proelled to monumental hieghts. I understand it does not focus on naval or air combat, so the pacific theatre is not such a good idea, although it could work, with the doctrine abilities (airstrikes, navla bombardment, landing craft reinforemnts etc.). However, the Eastern front and a russian faction is a must do for an expansion, along with a battle of the bulge/ market garden/ berlin campaign. A British faction would serve well here. But I digress. What the game does do, it does wellGraphics-The graphics are brilliant. modern effects mixed with the detail of an fps from a few years ago in an RTS? it is insane. The units are the best I've ever seen in an rts. normal and specular mapping are put to goo use here, and the physics engine is beautiful. However, the game does need more blood, and more damage modeling for tanks. When a tank takes a round (when it doesnt bounce off) it should at least dent it. Sound- Very nice, though limited score of music. It really adds to the atmosphere. The sounds themselves are immersive and amazing. This game withe bass on my sub all the way up is incredible. very good attention to detail in the sound area.Value- 15 very tough missions, AI skirmishes, and multiplayer ship with this game, along with 2 factions, and a great variety in units, upgrades, abilities, and tactics. The scope could have been more, especially in the area of missions and factons, but it isn't that big of a deal. CoH is a very focused game.I would reccomend this game to any RTS fan, but be warned, dont start here if you are new to the gnere, this game is TOUGH.			"

												This is without a doubt the best combination RTS and World War II game I've ever encountered. With expansions, this offers so much potential in terms of strategies, and the weapons seem for the most part historically balanced, albeit with some units being one offs in real life. Company of Heroes gives HOURS of game play with relatively simple to learn, but difficult to master, controls; one well played game can go for 4 hours against similarly skilled opponents. If you like RTS games, and see this up for sale, or in some deal, it would be doing yourself a favor to get this game.			"

												This is a game for fairly serious RTS players only. There are a large number of factors and tactical considerations to ponder, and a majority of the maps are not really fair. I would warn players that many would find this game tedious and boring if they are not in the right mindset when playing the game. You have infantry and tanks, as well as everything in between. The objectives are dynamic, in that the game presents them in a way that does not seem like the entire mission is ""go here and kill everything along the way"". Progress is generally slow, and the game tends to rush you. The pathfinding is a bit suspect. The satisfaction is not.There have been times that I had to quit playing to keep cool since the game likes to suggest that you do stupid things and then scold you for screwing up. It is really annoying when it YELLS at you to do A, then A is obviously going to end in death.The expansions are more of the same. One thing I cannot easily comprehend is how this game manages to make tank battles kinda boring and tedious. Probably has to do with the pathfinding.			"

												Company of Heroes is totally hardcorest.  You has to micro-manage like crazy while the AI makes dozens of moves at one time, has units with more health, and shoots impossibly far, ignoring the fogs of war.  The game always has save file problems, which makes me replay 4-hour levels over again, which is okay cuz the game is hardcorest.  Peeps online are pretty cool too.  Their servers always say ""No N00BS"" and then they get mad when I join and spend my time bulding observational posts, jeeps, and medic centers.			"

												This was the reason that I got steam in 2011, as a friend had wanted to gift this to me.I now have over 200 hours with the New Steam Version included, and after 8 years of this game being out, it is still amazing.The mod support has extended the life of this game so much, even without the ability for Steam Workshop, which CoH 2 has. The mods available are varied enough to give everyone something they like, with different maps or game modes included in most of the large total conversion mods such as Blitzkrieg or Eastern Front.The base game itself is also extremely fun and very user friendly; it doesn't take long to get the hang of the game, and you can use the very enjoyable campaign as a running tutorial before getting into the multiplayer, which is still populated by the die hard fans.The expansions are also well worth the price of admission if you're a fan of the game, especially now that they are at such low prices, having been out for quite a while.This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played, and one of the best ever made, RTS or otherwise, and it's well worth buying.

												Fantastic RTS game with excellent replayability. The game basically allows you to experience all of your favourite WW2 films from a commanders perspective. Though the scale of troops and battlefield map is relatively small, there is a variety of tools and toys you can play around with. The single player campaigns are addictive. A good single player game needs to have a well-polished story and character progression, here gameplay is well balanced with story which makes completing objectives interesting. I haven't played Multiplayer, but I have a feeling that the multiplayer aspect is where this game shines and the single player is good for a quiet weekend or for casual players who just want a little bit of fun. RTS and war fans MUST play this game.			"

												Company of Heroes is totally hardcorest.  You has to micro-manage like crazy while the AI makes dozens of moves at one time, has units with more health, and shoots impossibly far, ignoring the fogs of war.  The game always has save file problems, which makes me replay 4-hour levels over again, which is okay cuz the game is hardcorest.  Peeps online are pretty cool too.  Their servers always say ""No N00BS"" and then they get mad when I join and spend my time bulding observational posts, jeeps, and medic centers.			"

Originally posted on October 8, 2006Company of Heroes is a very focused and engaging game that plays off of squad dynamics and control point mechanics on a larger scale than seen before. It captures the WWII setting most admirably, with many historical weapons and vehicles, not to mention settings. Lets get to it then. Gameplay- The gameplay of company of heroes is fast paced and action oriented. The only way you are going to be able to sit back in your base and get rich on resources is if you have already taken most of the map. You win though fast decision making and decisive action, and mistakes are costly. Units cost quite a bit, and resource flow is rather slow, so make wise choices. The cover and physics system works very well to make the game feel real, and come alive as you play it. The enviornment changes with your progress.Dynamic cratering provides a new element of gameplay as well.The A.I. is really incredible for this game, both for the enemy and for your men. Anything higher than easy in the difficulty setting is decently challenging, and it just ramps up and up. your men know when to take cover, reorient, to return fire, and take tactical initiative in fire fights. The enemy flanks, counterattacks, uses smoke screens, airstrikes, and even fients. Overall, the squad system works well with single vehicle and upgradable unit and veterancy sytem. This , complimented by doctrine trees, creates quite alot of gameplay variety. The few complaints I have in this game are about gameplay, however. As great as it is, it is very focused. There is no ww2 rts that could benefit from seeing more content like company of heroes. There are only 2 factions (very deep ones, abelit) US, and Germany, and the campaign is entirely from the US point of view in Normandy. If this game had different theatres, years, and maybe a russian or japanese faction. I could see it being proelled to monumental hieghts. I understand it does not focus on naval or air combat, so the pacific theatre is not such a good idea, although it could work, with the doctrine abilities (airstrikes, navla bombardment, landing craft reinforemnts etc.). However, the Eastern front and a russian faction is a must do for an expansion, along with a battle of the bulge/ market garden/ berlin campaign. A British faction would serve well here. But I digress. What the game does do, it does wellGraphics-The graphics are brilliant. modern effects mixed with the detail of an fps from a few years ago in an RTS? it is insane. The units are the best I've ever seen in an rts. normal and specular mapping are put to goo use here, and the physics engine is beautiful. However, the game does need more blood, and more damage modeling for tanks. When a tank takes a round (when it doesnt bounce off) it should at least dent it. Sound- Very nice, though limited score of music. It really adds to the atmosphere. The sounds themselves are immersive and amazing. This game withe bass on my sub all the way up is incredible. very good attention to detail in the sound area.Value- 15 very tough missions, AI skirmishes, and multiplayer ship with this game, along with 2 factions, and a great variety in units, upgrades, abilities, and tactics. The scope could have been more, especially in the area of missions and factons, but it isn't that big of a deal. CoH is a very focused game.I would reccomend this game to any RTS fan, but be warned, dont start here if you are new to the gnere, this game is TOUGH.			"

												Fantastic RTS game with excellent replayability. The game basically allows you to experience all of your favourite WW2 films from a commanders perspective. Though the scale of troops and battlefield map is relatively small, there is a variety of tools and toys you can play around with. The single player campaigns are addictive. A good single player game needs to have a well-polished story and character progression, here gameplay is well balanced with story which makes completing objectives interesting. I haven't played Multiplayer, but I have a feeling that the multiplayer aspect is where this game shines and the single player is good for a quiet weekend or for casual players who just want a little bit of fun. RTS and war fans MUST play this game.			"

												Let me just say right now: This is the best WW2 game I have ever played. Battles are glorious and (For those fellow DoW fans) This is nothing like Dawn of War, Sure the core structure is similar but everything is different. This game requires you to be constantly on the move, you cannot camp your army at your base until its fully upgraded because the Axis/Allies WILL dominate the map and they can be ruthless. As soon as your spawn you'll want to send out troops to gain land by capturing control points (Strategic points) These points are far more important as they give you Fuel (For cars etc) weaponry (Upgrades). Although at times I think that the accuracy of guns should of been increased, the game is fairly balanced. 9/10 - It's just a shame that there aren't more factions to play as (US and Germnay for Vanilla game, British and Panzer elite for Opposing Fronts DLC)			"

Concepts like line of fire and supply lines come into action, making this a very fun game. The action never stops and the battles all seem like important engagements.Graphically beautiful and awesome sound effects to boot.

Battles are still intense, gameplay is still flawless, the thing that is most appealing is the fact that if you can think of a strategy, you can pretty much impliment it in the game.The historical accuracy is also a big plus from me. Fantastic game, definitely worth every penny.Ooh, don't invest in the sequel, though.

												One of my favorite strategy games. This game is fun and even challenging in a good way. This is for people that like challenges and use of strategic thinking. This game have it all: infantry, special infantry, light vehicles, tanks and most coolest thing: artillery. If you are playing against good opponent you can't just win with one of these playing styles, you have to combine them and use wisely which is what makes this game fun and challenging. This game is something in between the Dota 2 and realistic strategies like Men of War.Pros:+Lots of possibilites and styles to play+Good graphics for such an old game+Well designed maps and 4vs4 maps +Amazing and fun voice overs and sounds +Simple and easy interface+Game effects, explosions, smoothiness Cons-Not enough 4vs4 maps and other maps aswell-Can become unbalanced teams in multiplayer, sometimes host of the game does this on purpose for an easy win-Need more players overall in CoH multiplayerRecommended to people that like challenges and use strategic thinking. Also to those that like wars and it's history and just overall anyone who plays for fun and enjoys battles. "

												This game is simply an amazing piece of thought and work put together. It has been my favorite strategy game since I was much younger; in my teenagehood. I have played it on and off almost since it came out! The community hasnt been the greatest since the switchover to Steam/when SEGA bought the rights to the game; but there is still a large population on daily. Multiplayer is simply amazing; such a great feeling when you get to artillery a bunch of troops; or an enemy base/fortification.... or landing airborne troops behind enemy lines to cause havok. There is definitley the ability to implement strategy into the game; every decision in the beginning of a match (((In my opinion)) will determine the outcome of the rest of the match... matches can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 or more hours depending on how good the players are defensively and offensively. The game is based on strategic points on the given map being host; maps can be small-very large.... each team much advance towards the enemy team; while capturing points ((Its sort of like territory)) - the more territory you grab and hold; the more resources and population cap you aquire; giving you the edge over the enemy team. Whats awesome about long multiplayer matches; is that you can be winning for a very long time; and then be losing out of no where... its the same vice-versa. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a good strategy game that will keep them interested for hours on end.			"

It only does the west front but the presentation is amazing, the soundscape is absolutely beautiful and the game is just fun! It is obvious that they wanted to make Save Private Ryan the video game, but I don't care much - it's just so fun...This is one of my favorite video games of all time and I wish I had the patience to write more about how great it is, but writing here means not playing CoH. :(Definetly recommended!

												I reccoment the Normandy campaign, the rest of the expansions I tried them and they are really crap. Like a ""Hero"" mode or really quick and empty...Also the Normandy campaign at some point like 3\4 of it becomes really repetitive but it is still fun and accurate from historical point of view or at least respectful. The way instead of how paratroopers in other campaign are treated or how germans are ""rendered"" with a strong cultural bias and german accent like we were still culturally all in the berlin wall era, is really terrible and actually my negative comment is for the gameplay of the expansions.I rate positively the main part. Composed by many missions (at least 16 of them), again... some are really repepetitive and empty. Some with large maps and story are really nice.Make sure to play this game with at least 1 gb videocard and at least a good processor. Mine Pentium 4 is not good to enjoy the game really... and all the difects or the plus are augmented on my pc so I see if a game is good or not when ""it gives its worst graphically"":..So my strong suggestion is not to buy expansions of this game but just the main game.Have fun, check my wish list and see you around.

Believe the hype - this game is as great 10 years later than when it was initially released.In many ways this is a throwback to when C&C games were still great, but adds more to the genre without adding too much.If you haven't played an RTS game this is definitely the best one to start with (namely because getting C&C Red Alert to install must be a nightmare 20 years later).

												As a casual player, games like these really ought to have a pause game feature so we can assess the situation at our own pace and issue orders while in pause. I'm talking about single player mode ofcourse. The AI always uses distraction tactics that can make it very hard to get a good hold of what's going on soon enough. (EDIT: After 30 hours of gameplay, it occurred to me to google up the hotkeys since I suspected there must me more than the game shows us. AND THERE ARE. The game menu does not list the keyboard bindings and so I had no idea that the pause key could actually pause the game. This isn't indicated as an option on the gamplay HUD either :/  )While it truly is a fun game. It comes with it's fair share of big bugs. The biggest was that the game would always start in windowed mode. There is no setting in the options that can change this. I had to look up the issue to find these solutions :Solution 1: ALT+ENTER worked once. Solution 2: The one that worked so far is:- go to Documents\My Games\Company of HeroesOpen Local.ini with Notepad.Change the line'screendevice=DirectX10 rendering device'To'screendevice=DirectX9 rendering device'Save and start COHBug #2: The halftrack vehicles are supposed to be APVs. We should be able to load personnel into them, and you can... ONCE. You load one group into a truck and that's it for the rest of the level. (EDIT: 20 hours of gameplay and I now find out that this happens once you upgrade the half track. Which is a shame really. )Bug #3: The save game function is faulty. It does not save the game properly most of the time. If you choose to load a saved game, instead of picking up where you left off, it will start from the beginning of the mission. I thought this was done purposely by the developers. But it doesnt always work this way. This means I have wasted a lot of ime in being forced to restart the game level. I'm a risk averse player, which means I like to take my time and set up a flawless defence. This takes up a LOT of time. So being forced to restart a level because of a chink just upsets me.			"

												As a casual player, games like these really ought to have a pause game feature so we can assess the situation at our own pace and issue orders while in pause. I'm talking about single player mode ofcourse. The AI always uses distraction tactics that can make it very hard to get a good hold of what's going on soon enough. (EDIT: After 30 hours of gameplay, it occurred to me to google up the hotkeys since I suspected there must me more than the game shows us. AND THERE ARE. The game menu does not list the keyboard bindings and so I had no idea that the pause key could actually pause the game. This isn't indicated as an option on the gamplay HUD either :/  )While it truly is a fun game. It comes with it's fair share of big bugs. The biggest was that the game would always start in windowed mode. There is no setting in the options that can change this.

												A Real review:The game is a new stand on RTS. It's constant action and well thought out design makes it a personal favourite.In the game the units are not based on level or skill; simply how you use them. This makes the game a real suit for experienced RTS players, the game is no longer based on how fast you play; more on the fact on how. You could win an entire game with rifleman aslong as you used the proper tactics and strategy. Another thing I enjoyed about this is the mod community; constantly updating and creative original content comes out daily with motivated moders. This makes it so that the game always has a new suprise and always enjoyable.One of the things I did not like is the limited game modes on the vanilla ( It can obviously be fixed with mods and purchasing of the other DLC's, But this was my only dislike )Other then that I'd rate this game 7.9			"

Relic is at the top of their game here and have set the bar high for any future World War II strategy titles and RTS games in general. Completely destructible environments are used to enhance gameplay and create some of the most satisfyingly war torn landscapes seen in video games. A fulfilling campaign, addictive gameplay, detailed visuals, and powerful use of sound make up a complete experience with very few problems.			"

												One of the still standing RTS games from the old era. Empire Earth is dead, Age of Empires is dead. Long live Company of Heroes! The RTS system used in the Company of Heroes gameplay is vastly different from the other popular RTS of its era. It is highly recommended to go through the tutorial (as I did not the first time I played it) because the way you control and create units it is based on squads, and that gives the gameplay a lot more dynamism when you are openly battling the other factions and taking territories. The graphics are quite amazing, with destructible environment. You can even zoom in to see each of your units! Gameplay-wise this is a highly strategical game in which the occupation of territories actually holds a real value, compared to other RTS. So remember to have one or two squads around the corner ready to surprise the enemy, as they may not be expecting you to have rigged with explosives the bridge their tanks are in! This is a highly replayable, highly entertaining, time consuming RTS. Before I bought it in Steam I had the disc (oh, such times!) and I had some pretty amazing, long lasting matches which sometimes had to be called off because well... we needed to eat and let the sun outside hit us. Either way, in 2017 it still is a terrific game to be playing, either this one or the sequel, but keep up the support for this series!10/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.			"

												If you like WW2 games or a strategy game with an interesting cover system and a nice squad mechanic( ex: one unit of privates have 6 members and for many other games its...say 1 unit of zerglings is just 1 zergling). The campaign is a bit lackluster, but the multiplayer/skirmish mode(singleplayer version of multiplayer) will last you a bit longer. The AI is nice, but it can be extremely frustrating too(especially in skirmish mode). But overall its a good solid game.			"

												This game is still incredibly fun after 10 years. Very well detailed, well written, and fun RTS. I've completed every campaign at least 5 times. The almost fully destructable environments are something you just don't see in even today's games. The only gripes I have are that it's almost too easy (certain missions are virtually impossible to fail), Snipers are VERY OP, minor AI issues, minor pathing issues, & no Achievements (came out before Steam made those).I've seen it go on sale time to time for about $2.50. For that price it is a can't miss.Highly Recommended. "

												One of the still standing RTS games from the old era. Empire Earth is dead, Age of Empires is dead. Long live Company of Heroes! The RTS system used in the Company of Heroes gameplay is vastly different from the other popular RTS of its era. It is highly recommended to go through the tutorial (as I did not the first time I played it) because the way you control and create units it is based on squads, and that gives the gameplay a lot more dynamism when you are openly battling the other factions and taking territories. The graphics are quite amazing, with destructible environment. You can even zoom in to see each of your units! Gameplay-wise this is a highly strategical game in which the occupation of territories actually holds a real value, compared to other RTS. So remember to have one or two squads around the corner ready to surprise the enemy, as they may not be expecting you to have rigged with explosives the bridge their tanks are in! This is a highly replayable, highly entertaining, time consuming RTS. Before I bought it in Steam I had the disc (oh, such times!) and I had some pretty amazing, long lasting matches which sometimes had to be called off because well... we needed to eat and let the sun outside hit us. Either way, in 2017 it still is a terrific game to be playing, either this one or the sequel, but keep up the support for this series!10/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.			"

 Company Of Heroes 2006 Genre: Rts, HistoricalActivity: MinimalWorkshop: NoDLC: YesUser reviews: 96% positiveMetacritic 93/100 Brief Description A semi-classic genre defining WW2 Real-time-strategy game with a sequal which means its not as active anymore.  My first impressions I recently got this game for $3.24 and honestly, I don't regret it. I got into the gameplay with the first hour of playing. There are so many play styles and game modes. 4v4, 3v3, 2v2, 1v1 with an assortment of AI difficulties, 60+ Maps, 2 gamemodes and many unique factions to choose from. I chose to do a full tank squad that consisted of 10 tanks that would dominate. The commanders options are pretty cool but get old quite quick. Pros 1. Great gameplay2. Multiple units to play with3. Wide varient of maps4. Battles5. Single-Player/skirmish6. Replayable7. The graphics have aged well8. Commander mode (Air/Infantry/Armoured focus modes)9. Cheap10. Amazing unit strats and commands Cons 1. Crashing is common2. 16 gig download but 7.6 gig download for the new steam version?3. Only 2 fractions without dlc4. Multiplayer is slightly dead5. Annoying camera controls6. Strange money system7. Tedious gameplay that can drag on if something stupid happens8. Fullscreen is bugged9. CoH 2 is out and only a bit more expensive ($8 price difference)10. Tanks dont always follow commands Overall I love this game due to the amount of maps and units. I personally give it 8.4/10 Extras  There is a HL2 mod that is basically a reskin of this game. Lambda wars, at this time the game is in Beta so it isn't finished obv, alot of things with be getting added such as Vehicles, more units and more factions. So far its combine vs rebels. Also its free!Its really cool playing from the perspective of a rebel/combine commander from the Hl2 universe.Also, hl2 being based in the future means more advanced tools such as invisible scanners, headcrab launchers, dark matter cannon, striders and more strange futuristic weaponry/items.Get it here  "

												Company of Gyros is Relic's bold attempt to bring their experience on the sublime Homeworld 2 to the more down-to-earth genre of restaurant simulations. As the CEO of Gyros 'n Stuff, you control the national (and eventually multinational) policies of your gigantic corporation, but the game also allows you to micromanage various franchise owners if you wish. This is its greatest strength, because franchises in different regions have different challenges and objectives, and the higher level gameplay mirrors this, so that by spending time playing as these different franchises, you'll learn about the ""realities on the ground"" that are so crucial to success as a CEO. The endgame gets pretty bogged down because the game starts throwing lawsuits at you over the most tedious, petty details, and God help you if you actually did something REALLY bad. If your very first restaurant 10 years ago served ONE half-rat, half-lamb gyro on accident, you'll probably lose, long after you've quicksaved.			"

												i HIGHLY recommend this game, probably my favourite RTS game of all time! In the game, you choose between 2 sides: the United States or the Wehrmacht (German), and if you have the DLC for the game, you can also choose: The Commen Wealth or The Panzer Elite (which is pretty much the regular German team, but with different and/or more tank options and less infantry). The game includes a Singleplayer Campaign (which is expanded if you have the DLC), and great Multiplayer gameplay, with a bunch of maps to choose from, some maps being small for 1v1 matches, and some being massive for 4v4 matches. another thing really good about the multiplayer is most of the time the community is really good (of course, every once in a while you run into that guy who thinks he runs the show). ALSO, if u do happen to get bored after a while of playing the same thing over and over, there are LOTS of mods to choose from, for example: Modern Combat mod, Eastern Front mod and the Blitzkrieg mod. To sum it all up, excellent game! ARMOR IS GOOD TO GO!-------10/10 Shermans			"

												An instant classic.  Still play it today and with the Blitzkreig mod it looks even better with HD textures and many other features.  Also check out the Modern and WWI mod.  Both amazing games in their own right.  Don't hesitate buying this, especially during a sale.I highly reccommend you purchase the Opposing Fronts expansion with this game.  Ignore tales of Valor unless you want a few mini campaigns.			"

												CoH is one of the all time greats, best rated RTS ever and with good reason.Even the sequel (COH 2) is not as good, if you enjoy strategy games then this is a must.BTW my all time favorite game is CoHO which was almost identical too CoH but it had a better commander system and did multiplayer really well.

The SS propoganda officer's shouting will send shivers  up your spine, and when those 88's open up on you from the next hedgerow you'll be diving for cover under your desk.			"

												The thing that sucks in this game is stats. When you join a game, you usually get kicked by the host because he saw your stats and it said that you lost games and won games. So I would absoloutly NOT recommend this game unless you prefer playing against and with AI or with friends and campaing mode. I honestly think this game is awesome, but it's just that there is a few things in the game that should be changed. This may sound like a bad review, but the pros outnumber the cons. I'd prefer COH 2 honestly. But this game is better that COH 2 in a lot of ways. Either though the cons are annoying, the game itself is awesome.8.5/10			"

												This is an outstanding strategy and tactics game! You never know how a battle will end and the battle can swing back and forth at a moments notice. Every little detail counts in this game, as simply facing a machine gun a certain direction can have it either hold off waves and waves of infantry or become easily overrun by a single squad of riflemen.Units are also a great aspect of this game, as every faction has tons of unique and individual units, and each army feels completely different from the others. These units all complement each other very nicely, and no sole unit can win the game. You must use your units to work together to defeat the enemy.Visually and graphically this game is very pleasing as well. Graphics are nice and detailed and the terrain is fully destructable. Sound is also great in this game, with especially great voice acting for all of the units keeping the game from becoming completely dark and depressing, with units occasionally cracking truly humorous remarks.Overall, this is a great game for anyone who likes strategy and tactics, and if you aren't sure if you want to get the second one yet due to it's still high price(although it is just as good as this game but even more improved) this is a great game to get into real time tactics.

												Note: I have 42 hours on the Steam versionOne of the best Company of Heroes can't beat the original. Its definatley one of the more arcadey RTS games but still pretty cool. However I would wait till the game goees on sale because I don't think this game should be 20 USD it just seems to much for an older game. Theres also a few downsides to the game, being that most of the campaign is DLC. That sucks because now you went from paying 20 USD to about 35 USD. Even though the multiplayer is super fun I do think the campaign is a very big strong point and having to pay so much almost doesn't seem worth it. Just wait for the sale.7/10 Would be 9/10 but having to buy lots of the DLC to play the campaign is a big drawback from this game "

I never felt the horrors of a battlefield until I played this. Great game, great factions, great deaths. 10/10 would buy again and for someone else to play against.			"

												This game is a bit old but it does not matter at all. If you are a fan of second WW you will love this game totally. The point in multiplayer battle is to defeat the other one (as usual) but here is a big advantage of realistic equipiment, weapons,etc... You can take friend with you and play against 2 other guys. It depends on you wich army you will choose, every army has own advatanges and disadvantages and if you get in to game you will love playing it. There is another version of this game called CoH 2 , I tried the stuff and it is a top as well but at first I recommend you to buy this and try. At least you can refund it easily but I am sure that you won´t , Wish you happy playing, user .tyroX			"

												Definately one of the best strategy games to date 2012 even though made 2006 it still owns with complex strategic tactics and variety of maps to be played up to 4vs 4 team battles. Four completely different armies and variety of commader abilities makes the possible attack and defend strategies endless. Has an inbuilt ranking system and 3 game modes, THQ you stole my heart with this gem. Keep up the good work.			"

												This game is really funny and i enjoyed playing it. I think that the only problem is the teams, It would be more fun if all countries that took part of world war 2 was playable. As if now, only USA and england are playable. And the Axis has nazi germany and another nazi elite force. Bc of this I think its most fun to play with your friends. That, is really fun. 9/10 Very good game.			"

												I most definitely would recommend this game to a person who enjoys military strategy games. For me, this game reminds me very much of Halo Wars; but on a much larger scale, not to mention this is a WWII game not a sci-fi war. 4.5/5. The only things I didn't like about the game is that it is a small bit confusing.			"

The game is broken into 4 factions, 2 if you dont have tales of valor ( Which I reccomend getting ) and has many units, it is amazing in my opinion.Also I checked the second games reviews, it doesnt look like people like it much.

When I downloaded the game, I came to a really 2006 looking game menu. I passed that, because I HONESTLY thought this was a 2015 GAME! but actually, I was so unbelievably wrong. It was an fairly old game with the game mechanic of RTS.			"

												If you're looking for an RTS that can be enjoyable without having to Zerg Rush your way through gameplay, then look no further.  CoH is one of those few memorable strategy games that puts all others of it's genre to shame with it's dynamic game mechanics, impressive visual and audio (considering it's back from '06), and enticingly realistic scenarios.  A must-have for any fans of the more well-known RTS games such as Age of Empires, Starcraft/Warcraft, and Warhammer. Truly a sound investment that couldn't be wrong for anyone, I'd personally give this game a 9.5/10. (-.5 for a few minor flaws that could easily be overlooked)			"

												Company of Heroes is an amazing RTS. Relic has done a great job with this game and has set the bar high for future RTS games. Company of Heroes has a lot of attention to detail, adaptable play, and fast action. Has completly destructable enviroments.

												Really a great game, unlike most Real Time Stragety games, Company Of Heroes forces you to be tatical, plan, and use your resources sparingly. You can't simply throw your basic unit at the enemy base until they eventually break down. You must use your rifle men to take out small squadrons of of the enemy, your snipers to sneak up on the mortar team that has the rest of your men pinned, and your tank to blow that MG nest sky high and keep it from plastering your soldiers. Then as you close on the enemy base, you must use your own mortar teams to take out the anti tank units that will quickly destroy your heavy calvary. When your men are under heavy fire, they wont stand there and take it, they will drop down, get pinned, and be unable to attack. Yet if you place them in good cover, (which you can actually pick where they will take cover) and the enemy is exposed on advancement they will be the ones pinned. This is really a great game, and well worth the money.BUY THIS CRAP!			"

												This is one of the most overrated games I have played in many years. The praise given by critics and gamers to Company of Heroes is truly alarming. To play the game, you will be forced into signing up and logging into a Relic-Online account with your CD key. It doesn't matter if you're playing single player. Relic forces you into this DRM style process that is not even listed with Steam. This is absolutely unnacceptable and I feel misinformed by Steam and Relic. Relic had another idiotic idea. Menus for all three standalone Company of Heroes games are included, but locked. There are also two training missions from the second standalone game that appear, but are locked as well. Ridiculous. Upon first impressions (first four missions), the tactics appear to be slow, unrealistic, lacking in response, and surprisingly linear for a real-time strategy game. I am somewhat shocked, as this game has secured much hype over the years. The AI (of your own units and the enemy) is amazingly simple and limited. The units often have a hard time with your directions, and all units appear to be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The AI is simply not up to standard. Many of your troops stand or sit around during a large generalized firefight, or have extremely bad shot accuracy. Saving and loading times (especially) are unexcusably long even with a modern computer. After you quit the game, Steam uploads/synchronizes several hundred megs each time. I understand I can turn this off. My complaint is the amount of space the Company of Heroes save games occupy without allowing you to delete previously saved games. Company of Heroes does not make this simple save game housekeeping possible. The game has some serious sound volume troubles in general, as it is abnormally low. Between the live action portion and the cutscenes, this problem is most serious. The cutscenes are much lower in volume in comparison. You will be restricted to constructing a very small amount of buildings (six) and only seven types of infantry troops. If the aforementioned buildings and units were more extensive with their usage and utility, I would not have much to gripe about. In reality, you will find that what you have access to is quite abridged for a game that came out in 2006. From the fifth mission on, things do get better and a tiny bit more exciting, even though it will continue to be almost an exact repetition of the first four missions. The gameplay is abbreviated, strikingly dull, laggard, close to being boring, and with little to no excitement. You select your squad(s), point them in a certain direction, select some inexstensive actions, watch some mildly interesting battle take place until the enemy troops are all dead, then capture a strategic point. That's it. There is really not much else to it. Even if the mission objectives change from mission to mission, the means you will exercise to achieve those goals will be the same. Construct buildings, generate units, upgrade, take over strategic points, repair units, replenish units, and then repeat. Once again, that's it. Company of Heroes does not provide the player with any fresh real-time strategy scope. This clumsy piece of software also managed to crash multiple times during the final mission.Company of Heroes is okay.			"

												TL;DR- just buy it, it's a classic RTS, shame on you if you don't. Classic Real Time Strategy game. If you're new to real time strategy games, then I highly reccomend , and if you're an RTS vet, then you should still play. It's an excellent exciting game with well designed missions and decent ""breifings"" without too many constraints. I always feel like rts campaigns force you to play a certain way, but I don't have that problem with company of heroes I'll list my pro's and cons.Pros:-Dynamic gameplay, no feeling like mission after mission with a repeitive task. It feels like a natural progression.-Decent Campaign Length-In-game/In-game rendered cutscenes (Can be seen as a con, but I really like it. It makes you feel more invested when you zoom in)-Infantry can pick up weapons or man weapons that can turn into seperate units-It's during world war 2.Cons:-I ran into 3 glitches along the way. They're really simple to fix by just doing a quick google search for thr info.-Not too much unit variety, but in my opinion is made up for by the ability to man weapons and gain unit types by picking up items. You can also do this with weapons dropped by enemies.-seperate version for multiplayer is buggy af-F***ing annoying engineers with flame throwers sneaking behind your lines-limiting population cap			"

												    This game seems great at first glance. Great reviews and meta score. Considered to be one of the great rts games of all time. Unfortunately it has a seriously fatal flaw. Multiplayer balance. If you Google this topic you can find a myriad of discussions on it.      Please note that there are two versions of this game and the one that is played in multiplayer is the new steam version. So the number of hours I have played in this game might not be accurately described. I have played this game for around 500 hrs between the two versions.  Its my hope that you see my valuation as accurate. Thanks and be blessed.			"

There has been little or no communication with the customer as to any plans when the matter will be resolved and everyone seems to be sticking their heads in the sand and the customer service has been awful!!!So personally I would hold off buying this till service is resumed, which I hope will be soon, but I am not holding my breath as it has been over a month now!!!  :-( "

												overall, I'm not impressed.Listen: I should not be able to throw infantry wave after infantry wave at a Panzer while drunk on a Saturday night and not be penalized. I beat the missions and got a few medals along the way, but I was never challenged, because (except for defensive missions), I knew none of it mattered. So what I lost the entire 5th US Army in an assault on a portapotty? Sucks to be their widows. I beat the mission and was on to the next. My lack of competence had no feedback. I had no want to get better, and no way to know that I sucked besides my own criticisms.It has good mechanics, sure. Troops go where I tell them to go, and shoot at what I want them to shoot at, but being smart has no real merit. Flanking means nothing unless you toss a grenade, because whether the Nazis are facing towards you or away from you, it doesn't matter. Your soliders shoot the same and don't take cover except or machine gun fire.Basically, play Close Combat: Invasion Normandy. If you suck at it, you won't win, and if you win, it's because you don't suck at it.			"

												I can see that by ""not recommending"" this version on Steam people will say your review is not helpful purely because of that reason- the actual review itself be damned. Because of that let me recommend this game but put a huge disclaimer about this Steam version of CoH right at the start:***What this game SAYS it is giving you and what is actually SOLD are two different items. LAN is not included in this sale; you will have to use SteamWorks which means if your internet is crap and you want this game for LAN games you are screwed (even thought it says it is offered). Buy used versions of this game and the expansions (seriously like $2.50, a massive difference in price) and then plug in your cd key into Steam and get the Steam version for free while retaining your ability to play LAN games. You get more for much less currently by going used and plugging in the keys. Until the issues are fixed this game and its expansions are grossly overpriced. Amazing game, don't waste the money on the current Steam versions.**The game (Current Steam Version with update) is suffering from major online failures across the board. Don't buy the game hoping to jump into PvP as it looks to be broken and doesn't look to have a fix in sight.*Buying the expansion Tales of Valor will open up LAN options for networked PC's, the base game will not allow it. Also you will have to buy the expansions in order to play as the British.Gamplay:This game is the greatest to date RTS game surrounding the events of WWII and might even be the greatest RTS game of all time. They introduced many things into the genre that hadn’t been seen before and honestly haven’t really been seen since as the genre seems to be dying out. Instead of having to manage hundreds of villagers telling them to get wood/stone etc (building an economy), you build structures that produce units and capture and hold key points on the map that give you resources to build said units. Some features such as having all your units visible on a side bar plus all of your groups you have created clearly labeled on the same side bar (as group 1, 2, etc) is absolutely priceless. You will never lose track of any of your units ever again. Also the ‘retreat’ option; oh… my… word… THANK YOU! SO often in these games you just want to have your people FLEEEEE! You can in this, and they will run (faster than normal) straight back to your base (not really firing in the process BUT taking less damage). These features are huge improvements to such a stale genre.Another huge factor that plays into this game play is that THIS IS NOT A 20 MINUTE RUSH GAME! As far as Starcraft and AoE’s are played most games are over in 15 minutes with a rush; this game is all tactics. Someone rushes something there are huge counter measures where certain troops do terrible vs others so you cannot just rush a single unit and go; huge tactics in this game. The majority of the game play involves fighting over key points and ‘bleeding’ the enemy out of resources as you chip away at his defenses. Snipers, MG teams, rifle squads, etc make up the bulk of what you build; most of the units are in ‘squad’s or ‘groups’ vs just being alone and you have to bunch them up. Cover (in buildings and in the world) is important and has huge effects on who will win the battle. All in all an extremely well-polished RTS with well-polished RTS mechanics.  To see my thoughts on other games, movies, and music (and their complete reviews) check out my blog found in my Steam profile or by Google (Search Ashley and Micah English) Thanks.			"

Unplayable.Even after following a community guide (for crashes!) I can't get sufficient stability.The game used to be quite stable, but the conspiracy theorists say that with the CoH2 launch, SEGA and Relic wanted to move customers away from the ""old"" CoH and made a patch to break CoH. Maybe they're right.Won't be buying CoH2 anyway and regret buying this unstable game.			"

Its so glitchy to the point I cant play it the screen goes flashing with green stuff all the over the place the soilders were invisable dont get me started on everything eles.

Whats that it dosen't work??!?! It never worked for me. I got it to work ONCE but that was after a computer wipe when I downloaded (I think the new steam one) It stopped working. And I delted it and reinstailed this etc and it was broke again. So if this is broken and you dowloaded both with my experiance it's never going to work for you.. Sorry about that.

												I paid for and downloaded CoH from steam. Yet when I try and play it, I am asked for to install the CD ??? I have tried for three weeks to enlist help from steam. It is virtually impossible. There is no link to so called support for downloads that dont work.They pass me along to SEGA 3 weeks ago. I was told that they were reshuffling offices or some such tripe, and would get back to me. I do believe it's not a sega problem, as I am sure if I'd bought the game physically from some store, the CD would work.Steam should not be selling downloads if you cant open them without a CD.			"

												Inferior in every way to Dawn of War balance and AI. This eschews good RTS for gratifying the Idiocracy wave of gamers. Getting rid of real resource management makes the game more similar to Men of War; except CoH (both of them) suck compared to MoW at the tactical level. The complete lack of realism in the game also is a buzzkiller for any WW2 fan. Had they done something similar to their Dawn of War RTS games (not that DoW RPG wannabe RTS crap=DoW2) then this might have been a decent series. This game is best left to the insta-gratification console generation. More and more games have been getting dumbed down and require little brains, this series is an example of that. There are far better games out there that require much more intelligence and provide real gameplay. I'm afraid with this game all hope is lost for real RTS games made for adults instead of teenagers.			"

I own Tales of Valor and it still says that. COH: New Steam Edition is basically Tales of Valor but with more content unlocked.

Posted: March 13, 2015
												This game was really good in the past and is still is sort of an amazing rts game. But currently there are so many problems with this game and it is sort of ruining the fun in the game and I'll explain them all.1. The gameplay is extremly unbalanced: Mostly in favor of the axis. The axis tanks can easily counter almost anything that the allies through at them. For all honesty Panzer Elite can be extremly op first of all and the british are not certainly a good balancing factor to help out the allies. Panzer Elite has scout cars almost within minutes of starting the game and they can capture points and wipe out squads of engineers easily trying to capture them. They also extremly OP artillery based tanks which can easily be manuevered while the allies do not have manueverable aritillery which and unbalances the game even more. Second some infantry notes the Knights Cross holders are THREE MEN and are capable of wiping out 2 or even 3 squads easily. Their health is too high for infantry units and they are impossible to stop when they are in a cluster of 20-30. In fact I find it easier in some cases to take out axis tanks as allies then knights cross holders. Point is they are too OP and the allies do not even have any infantry troops to successfully counter them. Second a problem with both sides is that snipers are so OP. They uncover themselves and can easily go back into hiding after shooting. In all honesty, the camoflague feature should be wiped out and maybe instead of an extremly long range of site in that snipers could hide in the fog of war but become visible when shooting which would add to realism and help balance for the fact that snipers can camp inside a base and just keep on firing aritillery at the enemy base without even coming out of sight.But to some up you almost start to forget that the Allies won World War 2 for the fact that the Germans always win matches and destroy the ally armies so easily.2. The community isn't that great anymore. The old veteran players are running the show and pretty much taking up all the axis slots and dominating with the OP armies. In fact you can barely pull any wins as the allies anymore unless the axis players are noobs which is extremly rare. Also the veteran players don't even want to play with noobs and you will probably get kicked out of the game or moved to allies and called a noob just because you won 4 out 39 matches as allies. Its like sort of the community is redefining the word all together in that a noob is just someone who sucks instead of someone who is new to the game.Also to note I did not buy this game off steam and in fact i had it pretty much since it came out. It transfered to the steam version and it says I have 2 versions of the game for some reason a (New Steam Version and Regular). I have 42 hours on record for the (New Steam Version) and probably over 100 before I added it on steam. I know this game extremly well and love it but this review is out of complete honesty that this game has turned awful.			"

												Before you read this you should know I have player Men Of War.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:It would be an awesome game if it wasn't for the fact it's so unreal.Tanks have healthbars like a MMORPG troll, and its damage barely varies from where it is hit.Tanks can't use HE for a reason. Which results in 2 minutes of missing one soldier.I miss the direct control over units, cause they REALLY like to put their backs toward enemies.I don't get the point why the enemy keeps getting Stugs and Pz, while all I can do is set up mines which takes forever, resulting in leaving me defenseless.I have no idea why units can't throw multiple grenades (must wait 5 seconds), and why are they infinite.Units cannot run for their lives when pinned but throw themselves right into enemy fire. Like it would save them.In general the game is hard to understand because it isn't made in a way anyone could easily understand.Soldiers are really a general ""thing"" without different weapons.I am not sure if they can take a couple of hits or are this bad at aiming.WHAT I DID LIKE:The cinematics, they remind me of Band Of Brothers a little, are well made and makes you kind of bond with the NPC soldiers.Loved the TF2/AoE2 reference hitting things makes other things.I wouldn't reccomend this game for anyone new to strategy games, nor a veteran who has many more better games.

												I was pretty disappointed when I saw that you need to buy all DLC's to have full experience of the game.The game all over has a good potential. I like the way it was developed. The only down side is that you have to buy allDLC's for best experience as I mentioned above.My suggestion: lower the prices for CoH Tales of Valor and Opposing Fronts then the Game will be perfect.Suggestion to other people: Buy the CoH bundle with all DLC's when it is available for a better price.

												I've never seen a game cheat as much as this one does.  It is simply inconceivable that the developers would deliberately make a system that violates the rules as much as the AI in this game does.  Over and over, every game.  Impossible.  Explain to me how an enemy, with no access to a town (all bridges are blown), with no manufacturing in that same town, and with holding only 4 sectors, none of which are production, can produce multiple vehicles, cross a river that has no bridge and no fording, and press the attack non-stop?Cheating.

												The incessant scrolling, squad menus, stupid squad response,  the inability of these soldiers and squads under my command to stay out of my line of site, or evade the enemy and enemy fire are the standards of video games these days.  it's not MY unfamiliarity with the controls, or recognize the positions of each unit, it is how poorly they are identified, or their position. The bumbling stupidity of these troops to execute orders without tripping over one another, or obstructing one another is stupifying. It's like trying to run a painting company with the three stooges, except it's an entire army of stooges in a restricted locational overview.Add to the sheer stupidity of these guys the macros, keybinds, tactics incongruity, and building area restrictions, and you have another frustrating exercise trying to coordinate strategies with illogical menu interfaces.More and more, I see developers who can't place menus in smart locations away from the center, out of the way, without obstructing MY view. It is funny how the robot invaders range, and field of view advantages exceed my own, and they trap my stupid army in an ambush while they move intelligently and easily to surround us. I save a lot of money on games now, but can't get refunds for glitchy, clumsy interfaces, and unfair 'stupid logic' as the only thing I have to command.			"

												Basic things do not work for this game and it is filled with bugs for the modding community that were never fixed that they broke right before THQ went under.God forbid you have a monitor that is not inside it's preset resolutions too, as that means if you ever alt tab it will forever play at the preset resolutions and not the custom one you used until you close and reopen the game.  Playing in windowed mode to remedy this situation just further ♥♥♥♥s it up with huge amounts of lag.  Lag by that you click on something and tell it to go, but it never registered that your mouse was actually there and therefore does nothing, or better yet you use abilities on your own troops!  As in drop ♥♥♥♥ing bombs on them instead of the enemy.  Overall ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic support and the second game is an even bigger ♥♥♥♥ing joke.This is coming from somone that was big in the mapping scene before this game was even on steam about 9 years ago.  Do not ever purchase this game unless it is on sale, and even then it should be below 10 dollars.			"

												I did not enjoy this game, sadly after reading so many positive reviews all over the internet I decided to buy the complete pack.Firstly the AI is not good, even by 2006 standard.It feels too linear for it's scale. Not so many different ways to complete the objectives.You can't control individual soldiers, when they encounter a group of enemies they fire and throw grenades as they want to. You can control if they should hold fire or fire but nothing more in-depth than that.In a way it's Call of Duty in RTS form. Not very hard to learn, no complicated controls, your units can't do much more than move, cover and attack in one or two ways.It's a no-brainer to play. With all the pros and cons that come with it.The political symbols are censored (-historical accuracy) but there might be a mod texture for it.The effects and graphics are good for the game's age and the storyline is interesting at times.The environments are well made and adds abit of immersion.Most of the mission are defeat these enemies and capture this point or capture this point and get reinforcements, defend this position and get reinforcements and move on.I would recommend Men of War Assault Squad 1 or 2 instead. Bigger maps, indivdual unit and soldier control, more units, more destruction, more realistic, realistic damage to vehicles, more freedom of choice and good mod support.http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Digitalmindsoft (Men of War link)			"

												A terribly overrated game - absolutely atrocious:The AI is terrible it's like everyone in this world has obsessive-compulsive disorder: mortar crews will get stuck in a repeating pattern of setting up and taking down over and over again. tanks will expose their rear to fire when you expressly tell them to keep their front to enemy; your soldiers and armor will automatically attack the enemy that poses the least threat, while letting  themselves get pounded into the dirt by other NPCs...even after you tell them expressly which enemy to focus on.balancing is terrible - apparantely, the ""rules"" don't apply to the game itself...just the player: expect NPC enemies to come from off screen at any given time from any given point on the map, rendering carefully placed layers of defense meaningless; expect enemies to pop up from nowhere like little weeds that spawned from the dirt; expect a RPG team to be able to destroy your tanks, even while your tank is shooting every single gun it has at them....and missing every f--king bullet. Line of sight and fog of war apparently doesn't seem to apply to the enemy NPCs.But if you enjoy wasting your money and  time, and are some sort of masochist who gets off on frustration, then this game is for you			"

												I have 800+ hours,I know this game is bad.What this entire game is based on is ranger spam and if the map will allow you to kite those rangers properly. You can only deselected so many maps(yep the game dictates what maps are best for you, like some tyrannical government that knows what's best). No wonder THQ went out of business.You can cover half of the maps by spamming mortors in your base, you don't need oil, just manpower for ranger spam. The vehicles can't even navigate properly unless you micro manage 3 of them all at once while kiting ranger spam(impossible and highly gimmicky).Even if do you manage the win, the opponent will likely call you a hacker for using an anti-tank half track to kill his squads.This game has nice graphics for when it was made.

												Clearly one of those games where the developers are meticulous in their testing. Even INCESSANT with it, perhaps?Either way, the results are plain to see.The end products are these highly fine-tuned game mechanics which allow you choose the type of commander you want to be, be it an infantry warlord, vehicle hero or support warrior. And yet, you're still able to compete with anyone and everyone, regardless of Which war Enthusiast you may choose to specialise in.One thing that many were concerned about on it's release was that Tanks would be able to moonwalk over everything. There was even concern that the infamous 1980's disco floor filler and megahit ""Thriller"", by the late, great, awe inspiring Michael Jackson, would come on every time someone used a tank. This is not the case at all, tanks are not invincible and can be destroyed using infantry. Infantry can do it. Trust me.			"

												I only played the Operation Market Garden game as Germany on Normal Mode and what I found out was that it was not a war game but a puzzle game, much like Panzer General. The scripts like to throw you curve balls because the AI is so bad. There is only one way to win and you find out what that one way to win is by playing each scenario first. So if you like puzzle games (that are bad and throw you off because that's the only way they can win) by all means buy it, but why would you? It like a jigsaw puzzle where you realise you have to take a pair of scissors to make the pieces fit.A big thumbs down for this ""thing"". Don't get sucked into the hype.			"

												This game... Is arguably 10 times better than the second. It's like playing Dawn of War 1, but instead the action takes place in 1944-45.Pros:- tons of units and customizability- 4 playable factions (with the expansions)- a competitive online system that will test your skills and patience- a very clear and easy to navigate hud- different game modes that keep things interesting and fresh- affordable priceCons:- less units than it's successor, albeit they won't cost you your soul to field- graphics look a bit dated compared to CoH2- you can't vault fences or walls... But you can blow'em up or just drive through themIf you ever find yourself on the crossroads between CoH 1 and 2 pick the former. It may not be updated as frequently but at least it's playable and serviceable and aside from two expansions you won't have to pay a dime to unlock/swap to newer units.			"

												Hero. Who among us has ever been afforded the oppurtunity to meet an actual hero? Hero is a word that has been saturated as of late. Is a firefighter really a hero for saving that cat out of the tree? Mittens would in all likelihood have gotten down from that tree on his own, whether it be due to his own wishes, or the cruel hand of gravity. One could argue that a cat's life is not greater than or equal to in value of the cost of taxes being payed to fund the fire station. That one would be right. ""But what about actual fires? Don't we need firefighters for that?"" Great question.I know most people reading this review may find my beliefs to be quite inhumane, hell I doubt anyone will ever read my musings, but I can't sit upon the the hands that are my morals and wait for a hero to come along and save me. I have to step up to the proverbial batter's box, and proverbially knock the proverbial fastball of evil out of the proverbial ballpark. I challenge each and every one of you to do the same.Signing off, MattDamonsOwl.			"

It is slow at first, but the game picks up quickly. 4v4 matches are most likely going to take much longer than the average RTS game.			"

												My RTS skills are weak at best which could impact my judgement on a RTS game. Still, I think this game is great.Unlike old school mechanics where you have to build a base and gather resources, CoH just requires you to capture strategic points which will continually give resources as long as they are held. Base building is also very simplified with only a few buildings required to build.All this makes the game more straightforward and with a emphasis on tactical warfare. It's Relic at their best.			"

												One of the best RTS games of all time. This games mechinics are a bit different then the average Command and Conqure or Starcraft base/army building. This game focuses on squads, instead of individual units, and it's through careful manuvering and stratagey with those units that this game truly shines. Resources are gained only through ""Domination"" Control points on the map. The history is acurate, afaik, and the detail in everything is stunning. If you haven't played this game and you consider yourself an RTS fan, then you had better pick this one up before anyone finds out your a faker.			"

												If you are a fan of WWII and fast-paced strategy games that require minimal focus on economy and more on military, then this is the game for you. Resources are granted through the acquisition of key points in the map that will provide you with 1 of 3 resources: manpower, munitions, and fuel. Even though these points are vital for the economy side of the game, taking and maintaining these points requires a lot of focus on the size and positioning of one's military. As far as military units go, the game is just like any RTS game. You have light (infantry), medium (light vehicles), and heavy units (tanks) and counter units to different units in those classes. There are also three different branches for the Allies and Axis factions to choose from that will support you in commanding your troops on the battlefield. Support such as off-map artillery, increased abilities for units, and special units can be utilized to give you that extra edge against the enemy. Like I said, I would recommend buying this game not only because of the gameplay, but the amazing graphics and audio are a definite plus to the gameplay experience. Happy gaming! "

Why play this when you can follow the adventures of Ramirez and his stalwart companions in Modern Warfare 2?Ultimately, this game is as backward as Doom and features scenarios as dated as Hitler. I can only imagine this game was aimed at the neo-nazi crowd. This is the kind of game that only fans of the Legend of Zelda series would fall for. It features faceless, blank soldiers fighting a meaningless war with weak tanks and worthless allies. The soldiers' cries of pain do little to mask an empty, dead game.Do not buy.2/10			"

												Command and Conquer meet History. History meet CnC... wait what? Ignore that. However, there is base building, unit creation, unit promotions and research trees. Certanly sounds familiar. But this is a game in its own league.With graphics hardcore enough to match to anything you get today and with an A.I that will ALSO♥♥♥♥♥♥your mother while you thought it was drinking tea in front of you. Its a challenge both for strategist and those who thought they are tough. Hours of fun with friends or against the computer.Controls are easy and most of its handled with point n click methods that appear with most RTS. Coupled together with Blitzkrieg mod, you've got yourself a fine WW2 strategy game that handles all your favourite things in one screen. Panzers, Infantry, point captures, stop salvating and get on in already.One small gripe I do have and its a minor one, when will the super units and structures appear that most RTS's have today? ;)Final Rating: 4.5 / 5			"

Besides A.O.E., C.N.C. & Warcraft I haven't played a really good RTS well besides Mount & Blade which is really more realtime 3d fighting though it has RTS in it. Gem hidden in my list of many games so if you like C.N.C.-R.A./T.S. then you have to try this game it's well worth the price they are charging for it now with all the DLC. A++This game has me wanting more RTS games, Thanks to games like COD or MOH they robbed me of my patience to want to learn a game like this. Well not anymore I have stopped playing FPS because they seem to make me an Angry person LOL. 48hrs in now and 35hrs on new client steam version for multiplayer.

												This is an amazing RTS game that feels slightly different than ones that you might have already been accustomed to. One main aspect that differentiates this game from others is the Cover system. The system allows for your units to take cover in various enviromental objects, which an ingenious gameplay feature.Another difference is that buildings cannot be constructed around the map like in Age of Empires, Warcraft 3, Starcraft, etc.which leads to a different strategy of emcampment. All in all, this a game I'd say is worth buying and playing.			"

												Company of heroes is among the best RTS games I've played - having everything from small bouts between squads to full firefights across rivers involving heavily dug-in emplacements and well estasblished defenses. this game forces the player to make strategic decisions if they want to win the match, be it establishing a base of operations halfway up the field or blowing up bridges to cut off enemy movements across the river, and unless the player can adapt and react to everything and adapt to everything happening on the map, they will quickly lose control. Every firefight is carefully adjustable if the player knows what they're doing - when to use artillery and mortars, where to set up emplacements, and with the right strategy even the smallest, most wounded squad can beat back a small army. That's what makes this game special, is that the small squads still allow for massive action, especially when you're in an extended battle to take a fortified hill.However, it is not to be said that it's the eprfect game, as this game is incredibly brutal and will easily put off new players or players that aren't as good at RTS games and, to an extent, micromanagement, and it can even be daunting to players who are otherwise veterans in the RTS genre, due to all the new mechanics to which you must adjust.TL;DR: Company of Heroes is awesome if you can do tactics, not so much if you can't.

												Oh this game! Its wonderful, brilliants, fantastic and infuriating all at once!The ammount of damage to the environment that can be done is awesome, the damage mechanics are some of the best I've ever seen! You get a tank to shoot a building from the back and the back wall will fall apart, shoot it from the front and the front all will fall, its really that detailed.The thing is, the game is HUGELY unfair, the AI has what I call ""The all-seeing A-eye"" Its annoyingly accurate at throwing its units at points that you hav no defences and missing all of your defences. and if you use a long range artillary strike the enemy units will 9 out of 10 times move from that area. But that doesnt mean this game is bad, it just means its annoyingly difficult.Oh and dont try to cheat - The one time I simply had to turn off the game was because I built tank traps spanning the width of the map and the AI - instead of shooting them apart - drove through them, It was horrible to see but I guess if you cheat the AI will cheat back.

												Company of Heroes is a really good WW2 tactical squad-based RTS. The gameplay is somewhere between Dawn of War 1 and 2. You won't get a million units, but there are still a goodly number you can field. The plot is typical WW2, though I will say the German missions are more interesting.Pick it up if you like RTS.			"

												While I grew up on the C&C and C&C RA games, which I prefer, and wold like a new one that was actually great, this game still rocks and helps fill that void. The graphics are good, the explosions are fantastic! The sound is pretty good too! Music is typical WWII music for the most part, some tracks do stand out pretty good, but I turn the music down to bare minimum to enjoy the wonderful sound effects this game has.The performance is pretty good if you have a good rig, unless of course you level out the camera and look across a populated area thats decent in size. That will chop the Frames per second even the beastliest rigs. The gameplay is fantastic, pretty indepth game honestly. The base building leaves a lot to be desired, but the combat and movement itself is done very well! If you enjoy it then there are 2 expansions for it that will give you plenty more of it.I Just wish they would make a Vietnam or later themed game just like this! With better base building! Would be :)			"

												This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played! My only disappointment in the entire game are some players online exploiting an uncreative idea online of tank swarming and mobile artillary, but it is a part of the game and a lot of people don't use it. Unlike other games you don't need to purchase the DLC in order to have a fighting chance against those who did purchase it! I look forward to Company of Heroes 2 for these reasons and more :D			"

												One of the best RTS games ever made. You control sectors to gather resources, so you (and your enemy) are forced to advance. What really seperates this game from most RTS titles is cover. Your troops are able to take cover within building, behind trees, sandbags, even craters from past actions. In short, this is a must own RTS game, the Company of Heroes franchise is right up their with the Age of Empires games!			"

Company of Heroes brings a whole new immersive gameplay, well balanced mechanics and focusing loads on strategy, redefining what RTS should really be all along!			"

												Had this game and all the expansions/dlc in my account for a while now came with a humble bundle I bought before the sad ending of THQ company.Just now played it for the first time.This game ROCKS very fun game for a RTS I can already see it has a lot of replay ability I think I'm 5 missions in plus all the tutorials. Besides A.O.E., C.N.C. & Warcraft I haven't played a really good RTS well besides Mount & Blade which is really more realtime 3d fighting though it has RTS in it. Gem hidden in my list of many games so if you like C.N.C.-R.A./T.S. then you have to try this game it's well worth the price they are charging for it now with all the DLC. A++This game has me wanting more RTS games, Thanks to games like COD or MOH they robbed me of my patience to want to learn a game like this. Well not anymore I have stopped playing FPS because they seem to make me an Angry person LOL. 48hrs in now and 35hrs on new client steam version for multiplayer. The fun and want to play this game only Increases.			"

												Command and Conquer meet History. History meet CnC... wait what? Ignore that. However, there is base building, unit creation, unit promotions and research trees. Certanly sounds familiar. But this is a game in its own league.With graphics hardcore enough to match to anything you get today and with an A.I that will ALSO♥♥♥♥♥♥your mother while you thought it was drinking tea in front of you. Its a challenge both for strategist and those who thought they are tough. Hours of fun with friends or against the computer.Controls are easy and most of its handled with point n click methods that appear with most RTS. Coupled together with Blitzkrieg mod, you've got yourself a fine WW2 strategy game that handles all your favourite things in one screen. Panzers, Infantry, point captures, stop salvating and get on in already.One small gripe I do have and its a minor one, when will the super units and structures appear that most RTS's have today? ;)Final Rating: 4.5 / 5			"

												You think all WWII games are cheesey and generic? *buzzer* WRONG! Any decent strategy game player masturbates thinking about company of heroes. Powers, Upgrades and Units are all well-balanced. All AI units have remarkable pathfinding skills, Infantry effectively take cover, everything on the map is destrictuble, and most terrain details do little more than annoy tanks. This game is definitely one of the best strategy games ever, and i gurantee it will make your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hard.			"

												This is one of the greatest RTS games I've ever played. I've been playing these kinds of games since the mid 90's. It all started with Command & Conquer for me. I have played quite a few  since then and not many have captured my interest as well as C&C did. C&C Red Alert 2 wrote the book on how to do a good RTS but I always wanted something more modern and reallistic. For a couple of years I gave up on RTS games in general. One too many bad experiences I guess. I recently picked up Company of Heroes during a steam sale and I was blown away. It is brilliant. A great look and style. Runs well on many different PCs. It is all that I've wanted in an RTS and more. It is set during WWII which I would rather have a little more modern but it works well as it is. I only have two complaints. 1. I would have liked more units but there are still quite a few. 2. The games A.I. can be very challenging even on lower difficulty settings. Again not the worste thing but something to prepare for. Enjoy.			"

												The game itself is a pretty good RTS with good graphics for its age, I do belive that there are some balance issues, it could just be me since I haven't put a lot of time into it, another thing is that sometimes the units lack responsiveness and can get annoying. Other than these issues I like the game, not sure why they haven't done a CoH in a modern setting instead of WWII.			"

												I think it's about time I recommend my 2nd favorite game of all time. Company of Heroes is plain fun, addicting and smart. You play CoH like chess. Every unit has a role and what they can be used to counter or push forward. The single player gets you ready for the multiplayer where most of the fun happens. You can either play skirmish agaist the AI or basic matches (pvp) of up to 4v4. The community is alive and friendly for the most part. You can gather tips and information about CoH on Gamereplays.org and watch videos for more strategies with Propagandacast and TheSoundStrategyNetwork on youtube. There are 3 major mods (Blitzkrieg,Eastern Front and Modern Combat) that make the game even better, adding new factions, trees, weapons, vehicles and gamepay mechanics. Overall, you will have tons of fun in the campaign and multiplayer. Even without multiplayer, this game is worth the $10 and deffinetly the $2 when it goes on sale. Do yourself and my crippled dog a favor and buy this game.			"

												Old but Gold! This is currently still my favourite RTS going and after playing close to 150 hours (since the servers switched to new steam version) Someone will still surprise me with a new tactic or new playstyle. I havn't touched the campaigns other then to test them because they're not really my thing, what this game is built on and still does so well is the multiplayer. You will want to practise in skrimish sometimes to get better as well, but the real fun is when you are playing with or against your friends. Definetly buy this game if you have a few friends that can play with you, but if you don't it might not be a good idea since you can't rely on the online system as it usaly only has 20 people on at a time including open servers, closed and automatches. So just make sure you get some of your friends to buy this when you do if they don't already have it. Lastly you definetly want the complete pack, or all the dlc so you can play all 4 factions.			"

												Do you remember being a kid and playing the war with plastic toy soldiers and vehicles?! That's the same but with an simple advantage that the figures are animaned. Actually this is the best WWII rts that have ever been created on Earth despite of its aging graphics. In addition playing as the commander and deciding the turn of war is really exciting as it makes you feel ""important"", I mean you can walk in the shoes of a great general or whatever you like.The key feature to win a match in this game is of course the strategy and the ability to control more units at the same time which is tough and sometimes plays on your nerves. On the other hand victory is very satisfying and gives a great shot of adrenaline like (""oh my God I did it"").			"

												A pretty good tactical WWII simulator. It does a good job in showing the actions needed to be done to win a battle, but not necessarilly in the best ways, such as dropping paratroopers in the middle of a drop zone, moving to flag poles and capturing them, and constructing barracks on every battlefield. Also, the uniforms aren't the best, but in the end, they don't really damage the experience. In the end, it's a very good game.			"

												I just don't get this game.We have brilliant games like Modern Warfare 2 set in the modern era, and then there are dated games with scenarios over 20 years old like Company of Heroes. Why play this when you can follow the adventures of Ramirez and his stalwart companions in Modern Warfare 2?Ultimately, this game is as backward as Doom and features scenarios as dated as Hitler. I can only imagine this game was aimed at the neo-nazi crowd. This is the kind of game that only fans of the Legend of Zelda series would fall for. It features faceless, blank soldiers fighting a meaningless war with weak tanks and worthless allies. The soldiers' cries of pain do little to mask an empty, dead game.Do not buy.2/10			"

												Company of Heroes is one of my favorite RTS's at the moment. It is an awesome Single/Multiplayer game that gives you access to the powers of the Americans and Germans and with the Opposing Fronts version grants you access to the British and German Panzer Elite. It is another great WW2 RTS! Relic has definetly hit the nail on the head! :DCant wait to play CoH2 once its downloaded bringing in the Soviet Union!			"

												A smart, fast, high intensity RTS game with an emphasis on squad control, my only major complaint with it was that it ended. Levels and maps just hard enough to keep you on your toes,  but nothing so difficult or drudging that it breaks the flow of the game. I found it rather addicting.			"

												I always thought that like your first pill of ecstacy, you'll never forget your first great gaming experience. As far as RTS titles go, Westwood's Command & Conquer Tiberian Dawn seemed to take a crowning influence over the genre - at least until this game came along. While I'll always associate C&C memes and references to those glorious Win 95 days of old, Company of Heroes delivers an RTS experience that gracefully walks the tightrope between realistic combat simulation and skin of your teeth strategic gameplay. While I won't address the benefits of a well-told WW2 storyline, one of the most unique contributions of this game to its genre, is its combat system which creates empathy for each individual soldier on a micro perspective, and the thrill of successfully executing combined-arms tactics with armour and support weapons on a macro scale. Play this game, and then play it online - because it is one of the very few titles to have redefined the war strategy genre.			"

												This game... Is arguably 10 times better than the second. It's like playing Dawn of War 1, but instead the action takes place in 1944-45.Pros:- tons of units and customizability- 4 playable factions (with the expansions)- a competitive online system that will test your skills and patience- a very clear and easy to navigate hud- different game modes that keep things interesting and fresh- affordable priceCons:- less units than it's successor, albeit they won't cost you your soul to field- graphics look a bit dated compared to CoH2- you can't vault fences or walls... But you can blow'em up or just drive through themIf you ever find yourself on the crossroads between CoH 1 and 2 pick the former. It may not be updated as frequently but at least it's playable and serviceable and aside from two expansions you won't have to pay a dime to unlock/swap to newer units.			"

The ability to find various types of cover, upgrade your weapons and armour to have different effects on the enemy and completely change your style of play with each game, it's a must have in your arsenal of strategy.

												In my opinion this is one of the best games ever created. At over 400 hours between all of the versions of this game I have found very little to discredit this title. If you enjoy WW2 history/rts games/ in depth tactics and lots of missions and a great multiplayer then I can almost guarantee you will love this game. I still believe this is the game to beat in terms of best rts even games like command and conquer or starcraft feel bland by comparison. Even the graphics hold up well compared to modern games and with almost entirely destructable maps it surpases many modern titles who cant compare to the level of destruction possible here. Probably the only game I'd give a 5/5 since it runs so well and I have rarely seen a bug or glitch and the mechanics have been tweeked so there arent any overly powerful units unless you use and support them correctly. The closest thing to a perfect game!			"

												This game is amazing. I've been playing it with a bunch of my friends since the THQ Humble Bundle came out, and we've had a lot of fun. The modbase for it is great too, because it's an older game now. If you have friends that are willing to play with/against you in this game, you should get it. :)			"

												I think it's about time I recommend my 2nd favorite game of all time. Company of Heroes is plain fun, addicting and smart. You play CoH like chess. Every unit has a role and what they can be used to counter or push forward. The single player gets you ready for the multiplayer where most of the fun happens. You can either play skirmish agaist the AI or basic matches (pvp) of up to 4v4. The community is alive and friendly for the most part. You can gather tips and information about CoH on Gamereplays.org and watch videos for more strategies with Propagandacast and TheSoundStrategyNetwork on youtube. There are 3 major mods (Blitzkrieg,Eastern Front and Modern Combat) that make the game even better, adding new factions, trees, weapons, vehicles and gamepay mechanics. Overall, you will have tons of fun in the campaign and multiplayer. Even without multiplayer, this game is worth the $10 and deffinetly the $2 when it goes on sale. Do yourself and my crippled dog a favor and buy this game.			"

												Company of Heroes is an excellent World War II-based RTS by the makers of DAwn of War. It's very well done and is a great deal of fun in both singleplayer and multiplayer. I recommend it to anyone. The price it's offered at makes it an even more compelling buy. The Opposing Fronts expansion pack is not vital, but it adds two great campaigns with two new factions.			"

												Company of Heroes is a graphically fantastic, heavily resource and micro based RTS set during WWII. It is nothing like the StarCraft series. It's got an extensive singleplayer campaign that is worth hours and hours of fun and a fantastic online community that has released plenty of mods and custom maps. The game devs have diligently supported the game since it's release back in 2006 by continually releasing updates and striving to improve the multiplayer experience. Hell, it's got a 93 out of 100 on Metacritic, if that means anything.			"

I was running this game on a machine that was 5-6 years old and has an ATI X200 graphics card (a.k.a. crap) and i still had fun with this game. Also, this game is so amazingly fun, that I played it through much lag and still enjoyed myself. GET THIS GAME. I would recommend getting the gold pack though.			"

												This is a classic and still a lot of fun to play. Especially when you add the two additions to the game. While Company of Heroes 2 has better graphics and some improvements, this works great on older computers. If you don't already have this, add it to your collection--espcially when it goes on sale. This game has aged well. The hours listed only show what I have played on Steam. However, I played over 100 hours of this before it was on Steam when it was first released.			"

												Note: Hours are low because I mostly played the ""New Steam version"" that was made after THQ folded and Relic was sold to Sega. Steam lists it as a different game, but other than some Online features that were re-integrated into steam instead of THQ's servers, it's otherwise identical and included with your purchase. Now on to the review!In my humble opinion, the best RTS ever. Short form: Take Band of Brothers' brutally realistic take on World War 2 and give it to the best RTS devs in the buisiness.Have them craft a wide arrangement of viable strategies, reinforced by a Commander system that assists you in your chosen strategy (Yes you can successfully turtle! Provided you grab the points first!), mechanics that force you to consider positioning and cover over pure production, Warhammer 40k's Vehicle damage Mechanics (Hitting them from the side or rear means better chance of penetration and damaging components), and top it all off with amazing art and sound work.There's quite honestly, nothing I can think of in the RTS realm that tops this gem.If there was any letdown it is that the SP missions can drag on a bit too long and the strategy in this mode gets mindless at times (skirmish and online is a whole 'nother story!). Still fun, but when one of the bonus objectives is to finish a level in FIFTY minitues, there's a problem.  If you don't have the patience, just skip it and go to skirmish, and once you are comfortable with it's style, try it online.Also Opposing Fronts is worth it, British commonwealth and Panzer Elite are awesome factions. Also the campaigns are far better paced, Especially Panzer Elite's. Haven't tried (or bought) Tales of Valor so can't say how good that one is.			"

												Review based on Company of Heroes (New steam version)All the reason to love and play Company of Heroes and its expansions:  1. One of the best brutal/emotional and demanding single player experiences.  2. Awesome historical and faithful presentation of ww2   3. A game where strategy and progressive thinking is most of the times the only way to victory.  4. Extraordinary graphics and fully destructable enviroments  5. Night/day cycle and weather effects that will stun you.  6. A grand variety of units/armored cars and factions to choose from.  7. One of the best online experiences you could ever imagine  8.  A really big variety of gameplay mods  9. Epic fanmade mods to make you play the game again and again10. Great audio and sounds especially during heavy fights			"

												A very fun game for what it is. As for single unit production such as infantry against tanks, it will never work which is a downfall for casual gameplay. COH is definately a micro intensive game and sometimes is unbalanced at times. Indirect fire is definately a huge annoyance and especially snipers. When facing veterans this game can be very overwhelming. A disappointment i've always had was how the americans never had any anti tank infanry as i've always hated using tanks. The best part of the game i think has always been using the artillery. I've also enjoyed the micro ranks on the units themselves. The game is fairly realistic and provdie a definate fun gameplay.

												I got this game for my PC back in 2007 and I played it all the time, it became my faveorite games, it was just so good on so many levels that no other game compared to it. I played it up until 2012 when i had to sell my PC because we moved country and i was certain id never play the game again.Fast forward to 2013. I pre-order CoH 2, expecting it to be EVEN BETTER than the first game, surely it would be right? No.It was dissapointing and I regret pre-ordering it....or do I?No, i dont regret pre-ordering CoH 2, why? Because I pre-ordered the limited edition CoH 2 and got the original CoH with both expansions as a pre-order bonus for free, I didnt even realise until I read the back of the game booklet about 2 months after i got it, i uninstall CoH 2 and play this one instead! Best part about it was that the limited edition was the SAME PRICE as the normal edition!!!! Kudos to EB games!!!!!That pretty much sums up how good this game is. This game is a MUST BUY for any WW2 or RTS fan, hell, even if your not, you still need to buy this game, its a gem and it still looks and sounds flawless. Not to mention the mods you can get for this game which are fantastic as well!			"

												***NOTE: Game played on New Steam Version, but reviewed on this version***As someone who isn't a big RTS fan, I focused my playtime on the Campaign. I thoroughly enjoyed the campaigns. While there is always going to be come degree of ""build as many units as you can and throw them at your enemy"", Company of Heroes felt like it had more to offer than that. There is a lot of strategy involved to ensure your campaign objectives. Which sectors to capture; where to build defences and what kind to build; what makeup should my forces be?The game felt very balanced, as no units or countries felt overpowered. The quality of your units were traded off well with their costs. A number of the units also have their own flavour dialogue which added a lot of character and humour to the game. The campaigns themselves had a nice flowing story to them, which was a nice surprise. If anything, I would have liked more story, but that probably shows my preference for story-driven games.Overall, a nice campaign that you don't need to be a hardcore RTS player to enjoy. If you do enjoy your RTS though, there are also skirmish and online gameplay to enjoy.			"

												If you are looking for a good RTS game look no further. This game not only has the basics of an RTS such as 3rd person point of view and buildings but also gives you a better feel of being in a real war and commanding your units by having them seek cover in the natural surroundings and as your units earn their vet status in the field you gain experiance durring the match to do added things such as call air strikes to eliminate the opposing forces. I highly reccomend this game to those of you out there that like RTS and those who enjoy army games.			"

												I enjoy Age of Empires and I enjoy WWII history, so I gave this a whirl.To be honest, I did like this game. However, I'm more into base building, which is what the Germans in this game do. The other forces are more like those in C&C: they're built to be mobile. So for me, this was not very pleasant.If I had to give a score, it'd be a 8.5/10. Fun mechanics, great battles, but not much base building.			"

												A fine RTS brought to you by the people who created the fantastic Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War series. In ways it surpasses its brother in genre with its fantastic physics that lead to hilarious moments and the broad depth of tactics available to the player through three diverse command trees for each faction (two with base game and a third and fourth added in expansions).I highly recommend this game to those with even just a passing interest in Real-Time Strategy video games. It's interface is simple enough that new players to the genre can get it after the fully voiced tutorials yet the game is complex enough for those wanting to master another game.			"

												One of the best RTS games I've played, with decent graphics and good game mechanics. With the expansion packs ""Tales of Valor"" and ""Opposing Fronts"" you get lots of campaigns to play, where you get to play as british and american paratroopers and the germans. The multiplayer has a good enough balancing aswell, but if you wish to crush your enemys with the power of mighty german tanks such as the panther, tiger etc., the vanilla game won't cut it for you. Fortunately, there is a mod called ""Blitzkrieg"". It overhauls the game to be much more realistic and fun, you should try it. If thats not your cup, there are tons of other mods that are semi-realistic and more like vanilla.			"

												For being almost 10 years old, this game is and will continue to be one of my favorite RTS games. The graphics are decent to good. The gameplay is solid. The campaign is great and gets progressively more difficult but is not ridiculous. You must lead infantry, support units, tanks, and many other units around and be tactical to complete the missions. With 3 different companies to play throughout the campaign, what happens is mostly up to you. Some cons of the game are that it can be a bit unrealistic when it comes to how many shots it takes to kill some units, but it is not a game killer by any means. I highly recommend this game to any RTS player. The DLC also adds more huge campaigns. GET THIS GAME			"

Why play this when you can follow the adventures of Ramirez and his stalwart companions in Modern Warfare 2?Ultimately, this game is as backward as Doom and features scenarios as dated as Hitler. I can only imagine this game was aimed at the neo-nazi crowd. This is the kind of game that only fans of the Legend of Zelda series would fall for. It features faceless, blank soldiers fighting a meaningless war with weak tanks and worthless allies. The soldiers' cries of pain do little to mask an empty, dead game.Do not buy.2/10			"

												I always thought that like your first pill of ecstacy, you'll never forget your first great gaming experience. As far as RTS titles go, Westwood's Command & Conquer Tiberian Dawn seemed to take a crowning influence over the genre - at least until this game came along. While I'll always associate C&C memes and references to those glorious Win 95 days of old, Company of Heroes delivers an RTS experience that gracefully walks the tightrope between realistic combat simulation and skin of your teeth strategic gameplay. While I won't address the benefits of a well-told WW2 storyline, one of the most unique contributions of this game to its genre, is its combat system which creates empathy for each individual soldier on a micro perspective, and the thrill of successfully executing combined-arms tactics with armour and support weapons on a macro scale. Play this game, and then play it online - because it is one of the very few titles to have redefined the war strategy genre.			"

												I got this game for my PC back in 2007 and I played it all the time, it became my faveorite games, it was just so good on so many levels that no other game compared to it. I played it up until 2012 when i had to sell my PC because we moved country and i was certain id never play the game again.Fast forward to 2013. I pre-order CoH 2, expecting it to be EVEN BETTER than the first game, surely it would be right? No.It was dissapointing and I regret pre-ordering it....or do I?No, i dont regret pre-ordering CoH 2, why? Because I pre-ordered the limited edition CoH 2 and got the original CoH with both expansions as a pre-order bonus for free, I didnt even realise until I read the back of the game booklet about 2 months after i got it, i uninstall CoH 2 and play this one instead! Best part about it was that the limited edition was the SAME PRICE as the normal edition!!!! Kudos to EB games!!!!!That pretty much sums up how good this game is. This game is a MUST BUY for any WW2 or RTS fan, hell, even if your not, you still need to buy this game, its a gem and it still looks and sounds flawless. Not to mention the mods you can get for this game which are fantastic as well!			"

												A very fun game for what it is. As for single unit production such as infantry against tanks, it will never work which is a downfall for casual gameplay. COH is definately a micro intensive game and sometimes is unbalanced at times. Indirect fire is definately a huge annoyance and especially snipers. When facing veterans this game can be very overwhelming. A disappointment i've always had was how the americans never had any anti tank infanry as i've always hated using tanks. The best part of the game i think has always been using the artillery. I've also enjoyed the micro ranks on the units themselves. The game is fairly realistic and provdie a definate fun gameplay.

												This game... Is arguably 10 times better than the second. It's like playing Dawn of War 1, but instead the action takes place in 1944-45.Pros:- tons of units and customizability- 4 playable factions (with the expansions)- a competitive online system that will test your skills and patience- a very clear and easy to navigate hud- different game modes that keep things interesting and fresh- affordable priceCons:- less units than it's successor, albeit they won't cost you your soul to field- graphics look a bit dated compared to CoH2- you can't vault fences or walls... But you can blow'em up or just drive through themIf you ever find yourself on the crossroads between CoH 1 and 2 pick the former. It may not be updated as frequently but at least it's playable and serviceable and aside from two expansions you won't have to pay a dime to unlock/swap to newer units.			"

												Hero. Who among us has ever been afforded the oppurtunity to meet an actual hero? Hero is a word that has been saturated as of late. Is a firefighter really a hero for saving that cat out of the tree? Mittens would in all likelihood have gotten down from that tree on his own, whether it be due to his own wishes, or the cruel hand of gravity. One could argue that a cat's life is not greater than or equal to in value of the cost of taxes being payed to fund the fire station. That one would be right. ""But what about actual fires? Don't we need firefighters for that?"" Great question.I know most people reading this review may find my beliefs to be quite inhumane, hell I doubt anyone will ever read my musings, but I can't sit upon the the hands that are my morals and wait for a hero to come along and save me. I have to step up to the proverbial batter's box, and proverbially knock the proverbial fastball of evil out of the proverbial ballpark. I challenge each and every one of you to do the same.Signing off, MattDamonsOwl.			"

												Not the hardest RTS to play in the world, once you get to grips with the units and the cover systems etc its really easy to be effective with your army, online play is extremely fun in 2v2s etc working together to hold ground and wear down your enemy, theres alot of action in this game as it forces you to attack and hold constantly, doesnt require the fastest reactions in the world but its still a great game for what it does, DOW2 was released after this and was based on this game totally and it was a way lesser game then this. COH gets it just right. 1v1s are good also, probably one of the best RTS's of all time, the series needs to stay true to its self and the second full game will just be amazing.			"

												Best RTS game I've ever played in my life. It's so good that I didn't add ""so far"" at the end of the previous sentence.First of all, it's historically accurate in the campaign.Second, it is very balanced, so you don't loose your whole squad in a 16 second shootout, but they could get a better idea than automatic weapons missing 75% of the time.Thirdly, it's fun to play and when you win you have that really big win feeling but when you loose you get sort of dissapointed but you try again and don't become a super sad person for the rest of the day... except when you loose the last mission of Liberation of Caen after two hours of gameplay.Fourthly, it's extremely unique, you don't see strategies and battles of this type in other games. If you play internet games you may have noticed that many of them use extremely simular HUDs because it's such a good and unique HUD that really helps how the game is played. I can imagine other commanding stuff and how bad/difficult it would be with them, so the HUD is really good.Fifthly, it gives the most suitable amount of challenge and option I have ever heard of. Battles could take 5 hours for a pro to win, but yet necomers may look upon rubbles of the enemy base.Sixthly, why are you still reading this I just thought you would have bought it already! You haven't? Well get it (if you want to) and enjoy your underprised loot.			"

I was running this game on a machine that was 5-6 years old and has an ATI X200 graphics card (a.k.a. crap) and i still had fun with this game. Also, this game is so amazingly fun, that I played it through much lag and still enjoyed myself. GET THIS GAME. I would recommend getting the gold pack though.			"

It's an old game by today's standards (released 2006) but still looks great, plays well and worth playing.Recommend playing the ""new steam version"", as this version plays with no issues at.Whilst on special offer - 75% off it's a bargain.If you like RTS games, you should like this one.

												A challenging game, Company of Heroes really does require you to think strategically and be proactive in your gameplay. Instead of just sitting back and researching and fortifying while hoarding resources as you can do in other Strategy games, Company of Heroes requires you to constantly push the line forward in order to keep control of your territory and its resource points. Dawn of War II players, please note that this is the same engine and gameplay style, so it doesn't take long to get used to. However, it does feature quite a lot more than DoW II, in that you can build base structures, further customise the loadouts of squads and use special abilities without the need for a Commander unit. Very good for multiplayer, Company of Heroes is definitely a game worth trying out. ***			"

												Dont be fooled by hours of playing, I played the non-steam version and steam had steam version for free and thats cool.The game is just amazing, one of my favorite rts games but the sequel was over hyped, buy this one and you will still have the same experience as Coh2 but only better. Buy this game and leave Coh 2 alone. 11/10 would play again.			"

												THIS IS MY PREVIOUS REVIEW WHEN I HATED THE GAME. YOU CAN READ IT BUT MY NEW REVIEW IS AFTER THE BELOW!I thought it was an extremely fun game. I loved the D-Day mission in campaign and even without the expansions it is an excellent game.UNTIL. i went on the game one time and found that ALL units and BASES were invisible. I tried everything and even looked solutions up on Youtube but to no avail. Sadly this game was a waste of my money and it is now unplayable because the enemies are invisible and it just ruins the once amazing Company of Heroes. I am now sort of hesitating to buy CoH 2 becuase it could happen with that game too and COH 2 is $50. So sadly this game was a waste of time and money and unless it gets fixed i won't and can't play the game again. But to wrap up on a good note, i had plenty (About 4 matches) of good times and it is an older game so i can't expect too much. Cya and hope the the gods it gets fixed. =)*EDIT*SO i reinstalled the game after deleting it and i happily found out that it didn't turn my men invisible. I replayed the 1st campaign 1st level but on the second level, ALL my men and enemy men were in T-Pose with their guns sticking out of there chests and to make it worst EVERYTHNG BUT THE GROUND WAS BLACK (Not bien racist). I couldnt see my objectives becuase a huge black wall would appear in front of it and it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I will uninstall this game forever and go play Men of War Assault Squad, a REAL strategy game. MOWAS is soo much better than ths junk AND in MOWAS there is an editor, though complicated. This game is stupid and i will never waste money on sequels ore anything, even if it is on sale. SCREW THIS GAME*EDIT*Sorry i raged quite a bit when i wrote the review. Now 2 years after uninstalling i downloaded it again. The new steam version. And it worked perfect. i have played heaps already and i am soo happy my favourite strategy game is back in action! Thankyou whoever changed the game. U R the best!!!10/10Perfect			"

												My RTS skills are weak at best which could impact my judgement on a RTS game. Still, I think this game is great.Unlike old school mechanics where you have to build a base and gather resources, CoH just requires you to capture strategic points which will continually give resources as long as they are held. Base building is also very simplified with only a few buildings required to build.All this makes the game more straightforward and with a emphasis on tactical warfare. It's Relic at their best.			"

												A wonderful Real Time Strategy, Company of Heroes excels on almost evey aspect. The Axis and the Allies Factions are very different, creating diversity in game. The physics applied on the scenary destruction is amazing, and it feels satisfying when pieces and blocks fly away after you command a Tiger Tank to blow the building to hell. The cover system is easy to understand, easy to use, but it's extremely important during play. A squad behind (or inside) heavy cover can easily withstand various waves of multiples squads, while those outside cover will die easily. You have 3 trees for each faction, each one focusing on a different aspect, leading to three different ways of playing each faction.			"

If you like 2nd world war do not hesitate to buy any of the games.People have issues with the game play, but this is normal as there are issues with all games and none will be 100% acceptable.I am very pleased with the games and have now clocked up nearly 1400 hrs playing because it is competative and very enjoyable.

												The game has some flaws. It is not quite as realistic as it could be to create an authentic experience, but the gameplay is super solid and a lot of fun. The DLC doesn't break the game like in CoH2 yet it is worth it's price for a fan for sure... ever since the new steam version came out there have been a lot of problems with matchmaking, connecting to other players, etc. but after multiple fixes and updates it is working rather smoothly now 90% of the time... the only problem is, the amount of people playing is dropping so it might be hard to find someone to play....Still it remains one of my favorite games of all time ...

												possibly the best RTS game ive played...yes the bots cheat and most likely can see everything your doing (No fog of war for them i guess) but it is an amazing game! although i wish the addons were less then the actual game...here are the reasons it is really good:MULTIPLAYER: probably shouldnt play this until you are really good...but it is the reason this game is so awesomeSTORY: amazingly made story and seamless possibilities for attacking...GRAPHICS: amazing...just completely detailed graphics from the scars and scratches on the road to the buildings infrastructure and damage as well as designing each characters face with animations as they lie in pain on the ground waiting for the medic to arrivePHYSICS: the physics in this game are possibly the most realistic thing about this game...everything you do effects your surroundings: vehicles when slamming into walls do damage to the structure and you can see that damage physically as well as tanks being able to run into walls knocking them down allowing you to ambush your enemyOVERALL: overall this is a great game and i highly recommend it to someone who is die-hard for RTS games!Alright this is an edit... the graphics part...it is the best graphics i have ever seen for a 2006 game (not better then newer games) but this could rival COD: Ghosts Graphics...i may be being dramatic but DAAANNNNNNGGGGGGG just HOW!?!?!

												For being almost 10 years old, this game is and will continue to be one of my favorite RTS games. The graphics are decent to good. The gameplay is solid. The campaign is great and gets progressively more difficult but is not ridiculous. You must lead infantry, support units, tanks, and many other units around and be tactical to complete the missions. With 3 different companies to play throughout the campaign, what happens is mostly up to you. Some cons of the game are that it can be a bit unrealistic when it comes to how many shots it takes to kill some units, but it is not a game killer by any means. I highly recommend this game to any RTS player. The DLC also adds more huge campaigns. GET THIS GAME			"

												A RTS style game that changes up the play field by using squads instead of units while playing. A Unique creative feature that fits in with the WW2 game. As a WW2 game the story is just what you would expect from the base of the game ( No DLC). Basically Band of Brothers in a video game format. Movement felt off as the units would fill in where they could and even though there was cover, they would be standing around getting picked off. Attacking other units was a confusing formula of are you going to hit? or how long will this take to end? Could have a squad of 4 targeted on 1 enemy solider in a open field and they would exchange gun fire for 30-45 seconds without hitting something. As a real time strategy game it was fun and challenging. When it comes to war themed RTS games I prefer Command and ConquerStory: 5 / 10Gameplay: 7 / 10Visual/Sound: 8 / 10Entertainment: 6 / 10Controls: 9 / 10Final Grade: C-Replay Value: Average			"

												If Supreme Commander is the most macro focused RTS, and Starcraft 1/2 the most micro focused, Company of Heroes is the most tactical focused. The squad cover and combat mechanics, projectile physics, directional modifiers, and a wealth of unique units and abilities make this game challenging, satisfying, and unique every single time you play it. For those looking to get into it late, you can't go wrong with the core CoH game. ToV adds the British and PE factions while OF adds a handful of alternative units to each side. With the American and Wehrmacht factions being the most fun to play and play against, and the alternative units being a mixed bag, don't feel obliged to get the expansions.			"

												Probably the single best RTS ever. It is not action-amount intensive like Starcraft and it is not slow and macro-intensive like Supreme Commander. It is CoH and it's a blend of tactics and resource management that makes full use of the WWII setting to make a strongly emerging RTS. Only downside is the last expansion which I advise skipping because it brings very little to the table.			"

												Company of Heroes is a fun real-time strategy game set in the times of WW2, directly after the D-Day.You get to play as The Germans, British and America through different campaigns, not including skirmish and multi player. It's an old game by today's standards (released 2006) but still looks great, plays well and worth playing.Recommend playing the ""new steam version"", as this version plays with no issues at.Whilst on special offer - 75% off it's a bargain.If you like RTS games, you should like this one.

												A wonderful Real Time Strategy, Company of Heroes excels on almost evey aspect. The Axis and the Allies Factions are very different, creating diversity in game. The physics applied on the scenary destruction is amazing, and it feels satisfying when pieces and blocks fly away after you command a Tiger Tank to blow the building to hell. The cover system is easy to understand, easy to use, but it's extremely important during play. A squad behind (or inside) heavy cover can easily withstand various waves of multiples squads, while those outside cover will die easily. You have 3 trees for each faction, each one focusing on a different aspect, leading to three different ways of playing each faction.			"

												I have been a Fan of THQ for a long time, and this title represents their Online RTS style gaming to a perfect profile. The core game content has a vast amount of replayability, introducing multiplayer gaming provides an additional facet of gameplay as well. The Mod community has openly accepted COH into their bosom, and produces fantastic Mods to the game, improving the style and playability in a fashion which was widely accepted and advocated by the community. This game is a great time killer, with rounds lasting on average 30+ min. The only downside is having to purchase the additional base content, now seeming worthless with the dawn of COH2 on the horizon. Still a top shelf RTS, for a reasonable price, with a contemporary loyal fan base.			"

												Very neat RTS. The WWII setting made me think of generic FPS things, but there's not really been much RTS' set in the times FPS' usually are, when you think about it. At least, none that are popular.Anyway, it's got standard RTS elements. Bases, units, strategising positions and flanking. The best part about it for me is that most functions are set to units rather than bases, so your bases are in general a little short staffed, while you send all of your manpower out to shot da bad gais.Campaign is your general D-Day thing that you'd expect from a WWII era game. It's fun to do it from a commanding perspective for once, and while some may argue against me for this, it's also nice they're not trying too hard to draw you into a story. It sets up the show, and you set off the fireworks.I should also note that the expansions do NOT require this original game, too. It's a neat idea, since I can now play the same game through three different Steam links with the extra stuff.			"

												You can train little men with guns to go and shoot other little men with guns. If that is too savage for you, build little metal boxes with men inside them and shoot men outside metal boxes and explode other metal boxes. And if you actually wish to have fun CALL UPON THE GRACIOUS TENDERNESS OF THE ARTILLERY AND AIM THEIR LONG SOLID BARRELS AT THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF ANTS THAT ANNOY YOUR DIVINITY. MARVEL AS THE CLIMAX RELEASED FROM THESE AMAZING DESTRUCTIVE DEVICES LAY WASTE TO EVERYTHING and usually miss. Explosions are nice, though.What was i talking about?			"

												Good but not great. Wonderful 3D world, awesome story, excellent graphics and really gets you into the feel of WWII western front. This is one of the better RTS games out there, and sticks to a solid RTS formula. However, there are just some flaws that detract and cant be overlooked (only the USA is playable, DLC for other fronts, boo; Maps are hit or miss, as some are great challanges and others are just chores of capture the flag; It would have been nice to have a replay mode, so that I can enjoy the rifleman's point of view afterwards, because no one plays from the ground perspective when advancing on an german position). Get it on sale. Final score 75%			"

												My favorite RTS of all time.  I bought this game when it came out in 2006 and all of its following expansions.  It takes place in WWII, and the jist of almost every mission is to build a base and pump out upgradable squads, vehicles, and tanks and do whatever it takes to accomplish mission objectives.  Stunning visuals, smooth gameplay, friendly UI, and a great story, who could ask for more?			"

												Great game, and no real strategy game comes close to the environment or the particular action. It is unique. The AI can be really challenging, as can the veteran players of the game online, with no real learning curve. Also, the game was pre-DX10/11 so it can be a resource hog, but it plays and looks great. A must-have for gamers!			"

If you like 2nd world war do not hesitate to buy any of the games.People have issues with the game play, but this is normal as there are issues with all games and none will be 100% acceptable.I am very pleased with the games and have now clocked up nearly 1400 hrs playing because it is competative and very enjoyable.

												A very fun game for what it is. As for single unit production such as infantry against tanks, it will never work which is a downfall for casual gameplay. COH is definately a micro intensive game and sometimes is unbalanced at times. Indirect fire is definately a huge annoyance and especially snipers. When facing veterans this game can be very overwhelming. A disappointment i've always had was how the americans never had any anti tank infanry as i've always hated using tanks. The best part of the game i think has always been using the artillery. I've also enjoyed the micro ranks on the units themselves. The game is fairly realistic and provdie a definate fun gameplay.

												Oh this game! Its wonderful, brilliants, fantastic and infuriating all at once!The ammount of damage to the environment that can be done is awesome, the damage mechanics are some of the best I've ever seen! You get a tank to shoot a building from the back and the back wall will fall apart, shoot it from the front and the front all will fall, its really that detailed.The thing is, the game is HUGELY unfair, the AI has what I call ""The all-seeing A-eye"" Its annoyingly accurate at throwing its units at points that you hav no defences and missing all of your defences. and if you use a long range artillary strike the enemy units will 9 out of 10 times move from that area. But that doesnt mean this game is bad, it just means its annoyingly difficult.Oh and dont try to cheat - The one time I simply had to turn off the game was because I built tank traps spanning the width of the map and the AI - instead of shooting them apart - drove through them, It was horrible to see but I guess if you cheat the AI will cheat back.

												In my opinion best RTS game out there and a must purchase for any strategy fans. I've played several hundreds hours over COH between its old COH Online release and the pre-Steam servers and its still very fun.Relic Entertainment created two (four if you're playing with the expansions) balanced yet different factions and this leads to a varied  gameplay experience.The campaign is fairly typical for a RTS. Decent story, length, and objective variety.The multiplayer is great however, the size of the community is no longer what it was.			"

												Best World War 2 rpg of them all by farOn a 1 - 10 game is a 9.99 Must have game for the price. Game had so many awards to prove it as well. Unfortunatly we lost the Main dev to a car crash. I can't even imagine how many great games this young man would have molded or been a prt of developing. Really huge lose not just for his family but for hundreds of thousands of gamers.This game and it's dlc well worth buying and during steam sales it just is criminal not buying it, even if you play it for under 10 hours its worth the time and the cost.-------------------------lead designer on Company of Heroes Online was driving his Subaru OutbackCompany Of Heroes Developer Killed In Car AccidentBrian R. Wood, lead designer of Company of Heroes Online The 33-year-old developer was killed in the crash. His wife and their child survived the crash, thanks to Brian's last-minute sacrifice.According to Erin Wood, she and the baby would not have survived the crash had Brian not swerved at the last minute, taking the brunt of the impact himself.--------------------------My reviews are what I feel ..

												Company of Heroes is a really good WW2 tactical squad-based RTS. The gameplay is somewhere between Dawn of War 1 and 2. You won't get a million units, but there are still a goodly number you can field. The plot is typical WW2, though I will say the German missions are more interesting.Pick it up if you like RTS.			"

												Highly recommended as this is one of the best RTS of the past decade. Pick it up along with the first DLC - opposing fronts, since it adds a ton of contents and replay value. The game also contains a very vibrant online community and a ton of maps that can be played against human opponents or in co-op against the AI, which can be very competent and challenging.Avoid the Tales of Valor DLC unless it's bundled together with the game.

Emphasis on Tactics and teamwork, this game sets the bar for all RTS games, not very large scale but very fun game with great game mechanics and very fun gameplay styles. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game even thou COMPANY OF HEROES 2 is out. (WARNING) orignal sever providers have closed the online server but STEAM has saved the day by providing a steam version that continues online service for this game.			"

												Oh yes.I love CoH, it's the perfect example of a game I'd play day and night (and I do just that).In my book, it's a 9/10 game for sure. Besides the awesome next-gen graphics and audio (from 2007), the gameplay gets the golden hot doge award. There hasn't ever been a game with so much flexibility and open-endedness as CoH. If the terrain gets mangled from annoying♥♥♥♥♥Kraut artillery and your troops don't have cover, then it's time to build some cover! The terrain is very malleable and destructible; bridges, buildings, fences, hedges, people, trees, you can blow it all up! Or if you want to hold the line, fortify it! It's a dream come true for a strategy lover like me. Oh, that's another thing. Even though the AI is sketchy at times, strategy is a big key to success. The AI has a bad habit of spamming ungodly and relentless amounts of tanks or infantry (or both) should you provide the resources to them, so it can become a bit strategy-lacking at times unless you're an antisocial person who likes fighting computers. I love RTS games with all of my heart, yes so sweet and beautiful it is to command armies of people and watch them fight to the death. I do find the unit selections a bit ""limited"" even though it's all you need to survive and get the job done. This is where the glory of mods come in! Mods add countless new units and functions into the game, a few even add new factions! Don't like something about the game or a mod? That's not a problem, learning how to mod the game yourself is easier than remembering 3.1415926535897932384!I've wasted days playing this game and I'm glad to have wasted my time with such a fun game. It's a legendary game in the world of RTS, and it remains my favorite RTS in the world to this day.			"

Unlike in a lot of games a squad of soliders can't take a tank on unless they are equiped to do so. Vehicles can go out of control, engines can break, buildings can be torn apart, bombing runs this really does have it all. It is 100% worth the buy.			"

												Very neat RTS. The WWII setting made me think of generic FPS things, but there's not really been much RTS' set in the times FPS' usually are, when you think about it. At least, none that are popular.Anyway, it's got standard RTS elements. Bases, units, strategising positions and flanking. The best part about it for me is that most functions are set to units rather than bases, so your bases are in general a little short staffed, while you send all of your manpower out to shot da bad gais.Campaign is your general D-Day thing that you'd expect from a WWII era game. It's fun to do it from a commanding perspective for once, and while some may argue against me for this, it's also nice they're not trying too hard to draw you into a story. It sets up the show, and you set off the fireworks.I should also note that the expansions do NOT require this original game, too. It's a neat idea, since I can now play the same game through three different Steam links with the extra stuff.			"

												Awesome game, though I haven't played much I know i'm going to be playing a lot of it. The gameplay is great and story line is hard but fun. If you're going to play this game and get good at it, expect to put in a lot of hours. I highly recommend this game.			"

												An awesome RTS. Combines great strategy gameplay with awesome visuals and a active great group of players to play with and against. Takes a few days to learn and forever to master, but there are enough active players online that you have plenty of time to do it. Four diffrent armies with 3 diffrent army branches for each make a lot of variable gameplay.			"

												The best RTS ever played.There are so much going on at all time in this game. It got many layers of strategic thinking and there are so many diffrent tactics that can be deployed with success. The battle field change at all time and it's hard to tell who will win even at the later stages. The story builds mostly around true battles and events and it the story is well execut trought out the game. The campaign is well paced and varied. The graphics were incredible when released and they still look very good today from normal viewing distance. And that is much thanks to the nice particle effects and the breakable objects.			"

												It's awesome.Graphics: A little dated, but nonetheless good. Actually, surprisingly good, considering how old the game is. Animations are amazing, as you'll see your Rangers reload their Thompsons (yes, the magazine actually do come out!!) and the facial expressions on your wounded soldiers as they cry out for a medic (..even though you can't hear it..xD). It just brings the battlefield to life. 8/10Gameplay: It's just plain fun. It doesn't take too long to build up your army and send them off to battle. It's entertaining to watch you and your allies crush the opponent in a head-first attack, but you can also take your units (as some are made in fireteams) and strategically conduct smaller-scale mini operations to take out certain targets. The ways to play are virtually inifinite and you'll find that it's possible to counter any strategy. There are the cons, but Steam isn't going to let me write them, and it's not like you'll read this anyways...			"

												Even with WW2 (especially with the Normandy landing and race to Berlin here in the U.S.) being beaten by a dead horse this game shines as probably the most streamlines and tactical RTS to date. Check the date, I'm writing this well after COH2 came out. This game is better and involves more thought, where in COH2 your only option in most missions is to steamroll through the enemy with more troops. Historically accurate? Yes... Satisfying? Not really. So check out this game if you are a strategy fan. You will not be dissapointed. Pick up the free ""The Great War 1918"" mod on steam. It's amazing. Don't let the hours I played on steam fool you. I played this game for dozens of hours from a storebought copy years ago.			"

												""Company of Heroes""For sure one of the best RTS games ever made!Some sweet pick up lines from ""CoH"":- ""Eat lead, mother******!""- ""When you hear that clicking sound, you have to reload!""- ""What the **** do you want!?""- ""Burn em and shoot whoever is too stupid to run!""- ""I'm a little f***ing busy here!""

												It's awesome. Great game with lots of replayability. Pros:really addicting gameplaythe RTS gameplay is great and fungreat to play with friendsrequires some good strategic play and thinkingallows for different play stylesGood (and historical) campaignthe DLCs ACTUALLY make the game better (i had to wash my hands after writing that)Slight Cons ( I really cant think of anything that I hate about this game): AI likes to spam AT gunsonline against humans can get pretty boring (everyone builds up defenses like crazy then arty spams then tank moshes)prepare yourself for at least an hour-long game at a time (pretty well worth it though) "

												Multiplayer olarak oynamak için muhteşem bir II. Dünya savaşı konulu oyundur! Kendinizi savaşın içinde hissetmeniz muhtemel ki bunu fazlasıyla iyi bir şekilde yapıyor. Birimler oldukça kaliteli ve çeşitli. Haritalar gayet iyi yansıtılmış. Eğer daha önce oynamadıysanız ve II. Dünya savaşı fanıysanız kaçırmadan ilk indirimde alıp oynayın derim.NOT: Multiplayer serverları hala oldukça dolu.			"
