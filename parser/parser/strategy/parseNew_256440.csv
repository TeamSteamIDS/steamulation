								Already damn fun in its current state, and I can only see it getting better as content is added.  Check the forums--developers seem extremely responsive and are already addressing concerns....three months later, and zero development or posting.  Guess they read my review and decided then and there that they were done.			"

								I will say... YES!For now there is one word: PotentialHuge potential for this game, it needs more content, more destruction,  better imersive graphics and UI, chances to Multiplayer, a Map Editor with WorkShop support to create and share custom challenges, several gameplay modes, improved physics, also liquids,  and more themed and unique content that we unlock over time, progression so the gameplay experience feels fun and it doesn't get repetitive.I hope Devs look at the potential and create one unique game, that is already fun in my opinion. :)			"

												A cool concept with a lot of potential, but only a few months after the game came to Early Access, the devs decided to take our money and disappear completely without so much as a tip of the hat.  So....don't buy this game and, seriously, stop begging to be gifted codes to it. While playable at the most basic level it's missing about 90% of the features that would make it a real game and it has tons of problems, including a few levels that cannot be finished due to issues with the level design.

								The developers seems to have dissapeared completely. The game is not half bad, but the fact that the devs seems to have dissapeared off the face of the earth in the beginning of the games early access.. well, I would not recommend that anyone buys it until there is word from the developers.

								Great potential - but it seems to be a dead development. No progress or updates added what so ever, not much response of any kind on forum etc.Its playable in its current state, but quite repetetive, needs some tweaks on aiming and other details. Its too unpolished and flawed in its current state, that i would recommend it to anyone. If updates startet coming, then yes, but with nearly 6 months of absolutly nothing - DONT buy it.			"

												Was an ok game when I got it, played roughly 9 hours then uninstalled, recently installed again and it seems the game no longer works, can't even be started up, yet still on sale?Odd for steam to be selling a game that can no longer be played, isn't it :)I recommend, DO NOT BUY, UNLESS you see actual updates happening, 2016 ->			"

												Enormous waste of potential. This had the possibility of being a good game. It had good art, a neat concept, and lots of weapon variety.Then it was abandoned by the developer(s), who no longer seem to exist as their web domain is for sale. If I treat Monsters & Munitions as another good example of why we should always be wary of Early Access titles, then at least it still has value as a warning. "

												Its ok, but the problem is you have not that many shots that means you cant take out the monsters. I like that its randomly generated the levels but you need more shots to kill the enemies 3 shots isnt enough for 8 enemies who are hiding in buildings/caves. Its still early access so it can be better after a time of updates. I say that the game is really good, but to difficult			"

								*disclaimer - game is in an early but very playable state, not all of the world, quest, etc mechanics are in place yet and the card collection element needs some work to feel more like a CCG*This game is not just another angry birds clone but a more novel take on the genre - future features should add huge amounts of replayability to the game - random world map, quests and an interesting CCG mechanic (for weapon collection and upgrades). The devs are open to player feedback and suggestions and active on the forums. At the moment its highly playable and addictive (I daren't load it up while I am trying to finish a few other games such as ni no kuni as my last 'quick' go stretched to over 2 hours and I had to drag myself off M&M to go eat), some levels will frustrate you but also you get that must have one more go feeling that an addictive game requires.Once this game gets random maps and quests I can see my free-time just being eaten away...

								This game, although having GREAT potential, is really not playable. There is no obvious objective, and gameplay balance needs a lot of work. I'd suggest waiting to purchase this game until several updates are out. To the devs... 3 shots to eliminate 8 or more 'enemies'? Really?? Truly well-developed games will start off extremely simple, and gradually increase in difficulty, thereby encouraging the gamer to continue playing. This isn't it.04/05/2014: No updates in over 2 months. Has development ceased?			"

								Very fun. Yes, it's Angry Birds like but it has a complete different feel with the upgradeable munition. Does take a little bit to get used to. It WILL seem frustrating at first with the fact that you only have 3 shots per level BUT once you complete easier levels/ reset your map to re complete them to gain more munitions you get it down and it makes the game so much fun. Also, NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!!! 3.6/5			"
