												Of all of the indie bundle games I've tried out, some are bad while others are hidden gems. Most don't leave much of an impression.This game still makes me shudder with the memories of how terrible it is.			"

												Clicky typwriter noises when printing on the screen; a slow, nearly impossible to understand tutorial and psychoactive colours.  It wasn't even worth the $3 sale price.			"

												The game is very boring, nothing unique. If it goes on sale for a dollar I would buy it, but for $10? Never.			"

												This game is not very good. It's imbalanced. It is very difficult, and not in a fun way. It feels incomplete, like the devs were working on it and then just disappeared. I think there are even things in game that have said ""coming soon"" for a couple of years. Avoid this game.			"

												Terribly balanced game, not visually appealing, and now it seems it won't even play without breaking (text disappears and certain scripted actions don't run when you play the single player campaign...  1/10, not even worth a couple of dollars.			"

												I enjoy a good tower defense game and this looked appealing. Unfortunately, it was obtuse and not very responsive. The tutorial really didn't get much across and even when it did tell you to do something, it didn't seem to do it when I clicked the things it told me to. Perhaps this requires more patience than I'm willing to afford it, but this is in no way worth $10, from my limited experience.			"

												Quite frankly a terrible game and a waste of money. I played this last about 3-4 years ago, and I stil remember my dislike for it. The gameplay is very boring, there is no real method of progression besides the new units, and the storyline got too hard too quickly. 1/10			"

												I'm recommending you never play this game. It's horrible. It's kind of a tower wars type map. You get about 6 robots that you assign weapons to and they walts across the screen a few times to get to the other side. If they make it to the other side, you get a point. 10 points wins. There are various upgrades and the core way to gain money is by giving a robot the ""looter"" weapon so that they can ""salvage wrecks"". As the robots crawl across the screen they shoot at each other.On paper it doesn't sound so horrible, but the game is unbelivably poor.			"

												Complete garbage.  No strategy involved, just mindlessly build robots and do upgrades before the opposing robots gang up on you.			"

For $2.50, it's fun.You will feel like the game is cheating, which makes pushing the AI back and winning even more satisfying. Once you ""get it"", you can beat the game in one sitting with a few or no losses. There are 12 levels, each one taking from 6-15 minutes to win. Multiplayer is dead. Highscore tracking is broken. Mediocre music and sound but they work. You can upgrade your robots (speed, strenght, accuracy, etc.); I suggest you start upgrading once you have 400 fuel so you can have a few robots ready to go. Always send your robots in groups, 4-5, the last robot in the group being the Recycler. Again, once you find out how to play, you might find it satisfying and worth the money (I wouldn't pay over $3 for it).			"

Not even cool by 2010 standards.To echo the previous reviews, this game clearly feels unfinished. After a start-up, a bug occured causing none of my top statistics to update, but I decided to play the game anyway. I don't think there really is a point to this game, you can send robots, when they die you need to have a special class robot clean them up to get the in-game currency. This continued for like 20 minutes before I ended up losing. I did everything right, sent my groups in teams of 5, sometimes more. I was outplaying the enemy, but somehow the game still decided they were the victor. The graphics are unappealing, as is the music. I had a hard time finding anything really great about this game, even the tutorial narrator was just annoying, boring, and unpleasant.			"

												Good for a little mindless fun, but overall the gameplay is mechanical.  It is like mobile tower defense, however once you know how the game works, it offers little challenge or change.  The AI cheats, so you have to do the same thing over and over if you intend to win.			"

												I like this kind of ""Tower"" game due to the different combinations of resources as well as the variables that you can tweak.  It is also a game that a person can't go to YouTube immediatly and find all of the answers which gives hours and hours of fun for not only myself but my friends as they now can't cheat!  ;)  The graphics remind me of my quarter spending days and the playthrough is a little difficult as timing is everything!

												Power Of Defense provides a new strategy and defense mix game experience. Defend your world from upcoming evil and oil-smelling robots. They come from the platform between both parallel universes you have to fight on by producing own robots to send them back to their native world. You as the last hero on earth and the only one your government could find (and pay), only you can save the world.			"

												What an utterly pointless, frustrating and ultimately annoying game this is! I'm a big fan of the tower-defense type games, and thought I'd give this a try. In essence, your units progress up the 'board' while the enemy units move down the screen towards you. When they are in opposing aisles, they can open fire on each other.Now herein lies the most pointless aspect of the game. Start off and both you and the opposing team have EXACTLY the same three type of robots to build. Both you and the opposing team have EXACTLY the same upgrades to purchase. And both your own robots and those of the opposition move at EXACTLY the same speed (without unlock). So in a nutshell - it's a race to meet in the middle - at exactly the same time with exactly the same units with exactly the same kit. The result? A 51/49% split in success.Granted, the game is much more fun with the appeal of upgrades and working out what works well and where - but its too long and boring to even get there!			"

												I've probably logged nearly as many different defense game hours as I have Everquest, WoW and Eve hours... When I tell you this is a game to pass on, hopefully you will listen.It's in interesting take on the ""Tug of War"" style defense games where you stream out units that clash in the center. But instead clashing in the same lane, each side has it's own lane. Well I tried it. And it doesn't work. There's no strategy involved. No unit countering. No gambling on holding back units for an upgrade while tanks hold back the assault.Maybe there was something here ... but it's so poorly balanced and playtested that it is pure frustration and disapointment.

												It's obvious the overall game design ideas that are the core of this game. Unfortunately I don't think the developers asked themselves honestly ""Do they work?"". Avoid this game unless you want to be disappointed.			"

												A quite nice tower-defense-like game (if you imagine your towers are living creatures and are constantly moving to get away from this cruel world :) ). I, however, failed to fully understand the game mechanics, so it generally takes me more than half an hour to pass a level or to get completely stuck on it. So, I may consider this game a bit unbalanced. Unpredictable level time / length is a huge minus for me.			"
