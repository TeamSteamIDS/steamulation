												This is the best game that nobody has. I bet this Steam release will change that. The game lacks  support and online play and I can only hope that one day it will be patched in by the community. Other than that it's a completely unique game that requires both strategical planning and skillful timing. The single palyer challenge provides hours of gameplay and multiplayer through LAN is truly a fun and interesting experience.Edit: Turns out the community delivered a utility for online play and random generated maps long before my comment, search for moonbase commander console on google.

												Oh My God! I grew up playing this game with friends for hours on end back in elementry school and now its on steam, this... hold on, i'm having nostalgia. Best part? They didn't change a single thing!I'd recomend this game to anyone, it's fun, addictive, and for a great price. I hope that this release to steam rekindles the online multiplayer community and gets people interested in it once again. It's a steal for only $6.			"

												This game has simple game mechanics, small tech tree, but provides a nice skill curve, once you figure out what each thing does, its a matter of how to use them effectively. no instructions (no tutorial) which is kind of expected from old games like this, but they have a tutorial video on the store page so that does help, the game isn't complicated. Though since the game was put on steam it would of been nice if they added window mode or resolution options or make it so the steam overlay worked ingame so thats disappointing. However the game works on new computers and I haven't ran into any color issues that seem to be present in old games on newer systems.Gameplay:Players take turns launching units, structures or projectiles around the map. Players must secure resources around the map to gain more energy, the more energy you have the more things you can do per turn. The challenge comes from base planning and launching, every building palced is connected to the hub (the building that creates the other buildings) they are connected by a line, and no line can overlap each other so you must place your buildings carefully.The hub can only launch the structure so far, when you press the ""launch"" button you have a charge meter to see how far it goes.There is plenty of strategy and planning involved, the game has single player and multiplayer, single player offers skrimish mode and challenge mode. Skrimish is multiplayer but with AI. Challenge mode is bunch of scenerios with different objectives to complete. It's a nice way to learn the game and experiment with all the stuff.Graphics and AudioThe game is old and only supports low resolution but the sprites look really good, everything is pretty easy to identify and there are 4 teams each with different looks of the units so it has a nice mix up of the same units.The music is catchy and fits the game, totally kickass and really enjoyable, the sound effects are great and the voices that speak to you help create character for the teams and fit really well together.OptionsAs expected from an old game there isn't many options specially video options however it does contain the hotkeys and audio options including the ability to turn off the commentary if you so desire.OverallThe game is great and functions as intended, works on new systems but lacks features for a steam game, it's a small game and a low price, makes for an excellent game to play with friends. I give the game a 8/10, if they made the steam overlay work and add windows and resolution options it would be perfect.			"

												When I heard this was on the auction block, I seriously wondered how much it would go for. Was saddened when it disappeared into the maw of Atari, never to be seen again. Until now!This may be the best strategy game that nobody played, and it just begs for a modern port for touchscreen devices. It's just an awesome strategy game with simple controls, and a depth that really grows on you over time. Yeah, the graphics are nothing special, they looked 10 years old when the game launched 10 years ago. The multi-player is LAN only. The voiceover accents are cheesy. It doesn't matter.You play by launching one of 18 nodes onto the battlefield, scorched eath style. Every node costs energy, and is connected  to the node that launched it by a chain. If a node is destroyed, the nodes launched from it are destroyed in a chain reaction. There's the skill of placement, the tactics of deciding what to launch, and the strategy of resource management and the fog of war. There's never been another game quite like it, before or after. And that's sad. But at least you can still play this, even on Windows 8.1, 64 bit.Penny Arcade's effusive love for this game is still as relevant today:http://penny-arcade.com/2002/06/11As this is an old game, there's not a lot of handholding. The challenge mode works as a tutorial, but you really should read the manual. Seriously.It shows that this was a labor of love by a developer otherwise known for children's games. They must have polished this sucker in the back room for years playing amongst themselves. I've no idea how they made the pitch for this game work, but I'm still glad they did. Personally, I bought this just to convince Rebellion that a modern port is worth their time, this is one of the few game CDs that I've kept on the shelf since I bought it, and carefully re-installed on every new machine.

												I used to play the hell out of this game.  The main issue with the game is lack of multiplayer support beyond LAN connections.  My friends and I used to create a virtual LAN by using Hamachi but it's difficult to get most people to go through all that trouble to play an old game like this.  Otherwise I would buy this for some friends but at least I can enjoy it and know it'll be in my steam library so I won't lose access to it.			"

												Man, I remember this game... Back when I was in middle/high school, picked this up at a Big Lots' bargain bin sale. Thing looked old, but I figured ""why the hell not?"".It's a fun little game with an interesting feature: You fight with your buildings, not soldiers.You become more powerful by expanding your base, setting Energy Collectors to boost the amount of energy you have to spend each turn, which allows you to perform more actions, such as launching more buildings and attacks.The base is expanded by launching structures from a ""Hub"", which is the primary building for attacking and expanding the base. The hub can launch other hubs for further expansion, or set defensive buildings like forcefield generators and anti-air missile bases. And, of course, they can launch energy collectors for collecting energy. The Hub can also launch attacks against other buildings by launching a variety of ranged attacks, such as regular bombs, scatterbombs, missiles, and even a virus! The Hub can also launch a special ""offensive"" building which can only launch attacks, but at a far greater distance than the regular Hub.This game also has a unique feature where all the bases are connected to each other by Power Cords. The power cord shows not only which bases are connected, but which hubs are supplying them power (aka which hubs they were launched from). If you destroy a hub that is supplying power to other buildings, those other buildings are also destroyed.All in all, this game is fun. My favorite attack is the Energy Spike. You can hit cords and attack the two buildings on both ends of it!			"

Battle your friends, or take on the AI on a multitude of premade maps, or use the level editor which is easy and fun to use. A sassy, robotic voice is hilarious and the funky music will always keep you groving. The wonderful simplicity of Moonbase Commander gives games on the caliber of Starcraft 2 a run for their money. Moonbase Commander is a must-buy.			"

												Grab this game when is on sale, its a lot of fun!I remember the days when i had MBC on my first pc.... It brings back a lot of memories. Ok about the game : This is game is realy old but its good. The game mechanics are simple. You have one main base and you expand from there . If your main base is destroyed you are dead. Its the same for your opponents.There are 2 ways to win in this game : First is to try kill the enemy main base ASAP on turn 4/6 and get +7 enegy and go for the next enemy or expand your economy and then kill the rest. Second is to be good at aiming and hit the energy pool on first turn and after that you can go for the next energy pool or try fighting.Important !!! Disable fog of war , the wind and play on flat maps till you get use to the game machanics. When you feal ready turn them on again so you can realy enjoy the game.Also dont be discourage when you are playing challenge mode. This game dont give gold medals easy.			"

												Played this game quite a bit many years ago... This is a turn-based strategy gameWhat sets it apart from other similar games is the unique way in which you build your base. You sortof, launch the new stucture by timing the force required to achieve the desired distance while taking into account wind deviation in order to get your buildings to the desired location and it remains connected to your hub by a tether. So there's some skill involved in launching things safely on target. Just knowing what each unit is used for is really only half of the equation. Getting them properly deployed is where this game will offer you a fresh experience.If you and your friends play RTS/TBS games... challenge them to a game of moonbase commander for some laughs fumbling over just getting your units deployedRecommended for unique gameplay mechanics and a fresh take on the genre, even for an old title			"

												Huge fan of that game. I had so much fun back in the days playing it with friends. The game has won the reward of the ""Best of 2002: The Game No One Played"" award, which was the result of bad marketing and targetting the wrong audience (kids).I am still eagerly waiting for a remake as the game isn't really playable properly nowadays because such thing as extremely low resolution (the window is tiny on my 4K monitor), the LAN only networking and the AI that has its flaws the more buildings are placed.

												This game will probably go by unnoticed. Shame, since Moonbase Commander is one of the most original and most entertaining games lately! It might not have stunning graphics and sound, but if it’s fun that matters then this is one great game!So, what’s the story of this game? It’s quite simple – four companies are fighting for domination of the Moon. That’s all! There are no more details of the story, you will not be briefed about the current situation on the field, nothing! As the single player “campaign” starts, you will play as Niceco Company, then move on to Dewolf, then to System 7 and finally complete the game as Alpha team. Each company offers 4 missions and if you play for about 2 hours per day you should be done in less than 4 days. And I was just beginning to completely enjoy my superior strategy…The game plays as follows: you construct various structures such as air defense missiles, energy collectors and radar towers as well as fire missiles, bombs or crawlers. Each component can be constructed only in the hub. Hubs are the cores of each “base”. When you want to build a component, you need to select it, pay the price for construction, then aim and fire the component in the wanted direction. New component will be connected to the hub and will be destroyed if hub is destroyed. Hubs can also construct other hubs, but note if the main hub is destroyed so are all others and you have lost. Each component has its price of 1, 3 or 7 energy points. When you start the game you will be getting 7 energy points per turn, but finding energy sources and placing energy collectors gives you extra 3 energy points. Your goal is simple – destroy enemy main hub(s) or place an energy collector on a specific energy source and hold it for a set number of turns (you will be told about your goal).There is total of 18 components and weapons that can be “fired”. Aside from previously mentioned hubs and energy collectors, you can also build air defense (protects you from various air attacks), towers (provide larger viewable area when fog of war is turned on), shield (protects an area from everything) and so on. On the other hand, guided missiles are great if you are not aiming well, EMP disables shields, hubs and other structures, bombs are dumb and you need to aim well and finally, crawlers are ultimate weapon of destruction… but the move real slow. There are other weapons and components but you need to find something on your own!Once you complete the single player campaign, you can still play skirmishes versus up to three opponents or in team with a computer against other computers. There is a multiplayer game option but you can only play it online via GameSpy.The graphics and sound are much below today’s standard but such game doesn't need them anyway. Although the game can only be played in 640x480, everything looks real sharp and nice. Sounds are limited to the usual set of beeping, booming, crashing and whistling, with a voice commentary from your superior’s computers.Overall, the game is quite fun but it doesn't last long enough. After I was done with the campaign, I lost interest, as I never enjoy playing skirmishes (they just seem pointless to me).			"

												This game will always be a classic I think, likely because I've never seen anything else like it. The way it blends strategic, turn-based mechanics with the action and precision of the aiming mechanics is really something very unique, and insanely addictive. I like the unique mechanics, the innovative aiming system that vaguely reminds me of golf games but better, the well-balanced gameplay and weaponry, the sick music, and also the ability to create your own maps. Only things I dislike are relating to its age really, the resolution is kinda poor and you have to somewhat jump through hoops to play online. There are community tools to make online play easier, but it doesn't function through Steam.I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys both action and strategy games, and even to anyone who likes only one of these styles, as it's sure to hook you either way. Buy it. Do it. You know you want to. Make your dreams come true. Yesterday, you said tomorrow, so JUST DO IT.			"

												For years, this was probably our favorite strategy game to play on the home LAN.  We still play it from time to time.  I highly recommend it (and, it goes on sale for under $1 from time to time).Some helpful information:  It is turned based; however, the turns can be timed if you want (60, 30, or 15 seconds).  The game does not work across the internet without a third party tool (look for the Moonbase Commander steam group to find that tool called -- it's called Moonbase Console, and it can procedurally create random maps as well).  It includes a built in map editor.  Also, the game has a very easy learning curve... there are not that many units, so it is a good intro strategy game for when friends come over.  However, multiplayer is limited to 4 players (but, bots can fill in, if you have less).			"

												Exciting old turn-based strategy. Very old, so if you're up to fascinating visuals and fast and easy skirmish on stupid aliens or whatsoever - please, look the other way.The only downside that I see is that they only managed to add tutorial video on the store page and not in the game itself. Other than that - I'm completely satisfied.As you can see from the store page print-screens, MoonBase Commander is much closer to board games than to something fast-paced like BroodWar. You starting with one pod, which is your base, and you building a network of connected pods, all looks pretty much the same. The only resource is the energy, which consumes on every action and restores if you settling on the acid spots. Of course, the only reason to play that game is competition - who is building faster, shooting more precise and planning further. Board game for LAN computers, marks 7/10.Should you buy it? Well, now, with that 85% discount - it is surely a good move in any case, because you can sell steam cards from the game for more money than you paid for it. Enjoy!			"

												10/10, I highly recommend getting this. This game is incredible. It's definately my favorite strategy game of all time. I own a physical copy of this game, played it when I was six years old! I sucked at it back then but today, I beat Brutakas! The enemy AI is stunningly inteligent, sometimes while playing I'll feel like I'm playing one of those computer chess games where the computer just does not mess around. The challenge mode missions are fun and, as the name implies, challenging.  LAN multiplayer is a blast! If you're playing with a few friends who are as equally skilled at the game as you, then it can be a blast! Just make sure you don't play against a person whose new to the game, you'll crush them easilly. Moonbase Commander is highly skill based game, I'd go as far and say that it's probably the most solid skill based game out there. There is only one complaint I have with the game, which is that there is a balancing issue when it comes to underwater crawlers. Those who have played this game probably know what I'm talking about. If a crawler is launched into water, then it becomes the most overpowered weapon in the game, because the only way to neutralize it is to hit it with another crawler, when both crawlers hit each other, they detonate. This means that if a crawler is underwater right next to the shoreline, and you have buildings next to the shoreline, there is no way to stop the crawler from detonating and destroying your buildings. And if you think that's bad, it gets worse, because despite not being able to get hit by anything aside from other crawlers, missles will STILL lock on to the little things, and they won't do any damage to them. Underwater crawlers are easilly my least favorite thing about this game, and the more devious computers love spamming them.  Normally, crawlers aren't that ridiculous, because when they're on ground you can hit them with any type of weapon, and hitting them with a reclaimer defeats them without having them detonate. But put a crawler underwater, and it becomes very annoying. Honestly, a good way to balance it is if they would have allowed reclaimers to hit them while they're underwater. So yeah. That is seriously the games only flaw. And guess what! If you don't play on levels that have a ton of water, then underwater crawlers won't even be an issue! But, let's not leave things off on a bad note. I'm now going to discuss some of the even cooler things about this game!This game features a map editor where you can make your own planets! And then you can play on them with your friends! And the map editor gives you a surprisingly large amount of freedoms, you can set spawn points, you can set multiple spawn points for different types of game types (such as if it's a team battle, a four on four battle, or a two on two battle). The map editor makes the possibilities of this game considerably greater, and I love it to death!This game also features some interesting ways to change the game. In skirmish mode you can play with teams, set a WIND setting that changes the game feel considerably, and allows you to turn off fog of war. These options allow you to adjust the game to your preferences, in order to create the most fun experience possible.Finally... presentation. This game is gorgeous for a 2002 PC game. The theming of this game is awesome! Each of the four factions has their own narrator, and layout. In skirmish mode you can change the color of the team, and your faction, which also changes the color and style of your in game menu. The four factions are as follows, (I'll give you my vague understanding of what they're supposed to be): NiceCo: Russian utopians who are hungry for control. ""They will fall to our superior gameplay."" Dewulf: Industrialists who sound like agents from The Matrix. ""We're gonna own this planet.""System 7: Evil robots who are obsessed with triangles for some reason. ""Our Galactic domination will continue.""Team Alpha: Military guys, the good guys, on a quest to save the galaxy. ""Nice shot shirley! Keep em coming!"" My prefered fraction is Dewulf. But everyone else I know loves Team Alpha the most because they don't give you a hard time when you miss a shot. Also it should be a mention that this game has a AWESOME soundtrack. Final thoughts? GET THIS GAME. This game is awesome! And this downloadable version is just like the physical copy version! Except this one actually works on my new laptop, which has Windows 10. I give this game a perfect 10/10. One of my favorite games of all time. I honestly should have bought it twice during the winter sale and gifted it to one of my good friends .			"

												Quirky little strategy game that a lot of people seem to have fond memories of (personally I'd never heard of it.) Gameplay involves lobbing units / structures about on the battlefield kind of like worms or some classic artillery game.Comes with too many issues for me to recommend; fixed (low) resolution, horrible interface, lack of any sort of instruction / tutorial and gameplay is slow. Unless it allready holds a special place in your heart dont bother.			"

Moonbase Commander has some decent playability. Due to its layout it looks kind of simplistic in the way it could be associated with a product addressed to younger - in terms of age - audience, but it is a disfavour to take it as that. What has been done with this game is something rarely seen - the mixture of very different vital elements such as base construction, resources and space management, turn-based system, dynamic command-and-conquer strategy, as well as skill based combat with ballistic shooting comprehension. That is something to be admired, which makes Moonbase Commander stand out as a challenging and rewarding fun  - one of its kind on the market. Speaking of qualities, the overall in-game outlook is clear and user-friendly. The controls are intuitive and the overall proceeding easy to learn. Additionally worth to be mentioned is the nice electro-type music, decent narrator commentary sound and beatable settings menu, which includes a skirmish mode. Multiplayer option is available only with direct connection, therefore tertiary STEAM-incompatible platforms ought to be utilized as a common solution, which is a pity after all, since the game would be outstanding in that aspect. Nevertheless, what is more to be added? Go ahead and try it out - definitely worth the time of casual players. The actual [2016] price of five-six euro/dollars is fair, even though to some it may seem just a bit inflated. In that case, enroll the product on your list of items to grab on a discount. To me, this is probably the best game I have played in recent time, as least in the category of strategy and tactics.			"

												I usually like retro games - never cared for fancy graphics... But this game isn't it.  Wierd abstract sort of gameplay - can't even control where you build your base - you have to pick a direction and ""velocity"" and launch new base modules and hope they land where you want - there is no feedback - so if you don't get the velocity right you lost the cost of building and a ""turn"" for nothing!   Assuming you do build where you want - launching attacks is the same direction and velocity mechanic!  Argh!  I don't see how this could be so well rated.  It's not worth one dollar - can't believe I bought this!			"

												I wouldn't really recommend buying it. It's a bit of a confusing mess of a game. I can understand the concept of it, but it's too dated and doesn't really give any satisfaction for a strategy gamer. It's much more of a projectile estimation game.			"

												I hope you like 640/480 because that's all you ll get.I hope you like clunky mouse controle because your speed is impaired and only left button works. Don't try to zoom.So, there is no tutoriel nor campain. You can choose to map edit, skirmish, multi player or challenge.In challenge, you will find mission of easy caliber and objectives. Don't expect any help or direction on whatever you must do.On the first one you must build collect from enery pools. They of course don't appear on munimap but first one is in reach. Second one, you must build a line of hub to get there. There is strictly no indication or tool tip. You can hover mouse over the buton all you like before you find the utility on divers actions.How can such unfinished game be published in 2014 baffles me.I bought this game during sales because it looked fun. The good part is that I now have more time to play other games.			"

												I love this game because it has all the fun, challenge, and competitiveness you'd expect, but without the overwhelming number of skills, abilities, items, and whatnot of a modern game. It's the kind of battle game that's easy to learn and hours of fun. The AIs are actually pretty good too, with a significant range of difficulty level. Every once in a while they'll do something stupid enough to make you laugh, but for the most part they provide perfectly challenging opponents.			"

												Copying my review from GOG.com:Moonbase Commander won Gamespot's Best Game No One Played award in 2002. Well you should! This game is EXCELLENT! It's a strategy game that's instantly understandable, easy to play, hard to master, and tons of fun. Throw crawling bombs into the lake, send decoy cluster bombs to take out his anti-air, lob a virus at his hub, and laugh maniacally as he amputates his own arm! The music is hilariously bad. Don't let the Crayola graphics fool you--this is a deep game and a blast to play with friends. A *must* for LAN parties!			"

												Moonbase Commander is a vastly underrated classic; I learned about it a few years ago, and the version I played didn't have multiplayer (you needed to mod it, IIRC). This version has it built-in, which is great!Even if you can't drum up other players to annihilate, the single-player Challenge Mode should keep your strategic brain ticking over nicely. I can't recommend this game highly enough!My one criticism is that you can't change the resolution at all, which is unfortunate, but not too much of a problem, really.			"

												Great classic turn based strategy game.It's kind of no-frills fun.The only annoying thing is the element of chance - judging the distance new nodes are thrown from your existing structure.But some may even say that's a benefit, as it rewards experience.Definately worth buying.			"

												I enjoy this game as a bit of a time filler between other more complex games.  While the basics of the game are pretty simple the exact distance to luanch things can be a challenge.  The game is at a good price if you are looking for something that is pretty easy to  pick up and put down without having to rembebr complex mechanics.  TLDR:  I do recommend this game for those seeking a quick escape with out too much time to commit to it.			"
