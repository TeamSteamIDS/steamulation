												I'm not sure what prompted me to get HNR;B1. Yes I play Japanese videogames, yes I watch a little Annie May, and hell I even listen to Hatsune Miku. However, I'll be deep-fried in damnation before I tolerate uguu moeblobs crying over baka oniichan and the lack of senpai-noticing. That's not what this game is about though. The art might give you that impression, and there is some fan-service, but I dare say the best qualities about HN are the characters and writing.HN is broken up into 8 chapters. Typically there's plot, then shopping, more dialogue, random people handing you ""plans"", dungeons (both forced & optional), and then more plot. It's a standard setup and if you know what you're doing and/or skipping dialogue this game can be quite short. I wouldn't recommend it though, because the actual game portions aren't the greatest. From what I've read, this edition of HN is a massive improvement over the original in terms of exploration and combat. This must mean the first version was really dire.Getting around is handled via a map-screen, with dungeons representing the only ""on-foot"" portions. While the dungeons include various niceties like no random encounters, the lay-outs tend to repeat quite often. We're talking the exact same lay-out, and the enemies that populate them tend to be the same creatures you already fought, except stronger. There's no other way to say it, the dungeons in this game are weak. At least they're short, and they aren't bogged down by elevators, lots of stairs, and mind-numbing puzzles.The combat fares a bit better. It's turn-based and over-time you develop combos. There are three types: rush for building EXE meter (super moves), power for straight damage, and break for taking down shields. There are a variety of other skills like healing, buffs, and so on. The roster of playable characters eventually blossoms to over a dozen as well. It sounds like a lot to take in, but for the most part this is not a difficult RPG. There's very little strategy aside from ""use a lot of super moves"" and the ever-important ""heal when you're low on HP"". If you're getting slapped to heck and back, it's probably because your level isn't high enough. Late-game grinding isn't really a hassle either. A lot of optional super-enemies drop enough exp to level multiple times in a single battle. I suppose the level of difficulty can vary greatly, depending on how much leveling you do. Some players might find more entertainment in avoiding optional fights, so that every regular encounter is hard-fought. Eventually though you're going to become OP, you can't resist it.Most of the grind in this game is in finding all of the materials. Those plans I mentioned earlier add things to the game. New equipment, new abilities, more dungeons, and so on. They require materials stripped from the cold dead flesh of the monsters that you kill. This is best tackled with a guide. The in-game ""Nepedia"" is nice, but it pales in comparison to a guide from good ol' gamefaqs and the always handy CTRL-F. Materials (along with corpses) can also be turned in for quest rewards (if applicable). Quests are interesting in that completing them can raise & lower shares. The gals of HN are always talking about shares and their importance in the console war. This never really becomes a factor until 1) the ending and 2) the acquisition of hidden characters. It's something to keep in mind. I guess I should mention that aside from the ridiculous ""millionaire"" achievement, HNR;B1 isn't bad if you're a completionist. Doing everything (aside from some DLC) in the game took me less than 30 hours. I have played through the Vita game as well. That first play-through took about 30-35. If you don't skip cut-scenes, the length is more than reasonable.Notice the lack of character discussion in this review. Yeah, I'm not going to spoil the best aspect of the game. The cast of Neptunia is great, and the voice-acting (both ENG & JPN) is very well-done. I mean okay yeah, it's cute girls, some of whom transform into something exceptionally form-fitting, but the dialogue is rarely dull. Aside from a couple (expected) interactions, the cast doesn't get too hung up on the standard Annie May tropes either. Call me shallow, but I also got a kick out of all of the videogame references. The most amusing one to me is Neptunia herself. The other goddesses are Leanbox, Lastation, and Lowee. Since the plot of this game involves a console war, you can guess what those names refer to. So what's the deal with Neptunia? Back in the mid 90s, Sega was planning a console that combined the Genesis & the 32X. It was called Neptune. Honestly, I can't think of a better system that represents Nep-Nep, she is quite a random character.So yeah, I recommend HNR;B1. As far as J-RPGs go it's not particularly great, but it has so much charm I can overlook its faults. Also, it's appropriately-paced and the port isn't too bad (although I had to switch to XP compatibility due to constant after-battle crashes). Don't write this game off simply because you visited the community hub and saw a few questionable images.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

 tl;dr: An extremely basic and grindy RPG with cute characters, funny dialogue, impressive English dub, and a pretty depth lore. Give this one a go if you're very patient and have a few days to burn. Gameplay: The Gameplay is a turn-based system where you and your enemies take turns beating each other up and magical or physical attacks, sometimes both at the same time. The higher your combo, the more abilities you can use. There's a shop in every city that's indentical (The shop that is) and sells gear for your Party Members. There's also plans, which are basically upgrades you can get which will change the game or different characters, but you need materials for said plans. To get plans you have to visit through dungeons and collect loot, kill enemies, and explore. There's roughly 7 or so dungeons that are all very different, but they get copy-pasted for roughly 40 or something dungeons. Same with enemies, so it can get repetitive very quickly. Some Dungeons such as the Snow-related ones are also too big and don't have enough enemies. Plus, lots of treasure can go un-noticed due to the painful amounts of white everywhere. Characters: The characters in Neptunia are so good and likeable that there's even fans who pretend to be them, kinda odd, but kinda charming in it's own unique way. The Characters themselves are also charming, it's very silly with dialogue. You don't get to pick who you send out to talk, or the words which they say. Instead you're pretty much just watching them talk to each other, sometimes with voice to go along, other times just text. To move on to the next text box, you need to press Enter on your Keyboard. I found myself pressing Space by accident and ended up skipping tons of important dialogue, the skip is just so fast that it literally skips all of it within just 2 seconds. Kinda annoying, but it's a habbit that you can break easily.Dungeons: The Dungeons are the classic turn-based RPG game, they look really pretty and large, but only a small portion is where you can play. Enemies are randomly strewn about in the dungeon, who will sometimes follow you and attempt to take you down, or you can sneak up on them and get the first-turn of combat, which is very useful against those stronger boss-like enemies. As I noted earlier, the dungeons are very limited and are copy-pasted a ton throughout the game, same with the enemies who are just retextured with different colours. The enemiy choice for some of the Dungeons make no sense. Like, a flower in a dystopia Tron-setting. Enemy Design and Item Design: Something which immediately freaked the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta me was the enemy models. THEY ARE ODD! A giant walking Flower with an angry face, a man who is part-plane, a weird flying face that shoots out steam. Pretty bizarre stuff, but it also sort of gives the game it's own style and charm. The kind of charm where a Game-Show Host shows you different Enemies from different games and asks you which one is which. You see a Part-Man, Part-Plane and immediately you know that it's from Neptunia. The items, like weapons and costumes also look wicked cool. Classic giant Japanese weapons, can never get enough of them. I'm afraid that's really all there is to the game. It's a very simplistic game that should probably be just 10 hours long. But they manage to stretch out longer, while keeping new surprises coming towards you in terms of story and dungeons (even if those dungeons are copy-pasted, they add small changes each time).  "

												As someone who played this game to platinum three times on the Vita (thanks, stacking region trophy lists!), I find it to be the best Neptunia released in the West yet. The gameplay is simple to grasp and fun to play and the script is the best yet with quite a few funny moments, which is a huge step up from the very first game's cringe-worthy reference overdosing every few seconds. The English dub is also very good.Just one note: the cutscene portraits weren't scaled up, which is quite noticeable during cutscenes, particularly against the much crisper backgrounds. It's not a dealbreaker, but it may bother some people.			"

												Let's start with a note: Neptunia saga is not for all, that's a fact.As far as you can try if you don't like these ""breaking the fourth wall"", other games references and the fact the characters (at least the main ones) are girls you are not going to enjoy it.Now let's talk about the game:HDNRB1 is not just a remake of HDN, infact much is changed between story and mechanics.The game is a quite hard JRPG, at least at the begin, sadly later you will probably going to spam these EXE (super like moves) destroying everything in your path but still the game gives out quite a challenge.There's not actuall grinding like other JRPGs but still you can't go around ignoring enemies or you'll be in trouble against these End chapter bosses.Graphically the game is not that bad but not everyone like the ""anime style"".Musics are good even if not that many.Dungeons are... well there's many dungeons but not many types, you will find yourself unlocking many dungeons sure but in the same times many of them are just the same one with some differences and nothing more, same for the enemies, so be aware, if you want to see differences at every corner you are not going to like it.As port is not perfect but still this is the very first port made by IFI and, in my opinion, they made a good job in the end.Should you buy it then? Yes, you should.Still, like i've said at the begin, this game is not for everyone but who knows, you may find yourself having more fun than you think.			"

Lighthearted & self-aware // Recommended for JRPG gamers*A controller/gamepad is highly recommended for this title+ Dialogue is rife with self-aware humor and myriad cheeky references+ Gameplay is solid and straightforward+ Can create battle advantages by sneaking up on and hitting enemies first; pre-emptive strikes can pay dividends+ 'Order of Action' bar helps to plan turns in advance; injects a bit of strategy into the gameplay+ Multiple endings offer a fair amount of replay incentive+ Voice-acting, both English and Japanese, is competent and well-implemented (there are some issues with mouth syncronization, however)+ Detailed character models and applaudable attack animations+ Excellent soundtrack; fits the game like a glove and is often quite catchy+ Character customization is a refined facet of the game, and this offers many opportunities in regards to character performances in battle+ Offers a plethora of items and gear that does wonders to allow the player freedom of choice in combat- Visuals are underwhelming to say the least; textures, in particular, seem overly dated, likely as a result of the game being a port from the PS Vita- Camera is a bit restrictive and often feels clunky, particularly when traversing dungeons- Battles quickly become very reptitive; the player soon falls into a routine, following a formula that takes one down the path of least resistance- Quite a bit of grinding required at certain points in the narrativeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Certainly one of the better Hyperdimension games this series has great potential it still hasn't quite lived up to... still as is - a great JRPG Experience. This first installment feels... shorter than the game its remaking but that may have less to do with the game and my own experence with Victory knowing exactly what to do...As a remake it takes the entire combat system from the first game and chucks it in a bin, replacing it with the more enjoyable combat system seen in later installements.For those not familiar the combat system usually involves a party of three(Four in later games) being placed inside a circular area - characters are able to move freely and you're encouraged to keep them spaced apart as enemies can and will hit multiple targets cluster together - and you're free to do the same. A usual array of special attacks, skills and ultimates are there to fill the standard kit - however your normal attacks are broken up into ""Combos"" which can be fiddled with and swapped around to your liking.Neptunia also keeps its notable game references and forth wall breaking humor. I personally enjoy the campness of the story and chracters, its what kept me with the franchise so far. Its lighthearded tone and utter refusal to take itself - or indeed anything else seriously is closer to a breath of freash air than most of the dower affairs I've seen on the release list lately.Take it as a bit of unchallening junk food - like the JRPG equivelent of Dynasty Warriors.-Port Report-The ports is.... okay? I supposeIts a Vita Port so its not the least bit demanding - The astetic carries it fineResolution Caps at 1600x900? Er.... okay - its not 1920x1080 but I'll take it.Locked at 60FPS - (some cutscenes are at 30?)It is a turn based game so maybe that doesn't matter so much?Rebindable Keys and Gamepad Support! YES!Doesn't use the buttons its dispaying - you should play around with the settings - but it plays fine with a gamepad.Mouse Control in the Menus! YES!I'd say B+ on the port? Cerainly seen worse handheld ports "

												Pros:Improvements to the combat system compared to the original NeptuniaNot an in-depth story, but a fun and enjoyable experienceCustomization to character appearances (not for all characters)Great comedy, even if you don't understand all the referencesTons of replayabilityNot as fanservicy as you would thinkLovable charactersNice animations (despite some being rehased from previous games)Meh:Grind for materials is real, especially when you're going into DLC territoryDifficulty curve is very random. It's either too hard, or too easyYou'll either need a list/guide/site for the materials. Unless you're a super-computer that can remember all 100+ items and where they drop.Cons:First PC port by Idea Factory, understandable for problems to arise. Community has pretty much picked up on all the fixes almost. Idea Factory mends this problem pretty quickly as well, which is commendableChapter requirements for optional dungeons for the Add Enemies plans.Very tedious to navigate the store/plans when you have more plans unlockedVita controls displayed. Once again, first PC port, but you'll have to memorize what you hotkeyedWould I recommend this game? You bet I would if you're into JRPGs. There's plenty of fixes for your systems from the community around. Just need to do a little search for them, if there's none. Feel free to always post about it for Idea Factory to potentially check out with future ports.			"

												My Nep Nep checklist:All DLC brought and installed...All character level 999...All Achievement completed...All Coliseum battle won...All Item crafted...All EX Move from all character watched...All Nepedia monster database completed... (no more ???)Hmm it seems I am finnaly Done with this game.All jokes aside.I really didn't think Neping would be so addictive.Think back about this game.The graphic would be 9.5/10 for cartoon type.The Jokes of this game made me taken many screen shoots and spit coffee at my screen twice.The sound is repetive but after so many hours played it didn't feel repetitive.The Achievements was really easy to get and the only one that's hard is to get 100 Million gold.About 1/8 of the dialoge of this game have pretty good voice acting although i wish it would be completly voiced.There is only about 1 fighting animation at the beginning of the game. The rest of the game is just cartoon and dialoge. On surface this game seems to be a basic JRPG that feature girls that sell skin and make a simple/pedictable adventure. And i fully understand several video game site only rate this game 60/100.But somehow behind all that silliness of the game there is a successful Nep that everyone would love.A lot people would say this game is too cute for them but please give it a try. This game really made Cute into something nice and fun.9/10			"

My Background/Experience With ThisAt the time of this writing, I have 80 hours on record, have all the DLC, have cleared the main game, and am working on the bonus content.  I also have the vast majority of (though not all) of the achievements.Differences from ""Hyperdimension Neptunia"" (Original)So you see ""Re;Birth1"" in the name, and you wonder, ""Does that mean it's a port or a remake or something?  Is it any good?""  So for those with that question, this is a ground-up total remake (not simply a port) of the original ""Hyperdimension Neptunia.""  This is an important point to make; it's important to note that Re;Birth1 is a different overall experience from the original game, feel-wise, in a very good way.  Here are some of the more pertinent differences:The Scout System from the original game is totally gone and replaced by the Remake System.  I could launch an explanation of what both are and why the Remake system is, in my opinion, better, but you can find info on that stuff in Hyperdimension Neptunia Wiki if you want several paragraphs explaining specifically what each system does.The dialogue has been improved over the original, and has more recent references.  This is a plus.There was no moving around in-battle in the original, where you can in Re;Birth1.  This is also a plus, as it makes battles feel more involved and tactical, as your position becomes important.In-dungeon abilities have been changed from the original to match Neptunia Victory; that is, you can now jump (in the original, you couldn't), and the Search Sphere has returned (it wasn't present in the original).  This is a plus as well.From what I've seen of the original, Re;Birth1 is significantly more open-looking and far more colorful when you're inside a dungeon.  In the original game, dungeons felt extremely claustrophobic and drab.  This, too, is a plus.So in my opinion, this is not just good, but great as a remake.Let's address all the pros and cons that aren't difference-based next.ProsThe game is hilarious, and I love the video game references.Any grinding that you may discover needs done is typically minimal, as experience tends to be relatively easy to come by if you have half a brain in your head for picking a grinding location.  You won't be spending days grinding for any of the main story bosses.Boss fights are not ridiculously easy; they take effort and time to clear the first time you do them, which is exactly how I think boss fights should feel, so I list this as a plus.  Even once you get farther and have specials to carve huge chunks out of boss health, you still have to mind your tactics, or things could potentially go south - there is no such thing as a total pushover boss unless you're clearly overleveled.A relatively large cast of recruitable characters.  Naturally, nothing is quite Suikoden and its Stars, but the cast of Re;Birth1 is all lovable for their own reasons, and you won't have a shortage of people to use for the game's last leg or its bonus content.The DLC characters are not ""just there,"" they are actually fully voice-acted and have full skill-sets.ConsSome of the game's bosses have HP regeneration (notably, some of the already tough ones have it).  I have never enjoyed any enemy that has inherent regen that cannot be cancelled, and unfortunately, Compile Heart seems to love doing this.  The bosses already tend to have enough HP, so why not just give them more HP instead of forcing the player to outdamage their healing?  I've had a few incidents where I could have defeated a boss through sheer force of will in a battle of attrition if they simply didn't have regen.Missable Plans.  Yes, you can try for them again in a New Game +, and you do have to play the game through at least a few times to get everything anyway (such as getting all of the CPU Candidates), which helps the game's replayability.  However, Plans that a player may need in order to make things should not be impossible to acquire past a certain point in the game.I felt that Credits (money) tend to be just below my comfort level to come by on a base level until late in the game when you can really figure out how to farm for it.  You get just enough by default that you have to really consider what you need to buy on each shopping trip.  I grant that there are a few ways to make more money at large (such as the plan for Credits Up, or making equippable CDs that have Gained Credits Up traits), so it is likely this way deliberately; still, although Neptunia remains no match for some of the more stringent games I've played in terms of making money, it still feels just a bit restrictive.Personal TiltI think that Neptunia is charming, engaging, humorous, and most importantly, fun to play and and difficult to put down once you pick it up.  I'm a very picky RPG player, being 32 years old and remembering the old days of flying an airship around on the world map, and few RPGs really live up to my personal standards.  Neptunia Re;Birth1 is absolutely an RPG that I enjoy playing despite its few shortcomings, or I would not be in my second playthrough grinding for the super-hard Colosseum battles, nor would I have stuck Re;Birth2 on my wishlist.Bottom LineIf you love RPGs or anime, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is definitely something you want to play.  I highly recommend it.			"

												Hmmmm. Not sure how to review this. Do I review it as a PC port? Or a series I've never played before? Or as a guy who's a big fan of Disgaea and other games like this on the PS3 and generally a bit of a weeb?Yeah, so instead I'm just gonna write about the stuff I like about Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 and was less keen on. Not all of the features of the game are in here, and the technical stuff like the porting and whatnot is almost certainly in more detail in other reviews. These are just my opinions.Things I like:-Good looking on PC-60fps-More polished gameplay than previous installments-The turn based style and combo system works well and keeps you involved-Grinding feels less of a slog than similar JRPGS I've played, with the quest system giving more reason and reward for it-Lily system can create good character combos and adds to the game quite well-Plan system is pretty nice-Great artwork-Excellent animation-Love the music (even the song on the title screen is catchy)-A decent roster of likeable characters, especially Nep.-Pretty damn funny, with a lot of densely packed humor and references-Fourth wall? What fourth wall?-Cool enemy types, from giant robots and dragons to Otakus, Mario pipes and visual novel screens-Iris Heart :)Things I don't like so much:-The game has a bad habit of occaisionally dropping steep difficulty curves on you with little warning-Less awkward or not, grind IS necessary-No real ability to see what areas or enemies outlevel you until you've dived in-I kinda wish there was an ability to click on an enemy and see their stats, moves and abilities like in Disgaea-The 4-way movement feels a little strange in 3d at first-KO'd party members don't get XP, which can leave some characters (healers like Compa especially) as cannon fodder if they get downed too much-No NISA :(Also wanna add that what with HNRB;1 being Idea Factory's first PC port, the game has had issues with other players, including crashes and the like (I've been fine, but others have had issues). However, the devs have been listening to peoples problems and have been working pretty hard on patching the problems, and there's been a lot of support from the community on it too.In addition, the DLCs are pretty well priced in my opinion, without being game breaking but still adding to gameplay. In addition, the promotional offer when the game came out was a great deal and shows that these guys have the right attitude when it comes to bringing their game to a new market and new customers.Generally, Idea Factory have been pretty cool with the community here on Steam and have been doing their best to earn new fans and treat them with respect. Hopefully their example could even persuade other similar devs like NIS to set up on here, but I digress. Basically, I like the game a lot. It's funny, cute, pretty decent and I really hope to see more of it on Steam.			"

												Okay, this is my first ever legit review, so bear with me.First things first, you DON'T need to watch the anime in order to enjoy this game, or vice versa.If you're like me and watched the show before playing this, that's not really a big deal. You'll just notice that some charaters are missing, but that doesn't matter since this is this is basically a prequel. (Except the 2 DLC characters; Plutia and Peashy.)Second, this is an enhanced remake of the very first Hyperdimension Neptunia game for PS3 that utilizes the battle mechanic from Victory.Third, please play this game in Japanese, not some bad English dub where they don't even say Japanese honorifics. There are several segments where the English voices simply fail to play leaving you with just dungeon BGM and subtitles with no voices.-Characters - 8.5Neptune (Purple Heart), the CPU of Planeptune (representing the Sega Neptune), which is depicted as a modern-futuristic city, with skyscrapers and various streets. Nep-Nep is probably one the best female JRPG leads ever. Constant fourth-wall-breaking, pudding loving, happy go-getter. The main protagonist in most games She has a childish personality and lots of energy, and likes to jump headfirst into danger. However, her personality completely changes once she transforms into Purple Heart, taking on a much more serious and mature character. Noire (Black Heart), the CPU of Lastation (representing the PlayStation 3), a heavily industrialized steampunk-style city. Noire is the tsundere type character that wants to get things done. She has a very individual personality and likes to perform things by herself in her own time, yet is quite forgiving and fair. She initially has a strained relationship with Neptune, who acts as her rival.Blanc (White Heart), the CPU of Lowee (representing the Wii), a frosty, forest style city covered with white snow. She tends to get very loud and angry quite easily despite her harmless appearance. Her short temper is matched by her foul mouth, which can easily be demonstrated in almost any conversation involving her. She is flat-chested, and easily gets frustrated when reminded so.Vert (Green Heart), the CPU of Leanbox (representing the Xbox 360), a very rocky and mountainous area, with green grass at the base of the mountains. Vert, in some ways could be considered the most caring of the four, due to her gentle way of speaking and/or ways of helping. She is quite intelligent, but overestimates her strength, and is less informed about Arfoire's monsters compared to the others. She displays signs of arrogance, and has a rivalry with Blanc, partly due to Vert's large breast size. She is also a closet otaku and has a huge liking for videogames. Sometimes it is hinted that she is a lesbian because of the way she acts around IF (or Nepgear in the anime) but hasn't been confirmed.-Gameplay - 7.5The battle animation is very fluid and smooth being a huge step-up from the original game. As you level up a character, you unlock more powerful combos. Although some enemies may look similar to others from previous dungeons, level-wise, they are much more hardened. The tutorials may seems really annoying, but they really do help a lot, especially if you're new to turned-based JRPGs.-Story - 8/10It's your pretty generic and cliche ""protagonist loses something (in this case, her memory) and must get it back in order to have world peace or save the world"" or something story. But in addition to that, the main characters search for four things called Key Fragments (not from World of Warcraft) to release a tome called Histoire from her seal if she has any hope in remember who she really is. For the most part, it's pretty enjoyable, the character interactions make it that much better. The 8 chapters of the game are carefully planned out, so other than the battles, there's nothing really repeated. Side Note-It is stated several times about the importance of Shares. Share is a term describing the amount of influence a CPU and her formed nation has over a place. The amount of share is influenced by the amount of faith and belief people has over a CPU. In addition to influence, the CPU's powers depends on the amount of acquired share. CPUs can be incapacitated if they have insufficient shares, though this is proven wrong gameplay-wise. Although in this game, that's not the case. Pretty much, all you need shares for is to get the CPU Candidates as party members.Nepgear - Planeptune: 30% Shares for plan / 50% for being able to craft said plan.Uni - Lastation: 30% Shares for plan / 50% for being able to craft said plan.Ram & Rom - Lowee: 30% Shares for plan / 50% for being able to craft said plan.Leanbox doesn't give you anything which really sucks for Vert. :/Cons-There is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of grinding. Sometimes it takes hours of grinding to get to a decent level where you don't get immediately thrashed by starting the next story boss. So if you don't like grinding and crafting, you could either get a trainer, or just suck it up.-Having 6 people in a party rather than 3 is sometimes pointless. When you're fighting a tough enemy, sometimes you can miscalculate their moves. This could probably mean a quick death for one of your front-line party members. Now if said party member dies, you're unable to swap out to the other pair (like Pokemon), thus severly handicapping the fight in your favor.-There is no autosave so you have to save very often. So if your 3 party members die during a fight, that's Game Over. It's complete overkill, dragging you all the way back to the main menu signifying you seriously messed up in life.-This is a console port so it has gamepad buttons where it should be keys (if you play on keyboard like this pleb) It will be confusing at first, but that doesn't mean this game is unplayable, just a tad bit more complicated.I can't wait for Re;Birth 2 and Re;Birth 3 for later this year.Also Broccoli and Ran-Ran are the best.

												Yes, yes, we know all the jokes ""you lose your life, your friends, you become a loner, a weirdo, a pervert, a phedophile"" blablabla. Those ""reviews"" are hardly a review. So let me give you my subjective unbiased and totally unfunny review of HyperD Nep Rebirth1. It's a JRPG through and through. What kept me interested and playing was the gameplay. Believe it or not.What are you doing in this game? You play as teenager girls having an adventure by visiting dungeons, fighting monsters while they break the 4th wall more than enuff to make fun of popculture and videogames. The game follows a simple pattern: Follow the story as visual novel, go to dungeon, fight monsters, beat a boss, continue following the story as visual novel. Repeat. What spices it up is the sheer amount of items, dungeons, monsters to craft, visit and customize. You constantly meet new interesting characters with their own style of combat, abilities, items and weapons that will join your party and help out in combat.Combat seems not very interesting at first, but the more you play, the more you progress, the more diverse characters join your party and the more weapons and items you create, the more combat opens up to you and makes you realise how complex it actually is. I couldt explain it here in a very long wall of text, but I suppose finding out yourself is what makes it fun. As a quick summary, let me just tell you that you will meet a ton of characters for your party, each with their own style of combat, skills, strengths and weaknesses. The game allows you to have 3 members in the front and 3 more in the back as well as giving you free reign over which characters you want to pair, which abilities you want them to use and more. This leads to countless combinations that will keep combat fresh and exciting.Combat too got its downsides. Status Ailments (poison, paralyze, etc) hardly get applied, element types (fire, thunder, ice, etc.) don't really make much of a difference and sooner or later you will find equipment that simply ignores guardpoints and deals heavy damage to HP anyway. (Keep in mind I haven't played the additional content that increases level cap to 999 and adds super enemies to dungeons etc. yet. If the downsides dissappear because of that I will update the review accordingly)Is this game grindy? Yes and No. Level Progression is fast and returning to previously visited dungeons isn't boring since you will be able to alter the monsters/items in each of the dungeons separately. You will find lots of new Plans for new Items  to craft constantly that makes you want to return to dungeons. You maybe reach a point in the story where you have to fight a boss that gives you a bit of a hard time, but you don't need to level up much to be able to make the odds even unlike other JRPGs.Who should buy this game? If you don't mind slight but not too extrem grinding, its for you. If you like an interesting and entertaining story with many diverse and distinct characters, its for you. If you like videogames and popculture then its for you! If you like anime? Yeah its for you! If you don't like anime but a deep and interesting comabt system, give it a try!			"

In short:  This is a very closed world JRPG style game which features a cast of cutesy girls who  beat up monsters minding their own business to harvest XP  save their world? It’s very reference heavy and joke heavy in a large part thanks to Meme Overlord Nep. You’ll feel like a massive weeaboo and lose respect of friends and/or family but at least you’ll have fun doing it. Pick up the game if it’s on sale, it’s worth it even if to just try the style and the franchise. I will say though I have started mk2 and its combat is the same and fairly repetitive.  So where do I start with the Neptunia? It's an amusing game, that's for sure and to sum it up it's more or less references to other games the game. For starters place names are named after consoles or based off places in other games. Monsters exist that look like the enemies in space invaders or like Kyubey from the Madoka Magica anime. Items have names from the final fantasy games. Throughout dialogue there are vague references (vague for copyright reasons I would assume) to consoles, people involved with games, websites, anime, manga and I doubt anyone would pick up on all of them, it's actually pretty good. I've been told that the later games actually get a more references, memes and typical game tropes thrown into them and that is amazing.  Positives   Interesting and likely to get a giggle now and again.  Cute and quirky “animu grills” doing “cute things” If that’s your style and you’re down for that.  Did I mention the insane amount of references and jokes the game makes relating all sorts of “geeky” things?   I feel like the word Nep could be used like the word Smurf was and that relacing any verb with the word Nep will make it an innuendo. (Just me? Okay.)   English dub is actually very, very good.  Nep-Nep sings the Final Fantasy victory fanfare on levelling up sometimes and it’s amusing.  Nep is bit of goof ball  and MEME OVERLORD  making for a funny experience.   Good sense of humour.   Negatives    It is a huge grind from start to finish it feels. After the first half of the game you really get tired of the grinding and need up put it down.  There are ways to speed up the grind to your desired speed however, I won’t mention it here; I’ll leave that up to you to look into.   Cringe factor is a thing. Rarely something gets said and you just go “ohhhfff yeah, no”  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥do I feel like a massive weeaboo playing this game sometimes.  Your friends will deffinantly think you’re a massive weeaboo for owning it.    It’s difficult at times unless you have the DLC. In which case sadistic Plutia will wreck everyone.   Loss of all self-respect   (see top for short/ final conclusion)			"

Join Neptune, Compa, IF, and countless other characters in their journey to find out and beat the culprit that generates the monsters in Gamindustri! Game Overview Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1  starts off with an overview of the game's story, introducing the CPUs (Console Patron Unit) that govern and protect their respective landmasses, and their never-ending conflict with one another which became known as the ""Console War"".As the war reaches its peak, the goddesses hears a voice suggesting that it would be easier if the others would gang up on one to reduce competition, in which Goddesses Noire (Black Heart), Vert (Green Heart), and Blanc (White Heart) agreed on and ganged up on Neptune (Purple Heart). Purple Heart eventually lost and and was exiled from Celestia to the lower realms, losing her memories in the process and fatefully meets two human companions, Compa and IF. Along with Histoire, a mysterious girl who is the personification of Gamindustri's Tome of History, they go on to an adventure exploring its vast lands.Now that the story's overview has been told, let's go and discuss about the gameplay.In this game, the battles are played in a turn-based manner, and follows simple yet solid mechanics. Before you can start a battle, there are three instances that can either give you an advantage or disadvantage from the start. Hitting an enemy in the dungeon map will trigger a ""Symbol Attack"" notice in which your characters are guaranteed to act first before the enemies (and with some tweaks with the plans, you can even destroy the enemy instantly), while letting them approach you first will trigger ""Surprise Attack"" notice which is essentially the opposite of the latter.Once you're in battle, you can four (4) main actions available which are; SP Skills, EXE Drive, Attack, and Defend. The SP Skills command list special actions that can be used  by a certain character and exhausts a certain amount of SP stated. The EXE Drive command list actions that are like super techniques available for each character, which exhausts the EXE Drive Gauge instead of SP. The Attack command allows your characters to do a series of normal attacks that are divided in three (3) types; ""Rush"" which does more hits and useful in filling the EXE Drive Gauge, but has less power per hit; ""Power"" which does lesser hits but packs more power per hit and is useful when the enemy has guard break; and ""Break"" which is balanced in terms of hits and power and is useful to ""Break Guard"" the enemy.Not only that, certain characters also has different hit boxes in which you can align so you can hit multiple enemies if they are in the space of the hit box. The Defense command is pretty much self-explanatory, in exchange for the character's turn they will take less damage when attacked by enemies.Other actions include ""Transformation"" in which the goddesses activates ""HDD mode"" which consumes 20% of your SP and gives your the character's stats a boost, ""Switch"" to change characters place in the rear, ""Item"" to use a consumable in battle, and ""Run"" to flee from the fight by moving a character to the outer edge of the field (does not work during story event battles).In terms of features, the newly introduced ""Remake System"" brings in alot of flexibility and replayability to the gameplay. It allows the player to customize various aspects of the game such as additional dungeons to explore, creating new items, adjusting the difficulty of the enemies, etc. In order to be able to use those modifications, you will need to collect specific materials, achieving certain lily ranks between two characters, or by meeting the required amount of share percentage on a nation. One thing to note though is that you are limited to how many plans you have activated, which is measured through the available space in MB.Another feature is the ""Disc Developer"", which enables you to create game discs by using ""Idea Chips"" that has different effects and writing/burning (not the literal one) them on the said medium. Specific combinations will either result into a ""Godly"" or ""Sucky"" game, which offer positive or negative bonuses in addition to the effects coming from the idea chips. The Pros Improved Visuals, Gameplay, and Replay Value - By visuals, I am pertaining to the upgrade from the PS Vita with higher resolutions and FPS (though some people are stuck with the 30 FPS lock, you might want to check the guide in the game's community hub for reference on how to unlock it). In terms of gameplay and replay value, I am pertaining in comparison to the earlier games with the changed battle system as well as the new features such as the Remake System, both of which combines to deliver a solid gameplay and brings longevity to the game. Fun and Charming Story - While the story isn't quite that deep and complicated like some of the popular RPGs, the game does deliver a comedic, humor-filled and fourth-wall breaking story that brings a fun and lively experience for its players. Sometimes funny, sometimes cutesy, and sometimes ecchi (thank you IF and CH for the fan services). Beautiful Soundtracks and Voice Acting - To put it in a straight and simple fashion, the soundtracks made are divine which blends perfectly in the game's setting, and the voice acting for both English and Japanese voices are on point which brings out the character they play into another level. If you don't believe me, you can confirm that your self through the PVs and trailers available. The Cons Recycling of Assets - While the ""regulars"" of the Neptunia series might be used to seeing the same mobs and dungeons being recycled and re-used with a slight difference in spriting, I would like to perform due diligence to the fact that many new players might not be into seeing the same stuff again and again, which is a fair point to make in my opinion. Repetitive and Grindy Gameplay - While RPGs are fairly known to being repetitive in terms of gameplay, Re;Birth 1 seems to be hitting off the definition of the word accurately especially if you're going for the 100% completion. May it be due to the randomness in the difficulty of the game that causes it or due to the grind for the materials in the Remake System, both of which at some point leads to the feeling that you've been repeating the steps and mechanics in the game. The VerdictOverall, it is a fun and solid game that can be enjoyed by the long-time fans of the series as well as the newcomers, and in my honest opinion, the positive side outweighs significantly the cons (unless you hate anime and fan service stuff, and if you are so, beware that there are plenty of those moments here), so even if you are remotely interested, I would recommend that you give it out a try!If you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.

												If you want to get into Neptunia, this is the place to start. Using the combat system from Victory, this game introduces you to the bright and bubbly world of Gamindustri, where your new waifu awaits. Don't try to go back and play the original PS3 games, the Re;Birth series was meant to update and improve upon them for newcomers - while still having enough worthwhile additions for series veterans.

												This is definitely not an all-time classic, but man, despite the game's systems being a (playable, sometimes ignorable) mess, the writing absolutely carried this title for me. It's both a love letter and middle finger to classic gaming and otaku culture from moment to moment and at no point did I find myself going ""YOU MONSTERS"" instead of laughing.But maybe have a decent-to-high tolerance for anime before going in. Also: expect to discover very quickly that this game feels like the dungeon design had a budget of maybe $50. The art, music, and writing is where the money went, and you're going to start seeing reused dungeon assets about 3 missions in. This is a negative, and it'll hit you with new stuff in each land, but by endgame you'll have memorized most patterns (with some of the optional dungeons breaking this curse).			"

Hi all. I just want to say that this game...this is not just a game  for me. This game has a soul. The community of this game is really kind and friendly. I met so many friends thanks to this game. Really good kind friends who are always happy to help and who are really interesting, and funny to play with. This game was always with me . When I feel  bad this game made me feel better. When i was alone this game is always with me. This game helped me to forget the  painful past and healed my wounds. The jokes are sometimes perverted and sometimes just funny or jokes which break the fourth wall and the cute voices, clothes and movements when you are just farming a dungeon. All this will make a cute smile on your face :) The game is like a visual novel: it's really interesting  to read the dialog and the story is really good. Sometimes I just think what would have happened if Neptune didn't lose the divine battle and didn't lose her memory... probably then all goddesses wouldn't become good friends and evil would've probably won... The game is like a rpg: you must to farm bosses to level up because if you are not a high enough level you will not pass the main boss of any chapter. You must to grind mobs to get an item which you need for a plan to craft some cool stuff which you need. Yes for someone this is can be boring but for me this is just cool :P This game is all about plans because without them you can't continue play. Plans which unlock dungeons which add new weapons, clothes, rings etcetera to the shop. Be ready to waste a lot  of  your time to grind or find a boss,mob or hidden chest to get the item which you need for plan. You can finish game really fast if you play only for the story but if you want to get eveything and beat game to the end prepare your nerves then :P The Music is really good , sometimes i just stop in dialog to listen to the music :D I like that for some harder bosses has different music than the normal bosses. I will link some music exactly from this game but if you want more music for Neptunia check my profile. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 OST Here you can find almost all the songs from this game! In the end i can say first of all of course i recommend  this game. Second of all i love this game <3 and if you love this game too we can become good friends! This is not just a game this is my life....Some challenges for me:Comeplete eveything:reach 999 level, all achives, all ultimate weapons, all bosses and colliseum bosses, EVERYTHING!- done ✓ ✔ My real hours somewhere close to 250.Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 2 reviewHyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 3 review "

OverallAn absolutely brilliant game. I bought this on Steam release because it looked entertaining for the ~£12 it was on sale for at the time of pre-purchase, and have not regretted a single moment of it.Is it the best game ever made? Nah, not at all. We all know that is Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth and it always will be.But is it a fun, enjoyable game? Definitely, easily one of the most fun games I've seen released on PC in a while.It is a game made for people who have enjoyed games for some time (a wide array of games, really), and also those who enjoy Japanese culture, like anime and manga, and pokes alot of fun at both.From here on out I shall refer to the game as ""Neptunia"" because it's alot faster to write and I am a lazy man.Neptunia is very JRPG. If you've not played a JRPG before, you won't know what I mean, so don't let this comment worry you, just don't be expecting anything remotely western in the game, aside from the localised language, since the Japs have very much their own style of making RPGs and have many similar traits across them.Despite this, the developers have gone into the game with an air of sillyness, making a fun game without making something heavy or something trying to be more important than it is. The developers have just tried to make a fun, silly JRPG, and have succeeded in doing so.Neptunia makes light of many things from the games industry, such as how daft the very vague ""console war"" was that everyone pretty much forgot about a few years ago, as well as almost constant references to other games through quest descriptions, moves, character names and so on. Even my beloved Valkyrie Profile is referenced in one of the colluseum battles through rewards,  there is a Laeventeinn sword and ""Pinch Revival""item.Port QualityIt's pretty good. My one gripe with the port is that it doesn't support any resolution past 1920*1080, which is just lazy, but this pays off in a way, since I like to stick something on to watch while I'm grinding in the background.Oh, actually, I thought of something else. The volume options are tied to save files, which is completely idiotic, and as such the game is always on max volume when you boot it up.Other than these two issues the port is great. Allowing Japanese voices is brilliant, especially when the English voice actors are trash-tier and make a mess of everyone. Honestly, the Japanese voice acting is the only option, their voice actors are a god-send.Apparently with the port some stuff like graphics have been upscaled for more high-def pantsu. As it stands I've not played Neptunia on the Vita so I can't comment on this.GameplayAll of the story elements of the game are portrayed in a Visual Novel style, that being images of each of the characters standing around talking infront of a backdrop with a textbox of what they're saying at the bottom. There is sadly only one cutscene that takes place at the start, and occasional special images shown to illustrate something important happening. Only not really since these images seem to be thrown in at random, though usually to introduce a character in some shape or form.As aforementioned, it is a JRPG, and as such you can expecting grinding. The grinding in all fairness isn't completely necessary, though it can be quite difficult to avoid. Gaining levels naturally makes things easier and there is an alchemy system which requires item drops from enemies.The battle system is surprisingly in-depth. It uses a turn based system very similar to that of Final Fantasy X, though not as refined, and you have to choose between three attacking moves that all do different things; Break destroys the enemy's armour bar, essentially a bar that, once depeted, means that the enemy will take more damage from all other attacks, Power, which is raw damage, and usually comes after breaking an enemy's guard and Rush, a weaker Power attack that adds more charge to the .EXE Drive. (I find that, once the .EXE Charge Plan has been made, rush is very much redundant and if Power makes the targeted enemy's HP go down more than the armour, it is faster to use power attacks).The .EXE Drive does two things; it can be expended to use super moves, and if there are enough levels of charge, it allows you to use Combo Finishers. The Combo finisher function in the same way as the standard combo, it is just one extra move.The major problem with the battle system is that it introduces all these concepts through help dialogue and play, but the game takes forever to actually implement them. All the different moves are gained through levels so you get the moves at estimated points in the game, but it takes far far too  long for you to get them all, leaving the battle system feeling incomplete for about 3 hours, at least.The Alchemy SystemThis gets its own header because it is a rather large portion of the game. The alchemy, or ""Plan"" system, isn't too special, in its own right, but does essentially hold all access to all of the late game and non-storyline content. There are standard plans to make inbetween tiers of weapons and armour, all of these items during story I feel are sadly rather redundant, but they can look nice. Speaking of looking nice, there's a rather large amount of outfits to find and make, so you can dress your characters however you fancy, except nude, since the Neptunia girls are all classy ladies and dress properly, even while cosplaying.You know how I said all the end game content is held in the Plan system? Alot of the end game dungeons are missable (as of roughly chapter 6), as to get required plans for enemies for drops for future plans, one must get the dungeons as early as possible. However don't worry too much, since one can New Game+ and will more than likely need to if one wants to get everything anyway. NG+ and Google are your friends here, just be wary for spoilers if you plan on googling during playthrough 1.Everything elseIf I've not made my point yet, Neptunia is a great game with an extensive amount of post-story content. It's really very good and I've been playing it pretty much solidly for two weeks or so.Also, very mildly related, but it must suck being a younger sibling, living in your older sister's shadow. Especially when your older sister is Noire and is absolute perfection.			"

												Nep-Nep on PC.Not much else to say.Solid RPG experience with a unique type of combat experience.Still has the basics of a good RPG, and in this one you can actually swap around attacks, add partners to your current party members, and change their clothing [because who doesn't want to dress up their waifu or whatever].At the release price, this is totally worth it for 50% off, including the DLC packs.First Impressions Verdict: Solid 8.5/10 RPG.

												Port is okay, and the game was good on PS3. I recommend you to use a controller (Xbox 360, PS3 etc.) because the Keyboard+Mouse combination is horrible. They simply didn't think you would be using KB+M for this game. It's like Dark Souls is on KB+M, it ""works"" but feels stupid. However, the game is great and if you enjoyed the game on PS3 or have not yet tried it, go for it. Also, the sale price of 13,99€ (-50%) makes this game totally worth the price. 4/5.			"

												Honestly this has to be one of my favourite games, if not my all-time favourite game on Steam so far, it's addictive, the story line is brilliant, albeit cliche, it still kicks up a passion to find out what happens next. The waifus are adorable (Noire-chan for life) and there's plenty of custimasation in terms of weaponry, the combat system is very suited, though turn-based. Though, there is a lot of grinding, and it's not the kind of grinding I was hoping for :(There are plenty of good XP grinding spots to unlock starting early in the game too, and if that doesn't work, there's even a little cheat online to stop you dying/gain more XP, buy this game, worth every penny. Definite must buy. 10/10.			"

												When I originally played Hyperdimension Neptunia for the PS3, I absolutely hated it. A turn based RPG that lags trying to perform its own animations? Yeah...great product there. However, Re;Birth1 fixed many issues that I had with the original game. Better animations, better combat, less framerate drop and more options to expand gameplay that it isn't paid DLC. I actually really enjoy this game now and if you are a fan of JRPGs, clever gaming innuendos, and moe girls;  then you owe it to yourself to pick up this game.			"

												I just have no words to describe this game.Well, one word to describe it would be AMAZINGBALLZ (courtesy of GRArkada)Ever since buying this game, I have put hours upon hours into the game.I seriously put CS:GO on hold and all my other plans just to play this game.The Story (no spoilers)Absolutely hilarious. Multiple times throughout the story I literally laughed out loud because of some of the written jokes in the dialogue. Seriously, don't skip over the dialogue unless you've read it already, there are some really clever jokes thrown in there. I even woke my neighbours up at 2 AM in the morning because I laughed a bit too loudly. The story itself is very well written, with lots of 4th wall breaking and jabs at clichés. As for the main plot itself, it's nothing spectacular, but the way it's executed makes it one of the best stories I've ever seen in a single player game. Period. And seeing as I got the best ending, I was more than satisfied with the story I've played and helped develop.The CharactersAll of them have very likable personalities and character development is quite apparent. All the good-guy characters and bad-guy characters fulfill their roles quite nicely, though I feel like some of the support characters had sloppy execution and weren't exactly consistent and it felt like the writers just didn't know what to do with them. I'm specifically talking about the brothers, of course. Other than that though, I feel that the character execution (for the most part) is done rather well.The GameplayThe gameplay is a traditional JRPG. It's also quite a grindfest too. But really, the grinds aren't that bad. The game is generous with XP, provided you're the right level and at the right territory and gives you plenty of opportunities to level up. Combat itself works insanely well, with each move being well-described as to what it does and the boss battles are pretty balanced, yet challenging. The item system is also well-done. The shop system is constantly updating with new items for your characters and the game NPCs give you ""plans"" to craft new items for the store to purchase, so it's basically constantly-updating. I like that! There are three issues I have with the gameplay though:- The tutorial screens are very confusing and do a very poor job of teaching the player how certain mechanics work. Seriously, the tutorial screens just ended up confusing me more than teaching me, and I ended up learning everything by playing the game.- Some areas are rehashed. Yep, while playing the game, you'll often see dungeons being copied and pasted with different monsters. A bit of lacking in the originality department.- By the end-game, the grinds can actually be quite menotenous and overstay their welcome, as grinding for the level enough to defeat the final boss is actually quite boring.But the negatives I have with the gameplay are what I consider minor things and overall didn't affect my enjoyment of the game.Sound DesignI don't have any comments on the music. None of the songs seem to stick out (except Vert's theme, that one is really catchy~), they all just compliment the situations and nothing else. Voice acting fits every character's personality insanely well, at least for the Japanese audio. I don't know how it is with the English audio and I am not gonna switch to it just to find out. I prefer to listen to the characters in their original voices. As for the sound effects, they're sharp, they're satisfying to listen to, especially Neptune's Cross Combo.PresentationThis game definitely isn't what I would consider ""a game with the k00l GREEEFIX"" because it isn't. The textures are as basic as you can get, enemy design is also some of the most basic designs I've seen, except for Arfoire, which is the only detailed enemy character in the entire game. As for the playable characters, they're the best designed characters with the most depth, obviously, which is all so pleasing to look at. For, you see - every cosmetic item you equip physically shows up on your character, be it a swimsuit or a pair of cat ears.The framerate could be better though. The framerate never seems to be stable for me. Most of the time it's 60 FPS, but sometimes it starts to drop to 10 or 15 and then suddenly back to 60. I am going to guess that it's just the game's terrible optimisation with my AMD card, because that's a really common trait in games these days...But despite the negatives, the presentation of this game is what I actually consider quite average. Nothing very...spectacular, really.Final VerdictThis game was definitely worth the purchase.Really addicting gameplay coupled with likable characters and hilarious writing, this game is what I would recommend anyone to try out if they want to have a laugh and to have some fun.It is a game that I stayed up all night to play not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES ALREADY! And I don't regret any second I've spent into playing this game!Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 gets a score of:8.8/10.0FANTASTIC! Recommended even for full price, but even more so when on a discount! No reason to pass this game up if you aren't a fan of anime or JRPGs.			"

Product received for free
												Time and time again I was recommended Hyperdimension Neptunia series but I’ve always had a problem with JRPGs and that is the fact that I tend to find grinding pretty boring and usually I leave things half way through. That said, I’m glad I was given the chance to check out Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1, the first part of the series to be released on Steam for not only I came into terms with grinding but it also features a storyline which takes place in a world that most of us who play videogames can either identify ourselves with or be amused by the satire and comedy that comes with it. Story:The game takes place in Gamindustri, a realm divided into 4 different lands, each ruled by its own CPU (Console Patron Unit). Each one of these, with the exception of one, is a reference to the 3 major consoles, Lastation - Playstation, Lowee - Wii and Leanbox - Xbox. For time immemorial the 4 CPUs, which inhabit Celestia, have battled for control of Gamindustri and its shares (the peoples faith in them). This is where the story takes off, during a battle between all the CPUs you, Neptune, CPU of Planeptune, fall down from Celestia to Gamindustri resulting in the loss of your memory but, luckely, you’re saved by your very first party companion, Compa.The story is told as if you were playing a visual novel in the sense that you can’t change the way the story goes, you’re just pressing a button so that the next piece of dialogue triggers. The story is what kept me going through the dozens of hours that I’ve spent with this game, along with most of the combat. Still, there were moments where it felt like a cliché but sometimes the game manages to make fun of itself, for the characters become aware that they’re fictional and this creates some nice little moments in the dialogue. Overall, the dialogue is easy to understand and you’ll get a nice laugh every now and then. On the other hand, not every single piece of dialogue is voice acted, which is somewhat of a bummer to me, even if the english voice acting is not that great at times.Gameplay:Besides listening and reading through the dialogue sections of the game, you’ll be spending a good amount of time in dungeons which you can access via the world map. Here you’ll also be able to visit various different locations where you can shop and talk to people which will either give you plans to craft new items or provide very small pieces of dialogue which can contain references to other popular games such as the Metal Gear saga.Everytime you’re pursuing a quest chances are that it is at the end of the dungeon so either you want it or not, you’ll have to go through those and kill enemies. As you wander through the dungeons you might come across resources and treasures that you can pick up. Obviously you’ll also see different enemies and approaching them or attacking them will trigger an encounter but, even if you kill all the enemies during an encounter they will still respawn after a certain period of time, thus allowing you to farm for experience and loot.As far as I’m aware, combat works like in pretty much every other Neptunia game, it is turn-based but you don’t move in squares like in most games, instead each character has this circle around them which represents the space in which they can move and attack from. Every character has the ability to use either physical or magic attacks and consume potions but the combat gets more interesting with mechanics like “Lily ranks” and ”EXE drives”. Depending on your lily rank with the character you’re paired with you’ll be able to use different abilities and EXE drives resort on building up a combo meter to unleash even more devastating abilities.Of course you’re also able to equip your characters with different gear as well as craft new pieces of it. You’re also able to craft some sort of modifiers which can make enemies harder or easier, make more enemies spawn in a certain dungeon or increase the effectiveness of some ability that you might have. Looking for the ingredients to craft these is entirely optional though.Overall Thoughts:At its core, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is an extremely solid and enjoyable JRPG that made me realise how satisfying it is to finally beat that boss after spending an hour or two farming the same mobs over and over.The overall visual presentation is pretty good, even if some of the dungeon designs are just recycled with different enemies. The only caveat I have in terms of the game audio presentation is the fact that the game is not fully voice acted, as mentioned before.If you’re looking for an intriguing and, at the same time, silly story with various different characters and an enjoyable combat experience I certainly recommend you check this one out. If you’re a fan of the Neptunia series and haven’t played this one, chances are you’ll also have a good time here.			"

												In nowadays (2016), if you haven´t played any game from HDN series (WHAT?), i recommend play Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1, since this one is the first game of HDN series on steam, so you can have a better experience. The game style is a JRPG with turn based battle system.PROS:- Nep Nep (who´s you can ask): the main char and the very funniest (also little baka)- If you haven´t choose your waifu, this is a perferct game, with many waifusCONS:- NothingPlus: the HDN series also have a anime called Choujigen Game Neptune The Animation			"

												If you're looking at a review to decide whether to buy this game, you probably like the anime aesthetic, so this review will mostly cover gameplay.The combat itself is pretty good, character movement, attack ranges, areas of effect, elemental weaknesses, knockbacks, and charging the EXE Drive allow for a decent amount of strategy if you are so inclined. Bank EXE to perform more powerful finishers to your basic attacks, or expend it to deal massive damage.You can customize your characters stats with equipment(although the game isn't very clear about which stats do what, you can probably get a general idea, though I looked at a guide to be sure), even allowing you to choose between STR or INT-based attacks on several characters. In addition to weapons, armor, and ornaments, there are also the largely cosmetic accessories and costumes, which typically provide only tiny bonuses to stats, so you can use whatever you think looks good if you so choose. There is even a customizeable equipment piece, the disc, which you can load with abilities you find the most useful.I'm a bit of a grinder, so I'll mention a bit about grinding here. The grinding is pretty tastefully executed: rather than running through the most recent area to senselessly smash monsters' faces in, I often found myself choosing areas based on monsters' item drops in order to complete Plans, which could add items to the shop, slightly change mechanics, or unlock new dungeons. These Plans also require Storage (in MB), which is mostly found in boss battles in the main storyline, or from NPCs on the map as the story progresses, which encouraged to stop grinding and get back to the story. The combination of a direction to focus my grinding energy and a factor to limit meaningless grinding I found to be a very classy method of executing grinding.The story is pretty simple; don't expect to be blown away by a new development, or to be particularly impressed in general; the game seems to focus on presenting a variety of characters and have them interact in a largely slice-of-life fashion, rather than provide a serious emotional or intellectual experience.My largest problem with the game, was it's reuse of assets; many dungeons are reused in their entirety or pieced together from similar dungeons, and creatures are reused constantly, often without so much as a retexturing. It seems their budget went more to character visuals and voice acting(the weeaboo in me quickly changed the spoken dialogue to Japanese, where I was pleasantly surprised to hear many pretty big names from anime) than environmental or creature art.Overall, it's not a bad game at all, and if you're on the fence to the extent that a review is gonna make or break it for you, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

												Fun time review right here… Skip to the bottom if you don’t want to read a lot.*First of all, I’m NOT gonna review this game as a port, because IMHO it’s a good enough port and I’ve had zero problems with it besides the analog only giving 8 directions and not 1:1 analog movement.All you need is to right-click the game’s .exe file and set compatibility mode to XP SP3 and ‘run as admin’, then you’re set to go without any problems if you have a decent desktop computer and know how to work with it properly.This might be subject to change as the port devs actually care about their release.*AnywayYou know about how lately Steam has been getting invaded by ero games? Erotic games with semi-naked hot women drawn in anime art full of either text or mediocrely bad gameplay?Well, Neptunia has somewhat similar ero content, is a mix of visual novel and turn-based jRPG with good gameplay that easily BESTS any of those games.THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY ‘Waifu Simulator 2015’ RIGHT HERE!!It’s an actual GOOD game overall, starting from the beginning:Hyperdimension Neptunia was a game released years ago for the PS3, it had an AWESOME concept, but poor execution. The game is about a world called Gamindustry, 4 countries, 4 goddesses, each goddess representing a gaming company. They engage wars against each other aka the Console Wars. It’s mostly a moefest (filled with cute girls) full of parody, funny references, puns and jokes.But the original was quite boring with very long convos, unnecessary things, complex and demotivating mechanics and most of all, a terrible terrible battle system. I got tired of it after 10 hours on the PS3 because of that and the DLCfest nonsense it had. Even the framerate was bad.And then someone had the very good idea of remaking the original game under the name of Re;Birth for the PS Vita. And THEN someone had the BRILLIANT idea of releasing a port for the PC. And there we have it: an awesome and simplified game with an actually good battle system, good mechanics, good game design, an awesome soundtrack, and a huge cast of playable characters!Speaking of the soundtrack… I heard the music in this game is mostly recycled from Neptunia Victory, the 3rd original game. Most likely that’s why this game doesn’t have an official soundtrack release, if anything, just a mini-album with the only new 6 only Re;Birth-exclusive songs. And I heard more things were recycled besides the music. But that’s fine to those that (like me) haven’t played Victory, and I also heard Victory has some annoying’n complex mechanics anyway (like Share balance). The soundtrack is awesome, specially if you didn’t play Victory.This game has simple mechanics and if you miss something then, most likely you don’t really need it and you can get it on New Game + anyway, which the game encourages you to do because you get additional digital storage space needed to unlock Plans. Plans are game-changing things that enable you to unlock dungeons, items on the shop, outfits, weapons armor, make enemies stronger/weaker, etc etc, even unlocking new characters later on.Along with the unlockable dungeons, the game has a LOT of dungeons, but they only have like 7~8 layout & landscape variations. Although this isn’t much, at least you get acquainted with a dungeon easily once you already know a certain layout, and the enemies are different though they have their variations and I’d say they vary enough.Grinding is required as each story dungeon that has a boss, is about 5 levels stronger than the previous one, it can be challenging if you ignore fighting a lot.You should play this game if:-	You like anime-	You like jRPGs and want a solid experience-	You like hot and cute girls and don’t mind seeing 95% of the time… girls-	You’re a Steins;Gate fan-	You like Hatsune Miku’s character designs-	You like crafting items like in Atelier games and gather materials but with more simplicityYou should NOT play this game if:-	You don’t like anime and use the term ‘weaboo’ with ease-	jRPGs don’t appeal to you-	You don’t like to grind, even if just a bit (the DLC characters do help a lot in the first 5~10 hours of the game though, starting from when they join)-	You don’t like high-pitched voices-	You mind with some ""artificial content"" like few dungeon layout & landscape variationsAll in all, it’s an awesome game. Might edit my review later, as also I still need to play the New Game +			"

												Back more than 10 years ago, I was fond of RPG games, especially the Japanese ones (Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Golden Sun, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, ...). When I moved to Steam a few years ago, I started to play different kinds of games that did not require to invest a lot of time (platformer, shoot'em up, puzzle, ...). But I felt that something was missing ...So I looked at my games, and amongst the thousands of games I own, I found Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth1. I also own a lot of the FF games, but I wanted to try something new, that is why I checked the comments on this game, and I was in !I grabbed my pad and quickly, I was immersed in the game : I liked the characters, the story, the soundtrack (Japanese voices available !), the animations for the special attacks ... but overall, I really loved the gameplay ! Between the combos, the standard skills, the EXE skills, the HDD forms, and a lot of characters, you have almost infinite ways to fight !! Do not worry, it is easy to understand how everything works. In order to enable that, you have access to A LOT of dungeons, and in each dungeon, there are some bosses that are waiting for you to defeat them.Moreover, there is a craft system with the plans, it will keep you busy for a long time, because you can, as expected, craft both weapons and armor, but you can also unlock special assets that have a direct implication on the fights (more loot, more money, more xp, ...).I do not own the DLC, but I believe that being able to reach level 999 means a huge content !However, the game is not perfect : even if I liked the story, I found that, sometimes, dialogues were too long and childish, focusing on things that could be funny the first time, but not after (pudding, breast, ...). You can almost skip them by using the quick speed, but you feel like you are missing something ...If you want to unlock a lot of plans (for the gameplay or for the achievements), you are forced to replay the game a second time after you completed it (New Game +, you still have access to a lot of things you had at the end of the first run) : indeed, you need memory to craft, but memory is a limited ressource. This is kind of annoying since you cannot fully skip the dialogues, as mentionned above ...To put it in a nutshell, I had a great experience with this game that I highly recommend if you like J-RPG ! With the upcoming summer sales (tomorrow ... !), I may be tempted to buy the other Neptunia games ... wait and see !			"

												Not encountered any technical issues as of yet. Playing in Full Screen Mode appears to upscale so the button icons look a little bit pixelated, but I've seen worse I guess, it's not an actual hinderance to the gameplay.Controls are a little bit clunky, moving about in dungeons feels off as it's four-directional so using an Analogue-Stick feels a bit off, and there's been a few times so far where I've cast healing on the wrong target as to me it's a bit weird how you select a target.Other than that so far I've had a pretty good chuckle at the game so far, great script full of references to not only vidya but to also other anime tropes. (Broccoli references!)Played with the English VA options, combat right at the very start was a bit grating but now into Chapter Two it's seems to have improved a bit. This won't appeal to everyone but for those craving a Turn Based Combat System RPG, this is one of the stronger options out there.			"

												A fun game that replaces the god awful combat of the PS3 original, with the much superior combat of the later games in the series. It's a turn based RPG where you control the cute anime girl versions of the consoles, and help stop the Console War, and stop the evil pirate Arfoire(R4) to save the world of Gamindustri! The combat's fun and turn based, with lots of flashy attacks and smooth framerates, although I believe they're clocked at 60fps. The dialog needs to be mentioned, too. The story is told like a visual novel, with very high quality art assets that translate well to 3d models. It's also absolutely hilarious. It breaks the fourth wall constantly, and never takes itself too seriously, no matter how dire the plot situation. ""Hey! This lady is too strong for being an early stage boss! I call cheat!""""The damage that popped up against us was too large.""""No problem! I'm good at shooting games! I'll just have to barrel roll!""			"

												For tl;dr scroll down.To start this review I will discuss the quality of the port for neptunia.After scrolling through the negative reviews the most noticeable things i saw were crashes, bad optimisation and no graphics options.As far as i have experienced, the game runs on a solid 60 FPS with sometimes (really low chances) a framedrop.The only crash i've experienced is when  you are forced to be defeated by arfoire (shown as ??? at the time) .This was easely fixed by changing the compatibility mode to windows XP.The lack of graphics options is not necessarily bad, I don't miss it at the moment. Though it would be nice if there were more options.Window mode as a max of a resolution of 1600x900. Fullscreen is basicly borderless fullscreen. Fullscreen uses native resolution (in my case 1080p).Outside of that I have not come across any other issues regarding the port performance.I can't really say much about keyboard mouse support since I use a controller.That said the lack of a button overlay when in events was quite confusing at the start (skip button, backlog and stop) and was a bit of a try buttons out with what their function is.In my honest opinion IF did a far better job porting their game than Square Enix did with FF13.FF13 may not have had crashing issues but FF13-2 did after selecting a timeline in the historia crux.Side note to that: At least the ingame menu doesn't lag on neptunia.Rounding this up: IF is in the right direction with their port of neptunia rebirth 1 and i am looking forward to rebirth 2.Now onward to the game itself.Story (generally summorised)The game takes place in the world of Gamindustry where 4 goddesses each with their own respective country fight over rulership of Gamindustry. Our main female protagonist Neptune is one of those 4 goddesses and basicly got chosen to be the scape goat of the four by a mysterious figure in the background which made the other 3 goddesses gang up on neptune. Neptune falls down from the sky and lands right on Planeptune (basicly the country she represents) and loses her memories.Currently as i am writing this review, i am in chapter 2 of the game and the story so far is basicly to my liking.CombatNot sure if the whole combat mechanics are original the closest thing i can compare it to is probably valkyrie profile (not confused with chronicles). But basicly its to my liking and it doesn't really get boring fast.ExplorationThe game is for the most part lineair regarding exploring. The dungeons are short at the start (which isn't bad because it gives the story a nice pace) but they do get longer as the game progresses further.There isn't really an open world that u explore, you basicly get dungeons handed to you by the story and select that through the overworld (the overworld is pretty much Gamindustry as a whole).GameplayThe game is for the most part a mix of a visual novel and JRPG/strategy game.Graphics2D design of the characters are nice and unique in my opinion and thanks to live2D they become even more alive onscreen during the visual novel story parts. In dungeons the characters are all in 3D and look great.The only less detailed part of the game is the textures of the dungeons, they aren't bad but can't say its amazing.Beyond that characters and enemies alike both look great.DLCAre the DLC worth it? Well the only DLC i bought were the extra characters because... why the hell not.I'm not sure what the additional content really entails since all of them have the same description.Do note that the extra characters are kind of powerfull.... It's better to use them as a backup rather than main party members.DiffecultyIn my opinion the diffeculty is set right. Not too diffeculty but also not too easy and with the planning system you can decide if to add tougher monsters in dungeons or even buff the monsters that u previously already defeated.This game does entails some grinding but there probably will be an experience booster plan in later chapters?MusicI like it, don't mind the repetition in certain area's. Battle music is nice and i believe there are 4 different tracks for that? Not sure.Voice ActingDone nicely (using Japanese dub myself). nuff said.tl;drThe game is great and optimisation is done properly.It's a like it or don't like it game which can be very risky.The game has dirty jokes and a lot of references and 4th wall comments.IF did a great job porting this and i really hope it only gets better.Looking forward to Re;birth 2.

												I'm only 12 hours into this game but I am totally loving it.With the exception of Compa, who I find slightly annoying, the characters I've met so far are awesome. The dialogue, especially Neptune's is funny. It literally makes me laugh out loud at times. The theme is awesome. When you put yourself into the frame of mind that this is a game world, things make a lot more sense and it really fits together. Being able to craft plans to adjust things in the world really works in that it fits with the theme of the game. If you want to increase the difficulty, decrease the difficulty, have alternate items drop in dungeons, it's done by crafting.  I really like the disc development where you can customize based upon what chips are added to the disc. Chips are drops in the world that when added to the disc (level requirements and type) will impact the character.The combat is okay for what it is. I do like the transformation option to shift into the stronger CPU form. I'm not a fan of all of the monster graphics... some of them do look sort of lame. But they are computer / game themed so I can deal with it.The one dislike I have about the game are some of the voices during the battle. They sound ""childish"" with things like ""ouchy"" in a little kid's voice. I think Plutia's is the worst during battle... ""what should I do?"" Makes her sound helpless. I wish they were more like IF's ""who wants to get beaten first?!"".I'm sure there's more I can add, but I need to get back to Gamindustri while I have time to avoid the responsibilities of the real world.

One of the best RPGs I've played in years. This one really surprised me - I bought it based on the 'overwhelmingly positive' review status - and they sure were accurate. Essentially, this has all the bells-and-whistles of a classic RPG, as well as some modern quality-of-life upgrades. The girls are cute. The story is fantastic. The gameplay is constantly exciting and just overall really fun.I went ahead and picked up all three games with DLC from the series. Hopefully I'll get around to finishing all of them. That's how great I found this title to be.Pros:+Fantastic and interesting story+Awesome battle mechanic that is exciting and keeps me coming back - I like the hybrid of action and classic RPG+The girls are hot+I love all the side quests and collectables+Controller support is fantastic+Tons of party customizationCons:-None that I can think ofThis one really surprised me. I think it's worth full price. "

												Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a JRPG and every character you come across has their own unique attacks and abilities, these attacks which are (Rush, Power and Break) can all be changed which will determinate the way that the character attacks.PROS- Funny and alot of game references- Great PC port- Very fast saving/loading- English/Japanese voice options- Great OP- New game+ when you complete the game- 2 endings. normal and true ending- DLC's offer 2 new characters, more dungeons, a coliseium and more levels! (levels can go up to 999)- Game mechanics are solid and special attacks (Exe and SP attacks are skippable)- Very grindy (can be a pro or a con)- Can customize characters if you buy outfitsCONS- DLC characters are op compared to your other characters- If you get defeated it puts you in the main menu instead of last save- Enemy levels/difficulty remain the same in new game+ (the enemy doesn't get stronger)OverallI really enjoyed the game, was quite addicted to it over the past few days of playing it and looking forward to the future releases of other Hyperdimension Neptunia games on steam.

If you love lighthearted story, this is good oneGameplay : Basic, Easy to play, but VERY VERY grindy, expect tons of grinding, They reuse the dungeons, TONS of dungeons although i give it a pass because it is a VITA game [keep that in mind]another note : they throw all their budget on VA instead of gameplay department, go figureSound : Japanese VA is top tier with several huge name in industry.I bought it at 10$ for base game and 2.5$ for all DLC, is it worth it? Yes In My Opinionif you love japanese game, and know japanese industry, then go for itEdit: Platinum-ed It [100% achievement ]			"

												I was saving a review until at least halfway though the game.   As a veteran of all the original PS3 iterations of the game I am trying to post this review as non-bais as possible - but that could be hard so too bad :P ProsCute/Moe charactersGreat Character CustomizationFast flowing battlesystemFunny VN style story systemFan Service (if you like FS)ConsUn-balanced boss fights could cause problems for some playersLack of save points during heavy scripted events/boss fight eventsHigh potential of 'game overs' through no fault of the playerGrindyFan Service (If you don't like FS)There are many aspects to Re;Birth1 that are postive, great customization system all the way to a solid RPG battle system thats both fast paced and has relatively few bugs.   One of the few problems that new players to JRPGS or the HDN series may face are the problems with unbalanced boss fights or the typical road block boss fights, needless to say - don't get discouraged if your losing to a boss, most of the time its a matter of changing around your items or preventing certain status changes like paralyse which could be the key to winning. For the most part, fans of any Jrpg series will find the rpg and battle system fun and challenging, however a few points could have been improved during development such as long portions of story, followed by multiple boss fights without a chance to save is problem.  Also during the game several issues could appear which initiate scripted events which could cause 'game overs' far too easy, such as unlocking the coliseum which starts an unavoidable boss battle in Planeptune which is considerably difficult if unlocked too early in the game.

												If you're the kind of person who seeks the social approval of those around you in regards to what sort of games you play, you should probably turn back now, as the whole point of this game is not to be taken too seriously. Re;Birth 1 is a niche JRPG that clearly knows its audience, and the premise is extremely silly - four goddesses referencing Sega, Playstation, Xbox and Nintendo fight over a land called Gamindustri through the power of shares, and the constant video game and anime references are usually genuine and funny, although sometimes also forced and cheesy. I often found myself crumbling into laughter out of nowhere simply due to the absurdity of the overall situation I was in. Aside from its charm and humor, nothing particularly stands out about Re;Birth 1, but it's still an addicting game with decent overall mechanics.You'll spend a fair portion of your time with the dialogue sections between the characters, all of which are fully voice acted presuming you use the Japanese voiceovers. With English however, only some scenes have voice acting and its quality is lower overall, thus I made the switch from English to Japanese about halfway through my first playthrough. You won't find anything particularly deep or engaging in this story, but it's bound to get you into a good mood with its themes and humor. The goddesses are charming with each having their own distinct traits, and some of the jokes catch you completely off guard, like one of the default equips for the Xbox referencing goddess being a ring that has a red glow to it with only three fourths lit.The gameplay itself revolves around leveling up, gathering items and fighting various monsters in simple dungeons for easily obtainable drops to unlock items, equipment, optional dungeons and new powerful enemies as well as to modify the game mechanics. All of these actions use up points called MB, as in memory, which you can only get a limited amount of on each playthrough. However, the game has a New Game+ system that always carries over everything you've bought or unlocked except key items, letting you regain MB every time while still retaining all your unlocks. Unfortunately, many dungeons and monsters use the exact same layouts and models respectively, sometimes with slight variations, making the otherwise unique and charming game lean too much towards quantity over quality. Still as a result, the sheer amount of things to unlock and the need to gather items and drops from different places and monsters combined with the pacing of the story keeps the gameplay fairly addicting.The battle system is turn based and relatively simple. You've got your elements, ailments, buffs and debuffs along with three types of attacks including ones that quickly build up your special meter called the EXE meter, ones that do the most damage and ones that deplete the opponent's guard meter, causing them to take more damage when its empty. You also have special moves that use dedicated points called SP, and powerful EXE drive moves that use the EXE meter mentioned earlier. You can also freely position yourself within a specific area and most of your attacks have an area of effect, being able to hit several enemies at once. At the end of the day though, you'll generally be maximizing your EXE meter build for constant EXE drive usage along with occasional buffs and debuffs, and that's about it. The combat loses a lot of its potential due to the imbalances of the system.All in all Re;Birth 1 is an alright game. It lacks polish, and having more unique dungeon and monster designs as well as balancing out the battle system would have helped overcome that issue. Still, I can recommend this game to those RPG fans who already know they like this kind of stuff and are willing to look past these flaws, as well as people who are looking for something new and quirky since the premise of the game alone can be very refreshing.

												Everytime I play this, I cook and eat a custard pudding. I hope I won't die of diabetes before I finish the game.For those who are new to the series, Neptunia is rather a casual type of JRPG. The gameplay is simple and straightforward. You explore dungeon, collect items and beat up enemies for their spoils. If it's on the quest lists, you'll get reward for your hardwork. The unique part about the game is the ""Plan"" system. Basically, you 'synthesize' items to open up new options that allow you to adjust the game to your likings like: Gain more EXP, Change Item Drops in dungeon exploration, Open up new dungeons, Make Enemies Weaker, Make Stronger Dungeon Boss Appear and many more. During battle, you can move around within your moving range to attack your enemies or keep distance from them. Your main attacks have 3 types: Rush, Power and Break. Rush attack is about dealing as many hits as possible, but it helps you increase your EXE Drive Gauge to use for your EXE Drive type attack and your finishing combo. Power attack type speaks for itself. Break attack focus on decreasing the enemy defense gauge which reduce your attack damage while the gauge is up. Skills also available for dealing more damages or to attack multiple enemies in area. As you progresses through the story and acquired more characters, they can be paired up with one of the battling character for character coupling special effects and attacks during battle.Story is mainly lighthearted...because it's filled with comedies and 4th wall humors. Despite that, there are some seriousness to keep things up. Highly recommended for those who just want to play something casual and enjoyable in terms of both gameplay and story~!ps. Pudding taste nice, start eating pudding today!			"

												- The Story -The world is called Gamindustri, and is divided into four nations, Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee, and Leanbox.Each nation is led by a Console Patron Unit, or CPU, who are also known as the Four Goddesses.The CPUs are Purple Heart, Black Heart, White Heart, and Green Heart.If it wasn't obvious enough, the Hyperdimension Neptunia series draws from the console wars, as each nation is based on an existing video game console, the PS3, the Wii, the Xbox 360, and the cancelled SEGA Neptune.- The Gameplay - It's a JRPG, so there's really not much I can say about it. There's a world map from where you can travel to dungeons in which you run around as your designated party leader to explore, fight monsters, find items, and progress the story. - Technical Stuff - The recommended PC specs to run the game sound a bit misleading to me. It's a PC port of a PS Vita game. I think anyone with a decent Toastmaster 3000 MkII can run the game fine.On my rig, the game runs at a silky smooth 60fps, probably more if I had a better computer screen.The video settings are only Resolution and Fullscreen Mode. The game says that the max resolution is 1600x900, but that's pretty misleading. Running fullscreen actually runs the game in Fullscreen Windowed mode, and if anyone actually pays attention to their game settings that means that the game is running at the native screen resolution. For me that means 1920x1080.Running around in a dungeon, I can clearly tell that the 3D models (which I must say look really nice in this port) and pretty much the rest of the game is being rendered in 1080p.The only thing I can tell as far as I can see that is affected by the resolution options is the character portraits used during conversations, which move via hybrid animations to make them seem more alive.Given the lack of video settings, unless you know how to use your GPU's control panel to force video settings, your game will either run perfectly or your hardware's outdated.- TL;DR/Verdict - BUY THIS GAME THERE ARE CUTE ANIME GIRLS			"

												The very first game of the Neptunia series on Steam! Yuss!Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birt1 or to shorten it, HNR1, is an anime-styled game leading you to the dimension of Gamindustri and the 4 nations Planeptune, Lowee, Lastation and Leanbox which are ruled by a goddess each.Neptune, also known as Purple Heart, is the goddess of Planeptune (what a surprise)Blanc, also known as White Heart, is the goddess of LoweeNoire, also known as Black Heart, is the goddess of LastationVert, also known as Green Heart, is the goddess of LeanboxThe 4 goddesses are fighting over ""Shares"", the definition for the belief of the citizens in Gamindustri to become the ultimate ruler of all Gamindustri.During one of the fights between the 4 goddesses Neptune gets seriously wounded and falls from the sky to the ground that leads to her having amnesia.Besides the story, the girls are really well-drawn and you will feel drawn to them *badum-dish*Yes, Vert has nice boobies, but we will focus on them in another part of the Neptunia series!So, have fun playing and fooling around!

												Starting off by mentioning that as a remake it is simply amazing. As for the original, it was done on a very low budget so I will forgive it as being slow, lacking and a bit difficult to play. It introduced the world to this franchise and I must admit im still wondering how it got on. But now that were here im glad it did. Re;Birth1 is refined and fine tuned to be an excellent game as one itself. Using the original Victory battle system ( wich to me is excellent ) with its easy to use and yet very detailed interface, Re;Birth1 really is one relaxed game battlewise. As for the characters we've been introduced a few new ones and left behind some. The cast itself is very interesting at best. Following an amnesiac Neptune trying to get her memory back and then stopping Arfoire and everything else fishy. The series music is great as always. Catchy and fun to listen to. This game has the original Re;Birth plan system wich is a very decent system. It allows you to create items varying from battle items to actual costumes and effects in the game itself. There's alot to be done in this game, and at its very low price its a must for anyone who's interested in some JRPG action. Pros+ Enjoyable story+ The always brilliant Neptunia cast+ Great music+ Great battle system+ The plan system+ A lot to do if you want everything done ( plans, equipment, etc. )+ Very easygoing and relaxing gameMixed +/- It can be quite easySummarize: An excellent, easy to approach JRPG with amazing features. ( Definition of the word REMAKE! ) 10/10 "

												So this game is basically an adventure comedy game that is a parody of the real life console war, it’s full of jokes, puns and a whole lot and I mean A LOT of references of things ranging from games, movies, comics/manga and popular cultures (mostly Japanese culture though). Personally the thing that kinda bothered me with this game is the amount of anime fanservice (boobs) they shove into your face, if they did a little less of it I might recommend this to non-anime peoples unless you tolerate those things like I do. While the story isn’t exactly great but the comedy aspect of the game is what the game is best at.Pros:Hilarious jokes and they actually keep creating new ones instead of recycling jokes which is one of the things I enjoy the most in this gameReally good turn based combat system, at first it’s started as a simple system but it gets tougher and you have a lot of strategizing to do as you progress in the gameThe lily system adds more depth to the combat system as it can help boost up your characters depending on whom they are partnered withThe plan system is really useful and can help you create things that you previously can’t buy in a shop and make them available for purchase in the shop. You can even make the monster easier or harder depending on your preferences with itThe soundtrack in this game is awesome Cons:The port feels kinda bad imo, the prompts are in controller mode so I was really confused as what button to press and I have to ditch trying to play with the keyboard and mouse completely but it’s not exactly impossible to do if you try hard enough. (Although I got to say it ran really good though, no hitching or whatsoever)Eng dub is severely lacking, basically it’s fully voice acted from the start until the first boss then after that it’s complete silence. There are parts after that that are still voice acted but it’s so little, maybe this won’t bother most of you but some people like me prefer to hear English VAThere’s a lot of backtracking involved because you need to gather things only some dungeons have and those things you need can really help you in a battle from creating a plan, not to mention some dungeons are connected in a chain kind of way where you can only get an item from a certain dungeon 1 and that item can help unlock dungeon 2 where you might get plans/items to unlock dungeon 3 from dungeon 2 (Dungeonception in short).Somehow money in this game is very little and you have to constantly work on side quests in order to get themA lot of the areas are recycled, a few of them are just extended but they are basically identical. To people who want to see new environment and not the same looking area over and over again you will not like itBE WARNED the game is currently buggy to some people, I’m just one of the few lucky people who didn’t encounter a single bug in the game. If you don’t want to risk buying a broken game I suggest waiting a few more months until they patched up the bugsEdit: Seems like they patched out all the major bugs already, good job IF ;)Side note: This game also taught me that pudding is one helluva of a drug			"

												FINALLY I CAN PLAY THE FIRST NEP NEP WITHOUT HAVING TO PLAY THE FIRST NEP NEP AND WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HANDHELD11/10 WAS WAITING FOR A PORT TO PS3 AND IDEA FACTORY UPPED THE GAME AND PORTED TO PCon a somewhat serious note though, i was spooked about how the port was gonna be and, for the most part, it seems to be one of the better ports ive seen. whether it be a japanese or western game.-gwafix options are almost non-existant sadly, but since half the game is VN-style i guess we can let that pass.-rebindable keys was something i was surprised to see, but sadly it doesnt show keyboard keys onscreen. Like if you bind E to be the X button it will still show the X button instead of the E key.-its got the english and japanese voices like in all the other games along with several different audio sliders-judging off the video of the CPUs fighting at the start, i assume the videos are not 1080p and are just upscaled, but the opening video seemed to be 1080p along with everything else.-the resolution option was weird, it says it caps at 1600x900, but that option is only for windowed mode. fullscreen goes to whatever your desktop resolution is.-despite being able to rebind all the keys, it might still feel kind of strange. certainly not game-breaking, its just my index finger is starting to think im playing Diablo III and not a JRPGas for the game itself, well its nep nep. its really the only JRPG series aside from Pokemon where id play through the games more than once. its full of video game and anime humor and frequently breaks the fourth wall. hell, the premise of the game is a parody of the feud between sony, nintendo, and microsoft.so yeahi hope idea factory brings more nep nep to Steami also hope this makes other JP devs realize there's a market for their games on PC			"

												A summary of pros and cons for this game can be found at the end of my review.Re;Birth1 was first released for the Playstation Vita as an upgraded remake of the original PS3 Hyperdimension Neptunia game. This version stands very well on its own for players who are not familiar with previous entries in the series, and contains enough improvements to be a worthwhile experience for those who have already played the previous games. Idea Factory have also added in trading cards and included achievements to sweeten the deal.The story of Re;Birth1 is set in the world of Gamindustri in which four goddesses fight over control in the Console wars. You play primarily as a goddess named Neptune who has fallen from the sky and lost her memory. Together with new friends you depart on a quest to figure out who you are. The story is filled with humour and references to other popular games, yet never felt forced or cringe worthy. Spoken dialogue is available in both Japanese and English although subtitles for the Japanese were not appearing during combat. I found the English dub to be very serviceable (minus a few odd choices) and I especially loved Compa’s voice.The game consists of an overworld map and dungeons. As the player progresses more dungeons are unlocked through the story and crafting mode. Additionally, the crafting mode allows the player to add in new game rules, such as easier battles and more experience, as well as crafting new items, weapons and a large amount of outfits. My main criticism with the game is the repetitiveness of the dungeons. Many levels look the same and have to be run through multiple times to grind out items. A little more imagination with the locations would have gone a long way; however it is worth noting that this did not hinder enjoyment of the game too much. The battle system is notable for it’s a combination of turn based combat combined with free roaming. Each turn characters have an area in which they can freely position themselves before attacking, increasing the level of strategy for each fight. Characters can be equipped with a number of different attack styles and special skills based on player preference as well as the combinations of characters you send in to battle. It is also worth mentioning that the game functions a lot better with a controller as selecting options in battle with keyboard and mouse can get a bit fiddly at times.Overall this is a game I would fully recommend to fans of JRPGs or anime who are looking for a game that funny and light hearted while still dipping its toes into serious RPG territory.Pros: Great story filled with humour and game references, loveable characters, options for Japanese or English dubs (the English dub is actually quite good for the most part), a fun and engaging combat system, cheap DLC that actually adds useful characters, controller support, trading cards and backgrounds, achievements.Cons: Repetitive level designs, requires a reasonable amount of grinding for items and levels, some fights are very challenging without DLC characters or the aforementioned grinding.

												When I first started playing HyperDimension Neptunia Re;Birth I wasn’t sure if I liked it or not. The story and character interactions seemed somewhat reminiscent of the Disgaea series.   As I’m a rather large fan that series I was sure that the story would keep me going through the game. But that wouldn’t be enough to make me recommend it to friends.  That first night I put about two hours into the game advancing the story and figuring out the basics of the combat.  The second night I played about four hours and advanced the story. The third night I started doing the mini-quests and messing around with the dangerous enemies in dungeons.  I had about twelve hours in the game at that point I had just finished chapter three and started chapter four.  I’m now thirty hours in and just started chapter five. The story seems to be a little short but the amount of side content is huge.   At this point, I’m very happy with the battle system and still find enemies in the side areas to reasonably difficult however the enemies in the story line dungeons have been trivialized due to my doing side goals for so long that I’ve wound up severely over the level the dungeons are designed for.The odd part it I didn’t find myself to be grinding the whole time I was collecting drops from gather spots or enemies for items or weapons.  The few times I wasn’t doing that I was trying to do the dangerous monsters to challenge myself.  The Combat in the game is designed really well preventing you from face rolling through enemies unless you’ve really leveled up.  The combat uses a three attack type system divided by break, power, and rush.  Enemies have a guard bar and a health bar while the guard bar is intact they take reduced damage from all sources.  This is where break attacks come in they do minor damage to health in exchange for dealing high damage to the guard bar.  Power attacks are the opposite they do a great deal of damage to the hp but almost no damage to guard. The rush attacks focus on building the EXE gauge which deals with finishes and large damage super attacks.The game is absolutely a blast for me and I wish that I had heard of the Neptunia series sooner.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in it.  It also has plenty of references.  “Go Ancient Dragon, I choose you!”Tl;dr The game is a blast but it’s easy too get lost in side content and make the story content to easy.  Totally recommend this game for anyone that enjoys comedic story’s like Disgaea or games with some depth to the combat system.			"

An absolutely amazing rpg worthy of anyone and everyone's library!POSITIVES Easy to grasp but intricate battle system keeps the game fresh for all levels A lot of humorous moments and dialogue to make you grin  Tons of customization and playable characters; find your favorites and stick with them! Replay value through the roof, all the way to Celestia! Lots of flashy moves (Yes I know I'm a child)NEGATIVES Overall enormity of things to do and collect can seem daunting at first   Reuse of environments and monster models can get a bit tiresome after long sessions .... That's about it!Just don't enter into the game expecting a super serious, dark, gritty, or tame adventure and if you don't love it at first, it will probably grow on you. That being said even if you are looking for the aforementioned story and setting, you can still play just for the gameplay which is reminiscent almost of a Tales Series entry (to me at least.) Definately worth the 15 dollars + 5 spent to get all the DLC; I can tell this is a game I sink the dreaded 100+ hours into and I think you'll want to as well!			"

												Grindy. As in, hella grindy, but still fairly enjoyable.If this is your first nep game (as it was mine) you can easily pick it up from the start and not feel like you've missed anything story-wise. Gameplay is fairly simple even for someone new to turn-based RPGs. The humor of the game can feel beaten-in after a while, but all in all was still pretty good. As far as the content of the game, admittedly its a lot of copy and paste. Most of the dungeons and enemies are just reskins from earlier parts of the game. The characters are cute, and the animations for the EXE or SP moves can be interesting to watch the first few times. There's an offer of replayability thanks to some materials being limited to only be obtained once per playthrough, so if you wish to unlock everything in the game, you'll be playing through it multiple times.Its also worth noting, to those new to the series/JRPGs, Neptunia is basically a hybrid between an RPG and a Visual Novel. In my experience with the game, about 50% of my time was spent reading text (don't use the english dub, its awful), and the other 50% was wandering dungeons and killing mobs, until the second playthrough came and I was instead grinding mobs for specific materials.Even though the game has clear negative points, it must be doing something right to have kept me entertained for over 60 hours.

												Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a remake of a 2010 RPG game released on the PS3. Originally a PS Vita game, it was later ported to the PC and released on Steam.The game is a rather unusual take on the so-called ""Console Wars"" where the consoles are represented by their Moe Anthropomorphisms - Goddesses of four lands: Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox and Lowee. Fighting each other in Celestia, three of the Goddesses decide to gang up on Purple Heart, knocking her off and causing her to fall down to Planeptune. There is found by a young nurse named Compa who takes care of her injuries, as well as turning out that she lost her memory. Then they are contacted by a magical sealed tome called Histoire who sends them on a quest to find the Key Fragments neccessary to free Histoire, as well as unite all the four goddesses to fight together against a bigger threat.The gameplay is basically your typical turn-based jRPG with minor tactical elements. Your characters and enemies take turns performing attacks, using abilities or items. It's rather simple to get a grasp if you played any other turn-based RPG. Outside of dungeon exploring and fighting, you can use shops, view the gallery, accept and complete quests, or use special ""Plans"" to add or modify existing content in the game. The difficulty feels just right - it's not as hard as old-school jRPGs, but also not easy enough that you will be bored (unless you specifically overlevel your characters for the upcoming fights). The game even hands you certain Plans that make the enemies tougher or easier, so there's always some way of tuning the difficulty a bit if you want a challenge or - the opposite - want to focus on the story. Majority of the content is grind-based, however, so if you care about exploring everything, you'll have to level up your characters quite a lot.The story is quite engaging, with you traveling and exploring different lands, trying to stop the main villain from realizing her plans, interspersed with constant humor and jokes about either the characters themselves, whatever gaming cliches may appear, or just plainly ignoring the fourth wall for the sake of fun. All of the characters represent either a console or a game company, and they're a very likeable bunch. Of course, it's full of fanservice in one way or another, but what would you expect from a game that creates Moe Anthropomorphisms of game consoles?The graphics are good. You might notice blurred textures here and there, but it's nothing big, and it's pretty to look at. The only reason you might not like it is if you don't like anime style.In the sound department, we get mostly electronic music or rock, with quite a lot memorable or downright awesome themes. It's definitely worth listening to even outside the game.As far as the DLC goes, it's kind of a mixed bag. DLC characters like Plutia and Peashy join early, when your party is rather small, and provide a lot of additional firepower that makes the early game a little easier than normal. The ""additional content"" DLC, when all of them are purchased, introduces a lot of new dungeons and Colliseum battles, while extending the level cap from 99 to whopping 999. But, as you can guess, all of this content is purely grind-based, so if the only thing you care about is the story and not watching your characters grow stronger, I would suggest against buying this DLC.The game also pretty much requires New Game+ in order to unlock everything, since one playthrough does not yield enough MB (Megami Bytes) to craft every Plan you can get.Overall, this is a great game, featuring adorable, likeable characters, nice graphics, great music, interesting storyline, as well as lots of humor and content. I heavily recommend it to anyone who likes jRPGs that don't take themselves too seriously or cutesy games.			"

												As a person who finished the storyline of Re;Birth1 for the Vita at least thirty times it pains me to admit the Steam release is a clumsy port with all the fun key re-binding that comes with being a portable game previously. L-Stick, R-Stick, D-Pad and all the buttons and bumpers have to be rebound, which can be a royal pain in buttock. It might just be because my computer is utter wank, but I've noticed the game also seems to have some graphical hiccups at times. But as I said, my computer IS wank.On the other hand it's Neptunia, Re;Birth1. Instead of a remake it's more akin to a full overhaul of the original, keeping the main story plots and a few features present while tossing out a few more muddled elements. Is it better than the original? Gameplay-wise I'd have to say definitely without a doubt. Story-wise and dialogue-wise is more subjective, though overall I'd have to say yes. Unfortunately due to real-life events there's no more Nippon Ichi/Nisa or Gust, so tears shall be shed there.Though we do have Broccoli now.In the end, despite the hiccups I'd recommend getting the game. It's Neptunia, and Neptunia is the beautiful grace of the Goddesses, descended upon us feeble masses. But would I recommend it over the PS Vita version? No, the problems of the Steam release can take you out a good amount and the Vita is a better experience for that.. Plus it's portabler. However the Steam version is still more than worth your time, I'd recommend it any day as long as you don't have a crippling phobia of key-rebinding or pleasure.LADY NEPTUNE BE PRAISED, FOR SHE IS THE GREATEST.

												You spend a lot of time with grinding in dungeons full of weak enemies just to be able to defeat the next boss monster. You can customize your characters stats with equipment, even allowing you to choose between STR or INT-based attacks on seven characters. In addition to weapons, armor, and ornaments, there are also cosmetic accessories and costumes, which typically provide only tiny bonuses to stats.The combat is good, character movement, attack ranges, areas of effect, elemental weaknesses, knockbacks. EXE perform more powerful finishers to your basic attacks, or expend it to deal massive amounts damage. "

												When I saw this game the first time in the store, I was like ""Oh, another pure fan-service game"" But for some reason I really wanted it, I just had an inch that this game will be great, and soon a friend gifted it to me along with all the DLC, and I was right. The game is just amazing.First of all, the game manages to defeat a problem a lot of RPG's have - Being repetive and boring.This game includes a remake system, allowing you to customize pretty much everything using plans. Want to have different enemies appear in Avenir Factory? Find the plan in one of the stages, obtain the required items, and activate the plan; you just got tougher and different enemies in that place~! Feel like the game is too easy? Get the plan to weaken the enemies, obtain the items, and activate it~ now the game is easier! There's a lot more to this too, but there's too much to write it all. Getting and activating the plans is a lot of fun.So here's the main way of attacking, when you press ""Attack"" during a battle, you have 3 commands:Rush - Doesn't deal a lot of damage, but fills the EXE Gauge a lot faster. If you have filled the EXE gauge by at least 1, you can unleash addition EXE attacks, which you can fully customize to what they do. The EXE Gauge also allows you to use special moves called ""EXE Drive"" they deal a lot of damage, and also have a really neat attacking animations.Power - This type of attack deals the most damage.Break - These attacks are best used in order to lower the Enemy's Defense. The lower their defense is, the easier it is to defeat it And if you break the defense completely, they will be really weak and can be very easily defeated.Every characters turn, you can attack up to 4 times. The first attack is always pre-determined by the character, however.All three types of attacking are fully customizable. Want the 2nd Power Attack have a chance of inflicting poison, and the 3rd Break attack have a chance of freezing the enemy? You can definitely do that~! As you progress further in the game, you unlock more moves for your attacks to customize, making the battles a lot different.In other words, the battle system is pretty original, and really fun to play with. You won't feel bored during them.Now for the artwork and models~ The artwork is drawn pretty nicely and looks beautiful. The Models for the game are also very good, and have a nice Anime'ish look on them. The animations for all of the things (Walking, EXE drive, jumping, etc.) Are pretty nice and varying too.Now for the voice actors for the characters~ The game developers have taken very good choices. Both Japanese and English Vocals are adorable, and perfectly fitting for the personalities and looks of characters, which is a big plus.The Japanese Voices are 100% Complete, however the English ones don't seem to be. They seem to be about 70% complete, however, the remaining 30% which isn't dubbed seems to be in the less important parts of the game, so it isn't a big problem either. And now for the music~ It's just beautiful. Each lands music theme is fitting into that Land's looks. As an example, Lastation, which is full of machinery, has a energetic theme which sounds like it has machinery inside it. It's hard to explain it, but I can guarantee that it sounds great.And now for the characters~ They're all different, and have great personalities. Almost all of them show character development. A lot of them seem to be pure fan-service (Especially the CPU Forms) but that's kind of the charm. Most of their personas change when they enter they CPU form, causing pretty funny and great (and creepy in the case of a certain character..) conversations. And the final part~ the story. It's really neat, it might seem to be boring at first, but in reality, it's really good. Even though, this game is basically a mockery of the Gamindustry- I mean,  Gaming Industry, it still manages to give it a unique story and charm, I didn't get from games in a long time. The game has also two endings, which is pretty great, as it gives variety. After you beat Story Mode, you can start New Game+, allowing you to use all of your levels from characters/money/items and start Story Mode all over again. NG+ is best to obtain the CPU Candicates, and just have lots of fun~! And if you're a completionist like me, 100% the game.The game has a lot of references to other games/Companies, and most of the side characters have names after them, Like Marvy (Marvelous AQL) Iffy (Idea Factory) Compa (Compile Heart) and so on. And the Fan-Service is basically a joke about how a lot of people think that Anime is basically all about breast size and so on.In other words, this games makes a lot of funny jokes, mocks the gaming industry in a funny, subtle way, has a great story, amazing music and vocals, radical battle system, makes a lot of references to various games/anime, and lots of replayibility and fun.I've spend 84 hours at the moment of writing this review, and I plan to spend a lot more, as this game is really addicting and good. And I think it has became my new favorite game.I'd definitely recommend getting it, especially if you like jokes and/or Anime. You will love it.10/10			"

												Look, if this is your favorite game, that's totally fine. Good for you. The industry has different genres for this exact reason - different strokes for different folks (pun entirely intended). With this in mind I ask that please, do not take this the wrong way, but I personally cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone.Visually, the best way to sum up Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is ""softcore loli porn: the JRPG"". And again, if that's your thing, that's totally fine - but if it isn't, you're not going to enjoy the visual novel aspects of the game, which include 'animated' fanservice sequences where literally only the characters' breasts are animated. Within the first minute and a half of the game, the primary characters are introduced in armor that is not only impractical for battle but impossible to wear in real life, while the dialogue referencing their centuries-long war over who deserves to be god devolves into an argument over whether breast size should be a factor in determining who has control over literally all of creation.As a number of other reviewers have pointed out (and I hate to recycle the words of others here), it's a very niche brand of humor, and unless you're a hardcore anime fan - and again, specifically the loli genre - you're not going to get a lot of enjoyment out of this title from a writing standpoint. Everything is designed to be 'cuteness overload' while somehow simultaneously completely oversexualized, and that really just isn't going to appeal to everyone, which is why the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating on Steam feels both baffling and completely unjustified.Regardless of your softcore porn preferences, moving past the visual novel aspects (which are about 50% of the game), the gameplay itself aims to be a mix of a traditional turn-based JRPG while combining elements of a basic tactics system in which you have to physically move characters within range of their opponents, which presumably opens them up to attack. However, given the range of movement afforded characters from the start of battle with most low-leveled monsters, this system doesn't appear to make much sense because both you and your opponent will easily be able to close any starting gaps within the space of a single turn. Perhaps with the addition of long-ranged characters later on in the game, the tactics aspect will actually begin to shine, but for the beginning levels its inclusion is more mildly confusing and frustrating than anything else, especially considering that visually the system actually looks nice. Aside from this, however, the combat boils down to your basic JRPG fare, and there's nothing really special about it - because, again, the combat is really only half the game anyway. I'm not sure if the combat improves in the game's sequels, but I'm far less tempted to shell out any more money to even attempt to try them given my experience thus far with Re;Birth1.The greatest setback of them all, however, is the game's controls. As the store page says, for a long time this game was exclusively available on consoles, and it is made abundantly clear from the very first dungeon that Re;Birth1 was not designed with PC gamers in mind. The keyboard controls are abominable, even with keymapping, and it turns the entire experience into a taxing, joyless, tedious affair. I don't think I'd recommend anyone even attempt to play this game without a controller, unless you have the miraculous, nigh-inhuman patience required to alternate between using the mouse and having both hands on the keyboard just to be able to navigate the first dungeon. It's just that infuriating, and this problem persists into the combat sequences, where you will often find yourself having to once again alternate between using the mouse and having both hands on the keyboard within the space of a single turn, just to be able to select more than one target. It is absolutely mind-boggling that there isn't a warning on the store page that a controller is recommended for this game. Oh, and by the way, every single key prompt is designed with a controller in mind, which makes memorizing the keymapping even more difficult.The game's writing, meanwhile, is an entirely different source of frustration. The plot is a thinly veiled parody of the console war between Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and Sega (?), and in this reality all four are middle to highschool-aged girls guilty of more fourth-wall breaks than Deadpool himself. It's an interesting premise that gets heavily bogged down by the 'cutesy' anime dialogue of our loli protagonists, and it's a shame, because the concept of playing as characters who are aware they are in a video game is one that is seldom used. Unfortunately, Re;Birth1 fails to utilize its basic premise to its full potential.I'm sorry if this all sounds harsh. Again, obviously this game appeals to some people. I sure as hell don't know why, but if this is your kind of game, hats off to you. I'll never judge you for that. But the point of this wall of text is that this game really isn't designed to appeal to the average gamer - or, hell, most gamers in general. And people deserve to know that, given that this game still has an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating. If you absolutely have to try Re;Birth1, get it on sale - but it definitely isn't worth the retail price tag, and I cannot recommend anyone spend $29.99 on this.			"

												Okay first off I would like to say that I've beat the game 100% and all the achievements are done and I have the original games on the PS3 system. Overall the game is very fun and enjoyable to someone like myself who's played all the hyperdimension games before. The game wasn't as grindy as everyone else says. The story and the characters fit very well together lots of funny moments and lolis. Big tip here if you want the edge at the starting of the game buy one of the DLC characters. They help a ton at the starting of the game and the levels they start from are very high. Also the DLC characters dont require you to buy the More levels DLC to continue leveling. So you can keep leveling them up to your heart's content .Pros------------------------------------Story and characters are greatNever gets boringAlways something to dokept me entertained till the endControls work greatNo lag always 60 fpsPeashy <3Cons100 Millon gold achievement Craft 100 items achievement------------------------------------In the end the game was well worth the 16$ I paid for it and I plan to buy rebirth 2 very soon.Check out my review for rebirth 2 here. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198193064026/recommended/351710/ "

												Chillingly accurate documentary about the history of game industry. In this game you will find out many interesting facts you never knew about console wars, and why Xbox is the best waifu.Seriously though, this is a really fun game. Battles are well done, there's lots of stuff for completionists, the difficulty is just right (if you feel it's too easy or hard, you can unlock something that makes things easier/harder), and the story is endearing even though partly because it doesn't take itself seriously. Don't play this only if you hate turn based RPGs or anime stylistics.			"

Posted: May 16, 2015
												I had been looking to get some of the Hyperdimension Neptunia games on PS3 for the past few months, as I assumed such a long series meant those games were selling and had to be somehow popular. A faithful viewer from my stream actually gifted me the remake of the first game of the series on Steam, and here I am reviewing it for you.Just a little bit of background: I'm somehow versed into Japanese culture, I really dig J-RPGs, I don't mind listening to Baby Metal or Hatsune Miku, I watch a decent amount of animes and I can't wait for my next trip to Akihabara.If you are looking for a difficult and rather serious RPG game, Re;Birth 1 is not for you. The game is good, but it has its limits. The game is all about humor and references to the video game culture/history/industry. All characters are basically a personification of whether a console, a developer, a publisher or even a single game. It's sometimes really hard to guess who is who, especially for non-initiates (I'm not sure Marvelous AQL rings a bell in many Western heads).The localization of the game left me with a mixed feeling, somehow. I started to play the game in English, but I had to switch the voices back to Japanese very fast, as the English voices felt totally out of place. Maybe this is just due to me being so used to watch animes with the same type of art in original version with subtitles. The texts were actually accurate, with a good use of video-game references. Some sentences were not reflecting the complete Japanese text (a 30 seconds long voice-over in Japanese summed up in 5 words in English), but this is still a job well done.Regarding the game itself, you should note that there will be a lot of history-related dialogues: Re;Birth 1 seems to have put a massive emphasis on story-telling, but it sometimes feels a bit over the top. I have recordings of me ""playing"" the game for more than 30 minutes without even pressing a button, just listening/reading dialogues between different characters. You have options to automatically scroll through dialogues or to even skip them in fast forward. I wouldn't recommend skipping on your first playthrough, but don't hesitate to do so on your NG+ run. Some figures to highlight this point: my first/blind playthrough took me between 35 and 40 hours, my NG+ run in fast forward took me less than 10 hours, including some item or boss farming... Even if NG+ is faster as all your progression from your first playthrough carries over, it's still a massive difference.Re;Birth1 is divided into 8 chapters. Most of them are divided like so: opening dialogue, event, mission, carry the mission in a dungeon, report back to the main city, new dialogue, new mission, boss fight, dialogue to introduce new area/town/dungeon, new chapter. If you are looking for an open-world game which is not a corridor simulator, you might want to look elsewhere, as this game only offers you the possibility to travel through an overhead map, totally static. The areas you get to explore feel really dull: I unlocked 36 dungeons over the course of the game and I think I didn't see more than 7 different area settings. Most of the time, the new dungeon you explore is going to be a copy of a previous setting, with a different spawn point, a different layout with sometimes an extra level, and a different set of monsters.You'll be most of the time exploring a dungeon to gather items from its fauna, which is a core element of Hyperdimension Neptunia: Re;Birth1's gameplay. The storyline will tell you to explore a bunch of areas, but those are just the tip of the iceberg, as you can unlock many other dungeons through crafting, which requires items gathered while hunting down monsters. In your adventures, you will be unlocking plans, which will allow you to craft new items, new costumes, new armors, new weapons and, somehow, new dungeons. For each dungeon, you will also get the possibility to unlock extra options, like adding more enemies or turning them into super enemies. Who says new enemies means new items, which will help you to craft new recipes. This idea, which might sound extremely silly to many Westerners, is actually like paradise for players used to grind their way through J-RPGs or completionists. You have hundreds of items to create, hundreds of recipes to craft and some of them are extremely tricky, especially the ones connected to the game's DLC.Items have a massive impact on the gameplay, and can turn an extremely tough fight in a walk in the park. Crafting better weapons or armors for your characters can obviously directly impact a fight, but sometimes, just unlocking a better healing potion can make a difference. As long as you didn't unlock the item through crafting, you can't buy it and the storyline won't unlock it for you. You will have to leave the story aside at times to take the time and farm up ingredients for crafting recipes.This part of the gameplay is in my view meant to get you to overcome the difference gap between your character level and the difficulty increase in the storyline. A rule of thumb for leveling in the game is that you need to take around 5 levels between every boss you have to fight. The issue lays in the fact that the dungeons are extremely small and that you sometimes need to grind a lot waiting for the monsters to respawn to get your EXP. A good alternative is, as said, to go and explore other dungeons to maybe unlock new recipes in the mean time. It's still a grind, but you add an additional objective to your grind, which will be completed much faster and far less frustrating.The monsters you'll be facing will, like the dungeons, look a lot a like: the bestiary is very limited and offers mostly recolorations. You'll be facing rad, blue, yellow, orange flowers. You'll slay green, red and blue Mario pipes. You'll tear apart 5 different types of visual-novel games screenshots. But each of them will drop a different item that you might need for a recipe or another. I can only recommend you to check out the guide section connected to this game to get an entire drop list and make your life a lot easier. Combats will most of the time be easy, but necessary.The combat system itself will leave a different impression depending on the player. Some will find it boring, some others will find it extremely entertaining. I personally really enjoyed the turn-base aspect of it, even if it was sometimes hard to get a grasp of why your opponent would be allowed to get two turns in a row or why specific choices made you fall back a bit further down the ""turn to attack"" line. You have many options to choose from in combat: the deities can take their HDD forms and improve their statistics and their movesets, all characters can decide whether they want to use skills (heal/buff/debuff/attack/resurrection) or a string of attacks. If you decide to attack with your weapon, you'll be offered the possibility to use three moves in a row, each one can have a different impact on your target. Some skills are meant to reduce your foe's defense, others to directly target your enemies HP bar and the last one will increase your EXE gauge, which will allow you to use super attacks once you get enough energy. The animations for those skills are pretty impressive, and you can even create combination attacks between characters through the friendship system built in the game (Lily ranking). Some will try to fill up their EXE gauge as fast as they can to brainlessly spam super powerful atacks, some will play around buffs and debuffs to weaken their foes. It's all up to you, but don't hesitate to spam the HDD transformations. Because lollies.All in all, this review can sound a little gloomy, but the game is still worth a try, it will keep you busy for a little over 60 hours if you want to go for all the achievements, it offers a lot of content (even if it's sometimes just duplicated) and you get all the fan service and references an Otaku can dream of.

												Something between visual novel and JRPG with unique and fun characters, each representing a video game console or company.There are some points where you'll have to grind for levels to continue, as some bosses of the main story are hard to kill. However, it has high replay value because of New Game+. So, unless you are a perfectionist, you'll never have to grind again once you've reached a decent level.Dungeon exploration may be repetitive since they reuse most of the maps and enemies, but don't let that bring you down, it's still worth the neps.

												This game is incredibly soothing to the soul. This should be offered to sick patients. Buy this game if you wish to achieve enlightenment or wish for healing.As for the actual game? It's about 45 hours long for the first playthrough, NG+ goes by a lot quicker. A significant portion of the endgame content is locked behind the DLC's, but due to the cheap cost, that isn't a problem. The plot is cute and funny, you can tell that it doesn't take itself seriously at all. The game takes the lighthearted mood and runs with it. Combat is better than most JRPGs. While you can game the system a bit with Neptune Break, the combo system allows for a lot of different attack chains, and the break system is pretty cool. Item crafting is fun, though I recommend using a guide for it to avoid frustration.Only downside is heavily recycled assests and the horrendous English dub.Overall, it's a great experience. You should buy this game. Please. Every sale means we get closer to RB3 on the PC.			"

												At first, I bought this game as a joke because I thought it was gonna be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime fan service game, but I was so wrong.This game is insanely fun and entertaining. The gameplay is enjoyable and rewarding. It has a decent plot, with lots of loveable characters. My favorite part was all the hilarious one liners and references to other games. Even though I only have 50 hours on this game (because I'm stupid and saved at the wrong time), there are countless hours of fun. I actually enjoyed it so much, I'm probably gonna get it on my ps vita and play through it again (once I finish the other games of course).This is no ordinary JRPG. I highly recommend it and it is by far worth the $30 (even though I payed $15).I have now picked up the second game of the series and am playing through it now. I'm really happy I was able to find this gem of a series in all the other crap that's out there :)			"

												The game in general is incredibly well written and designed, with a rather progressive skill system that often leaves you wanting more. The Art is amazing, as well as the voices in both Japanese and English, although it isn't fully dubbed. Combat is turn based but still decently paced if you want it to be, with flashy skills and abilities for eye candy. Graphics are what you expect from a Vita port, not bad but nothing top notch. The port does have it's problems, a few crashes (to be patched, I assume), resolution is not 1920x1080, and settings aren't saved(yet). Overall the problems in this game are an inconvenience at worst, and minor ones at that. Definitely recommended for a bit of light playing, and  especially for those who are in to the general moe culture of Japanese entertainment and visual novels in general. Being a diehard fan of the series myself10/10, would Nep again.			"

												This was my start in the Hyperdimension Neptunia series. I bought it, because i´ve seen waifus and nerdy things. At this point i really didn´t know what i was going to get. And now after 80 hours of gameplay I can say that: Hyperdimension Neptunia is an JRPG occuring in a nerdy animu world, but still having very nice unique rpg elements. As a gamer i can relate to many of the foes one encounters and that makes this very enjoyable. This game fulfilled my desires of animu, comedy and gaming. Still it demands a lot of grinding if you want to achieve everything (normal steam achievements are very doable nevertheless).Just make sure you like RPGs, animus and nerdy things in general, then Hyperdimension Neptunia is the game/series for you. I´m already looking forward to play the next games of this series.			"

												It's a good JRPG with quite a bit of comedy. The characters are likeable and the game itself runs smoother than the Vita version. If you are a fan of JRPGs (or comedy), then I'd say to try it out. And if you dislike the English voice acting, it has Japanese voice acting available.Only issue I can say is maybe the lip syncing isn't great in English, but nothing too bad.			"

												A game that tells the tale of four ancient goddesses engaged in an eternal divine war for control of the world itself, and most importantly which video game console is the best, how piracy will destroy the world, and how close girls can get before it's no longer subtext.The game is very competent, without anything that particularly lacks or stands out. The story really just boils down to ""what if game companies and consoles were anime ladies"", but the writing is amusing and the little jokes and nods towards the companies (the Wii girl has incredible defenses, the Xbox wears a red ring, etc.) are a nice touch. The battle system revolves around setting up combos, choosing from weak attacks that raise a meter for powerful attacks, attacks that reduce the enemy's guard, or high HP damage above all else.The world, art, and locations look very pretty, and the music is enjoyable, but there could stand to be more variety and many dungeons are ""The dungeon from before but with an extra path and area added"". The enemies are standard RPG fare, with the occasional anime joke or game parody such as Mario's pipes or Pac-Man ghosts. The game also boasts crafting recipes that allow you to add items to the shops, access new dungeons, or change the items and enemies that can be found within a dungeon.The only real concerns with the game are the grinding and fanservice. With the former, you'll often reach a boss and find yourself suddenly outgunned, and needing to go back until you've gained a few levels, with one early boss apparently enough to send people to forums, convinced that victory is impossible. Regarding fanservice, most early introductions include cutscenes where the only animation is jiggling, and certain outfits and attacks will mean upskirt city. That said, if you're looking at this game, it's probably a selling point for you.If you play, keep in mind that the ""camera reset"" button lets you skip attack animations.also noire is best waifu honorable mention to blanc			"

												Despite what you might think just looking at the screenshots this game actually has less fanservice and anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than you'd expect. Sure there is fanservice scenes spread throughout, but the real core of the content is the parody aspect of the game and the 4th Wall Breaking antics of the cast. For those of you who don't know, the Hyperdimension Neptunia games are an affectionate parody of the game industry. Much of the humor is based around references that go from the obvious like Mario, to the almost ridiculously obscure like the SNES-CDROM ordeal. That's not to say that is the only source of humor, indeed much of the fun comes from the surprisingly diverse cast with each character having their own little quirks that make them stand out.As for game mechanics, it is fairly basic turn based system, however there are some notable features that are pretty neat. The order in which each character on the battlefield fights is determined by their stats, once it is their turn the player is allowed to move a certain distance with the character (once again determined by stats, which can be changed via equipment and the usual level ups), and then the character can use a basic attack with a range that is dependent on what weapon their using. The basic attacks are split into three variations, Break, Power, and Rush; each with their own uses in a battle that is best explained in-game. Each character has a variety of skills that are usually just special attacks, healing abilitites, or buff/debuff techniques, these drain the characters SP bar once used. The characters also have access to EXE skills, which are super moves that tend to make fights much easier. The first EXE skill is obtained when a character reaches level 25, and is essential to boss battles. Note though that EXE skills can not be spammed since they use up a bar on the EXE gauge, which has a max of 4 bars and can only be filled by giving or receiving damage.  Also important to point out is that character are seperated into two seperate groups, the CPUs and the Makers. The CPUs are unique in that they have a second form in which their stats are boosted and in general just become all around better in direct combat. While the Makers have a wider variety of skills that are better in the support role, though they are still capable of dealing good amounts of damage. While most people tend to just stick with the CPUs since their HDD modes make fights easier, some battles require the skills from the Makers that the CPUs lack. Combined with the Lily Rank system and the bonuses those grant (for example the heroine's (unlockable) sister Nepgear allows the character she is paired with to deal damage pass the limit of 9999), and you have surprisingly deep party customizing options.  It should also be noted that level grinding is very much needed in this game due to boss difficulty ramping up at certain points. The grind isn't too bad, but it isn't uncommon for the idea of level grinding to turn off a few people. The PC port is actually quite good considering it was done by a Japanese developer, basic but in no ways unplayable. The framerate is a massive improvement from the PS3 titles, and the graphics actually look like they belong in this generation of games now. Note that in the option menu the resolution states that the max is 1600x900, this is only for Windowed mode and as long as you have the game in fullscreen it should default to your monitor's resolution. If you are having issues you can try going into the program files and editing the .ini configuration file manually to set your resolution (make sure to set the file to Read Only after doing so). There are also some issues with DLC at the time of this review, but the DLC are minor additions and are not necessary to enjoy the game at all (though the addition of characters with an HDD mode like Plutia do make some sections easier). *EDIT* As of right now the resolution and DLC issues appear to be fixed (at least for me) so the previous section is irrelevant now.In conclusion, if you are a fan of JRPG's or just a fan of Anime related products then Neptunia Rebirth is a decent addition to your steam library. The upcoming games that will be released have the same forumla with minor changes (biggest being the addition of a fourth party member during battle), but it is worth getting them for the different stories and humor alone; so those are also good purchases if you want your money's worth.

Posted: February 8, 2015
												Oh boy, how do I write a review for this game. Let me just say I just finished collecting all the achievements and it took me about 60 hours. I'm normally not an achievement hunter, but I had to do it for this game. Let me explain:I grew up playing games like FF5-10, Chrono Cross, Legend of Legaia, Suikoden, Legend of Dragoon, Tales, Xenosaga, and etc. Those games were my childhood. Unfortunately, the golden age of JRPGs is long gone, and I do miss it.Now if those games are like a fine bottle of vintage wine, then this game is like super concentrated Red Bull. Is that a bad thing? Absolutely not. This game is fast paced, linear, and to the point. Dungeons are tiny (and recycled) compared to traditional JRPGs and everything is streamlined, but don't let these things deter you. It works for this game. Sure, the game doesn't have a deep story. It doesn't have heavy character development, and there's no exploration really. But you know what? There's no angsty protagonist whining about his repressed emotions towards a love interest either.What this game does have is an enjoyable and fast paced battle system (think Tales mixed with Eternal Sonata with a pinch of Star Ocean). The crafting and ""remake"" system reminded me of Disgaea - you can add dungeons and stronger monsters, change item drops, break the damage limit, and even raise your credit and exp gain. The 2D artwork is gorgeous and has some animations to accompany the dialogue, which I found was a nice touch. The game does not take itself seriously and neither should you. It makes fun of gamer culture while breaking the fourth wall on a regular basis. It has loads of sly references to classic JRPGs and games in general. The costume and weapon designs are also nicely detailed. And yes, there's a lot of fan service, and some, I admit, was a bit too much. Some might be turned off by the ""loli"" aspect of this game, but it's really not that bad.Playing this game brought back a lot of memories for me, and maybe nostalgia was the driving force behind my achievement hunting. From the over-the-top finishing moves, to one of the characters humming the Final Fantasy fanfare after battle, the entire game is a ""parody love letter"" to JRPG fans.I thoroughly enjoyed this game and I can't wait for the sequel to be ported to Steam later this year. However, for those people looking for a ""deeper"" and ""more enriching"" JRPG experince, I recommend FF7 and 8 currently on Steam.Some tips that the game doesn't explain and I had to find out ""accidently"" (based on using an Xbox controller):1. LB lets you skip any battle animation, including the basic combo moves. This really sped up the grinding during the later stages.2. Pressing ""X"" puts the current dialogue scene in fastforward mode. Press ""X"" to return to normal speed.3. Pressing ""Y"" lets you review the dialogue in case you missed something.4. Party members in reserve during battle will heal over time, and thus switching out characters when they are in low health is a viable strategy.5. Enemies take more damage in the back and the sides.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to return to this game and finish up the Coliseum battles. :)			"

												Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a game that, while flawed in some critical areas, can still manage to win over players with its sheer amount of charm and character, videogame reference-based humor, and a solid set of combat mechanics. The story is loosely based on the Console War, with cute anime girls playing the roles of goddesses to landmasses that are based on Sega, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony. The idea is neat, but the environments never really truly capture the ""spirit"" of any of the companies being represented and there's a real lack of creativity in bringing these lands alive in that respect. Which brings me to the game's biggest issue: Its lack of variety in locales and recycled dungeon designs. You'll see nearly every type of environment in the first 5 or so hours of the game, and from there, almost nothing but repeats, which will also be the case for most enemies and bosses as well. Combat is turn-based and fast, and you're given a myriad of options on how you want to outfit your characters' equipment and combo loadouts. Boss battles can be long, drawn-out, and at times strategy intensive ordeals that rarely, if ever, require grinding to overcome. The progression in terms of the game's difficulty is a fairly balanced curve most of the way, with the player given many opportunities to tip the balance into their favor by either gaining a few extra levels, or utilizing the game's ""Remake"" system which can allow you to craft new items to buy, add more powerful enemies to duneons, and change what items appear. Again, there's not much grinding involved at all in order to complete the story, and most sidequests can be ignored if you so choose. The only real grinding in the game involves needing to run back through areas to collect items which may be necessary to craft new Plans you've come across. The game leans a bit hard into this system and it at times can drag things to a screeching halt, but again, beyond the basics and a few nice things here and there, you don't necessarily HAVE to engage with it. While flawed, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a solid JRPG and will more than please those looking for something a little different in the genre.			"

												One of the most fun Jrpg's I've played in a long time.Pro's-Fun characters-Engaging battle system-Music is great-Story is amusing with all its references / parodies-Dress up elements-Theres a Yandere Healer.-Dual Audio (english / japanese)-Panty shots of some characters even when your not even trying and they are just standing still.-Con's-Cannot be set to 1920x1080p by itself. (NOTE: This is easly changed by setting your desktop resolution to 1080p and selecting Fullscreen option in game)-Sometimes the characters talk to much in battle, hearing the same quotes over and over (mainly due to when a characters action is done and it moves to your next one the last characters speech is still going.) Can be annoying if you make your actions quickly. Would be better if they had more than 4 quotes for healing / attacking / getting hit.9/10 Would bang again.			"

												Okay I've played the original PS3 version this game is based off and I can safely say, this game is WAY better than the original. If you had chose between the original and this one, I would say get this one in a heart beat! The battle system is SO worth it when compare to the original. For those that care not for the original, this game is a visual novel type RPG. Its not your standard RPG, and it does have quite a few funny moments, especially plays on other video games. Not as many plays like the original (Miss the scene where they run into a 'Street Fighter') but honestly, that I can go without, cause the battle system alone is easy to pick up on. Plus you can 'create' new dungeons. If you don't, you'll be stuck with just the story dungeons and you will get your butt handed to you by bosses if you don't try your hand at some of the extra dungeons (I learn this the hard way). But yeah. The story is a tad different from the original PS3 game, so I say give it a shot. You won't be disappointed (unless this isn't your type of game, then sorry!)			"

This game is incredible. Ever since I saw some fragments of it and the anime, I really wanted to give it a shot, and finally when I bought it in the Summer Sale, I started to play it.To be honest, I really did not expect it to entertain me so much. It's one of the best JRPGS out there, just like trail of the sky etc. Which is something I really wanted to play for a long time since I will never buy a console just to play a few games. But of course, just like any other game, it has bad things: They didn't make enough effort for the fragments, it was just like those light novels, characters on right and left side speaking and barely moving, which is weird because there was a fragment in the beggining in which they made a 3D scene, which was really well made. and it would've been so much better if they did that with all of fragments in which the characters speak; I will never say characters diversity is bad, but... it had quite too many characters; The game has a shop in which you buy items and equipment (duh), and... There are some things that are just WAY TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE, like... 5KK - 10KK € (no the game's currency is not €, I just don't remember it...); And lastly, what saddens me the most... The game fell to the DLCs industry.. (remember the good times when they used to sell completed games? good times...), and they're quite unbalanced, they add a bunch of stuff, but the most important is that you get to play with more characters and you unlock more dungeons. I don't really complain with the characters, I actually like it. But you know... It'd be much better if you wouldn't need to pay for them. And the thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, the dungeons, holy hell, the monsters were... TOO DAMN OVERPOWERED, with the DLCs, the maximum level of the characters goes from 99 to 999, and you have no chance to beat them unless you get to a very high level.Summarizing... The game is awesome, the bad things it has can be forgiven, I cannot wait to play the other games!!Overall Score: 9.25/10 "

												Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 is a JRPG that throws away any serious story for nothing but references and jokes yet still manages to be somewhat enjoyable.Now the story is as generic as you can get; the main character Neptune is a goddess that fell from the sky, hit her head really hard and has amnesia. Along the way she meets other characters that join her party trying to help her get her memory back, some of these characters are other goddess's that before they met Neptune all hated each other but they learn to get along. There's a bit more to the story than that, but that's basically the gist of it; Neptune literally takes any serious tone and throws it out the window every chance she gets and at first it's funny but eventually it just gets old.This game is broken up into eight chapters; typically the order of events goes story, look at new items at the shop, view world map events, go to newly revealed dungeon and repeat all of that. What helps to shake this up a bit is when you're in the dungeons you can freely roam around and instead of getting into random battles you see the enemies roaming around just like you are. When you come in contact with an enemy it starts the encounter, but you can also attack them instead of touching them to get the advantage and have your party members start off the fight. When you're in combat you'll notice right away you can freely move around within the specified circular area, this is the combat zone and you're enouraged to keep your party spaced apart because enemies can hit multiple targets but so can you. Though you can move each character around individually the combat is turn based, so once you move you have to attack or skip your turn; there are three types of attacks that all build your .EXE meter (Which is basically your super meter). Each attack type has different properties, rush type attacks generally do little damage but hit a lot of times in one action and they're used to build the .EXE meter, power type attacks do tons of health damage in usually one swing and don't build .EXE meter very well nor do they do a lot of guard damage, and lastly break type attacks are used for destroying your opponents shield and don't do much health damage nor build .EXE meter that well. You'll also unlock special abilities like heals, spells, or buffs that use SP as your characters level up so you can have defined rolls for each party member like healer, damage, support. Aside from healing when you're low on health there really isn't a lot of strategy involved in the combat, build .EXE meter when you don't have any to use super moves at the end of combos, destroy enemy shields with break attacks than spam power attacks to finish the fight. This game also has a ton of plans you can complete and if you go after all of them it'll take a considerable amount of time, they generally add a new piece of equipment or an accessory you can purchase from the shop but some of them change enemy types in a dungeon or give you more experience/credits from fights.The soundtrack wasn't that bad, I wouldn't say it's anything memorable; but it really fit the game and some of the tracks were quite catchy.Though it might have an alright soundtrack this game's graphics aren't anything worthy of praise, the character/enemy models look alright but the environments are really uninspired. Each dungeon has a ""theme"" and each of these ""themes"" has about 3 layouts that don't change and look identical to the others in the same ""theme"".I would recommend a purchase to any fan of JRPGs that really enjoy grinding because that's honestly all this game is, a massive grind fest from leveling up to farming materials for plans to get stronger items or unlock optional dungeons. If you're not a fan of JRPGs or if you're not into very grind heavy games than I'd say either get this on a very good sale or skip it all together because there honestly isn't an intriguing story to keep you hooked if that's what you're after.

 It all started with a simple Skype call, talking about animu games and whatnot, right around the time of the Steam Winter Sale.  A little game called Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 instantly catches my attention,  to which I would share with my comrade about how cringe it was, making all sorts of comments about it. This is when a bet was formed, my comrade had challenged me to a 1v1 on League of Legends, which led up to one hell of a bet. It was simple, the loser was given Neptunia for free from the winner, to which the loser would have to put an active 15 hours into at minimum.  Needless to say, I got ♥♥♥♥ing destroyed.  I accepted my fate with my remaining dignity and downloaded the game overnight, being mocked and teased all the while. The next night, my time had come. Booted up the game, saw the anime-esc opening sequence and nearly reached for the bleach, but I dared to tread on, I still had 15 hours to go. During this opening scene, scolling between dialogue of 4 unnamed Goddesses having an argument for god knows what, land or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then the flat chested whitey called the green one Thundertits, I actually ♥♥♥♥ing laughed, I was not expecting that at all. At that moment I knew the game had changed, this may not be so bad after all. Got into the actual game, find out it's a turn based RPG-esc game, end up actually enjoying it immensely. I hid this fact from my comrade, ended up hitting the 15 hours in two days. It's been a good month now, 65 hours in, comrade thinks I am weeaboo scum and abandons me.  IT ALL STARTED AS A PRANK BRO, PLEASE SEND HELP. Pros  You get to stare at animu tiddies for the entirety of the playthrough, zoom feature included. Wink Wink. Enjoyable cast of Characters. Decently fair combat and fun combat, can get repetitive with the big bosses at times. (Even worse if your cast of Waifus can't actually kill the boss, so dying and coming back to it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥) There is a Waifu for everyone. Name your preferance, you got it. Cheap DLC. Top Nep.Cons Noire's voice is like listening to nails on a chalkboard on an amp. Some bosses have infinite MP, so they can spam their most powerful move almost every turn, while leaving you with a dead healer every time. Partial grind-fest for those special items and weapons. Flat Chested women. Potential loss of friends, respect from remaining friends, and embarassing your entire family tree.I rates 9/10, would Nep Nep again. "

												Having almost completed every accomplishments, I think that giving a review for fresh players should be a good thing to do, lets put features of this game into a summary:Pros+ Long, funny and shallow storyline, 2 endings for us to choose, 20-30 hours for a walkthrough.+ Unbeatably cute characters which can instantly make you addicted on this game.+ Features different types of weapons, items and crafts, making players stonger constantly.+ Cute CGs.+ Immersive soundtracks.+ Reasonable training system.Cons- The only little flaw is that there are too many items players can miss,mostly important for achievement accomplishments, the only cure is to start a NG+ or to reload a saved checkpoint, and the only way to prevent this is to read achievement guides. Of course, if you do not care about the achievements, it’s fine, but for those who do care, they have lots of works to do.I will hereby try to cover as many aspects and features as I possibly can:This product is also called HDN re birth 1 for short, as a tactical role-playing game, players take control of 3 characters in the front line while keeping 3 others as reserves in the rear. With different combinations players can create their own strategy, when facing challenging foes or bosses this can evidently prove helpful. However, you can defeat the bosses that are powerful more easily if you just train your characters, augmenting several levels. But a strategy is still recommended as it entertains your intelligence, this is also the point of playing games with identic genres.Now let us see its in-game equipments, including weapons, items and crafts. Weapons here varies a lot, this keeps upgrading your character’s attack output in general. As to items, the system of HDN re birth 3 also keeps track on your level and gives you different items that you might need in different situations. Healing potions for instance, varies from 1000-10000 points and 30-100% of healing, these potions can be used for high level or low level characters depending on their efficiency, as far as I’m concerned, this feature is also found in other role-playing games, but since I haven’t experienced many so far, I still pointed it out. Furthermore, crafts, or plans as named in this game, are very important features, plans are your best friends, they can unlock powerful weapons, useful items in addition to many dungeon maps.About CGs and Soundtracks, both are well designed, although nothing extraordinary, they do make the players immerse into the game. Especially CGs, they actually did point out the funniest and important events into a more specified way.Thank you for reading this review up to here, I hope that this helped you a bit, however, if you find anything interesting in any of my explanations or introductions, I suggest you to give this game a try ^^, be aware that you might get addicted very soon …… ^.^.

												A cautious recommendation.As always with games like these, the bad kind of weebs ruin the review section with their fanboyish sheit so heres the stuff you really want to know.Hows the port?Its barebones, no graphics options, some key rebinding which is really badly designed. You'll want to use a controller, I use a PS3 controller through motioninjoy and I have no issues with it. You have to select it in the game menu as usual before it works.The game is NOT 1080p, the resolution goes upto 1600x900 I think, but when you play fullscreen, it upscales it and the game itself looks fine enough. The character sprites in the VN style dialogue sections show a bit of annoying blur, same as the 3D ingame stuff, but nothing too bad. Considering the art style, its tolerable, but not excusable. The devs need to fix this sh*it, its 2015 and we shouldnt be getting ports from the year 2001. (then again the past year has been a bad year for PC gamers, what can I say)I cant seem to enable DSR either so downscaling the game as far as I know, is not possible. Correct me if Im wrong though.The game itself is your typical weeb am I kawaii uguu desu-fest with mild fanservice, clunky animations, lots of fourth wall breaking dialogue and fun/cute characters. Just a word of warning if you dont know what you are getting into, but as always. If you DONT know what you are buying, dont ♥♥♥♥ing buy it you nerd.If you are a filthy disgusting weeb like I am, you will love it despite its shortcomings. It feels a lot like trinity universe, but the combat and exploration is much much much better. Even uses some same menu sounds.The devs seem willing to do something about the issues in the game and quickly patched in some of the issues. I would still appreciate a proper 1080p support. Its the bare minimum that a PC game should have. Dont be such lazy hacks.			"

												Transforming girls that morph!?Pros:+The game is all around good.+Story is fun. (Nice to see a not so deep RPG.)+Art style is nice, nothing original but nice.+Characters are very entertaining.+Costumes! (Yes this is a pro for me, shut up!)+Interesting battle system, nothing super original but what it takes from other games is really good.+The port isn't amazing but it's still better than most ports out there, hell even AAA games aren’t this decent.+Option menu is decent for PC.+Runs in 60FPS. (Or at least tries)+1080p support. (Not perfect 1080p it’s upscale)+Fully rebindable keys/controller with the ability to bind 2 buttons to one function.+Mouse controls and mouse controlled menus.Cons:--The game is short with a lot of filler and grinding. (If you’re into that it’s that fine, I was)--Battle system is good but can get repetitive. (This is just an average thing for RPGs)--New game plus doesn’t give your whole party back; you have to get them back through the story again. Not the DLC and unlocks though. (This is really annoying to be honest)--True ending is a bit of a pain to get without look it up. (Nothing to bad, at least it wasn’t like Agarest: Generations of War)--Voicing can get annoying due to very little quotes recorded. (Nothing to serious but when you’re angry at an optional boss some quotes will make you mad as hell.)--No graphic settings other then resolution. (Not a big deal)--Frame drops across the board. (At least for me, nothing below 30FPS though)Conclusion:I actually enjoyed this game quite a lot, which is suppressing because I’ve heard and read that the original PS3 version was just terrible. I can honestly say that Idea Factory did a damn good job upon this game plus the port was big surprise, I was ready for another Dark Souls port.Disclaimer:I like anime… so take that as you will.			"

												Besides the codec issue skipping the intros and the resolution only being 900p this is a great game. Lots of content and interesting story albeit the story breaks the 4th wall a lot. The dialogue is cute and quirky and the voices are well done. The game doesn't take itself too seriously however it is a great JRPG that any fan of the genre should add			"

												I've read there is a PS Vita (or whatever it is called) Version of this, after i watched the Anime. And since i'm not really a fan of PS (except for a handful of great games) i didn't bother to look further into it.Then i've seen it on steam recently and decided to buy.So, now i'm about to finish my second cycle... and i regret not a single second or cent i spend on this game.if i had known it would be THIS entertaining, maybe i would haveeven bought that PS handheld just to play this. Oh, OF COURSE this game isn't flawless, and considering that this is the first portfrom a handheld to PC it is still very good.(On a Sidenote: i don't get any crashes or bugs so farexcept this two, which could be caused by other things:- game freezes on entering fight, if the game session is longer then 5 hours (going to main menu avoids that)- after playing ""League of Legend"" this game won't start untila reboot of the whole system (this might be caused by the other game though)if you can excuse repeating mob models and dungeon levels (there are still a lot of different ones though)and if you don't dislike some hours of grinding to get all the stuff you want, this game might be for you.another nice thing for the grinding is that you don't need to train each character seperately, since everyone (including not fighting ones) gets a share of EXP and you can exchange the used formation as much as you like to avoid ""stupid grinding"" and seeing the same things over and over. for those who already have it and have problems to farm the stuff you need try this: http://neptunia.wikia.com/wiki/Bestiary/Re;Birth1it helped me a lot, also there are very helpful guides in steam. i got all characters and most plans and equipment within the first two cycles. now i'm aiming for collosseum and costumes :3to sum it up:9/10 - this will be my first 100% cleared game in a long while (and i will buy Re;Birth 2 asap ^^)			"

												Recommened to me by a friend, I initially didn't know what to think of this game but the more I played the more the characters, world, humour and its mechanics grew on me. It may be a budget JRPG but it's a well done one, though keep in mind the focus of this game is the characters and humour, if these don't resonate with you I can't recommend the game.It's a turn based RPG so that may turn people off and there isn't much in the way of exploration but with its ""remake"" system finding items and crafting new features to add to the game can be quite addictive, it's a unique feature I'd like to see in more games. Hyperdimension Neptunia provides a fair challenge that should help keep your interest while playing.As mentioned above it's the characters and humour the provides the greatest entertainment of this game, it's full video game parodies and jabs at video game culture but you can tell it's done by people that love gaming. The characters at the beginning can be overbearingly cute if you're not used to more Japanese flavoured games but each one of them has a unique personality and develops well through out the story. It would be generally shocking if you left this game without liking at least one of the characters.It's definitely for the JRPG crowd but for those wanting to try something different this isn't a bad place to start.

												NOTE: This is more of a personal experience rather than a review, and I'm probably gonna update this in the future as I go along.Update: I finished the game. Huzzah! The review is offical. Enjoy!I first found out about this games existince around springtime of last year, when I randomly came across a let's play video of this game by a youtuber known as Long Pause. While the video was good for a quick laugh, the game itself didn't capture my intrest. In fact, I would've forgotten about it if it wasn't for a Splatoon Gmod video called ""Squid-nanigans"". In it, the main character of this game, Neptune (based on the Sega Neptune), encounters an Inkling and.....chaos ensues.This lead me to do a little research, and eventually I had the motive to buy this game(but not at full price). Christmas comes around, I get steam money, it was on sale for 6 bucks, bought the game and.......I spent 6 hours on it and didn't touch the game for at least 2 months.Near the end of march, I decided to give the game one last shot, to see if I can try and find a reason to keep going. Thankfully I did, as I made some serious progress, and I realized that this game is actually good. Very good. In fact, It's surprizingly good.Pros:        -The EXE attacks are amazing.        -The regular special attacks arn't to bad either.        -Compa.        -The characters are chock-full of personallity.        -The world of Gameindustri is based on video games.        -The battle system has plenty of variety.        -Compa.        -Lots of side quests to keep one busy between major story events.        -Foruth-Wall breaks. I like those.        -Me laughing the whole way through, especailly when it comes to Neptune and her pudding.        -Did I already metion Compa? What I'm saying is that I really like Compa (and Blanc, and Nepgear, and Noire, and Neptune, and 5pb who is my real favorite character but she's not in this game so Compa will do, and...).Cons:         -The voice acting goes up and down in quality.         -Some of the items in the shop are more expensive than they should.         -A glitch that causes enemies to become self-aware and not attack on their turn.         -The game in general can be hard without DLC or if your characters arn't at a proper level.         -The simple fact that I had to rewrite all the changes I made to this review because my laptop is literally a SELF-AWARE A$$HOLE THAT SECRETLY HATES ME!Would I recommend this game? The box says yes but I don't really know. It depends on what kind of gamer you are. I mean, if you're the kind of gamer who's willing to look past the fanservice, likes RPG's, Video game references, fourth-wall breaks and a storyline that doesn't take itself seriously and focused more on comedy, or just really wants to see some of their favorite game consoles as godesses/anime girls, then who knows? Maybe this games for you. If you don't like any of those things, then get ready for a bad time(insert Undertale reference here).Seriously though, I need an actual computer.			"

												Welcome to my review.Before anything else, I would like to thank  クソ野郎 RAIN  for gifting this game to me.The game is full of Kawaii grills and Nep-nep always  breaking the fourth wall [en.wikipedia.org] that makes you laugh all the time. The english dub is great and it doesn't make me cringe and the only bad thing I got so far is that when playing the game with keyboard. It's very confusing for me so I had to jack-in my controller to eliminate the confusion. The fanservice is not that much and it's more likely to make you laugh.Music: 8 out of 10 I can't skip the OP when I start the game.Visuals: 10 out of 10 for using animated spritesBattle Style: 9 out of 10 for my all time turn base battle styleSFX: 10 out of 10Story: N/A since I haven't finish the game.

Totally Fun to play if you`re new to this kind of game. Sadly Rip English Voices (Barely used in Story, Not Sure If its Fixed Doesn't Read updates) but The Japanese Voices Of course Sweeps it up. Overall Nep/Nep would Nep again!!!! <3*There are some Rare crashes But its Just Prolly Me* *Prepare For Some Grinding IF and I said IF you have Bought the DLC for Extended Level Cap* And Uhhh thats Prolly Its I've Got to Say about this game WAIT  please dont be dumb like me who buys it full price, wait for a sale its worth the wait.

												This game is far more clever than I expected it to be. The humor is sometimes hit or miss, but often a hit, despite the fact that most of my otaku cultural knowledge is second-hand. The basic premise, if you don't know, is that the console war is fought not with business meetings and product sales but with anime girls who draw power from their market share.Combat is turn-based, but it's the fastest turn-based game I've ever played. Transitions from one turn to the next are completely seamless, the AI takes no time at all to line out moves, your movement is resrtricted to a radius around you rather than distance so there's no cancelling moves over and over to reposition yourself and once locked in combat, your character will attack four or more times with an assortment of thirteen pre-equipped moves you can swap from on the fly, yet you'll soon develop combinations for specific situations that means selecting the given moves is as simple as the press of a button. Fighting something with a full armor bar you want to whittle down? Try AAAA. if its guard is at half so you want to mix up guard breaks and damage? Go for AAYY. Shields down? AXXX. Enemy is too evasive or you need to try for a crit? AYYY. There's no scrolling through long menus to find whatever it is you need. A little slower with a mouse if you want to click things, but not by much.You can also dress up your gamindustri (the actual name of the world in Hyperdimension Neptunia) lolis with a wide array of costumes, weapon designs and, of course, hats. This is steam. I hear people like hats.			"

My full review can be found here.[www.the-backlog.net]Hyperdimension Neptunia ReBirth1 heads back to the very beginning of the series. After falling from Celestia, Neptune meets Compa and eventually IF as she works to find Key Fragments that are spread throughout GameIndustri! Unfortunately though, Neptune has lost her memory and can't recall who she is.ReBirth1 is a remake of the original Hyperdimension Neptunia, and while the original game was a bit of a mess at times to play through, this is not. That doesn't stop ReBirth1 from being pretty hard. You'll find it quite useful to make use of the new Remake system to add in new dungeons so that you can get a bit of an edge on the bosses.The PC version features some issues however - the lip syncing is a bit off, the game doesn't like to run (without crashing) without being in compatibility mode, and some lines of text get cut off in their text boxes. This doesn't stop the game from being quite enjoyable from the numerous video game references spread everywhere. It does unfortunately seem like we won't see a fix for this PC issues though. Regardless, it's quite easy for me to give this a recommendation with it having both an enjoyable combat system and enjoyable storyline.			"

												If you are a fan of the Neptune series, this is a must have. Finding the original PS3 disc is a pain and costs a ton, and even though I have a Vita, Re:Birth 1 is still $40 and I have no more space on my memory card. I absolutely love that we are starting to get some JRPGs on Steam that were formerly console exclusive.The gameplay is turn based with a field, think Final Fantasy 10 meets Tales of Vesperia. The difficulty rises quickly and as with most JRPGs there is grinding involved in order to stay on top of the difficulty, which is a plus in my book.There are plenty of customizations available in this game, from attack lists, to outfits and weapons. Plenty of content to keep you entertained for 50+ hours, maybe more if you get the DLC that allows you to level to 300, not sure if there was DLC to let you get to 999 like there is in HDN:Victory.Obviously as this is day 1 there are some minor issues with the game. It doesn't have 1080p as advertised, it is 900p maximum. Some of the buttons still retain their Vita icons and a few in the tutorial are mislabeled. Controller support is wonderful using an XBOne controller, however the input seems limited to 8 directions rather than true 360 analog support.All in all it is a wonderful game that finally has made its transition to Steam. Definitely worth the $30, at $15 it is a steal.			"

												The lead character Neptune breaks the 4th wall every other sentence. And she's funny about it.  It has a fun combo system, funny dialog and some enjoyable characters. It is not a serious JRPG. It's a comedy, so keep that in mind. However it is a low budget game that is very grindy. You will fight the same monsters and play the same dungeons over and over. The way you unlock plans to reshape the gameplay and unlock items is complex and borderline absurd. But that is what keeps you busy in consecutive playthroughs as it is impossible to unlock everything the first 2 times through.Even at 50+ hours, I still have a lot of stuff to unlock. I'm sure I could spend another 30hours on this game if I didn't have to get back to the chores I neglected while playing this game.			"

												Let me start by saying I started this game two years ago losing passion for all things video games and going through hard times in my life. I looked at a guide to defeat Lady Noire. Now I have to say this is one of the most astoundingly epic games I've ever played in my entire life. I have played quite a lot of games in the past. Now let's talk about what makes this game great for a minute. Bright and vivid colours and beatiful art style. Excellent game-like music with high quality. Great characters and a fun and interactive story that really appealls to a young game playing or anime fan but in all honesty even if you weren't too into games or anime this game would still be great for the level of depth. It is truly a deep masterpiece. I honestly only really disliked the two posh, deceptive people who pretended to be gentlemen but all they were really interested in were the women's bodies and not the whole of them and they were really annoying as well. Despicable characters. What this game does is really give you a very unique flavour and viewpoint of how a game should be. Interesting, exciting, addictive, interactive and most importantly entertaining, fun and a great experience.If someone would ask me what game they should play I will tell them one of a few select elite titles in my viewpoint. One being Resident Evil 4. The next being either Fallout 3 or Fire Emblem:Awakening. The third would be this game. Hyperdimension Neptunia truly these three games are very close to my heart because of how each one is very unique and they really fulfill their potential as games. The most nostalgic game I could ever play is Pokemon Blue or maybe Pokemon Yellow since that was basically the first game I ever played or the first game I became completely engrossed in.If you ever question whether or not to get this game do not! It is definitely worth your time. Now because of this game and other factors of course I have become passionate about games again and have become more confident along the way this confidence being because I have started to love life and really enjoy my life. This may seem irrelevant but because of this game I have become truly passionate about games again. So truly you should buy this game and maybe you too will have a terrific, astounding, epic experience along the way.			"

												This animu game was originally on the Playstation Vita and is a JRPG with tons of references to other video games such as Soul Calibur, Metal Gear Solid, Pac-man, and Final Fantasy. It's a very kawaii-desu game not to be taken seriously because the entire game almost feels like a parody, which isn't a bad thing. The voice acting is very well done, and you can switch between English and Japanese at any time. You will not go 10 minutes without one of the characters breaking the forth wall. The story is based on some war going on since the beginning of time called ""The Console War."" I know Blanc is supposed to represent Nintendo, Noire is representing Sony, and Vert resembles Microsoft. I am not sure who Neptune represents, however, probably the Game.Com. Anyway, they fight to keep the Gamindustry peaceful or something. The gameplay however, runs great in upscaled 1080p but only supports 8 directions if you are using a controller, unlike the Vita version. It is similar to Final Fantasy where you touch a blob and go into battle with 3 different monsters. You are able to walk around in battle, and use a variety of attacks, but it is still turn-based. When a character is killed, they will usually say something very funny like ""I'm still single!"" or ""I'll be back!"" Pure Genius.Very Fan Service-y Game! Highly Recommended!Just be ready to be called a weeb when your friends see you playing it.You will also get weird looks from your family when they see you playing this.			"

												1/29/2015. A day that will live in moe. It was on this day that the dreaded console war would crawl its way into the land of the PC Master Race. The war had been going on for decades down in the dreaded contient below where the consoles held power. It was a bloody and scarring war for those that participated. Shots were fired and alliences were broken. However, little did we, the master race, know what was going on behind the scenes in this war. On the infamous, moe day, 1/29/2015, a lost, amnesia overcome Sega Neptune came to us, the PC Master Race, in search of help. Help to recover her lost memory. By heading down to this war torn world, we would not only have the task of returning the Sega Neptune's memory, but ending the war once and for all. I hereby issue a challenge to all of my fellow PC gamers. Help this poor console find her memory. By doing so we may finally end this struggle once and for all. Not just for the consoles, but for the PC users who have to deal with this war on a daily basis. Will you take up this challenge?69/10 gr8 b8 4 gamrg8			"

												Once upon a time somebody decided to combine a visual novel with a cliche JRPG. And so Hyperdimension Neptunia was born.This game takes place in a world where the console wars are made real and each console is represented by a scantily clad anime Goddess because of course they are. The story follows a colourful(and all-female) cast of characters as they fight to save the world of Gamindustri(seriously?) from the forces of darkness. The setting is constantly used to poke fun at videogame and anime cliches, and the characters break through the fourth wall so many times they might as well install a revolving door. You can also expect quite a bit of fan service. The questionable attire of the Goddesses is just the tip of a kinky icebergOn the gameplay side of things this is nothing special. You'll read through VN style story segments and then fight your way through dungeons full of treasures and palette swapped monsters. The flashy, over the top animations make combat fun but don't expect a design revolution here. It's your average JRPG on the gameplay front.So this game is basically the videogame equivalent of fast food. Not the most classy thing on the menu but still pretty damn good.			"

												Some people like ""clicking"" games, I like this game. I was pretty skeptical considering the high rating this game has (98%). I was really worried about the rating being cushioned by the ""anime effect"" that many other visual novel-esque titles have despite being really niche material. And it is true that it does benefit, but this game is fun without all the fanservice and references. Those things are fluffy little extras to a well balanced grind-fest RPG.The grinding isn't obviously pointless (its still a game), and there are active elements of the game that evolve and change as a reward for your grind. It is simple and pleasant.The references this game has are mostly sigh inducing eye-rollers, but they contribute to a really cheery atmosphere as they are ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere. The cutscenes will make you laugh sometimes, but other times you will be thankful there is a skip function. In a vacuum the story is pretty much exactly like every other generic JRPG, which in itself is just another reference. The characters are two-dimensional in every sense of the word.Some little things get on my nerves like reused assets; e.g., higher level monsters will have the same model as their weaker counter part with a different name(child wolf, wolf, etc), dungeons look the same with only slight path changes or extras, and some of the outfits and customizeables are just recolors.I recommend buying this when it is on sale 100%. If you are a sucker for anime tropes and cutesy fanservice you might be interested in paying full price.			"

												Hyper Dimension Neptunia Re;birth1 is a turn-based jrpg that quickly immerses you into a Fantasy world ruled by goddesses that are fighting each other for control of Gamingindustri. The story is very funny and the characters break the fourth wall quite often mentioning the player(you) and the video game itself; while even giving references to other franchises like Pokemon. If you do not care for side quests/objectives and only the story, then the game can be cleared in less than 10hours but if you want the true ending it will take atleast two playthroughs plus nearly all side dungeons. The regular trash mobs should never give you a problem but the bosses can kick you around a decent amount. At some points you may have to go back and grind some to be able to take some bosses on, if you cannot afford healing items or taking too much damage. The attack animiations are pretty flushed and the cinematics for supers are well done. Most of the time the enemy AI seem to just attack whoever is closest to them and does not use their own abilities frequently enough. And constantly clearing dungeons can get repetitive as there are no puzzles to solve, objects to interact with, etc.The game offers plenty of playable characters but you may only have 3 on the field and three on the bench at any given time. All characters can be customized by crafting/buying outfits from the stores or getting clothes in chests through dungeons. In summary, this game can be a breath of fresh air if you've been looking for an rpg with a little twist to it. And you can have lots of fun following the story and watching the cinematic attacks. I'd recommend this game if you are also into tactical-turn based rpg games. In my opinion it is not quite worth 30 dollars though so catch it on sale.			"

												HyperDimension Neptunia is a series that you will either love or hate. If you are not willing to look past the fanservice and suggestive aspects of it, you will not have a very good time. However, if you are willing to look past those, you will find a series full of well-written and developed characters and a large amount of meta-humour that is hard to not get a laugh out of.To start things off, Neptunia a JRPG. In the world of Gamindustri, there are four nations: Lastation, Lowee, Leanbox and Planeptune. Each nation is ruled over by a goddess CPU (Console Patron Unit). CPU Black Heart rules Lastation, CPU White Heart rules Lowee, CPU Green Heart rules Leanbox and CPU Purple Heart rules Planeptune. The CPUs reside in Celestia, where they are locked in battle to determine who will obtain the title of True Goddess. After hundreds of years of fighting, a strange voice suggests for Black Heart, White Heart and Green Heart to group together and defeat Purple Heart. They agree and send her careening off the edge of Celestia towards Gamindustri, during which she reverts into Neptune, her human form. After being found and tended to by an aspiring nurse named Compa, it is learned that Neptune has amnesia, and so she, Compa and a member of the Guild named IF set out across Gamindustri to restore Neptune's memories. The story is very lighthearted and rarely takes itself seriously. The characters are all well-developed and likeable, and their conversations often involve the breaking of the fourth wall to hilarious effect.Gameplay-wise, the game is relatively solid. It uses a turn-based system where you move you characters around the battlefield before using their abilities or using combos. Combos are composed of Rush, Power and Break attacks. Rush attacks are more effective at building your EXE Gauge, which allows the use of EXE Drives. EXE Drives are very powerful attacks that can be performed alone or with other characters, depending on which character is using an EXE Drive. Power attacks deal the most raw damage out of the three, and Break attacks are better at decreasing an enemy's Guard Points. When their Guard Points reach zero, that enemy will take around double damage for a short time.In addition to the three characters on the battlefield, you can pair them with another three who will provide passive bonuses such as more EXP or increased defences. When two characters are paired together, they have a Lily Rank that shows how much those characters like each other. As the Lily Rank increase, more bonuses become unlocked between those characters. Some characters can even perform EXE Drives together if their Lily Rank is high enough.In conclusion, HyperDimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is an excellent game if you are able to forgive/look beyond the sexualized aspects of it. The characters are likeable and believable, the humour is great and hard to not laugh at, and the gameplay is fun and surprisingly deep. I recommend that anyone who just wants to have a good time purchases this game.			"

This is the third time I have bought this game, once on the PS3 and once on the Vita. 10/10 would continue to play in shame, at least I have Nep-Nep.Full disclosure: I have spent several hundred dollars on DLC throughout this series, someone please stop me ;__;			"

Review For Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth1Review by: DEHUPros :- Good graphics- Funny Dialogs- Great Story- Good voice actors- Fantastic controlsCons :- too much grindingReview :Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth1 is a remake of the original Hyperdimension Neptunia for PS3 with better cinematics and new type of gameplay.Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth1 is about the console wars we know of today. The endless fight between Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo and now Sega.The nicknames of the 4 goddess are the color of the consoles like, Green heart is Xbox, Black Heart is Playstation, White Heart is Nintendo and Purple Heart is Sega.You control the goddess Purple Heart or Neptune that suffers from amnesia after a fierce battle between the other goddess that too her out. Neptune meets Compa, that is a reference to company that made this game; Compile Heart. Later in the game you meet IF that is a Reference to the publishers; Idea Factory.The game is kinda huge, and with lots of dungeon crawling.You have the ability to create custom moves with Discs and such. Every Goddess have a HDD transformation also called Hard Drive Divinity, that makes them even more powerful.There are DLC to get 2 other Goddess on your team almost from the start, Peashy(Yellow Heart) and Plutia(Iris Heart).The game have loads of humor and it's VN style is loveable.The only sad part is that, it's grind based. So you have to grind up by doing quest to earn Exp and money for new gear.Additional Infomation :Developer: Idea Factory, Compile Heart, Felistella Publisher: Compile Heart Genre: Singleplayer, RPG, Anime, Dungeon CrawlerReleased on PS Vita: 26 August 2014Released on Steam: January 30, 2015Follow my Curator page :http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/This review is written for :The Panda's Corner "

												First of all. If you do not like any RPG, go out of here.With the remake of the first Hyperdimension Neptunia it is now possible to enjoy the series without having a Playstation. I am very happy with it.There is a really solid gameplay. Dungeon-selecting and a TBS-Battle-System with some extras. There are no random encounters. The difficulty of this game is not that hard.A system makes you able to add different content. For finding the right materials you can add dungeons, equipment, outfits and enemies or even change the strength of them. So you are able to change a part of the game as you wish.Like most RPG the focus of the game is the well explained story. Well it is true that there is a really nice storybut I must confess the core of this game is the humor. There is a ton of game references, which usually makes you grin. Character names, quotes, jokes, eveything is there.The whole story is explained with dialogs like a visual novel. There is much to read, but in the end it is always funny. Between the battles it is always relaxing just to read the dialogs.Nep-ko should really eat her eggplants, because they are so healthy.. uhm nevermind..This game is one of the few games I really wanted to have for release. The price was really worth it.If you like RPG and are interested in the Console War in Game Industri, then you should buy it.			"

												Good news for all you Linux gamers out there: It works with wine!My sorta crazy setup is:Lubuntu 64bitwine 1.7PS3-ControllerYou have to start steam in 32 bit wine and using the wine browser navigate to the install directory of Neptunia to start the exe. The game won't work if trying to start it from steam for me.After configuring the controller key mapping, everything works.The port seems kinda buggy at the moment. It randomly stops to accept keyboard input (only mouse works, which might get you stuck in the game). Didn't have this using the controller yet. The game also crashes sometimes after battle. Not sure what triggers that, might be the time you spent fighting.I experience absolutely zero lag, which is awesome considering it's running through wine. Machine specs are:AMD FX 4300 @ 4,2 GHzAMD Radeon 6950 (fglrx drivers)16GB DDR3 1333I have it on my Vita already, but playing on a large screen at home is so much better compared to a handheld. Don't need mobile gaming at home.Despite the occasional crash, this game is awesome. Get it. NOW!			"

												For anyone who came here lost on where to start in the Hyperdimension Neptuina series, here is a brief overview on the differences between the versions of this game and whether or not this is the right place to start for you.TL;DR: Hyperdimension Neptunia (PS3) and Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth are different games, but both work as starting points to the franchise. If you have played one of them, then you've seen the main storyline for the other and won't be missing too much (Storyline-wise at least)This game is: Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1, is a port of the Playstation Vita game of the same name. Re;Birth1 is canonically the first game in the current canon, (albeit, some, if not most of the games take place in different dimensions) and is the best starting point for those who are interested in getting into the Neptunia games. In this game you will not encounter: Reddo-Chan, 5PB, Nisa or Gust.This game is not: Hyperdimension Neptunia (Proper). Hyperdimension Neptunia for the PS3 was the first game in the Neptunia series and while these games have a similar storyline, characters, game play, duologue, art, graphics, etc. are all different from this game to its Re;Birth counterpart. These two games both work as entry points to this series as they have (mostly) similar stories, but depending on what experience you want to take away from this franchise you may want to chose one over the other.If you are looking for a better technical experience than look no further than Re;Birth1. Re;Birth1 has a unique combat system that has become the trademark of the current Neptunia games; the player will move the characters inside a instanced battle map and direct the character's attacks to hit as many enemies as possible. This can also work against the player though as the enemies can attack several of your party members if they are bundled up too closely. Re;Birth1 also boasts a better overall frame rate as it's PS3 counterpart ran very sluggishly and had a very unstable overall frame rate. Re;Birth1 also contains a new system that allows the player to unlock new, items, weapons, maps, and even characters using the Remake system. Rebirth1 also has a far larger cast of playable characters: 16 without DLC and 19 with DLC.Hyperdimension Neptunia (PS3) Has tons of customization options not available in Re;Birth1 such as the ability to import one's own images to create custom attacks; alongside this one may also create custom attack combos that lead into custom finishing moves. On the downside, Neptunia PS3 has a smaller cast of characters 7 without DLC and 11 with, but it does feature fan favorites Nisa and Gust, neither of which you will see in any of the games on steam. The combat in this game is unique and no other game in the series plays like it; the characters do not move while in battle and the battle system is similar to that of games such as Xenosaga. Characters have three main types of attacks: Weapon, Physical and shoot (and its pretty great seeing Iffy and Nep-Nep whip out pistols to shoot the enemy with) all with their own unique properties. Neptunia PS3 also has the greatest amount of direct references to video games and gaming culture in general, so the humor is pretty great for those who like video games.Overall they are both unique and fun experiences to be had, but if you are only going to play one of them I really must recommend Re;Birth1 as its game play and characters have a far wider appeal, and Re;Birth1 also has tons of content to play through not featured in the PS3 game. If you are a true Nep-fanatic you'll eventually find yourself playing through both games and enjoying the vastly different content presented in both.			"

												I complete this game 5 times and get all of the achievement already. The dialog is not boring because 1 of the character will say something out from the script when the conversation has started boring, like when Neptune say ""And our players out there don't want to read a wall of text no more..."", it makes me laugh lol.... If you like Visual Novel that have a good story If you like cute girl If you like sexy girl or Cute Girl that transform into Sexy Girlthen buy this gameAND IF YOU LOVE PUDDING THEN DON'T FORGET TO BUY THIS GAME  Overall Ratings:  10000/9999    (extra 1 points for the Puddings)  "

												+Decent story, it doesn't take itself too serious and avoids the melodrama that usually follows JRPGs+Simple and straightforward battle system, no unnecessary complexity that causes headaches/irritation (I'm looking at you Agarest)+Ok anime graphics, during the VN parts the animation is done well enough and the fanservice doesn't quite go too far+Iris Heart DLC character+Unlike the PS3 originals the PC port runs at 60fps without really stressing an average system. Those that have played Victory (the title that this game took most gameplay elements from) on the PS3 will probably find this to be the biggest plus, framerate on the console was horrible-The English translation takes too much freedom, much of the spark from the original Japanese dialogue is lost and at some places even the general meaning is changed.-Default controls aren't that good and you need a decent gamepad to play without hassle-English dub is lethal and a few of the Japanese voices can be somewhat irritating (Compa in general and a few combat lines from Neptune)Still one of the best JRPGs on Steam and the PC port seem to be working without issue now (unlike at launch).

												A revamp of the PS3 release. Re;birth 1 removes the bland and tedious of the first game (but still enjoyable) and replaced it with goodies from its mk2 sequel, primarily its semi free-roam battle system, as opposed to the original's FF-sqeue turn-based combat, all while still maintaining its charm and eyecandy fans have come to expect and love. Console jokes and character conversations also include references and jabs at the first game, giving players who played the original PS3 release a good chuckle or two.Being a Vita port, the game doesn't run on native 1080p, but it's not a deal-breaker. In fact, I find it very well optimized for a port aside from its post-release issues and glitches. Gameplay is fluid and 'breathing' character portraits bring life to its cast during dialogue. Best played with a controller, a KB+M is fine but navigating character movement and camera angles with two sets of movement keys while inputting commands isn't fun.Highly recommended to anime and VN fans, or anyone who falls into the niche JRPG segment of the market.

												After playing Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 a few hours I can recommend it:++ challenging turn based combat, with many skills and gear upgrades++ dungeons can be adjusted, new locations can be unlocked++ the game doesn't take itself too seriously++ the female main characters are funny, hilarious & charming and have a great friendship++ game is full of references that only seasoned gamers will get++ funny dialogs++ challenging boss fights++ entertaining story- - some grinding- - respawning- - some recycled maps- - playing with keyboard and mouse is a challenge, but can be learnedIf you want to play a serious RPG look elsewhere, but if you like challenging fights, hilarious charming characters and lots of humor this could be a game for you! PS:Main tips for mouse and keyboard play:    don't play with inverted mouse control    use W A S D to move    use cursor keys to select targets    use 'o' in the main menu to equip your characters, save, load, etc.    always use the mouse for combat actions (-> click on the controller key-symbols)    use left mouse click in dialogs to get the next sentence			"

												First of all, I'd like to give a shoutout and thank a couple of friends of mine from allowing me to enjoy this game. One of them for getting me into this franchise and the other one for gifting me this game when it was on sale. I'm not gonna make any mentions, but they know who they are!Now, Hyperdimension Neptunia... I remember seeing this game back as a PS3 exclusive, a few years ago. But I didn't feel like playing it and I couldn't buy it cuz I didn't have a PS3 at the time and the one thing to get my attention where the main characters on the cover. So this was my first shot at it.For starters, the story. And I'll try to talk about it here without spoiling too much, here. The game takes place in Gamindustri, formed by 4 lands (Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox and Lowee) and each have a goddess who rules over them (Purple Heart, Black Heart, Green Heart and White Heart). Now the story starts with all 4 goddesses battling each other in a land called Celestia, which is above Gamindustri. All 4 with the exact same objective, which is to win and rule over all 4 lands. After battling for a while, Black, Green and White heart consider getting rid of one of them to make the battle easier and join forces to get rid of Purple Heart. They successfully do it, Purple Heart falls off of Celestia, landing on Planeptune and losing her memory. After falling, a girl aspiring to be a nurse called Compa finds her and becomes friends with her, promising to help her getting her memory back.I find the gameplay good. It's easy to move around when free roaming and I found the controls for combat easy to get comfortable with. Besides, the combat's pretty varied, as each character has a lot of different attacks and special moves. Though playing this game can be a little difficult, depending on your situation. The game does support keyboard, but I highly recommend a controller.For a game that originally came out in 2011 for the PS3 and was ported to Steam and PSVita in 2014, I don't see much of a difference in graphics. Which doesn't mean it's bad, actually. If the game still lags for you, it's most likely because the game's loading too any enemies and any small details, in the dungeons.The game's pretty fun and if you pay attention, you can notice a lot of jokes. And also something which is pretty well made in this game, which is 4th wall breaking. A lot of it!But with all these pros, obviously the game also comes with it's share of cons. And I've experienced some of them. Even though this game is great, you may kinda get a little tired of some of the dungeons you'll see throughout the game, as Idea Factory recycled a lot of dungeon layouts and a lot of enemies, simply renaming them and making them stronger.  Two other examples I can give are that the game suffers from a glitch that can pretty much screw up your whole process if you don't save frequently. Sometimes in combat, the enemies will not move at all, during their turns. They'll just stare at your party without attacking at all. Idk the solution for this and a lot of people complain about the same issue in the Steam forums and so far, no solution to this problem. So if it happens, force close the game through the task manager. The last problem I can mention is that sometimes, the game randomly crashes in between intros. Idk if anyone else has had this issue, but it has happened to me a couple of times. But very rarely. So here's a piece of advice for you who buy the game: save frequently.This is something I'm gonna start doing, with my reviews. My final verdict for Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 1 is a 7/10.This is a great game. And it had potential to reach a higher score! Maybe even an 8/10, imo. But with the few issues it has and with so many recycled content in the game, it kinda drops the score I personally give the game. But still. It's a pretty fun experience and worth the money! I still strongly recommend this game to any JRPG fans and anyone who's looking for a new game to play.			"

												Update: After 51 hours (Excluding hours I left the game running and didn't play,) got all the Achievements for the Game. I enjoyed this game so much that it's literally the only game I actually bothered to do Achievements for. Also the first Game I actually decided to do the Trading Cards for. This is definitely a great casual Game worthy of many playthroughs.Really surprised with this title so far (14 hours into the Game at the time of this post.)The Story is quite... Interesting. It is not your typical straightforward story. The Basic plot is that the CPUs are in the middle of a Console War. Yes, a Console War. This is where your Story starts off. If you can comprehend that and the fact that the game has a lot of 4th wall breaking context to some times insult its players and have wacky dialogue, the Story is for the most part Satirical all the way through, which is very interesting, and I actually like it.One main piece of advice I can offer to any one interested in Re;Birth 1: I recommend one of two things.1. Watch the Anime. (The Anime is an adaptation of the Game, and takes place some time after the other games. Main reason I list this is because it's a good way to get used to the Characters, and if you can handle the wacky / cheesy dialogue in the Anime, you'll fit right in for the Game.)2. Grind. Grind. Grind, and buy Item Upgrades / make the Upgrades VIA Plans at every opportunity they become available.People say that this Game is pretty easy. Maybe if you played it before it came to Steam, that is understandable, but this Game is by no means easy. It is actually VERY hard / some times frustrating.The Game runs Eight Chapters. If you are not grinding / purchasing upgrades at every opportunity, you will notice how hard this Game can be when you get halfway through the 2nd Chapter. The other problem is that the Bosses have a lot of RNG to them, where they can either do a Normal hit to you, a Powerful hit that might kill you, or an Attack that hits all of your Party Members in close range, even if they aren't even in front of the Boss. Reviving your Party Members when they get downed is also RNG, because from what i've experienced in my own Playthrough, the Boss likes to immediately attack and kill the person you revive almost 90% of the time before it switches to one of your other party members. If you're coming into this game thinking that you'll blow through it without using Healing items or Game Over'ing at all, you're in for a rude awakening. Get used to how the Dungeons look in the first two chapters of the Game, because you're going to be seeing them all the way until the End. I can't knock them on this because if you can tell already that the Game doesn't take itself seriously and that it mocks a lot of things, especially in the Gaming world, you could see this as them mocking Games that use the same Layouts constantly.Soundtrack is also pretty decent, but a lot of areas unfortunately use the same background music way too often. Can't knock this either for similar reasons that I listed for Dungeons.If you can get past all this, this is definitely a very fun game, albeit very challenging as well. Would definitely recommend to any one that likes JRPGs, and I look forward to the rest of the Series coming to Steam.			"

												Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a good, perhaps even great game, but it does not come without significant flaws. It is a bit of a rollercoaster between good and bad, and the bad moments are just as frustrating as the good moments are amazing. Whether or not you'll be able to forgive Neptunia for its flaws and enjoy it for the good it offers seems to depend mostly on personal preference.Unlike most modern western games that go for the lowest common denominator, this game was made with a clear target audience in mind. If you are not a fan of japanese animation in general, then you do not belong into this group and a significant part of the game will not appeal to you.In Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 you'll spend your time with two types of activities; dialogue in VN-style with animated sprites, and gameplay with jRPG typical turn-based combat.The dialogue is not very interesting on its own and mainly consists of ""cute girls doing cute things"". If you do not like that sort of thing, then a large part of Neptunia's charm will not appeal to you. But then again, you wouldn't be here in the first place if that was true, right?Then there's the gameplay. During missions and quests you'll be wandering around in so called ""dungeons"", which I'd just call ""maps"", as a majority of them are outside. These dungeons are filled with monsters, and upon contact, you'll face off against them in turn-based combat. The combat can be a bit hard to get into at first, but after getting used to it, it can be quite enjoyable. However, it quickly gets repetitive and killing everything in your way will soon feel like a chore. A few hours into the game, you'll probably want to avoid most of the ""trashmobs"" and then repeatedly kill boss-type mobs over and over again to grind some much needed levels for the upcoming event bosses. The bosses in general can be very though, they have a lot of health and whether you'll find them a pushover or unbeatable will depend a lot on your level, which makes a huge difference.The combat is surprisingly deep with many options for combos, finishers, super moves, abilities that come either as passives or as a bonus from other party members, and hundreds of possible bonus abilities from equipment slots, particularly discs that you can configure yourself.Easily the worst part of Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is the leveldesign. There are a handful of maps, like a cave, a mountain pass, a grasslands area, a warehouse, and so on. There are tons of dungeons in the game, and it just so happens that these few maps get copypasted over and over again. Many of the dungeons use literally the exact same map, along with the same enemies using a new color and name. Going through the same looking dungeons will quickly become a chore.The game does however offer a ton of endgame content with lots of replay value. If you only play through the story once and then quit, you'll miss a significant amount of content, although doing so is certainly understandable given the copypasted nature of the dungeons and enemies. About half the dungeons are optional, and you can spawn additional bosses in every dungeon through the use of a crafting system that calls those things ""plans"". There are more items in Neptunia than you could ever hope for. Most of them are crafted and require specific materials, including boss drops. Getting some of them is a feat on its own, but attempting to get everything possible is extremely grindy. There are optional party members, super strong bosses, difficult dungeons and amazing weapons/armors that you can attempt to get once your party has a high enough level.Another major gripe is the localisation. The translation is extremely liberal, seemingly in an attempt to ""americanize"" the game. The text box displaying something along the lines of, but still completely different from what the characters say is a frequent occurrence, to the point that it even changes the characters personalities sometimes. I did some digging around and apparently the localisation of this game is considered ""good"" by the community, which speaks volumes not only about the standards of the fans, but moreso about the quality of the translation of other games in the series.In conclusion, I can recommend Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 to people who like anime and/or turn-based gameplay. Despite doing many things wrong, it can offer an enjoyable experience if the things it does right appeal to you.			"

												Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1, I love this game. I haven't played any of the previous installments of this series, but I personally do not feel like I'm missing out on anything.Pros:Witty and comical humor! (Nep-Nep makes this game great)Fun and intersting combatThe game delivers what a jrpg is - grinding levels (I enjoy constant battles to increase my characters levels and power)The story is actually fun to followSkimpy anime girls (If you bought the game obviously you're interested in this aspect)So many outfits to choose from!Cons:Because of the constant need to grind, the game doesn't feel as large as it should. Your time spent is in the same dungeons over and over.Lack of in-depth character customization (I didn't really expect this game to have it, but it would have been nice to have just a little more variety.The game is fun and if you enjoy jrpg this title is right up your alley. I own the other Neptunia games on Steam as well now because of this game and I expect the series only gets better. "

EVER HEARD OF FOURTH WALL BREAKING? get ready for lots of that in a funny way. The character designs are so kawaii and well done that i admittedly spend hours coming back to play neptunia games just to stare at the characters like some perverted SUPER OTAKU (neppers know what i mean) though the best game to do that in is Megadimension Neptunia VII just for the better graphics!!!!but anyhoo yea its just a good little game but if your looking for some serious game to put your whole life into like a bethesda RPG yea....this isnt what your looking for.....you have to not think too hard about it to enjoy these games and the anime!9.9999998/10 NEP-TACULAR!!!!(NEP-SISTERS ARE THE BEST!!!! - THATS RIGHT I SAID IT!!!)

												This is a remake of a PS3 JRPG that's also available on Vita. I hear the original was a much worse game, and I really don't dare imagine how that was like. It's a cheap budget JRPG (new price was 15 bucks on launch sale) with emphasize on cheap. There are only like half a dozen dungeon layouts, while there are 50 dungeons in the game. So basically each dungeon is copy pasted 10 times with only the enemies replaced. The dungeons are super short too, you can run from the entrance to the end usually in less than 5 minutes. The storyline is also only presented visual novel style with textboxes and talking heads. Cities are implemented as simple menus. So you either watch dialogues or you pick a dungeon from a list and run through it. Really this game probably cost less to make than the PS3 licensing fees...Still, it is suprisingly fun. Combat is turn based with a bunch of systems piled on it, and there is a massive crafting component involving hunting monsters for materials and crafting plans to unlock new equipment or dungeons. And the grind is so extremely streamlined, you can breeze even through special bosses within 10 seconds by liberal use of the ultra smooth animation cancel button. There are also absolutely no loading times, everything appears and works instantly. So the grind can downright turn into a rush and feels very satisfying. Think the loot and kill vortex of Diablo, but as a JRPG. Oh also the story is a parody of the console war in the current game industry. The entire cast of the game is female with permanent fan service forced in your face. The main character is a personified Dreamcast and there are also Playstation, Xbox and the Wii present. Ofc the Xbox has the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥while the Wii is as flat as a washboard and gets extremely jealous if that's pointed out to her. At the start they are all mortal enemies but of course they eventually band together to fight a greater evil. It is in no way shape or form serious and constantly goofy and 4th wall breaking. I thought I would hate it but honestly, I think I prefer this absolute nonsense over yet another embarassing teenage melodrama or boring as ♥♥♥♥ Hero Alex gathers the stones of power to save the world from the evil wizard♥♥♥♥♥♥as you'd usually find in JRPGs.Mild recommendation.

												I was skeptical of the positive reviews at first but this game is great. It has that mmo dungeon crawler feel, attacthed to the goofy comedy anime vibe we all know and love. granted ive only played two hours, but so far its been really fun.One thing i'd like to note is that this game really needs a controller. It is playable on K&M, however i'm finding it to be much less smooth than it would be if i had a controller. Its relatively easy to look past though. The english voice acting is also not consistently used throughout the whole game leading to odd gaps but whatever.For disclosure sake, i'd like to point out the game was $6 on a steam sale when i purchased it, which may make my review more forgiving than others All in all, if you have a controller, and want to have some kawaii fun with some fan service thrown in, get it. If you like final fantasy, or fire emblem, you will probbaly enjoy this for the change of pace.			"

												So first off the controls are confusing when you first start because it's basically designed for the controller but by pressing 'O' mid game you can quickly change them.-PVP is awesome-Leveling is almost the same as an MMO-Animations are cute and well designed8/10			"

												Arguably the best VN/RPG game I've played in a very, very long time. I immiediatly got hooked on this and the other two I bought through a sale. Neptune is the best fourthwall break character and the humour made this very enjoyable. This is definitely well worth getting if you enjoy RPG games that have a touch of visual novels.			"

												This games is the most fun time wasting jRPG I've ever played. The humor is on point. It's self-aware fanservice so it's not for everybody, but for those of us who love that sort of thing, definitely pick this up. It's very very grindy but the grinding is made less apparenty with it's ""remake"" system (basically item creation/crafting system). I've never felt the urge to play through multiple ng+'s but I think I just might on this one. Nepnoire and IF+Vert forever!			"

												Just from 1 hour of gameplay, I can honestly say that buying this game was a terriffic choice! The game is exactly as advertised, a JRPG that takes various tropes and punches them in the face! The story is fairly good too. Otakus would probably understand what I mean when I say the game is like Hetalia but for the Video Game industry. The game's four main characters are all based on the 4 major gaming console manufacturers: Sega (Sega Neptune), Sony (Playstation), Nintendo (Wii), and Microsoft (XBox), and are in the midst of waging a war literally called ""The Console War"" in the world of ""Gameindustri."" Yeah, that's how this game rolls and thats just the beginning.This being a JRPG, the game has an opening like a traditonal anime and the opening is very good too. Be warned, the majority if not the entirety of the main cast are female and most appear to be the typical teenaged anime characters and there is some noticable ""jiggle physics"" on some of the characters. Just a fair heads up.Gameplay wise, keyboard controls are a bit dodgy. The game is meant to be played with a controller (which actually makes more sense considering the premice of the game itself) but has rebindable keys for keyboard. I recommend using an XBox 360 Controller (wired) as a fast alternative workaround.In terms of combat, the game is turn based but with an interesting twist. You can move the characters around within a certain radius, putting their target into a blue targeting box in front of them. You can target multiple enemies this way especially if they're clustered together. The enemy won't move until it's their turn too. One thing mouse and keyboard has an advantage over controler is that you can more carefully turn your characters so you can line up accurate attacks.			"

												I really liked this game. The thing that killed it for me, hence only 15 hours or whatever played rather than the 70+ the top reviews have, was the massive grind to beat the second boss. Like, i had to grind for a very, very long time to beat that ♥♥♥♥ing boss. It was awful, boring and killed it for me.The combat in this game was pretty awful at first, but after tinkering around and figuring it out, it became a thing of beauty. After a little testing on your own, you'll be able to figure out which moves to use when and how to hit multiple enemies at once. It begins to feel like a little bit of strategy is needed to actually fight, which is nice.The sheer amount of content in this game is amazing also. There's so many things to craft and so many characters to level up (and dress up in some cases) that the 80 or so hours of playtime i see most people with is not surprising in the least. However, it can feel a little overwhelming if you're a perfectionist who actually wants to get close to a perfect runthrough.Another thing that should be mentioned is the tutorials aren't that great. They don't really explain enough, I feel, and you kind of have to figure it out on your own. That was also another ""killer"" for me because I spent probably an hour or two just messing around looking through all the different menus to figure out anything mildly helpful. I still honestly don't understand the point of some things or where to find certain items or how to check if an item is good before i spend hours grinding for monsters to drop the one thing i need...Anyway, most of my problems with the game could probably be easily avoided if you're up for googling and looking for guides before you get in depth. Also, being prepared for the huge grind needed to beat the second boss is a nice heads up.			"

												Didn't really have any idea what this game was about when I bought it. I only got fascinated because of the cute characters, and that a lot of people on my list were playing this game, so I went and bought it. I guess it's okay. I love the franchise now because of the diverse characters. Only downside is that the maps are recycled, and farming for rare items is a huge pain in the butt, especially for those end-game gears dropped by the most powerful bosses.			"

												First of all, I'd like to give a shoutout and thank a couple of friends of mine from allowing me to enjoy this game. One of them for getting me into this franchise and the other one for gifting me this game when it was on sale. I'm not gonna make any mentions, but they know who they are!Now, Hyperdimension Neptunia... I remember seeing this game back as a PS3 exclusive, a few years ago. But I didn't feel like playing it and I couldn't buy it cuz I didn't have a PS3 at the time and the one thing to get my attention where the main characters on the cover. So this was my first shot at it.For starters, the story. And I'll try to talk about it here without spoiling too much, here. The game takes place in Gamindustri, formed by 4 lands (Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox and Lowee) and each have a goddess who rules over them (Purple Heart, Black Heart, Green Heart and White Heart). Now the story starts with all 4 goddesses battling each other in a land called Celestia, which is above Gamindustri. All 4 with the exact same objective, which is to win and rule over all 4 lands. After battling for a while, Black, Green and White heart consider getting rid of one of them to make the battle easier and join forces to get rid of Purple Heart. They successfully do it, Purple Heart falls off of Celestia, landing on Planeptune and losing her memory. After falling, a girl aspiring to be a nurse called Compa finds her and becomes friends with her, promising to help her getting her memory back.I find the gameplay good. It's easy to move around when free roaming and I found the controls for combat easy to get comfortable with. Besides, the combat's pretty varied, as each character has a lot of different attacks and special moves. Though playing this game can be a little difficult, depending on your situation. The game does support keyboard, but I highly recommend a controller.For a game that originally came out in 2011 for the PS3 and was ported to Steam and PSVita in 2014, I don't see much of a difference in graphics. Which doesn't mean it's bad, actually. If the game still lags for you, it's most likely because the game's loading too any enemies and any small details, in the dungeons.The game's pretty fun and if you pay attention, you can notice a lot of jokes. And also something which is pretty well made in this game, which is 4th wall breaking. A lot of it!But with all these pros, obviously the game also comes with it's share of cons. And I've experienced some of them. Even though this game is great, you may kinda get a little tired of some of the dungeons you'll see throughout the game, as Idea Factory recycled a lot of dungeon layouts and a lot of enemies, simply renaming them and making them stronger.  Two other examples I can give are that the game suffers from a glitch that can pretty much screw up your whole process if you don't save frequently. Sometimes in combat, the enemies will not move at all, during their turns. They'll just stare at your party without attacking at all. Idk the solution for this and a lot of people complain about the same issue in the Steam forums and so far, no solution to this problem. So if it happens, force close the game through the task manager. The last problem I can mention is that sometimes, the game randomly crashes in between intros. Idk if anyone else has had this issue, but it has happened to me a couple of times. But very rarely. So here's a piece of advice for you who buy the game: save frequently.This is something I'm gonna start doing, with my reviews. My final verdict for Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 1 is a 7/10.This is a great game. And it had potential to reach a higher score! Maybe even an 8/10, imo. But with the few issues it has and with so many recycled content in the game, it kinda drops the score I personally give the game. But still. It's a pretty fun experience and worth the money! I still strongly recommend this game to any JRPG fans and anyone who's looking for a new game to play.			"

												I have never played a Hyperdimension game before, but was quite excited for this release, as I would really like to see the ball get rolling with more JRPG's coming to Steam (all of NB's ""Tales"" games and Final Fantasy XV come to mind...)I'm one who loves deep, emotionally-involved characters and an amazing plot, but have been able to shelve that here. I bought this the minute it was released, and am glad I did. A good, solid JRPG with a great battle system awaited, and it plays wonderfully at 60fps. An all-female cast is also a big plus for me, too.**EDIT**I own a GeForce GTX 660Ti graphics card, and as of a couple driver updates ago, within the last few months, a few features were added to the card. Among them, ""Dynamic Super Resolution (DSR)."" This enables the GPU to commandeer absolutely all graphics output, from photographs to non-DirectX games (like this one), upscale the image up to 4x of the current screen resolution, and then put it back to the screen resolution. The result? This game (yes, this game) now looks AMAZING, and with no drop in FPS (over 1300-core GPU). If anyone out there owns an NVidia card as good or better than this one, TURN THIS OPTION ON!! Trust me, you won't regret it.**Open statement to Japanese gaming companies: Even though PC games may not do so well in Japan, they certainly do everywhere else! And the performance with a good, dedicated gfx card is superior to that of consoles! Please bring all of your day-one releases to PC. They -will- sell.Can't wait for the next releases, Idea Factory! Keep 'em coming!			"

												9/10, a good JRPG with good characters and a nice story.If there was one complaint I have, it'd have to be that there's no autosave system. I once got sent back over 30 minutes of progress when I died during a certain boss fight. Otherwise there isn't any real flaws I can point out. It is what it promises to be. It re-uses a few level layouts but that isn't really an issue.The customization was really good too.If I had to sum it up, Hyperdimension Neptunia is a game about grinding girls who you wish to grind.

												Update: After 51 hours (Excluding hours I left the game running and didn't play,) got all the Achievements for the Game. I enjoyed this game so much that it's literally the only game I actually bothered to do Achievements for. Also the first Game I actually decided to do the Trading Cards for. This is definitely a great casual Game worthy of many playthroughs.Really surprised with this title so far (14 hours into the Game at the time of this post.)The Story is quite... Interesting. It is not your typical straightforward story. The Basic plot is that the CPUs are in the middle of a Console War. Yes, a Console War. This is where your Story starts off. If you can comprehend that and the fact that the game has a lot of 4th wall breaking context to some times insult its players and have wacky dialogue, the Story is for the most part Satirical all the way through, which is very interesting, and I actually like it.One main piece of advice I can offer to any one interested in Re;Birth 1: I recommend one of two things.1. Watch the Anime. (The Anime is an adaptation of the Game, and takes place some time after the other games. Main reason I list this is because it's a good way to get used to the Characters, and if you can handle the wacky / cheesy dialogue in the Anime, you'll fit right in for the Game.)2. Grind. Grind. Grind, and buy Item Upgrades / make the Upgrades VIA Plans at every opportunity they become available.People say that this Game is pretty easy. Maybe if you played it before it came to Steam, that is understandable, but this Game is by no means easy. It is actually VERY hard / some times frustrating.The Game runs Eight Chapters. If you are not grinding / purchasing upgrades at every opportunity, you will notice how hard this Game can be when you get halfway through the 2nd Chapter. The other problem is that the Bosses have a lot of RNG to them, where they can either do a Normal hit to you, a Powerful hit that might kill you, or an Attack that hits all of your Party Members in close range, even if they aren't even in front of the Boss. Reviving your Party Members when they get downed is also RNG, because from what i've experienced in my own Playthrough, the Boss likes to immediately attack and kill the person you revive almost 90% of the time before it switches to one of your other party members. If you're coming into this game thinking that you'll blow through it without using Healing items or Game Over'ing at all, you're in for a rude awakening. Get used to how the Dungeons look in the first two chapters of the Game, because you're going to be seeing them all the way until the End. I can't knock them on this because if you can tell already that the Game doesn't take itself seriously and that it mocks a lot of things, especially in the Gaming world, you could see this as them mocking Games that use the same Layouts constantly.Soundtrack is also pretty decent, but a lot of areas unfortunately use the same background music way too often. Can't knock this either for similar reasons that I listed for Dungeons.If you can get past all this, this is definitely a very fun game, albeit very challenging as well. Would definitely recommend to any one that likes JRPGs, and I look forward to the rest of the Series coming to Steam.			"

Couple of pros and cons:PROS: - Both English and Japanese voice support - Feels great on controller - Lots of playability if you're the completionist type.  - Over-exaggerates damage output of attacks and gives it that great feeling of being 'OP' - Plenty of great references to movies, games, and other iconic stuff. - Moe moe moe and glassesCONS: - Can be VERY grind heavy - Recycled dungeons  - Repetitive when it comes to unlocking 'Add Enemy' plans  - Plutia isn't OP enough ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1, I love this game. I haven't played any of the previous installments of this series, but I personally do not feel like I'm missing out on anything.Pros:Witty and comical humor! (Nep-Nep makes this game great)Fun and intersting combatThe game delivers what a jrpg is - grinding levels (I enjoy constant battles to increase my characters levels and power)The story is actually fun to followSkimpy anime girls (If you bought the game obviously you're interested in this aspect)So many outfits to choose from!Cons:Because of the constant need to grind, the game doesn't feel as large as it should. Your time spent is in the same dungeons over and over.Lack of in-depth character customization (I didn't really expect this game to have it, but it would have been nice to have just a little more variety.The game is fun and if you enjoy jrpg this title is right up your alley. I own the other Neptunia games on Steam as well now because of this game and I expect the series only gets better. "

												A very cute anime-styled JRPG full of self-referential humor and the occasional handful of fan service.The game can certainly stand on it's own merits, with an interesting turn-based battle system and a difficulty curve that never feels unfairly hard or boringly easy.There are also oodles of side-dungeons, item crafting, and quests to keep you busy and entertained until the credits roll and beyond.If you're looking for a light-hearted JRPG and aren't put off by anime girls and fourth-wall poking (and sometimes demolishing) humor, this is definitely worth picking up.

												I bought this game because of all the positive reviews and stupid (in a good way) looking setting.If the half naked anime girls don't turn you off (or, even better, you like this stlye) you can find a pretty solid game underneath. The story doesn't win an Oscar but is keeping me engaged. Most of the fun comes from the cute dialogues and references to anything game related anyway. The charakters break the fouth wall quite often and the overall atmosphere is very light-hearted. The game just wants to be fun and make you smile and succeeds.There are tons of items to find, buy and craft. Add a good variety of abilities, spells, combos, some kind synergies between characters (if they like each other, you get bonuses) and you get great possibilities to customize your party. If you like experimenting, the game might be for you. Getting all the Plans, trying things out can be pretty addictive.The combat is turn-based on a 2D-Battlefield. Positioning is key, since all attacks have an area of effect. Standing at a wrong place can seriously ruin your day. Attack animations are also pretty good, so cambat is challenging and fun to watch. I strongly recommend a gamepad for the best experience. Playing with keyboard and mouse is possible but doesn't feel great.I won't comment much on the graphics. Look at Screenshots and videos and decide for yourself. It's a bit outdated but not ugly. Works for me.However, this game is not without flaws.The combat can get repetetive after a while, since the game tends to be quite grindy. You often have to get a few levels because of a difficulty spike and the MMO'ish quests (Kill X of these, bring me Y of that) increase this.The fact that dungeons and enemies are frequently recolored and reused does't make it better either. Oh, and you have to save often. There is no autosave and when you're dead, it's game over.To sum it all up: 7/10, fun game with some flaws. Would buy again			"

												Let me be perfectly clear. I have not played a Neptunia game prior to Re;birth and it's moments like this that I wish I had pulled my head out of the ground sooner.The first that got to me about this game was certain terminology such as the Console War, or CPUs. Which do not stand for Central Processor Unit, mind you. It stands for Console Patron Unit (CPU). The game's lead character Neptune falls from the sky after a brutal, yet thrilling, battle with other CPUs, Black Heart, White Heart and Green Heart and loses her memory. Accompanied by Compa, she sets out to recover her memory and rescue Histoire. Whom she refers to as Histy. This is essentially the rundown of the story.But how does it play? Rather well I must say. It's simplistic but requires a fairly strategic mind. As it is the case with many a JRPG you can't afford to just head first into everything. You need to be at least a specific level before can reliably take on bosses. Even then it's more than likely to be a challenge. If nothing else, I must congratulate the team at IF for putting together a game that's challenging and fun. But if you happen to be a casual gamer, the Remake System got you covered.The true charm of this game, however, is not the gameplay but its characters. They are all well-thought out and fleshed out very well. So much so that you can keep playing the game again and again only to expose yourself to the humorous spectacle that is Hyperdimension Neptunia.Overall, Re;Birth1 is game that's worth your money and more. It's got a ton of content just waiting for you to unlock them. 241 hours and still don't have everything.			"

												Going to get all the versions on the ps3 now XD. Great game that exceed my expectations for a Pc RPG. Which got me to write a review for this game. I usually never write reviews on games (because im too lazy and have better stuff to do such as creating playermodels for Garrys Mod), but this one is an exception. From the 6 badges I crafted, I got 6 Noire wall papers from the badges =D total $120. Rebirth 1 is a million times better than Rebirth 2. I hope rebirth 3 will not disappoint me like rebirth 2.			"

												The game is amazingly fun (well, by my standards, but different people view ""fun"" differently) to play, the girls are cute, the voice acting is top notch (the Japanese voice acting is, but I have no idea how good -- or bad -- the English voice acting is since I didn't bother to listen to it), and the story is fun enough to make you not care about how many cliches they used in the game.  In fact, they made use of cliches and tropes to such a degree that it was funny, entertaining, and enjoyable.  You don't have to go beyond this first paragraph if you don't feel like it, since the remaining paragraphs are merely my extensions on why I like the game and think that you should get it too.Even though it had the standard ""save the world from the villain"" plot, the true ending puts a nice twist to the story, and indeed, the story itself is poking fun at the genre that it is in (not unlike a certain other story involving a female demon lord, a hero, his past companions, and the various people that are involved in wars).There is an abundance of female characters and some nonsensical jiggling, but since I like girls and I laugh at nonsensical jiggling. . . wwwwwwI can't get enough of Ueda Kana's voice, and the way that the voice actors voiced the cast of characters made the story even more entertaining than it already was.If you're worried about grinding pointlessly, don't.  You can pretty much clear the game by doing only the main battles and a few sidequests to find some materials for gears.  The New Game+ feature will also help you in your subsequent playthroughs, assuming you want to get all of your money's worth of the game and find any content that you may have missed in the first playthrough.  That said, New Game+ may be considered ""grinding"", but then again, there's just no pleasing some people.If you read this review all the way here, thank you.  Seriously, I didn't think that anyone would read it all the way here, so give yourself a pat in the back, and buy and play the game!			"

												9/10, a good JRPG with good characters and a nice story.If there was one complaint I have, it'd have to be that there's no autosave system. I once got sent back over 30 minutes of progress when I died during a certain boss fight. Otherwise there isn't any real flaws I can point out. It is what it promises to be. It re-uses a few level layouts but that isn't really an issue.The customization was really good too.If I had to sum it up, Hyperdimension Neptunia is a game about grinding girls who you wish to grind.

												I was skeptical of the positive reviews at first but this game is great. It has that mmo dungeon crawler feel, attacthed to the goofy comedy anime vibe we all know and love. granted ive only played two hours, but so far its been really fun.One thing i'd like to note is that this game really needs a controller. It is playable on K&M, however i'm finding it to be much less smooth than it would be if i had a controller. Its relatively easy to look past though. The english voice acting is also not consistently used throughout the whole game leading to odd gaps but whatever.For disclosure sake, i'd like to point out the game was $6 on a steam sale when i purchased it, which may make my review more forgiving than others All in all, if you have a controller, and want to have some kawaii fun with some fan service thrown in, get it. If you like final fantasy, or fire emblem, you will probbaly enjoy this for the change of pace.			"

It's very very grindy but the grinding is made less apparenty with it's ""remake"" system (basically item creation/crafting system).

												Just from 1 hour of gameplay, I can honestly say that buying this game was a terriffic choice! The game is exactly as advertised, a JRPG that takes various tropes and punches them in the face! The story is fairly good too. Otakus would probably understand what I mean when I say the game is like Hetalia but for the Video Game industry. The game's four main characters are all based on the 4 major gaming console manufacturers: Sega (Sega Neptune), Sony (Playstation), Nintendo (Wii), and Microsoft (XBox), and are in the midst of waging a war literally called ""The Console War"" in the world of ""Gameindustri."" Yeah, that's how this game rolls and thats just the beginning.This being a JRPG, the game has an opening like a traditonal anime and the opening is very good too. Be warned, the majority if not the entirety of the main cast are female and most appear to be the typical teenaged anime characters and there is some noticable ""jiggle physics"" on some of the characters. Just a fair heads up.Gameplay wise, keyboard controls are a bit dodgy. The game is meant to be played with a controller (which actually makes more sense considering the premice of the game itself) but has rebindable keys for keyboard. I recommend using an XBox 360 Controller (wired) as a fast alternative workaround.In terms of combat, the game is turn based but with an interesting twist. You can move the characters around within a certain radius, putting their target into a blue targeting box in front of them. You can target multiple enemies this way especially if they're clustered together. The enemy won't move until it's their turn too. One thing mouse and keyboard has an advantage over controler is that you can more carefully turn your characters so you can line up accurate attacks.			"

												I really liked this game. The thing that killed it for me, hence only 15 hours or whatever played rather than the 70+ the top reviews have, was the massive grind to beat the second boss. Like, i had to grind for a very, very long time to beat that ♥♥♥♥ing boss. It was awful, boring and killed it for me.The combat in this game was pretty awful at first, but after tinkering around and figuring it out, it became a thing of beauty. After a little testing on your own, you'll be able to figure out which moves to use when and how to hit multiple enemies at once. It begins to feel like a little bit of strategy is needed to actually fight, which is nice.The sheer amount of content in this game is amazing also. There's so many things to craft and so many characters to level up (and dress up in some cases) that the 80 or so hours of playtime i see most people with is not surprising in the least. However, it can feel a little overwhelming if you're a perfectionist who actually wants to get close to a perfect runthrough.Another thing that should be mentioned is the tutorials aren't that great. They don't really explain enough, I feel, and you kind of have to figure it out on your own. That was also another ""killer"" for me because I spent probably an hour or two just messing around looking through all the different menus to figure out anything mildly helpful. I still honestly don't understand the point of some things or where to find certain items or how to check if an item is good before i spend hours grinding for monsters to drop the one thing i need...Anyway, most of my problems with the game could probably be easily avoided if you're up for googling and looking for guides before you get in depth. Also, being prepared for the huge grind needed to beat the second boss is a nice heads up.			"

												One Of The Best Jrpg's I've Played In Quite Some Time.. Great Gameplay,Story And More.. Welp Time For A Pro's And Cons List.Pros-Great Story-Great Gameplay-Full Female Cast Of Playable Characters-Nep Nep-Amazing Graphics-Awesome Endings-Not Much Replayableity But It's a Game where you 100% it then put it down for a while.. so you can come back and have that same fun all over again.there are many more Pros.. but it would make this review to big to add them all in.. so let's start the cons..Cons-Some Computers Can't Handle This Game-Diffculty Spikes At Odd Places And Prevent you from proceeding with the story.-JP Only DLC Character Not Able To Be Gotten-Grindfest Only If You Want To Go To Level 999 And Get All The Gear And What-NotThese Cons Quite Nit-Picky But I Still Deem Them Cons.. I Do Hope We Get That JP DLC Character One Day...Overall I Give The Game a 9.5 Outta 10... Would Give It a 10/10 But That Means The Devs Have Nothing To Improve Upon..			"

												It's your typical JRPG - exploring dungeons, levelling up, turn-based, super skills, 2nd forms, quests and most importantly - CUTE FIGHTING GIRLS WITH KAWAII ANIMATIONS.Nep-nep is super hilarious. The dialouge is funny and plot is straightforward. Recommended			"

Story/Presentation: 7I decided to try out this game in the Japanese language with English subtitles, of course, and I'm really glad I did. A lot of the English voice acting was very odd for me to hear and almost unbearable. I don't know what it is that some english dubbing is just so.. off putting. A lot of the lip-sinc was really off as well, so I forced myself to restart the game and try it out in Japanese. It somehow feels a lot more alive, more expressive, and you feel and know who the characters really are. So if anything, I would highly recommend going through the story and game in Japanese. Just pretend like you're watching a foreign film. As for the story, it's super cheesy, yet pretty enjoyable. I sort of saw it like a way to make fun of recent animes and make their own puns and the like. There is quite a bit of fan service here and there, but not the point where it's rubbed on your face, unless you like seeing underskirts during gameplay, but that can always be avoided. The art of the game, however, is very pretty to watch. The colors are very nice, and the art during the conversation sections are super pretty and pretty up to date compared to most games with this style. One thing I've noticed in game was when I just walk around a dungeun, I can somehow see the face normals on a model, and it just put me off a bit. It could of been because of the 'cyber world' gimick, but then it would of at least made it more obvious.Gameplay: 9Easily one of the best JRPGs I've played in a long time. I'm sort of selective when it comes to RPGs, specially turn-based ones, and this one works out just nicely! There's still a lot of movement involved, the challange is really big specially reaching Chapter 2, and it's just a lot of fun overall! As I mentioned, the Japanese acting works well with a lot of scenarios as well in game. The 'Plan' was an amazing feature in game, which I heard was what helped made the game better from it's original, and it was a good way to add in some sort of 'mods' to add weapons, make the game easier or harder, and to help with the fighting involving adding EXE power ups or even adding higher chances for enemies to drop items/resources. Everything works just fine, the only thing I wish was that there were more than just 3 characters to use in game, and that there were more moves to use, since a lot were just capped at Lv 3 EXE powers and the like. But even then, the New Game + is incredible, because even if you finished the game and start a new one with the same file, all of your character levels, all your items and equipments, all the plans, and even the MB Memories from Plans get transfered over. So when you start off from the first dungeon, you're already incredibly strong from the level you left off. Also, there is a lot of grinding involved.Overall: 9The game's incredibly cute and sexy, and also very fun to play. It can be addicting because of how easy you can level up and get so many items in game and the like. The characters are charming and loving in their own way, and I am personally excited for the second and third one to come out eventually on Steam. I highly recommend this game for Anybody into JRPGs and anime games in general!			"

												Cute and fun little RPG. The only issue I've encountered is that it won't save changes to resolution unless you're in windowed mode - but once you've changed it in windowed mode, that'll be retained in full-screen mode, so it's not really an issue. Haven't experienced crashes on a fully-updated copy of Windows 7 with GTX 460 (1GB) and latest Nvidia drivers. 60fps HD boob-jiggling is 10/10, even though it's limited to 1600x900 at the moment - though there is AA and AF, which are nice. :3			"

												tl;dr 10/10, lots of grinding with cute girls who are all waifu material, lots of fourth-wall breaking and endless references to things you like.A friend got me this game while it was on sale. Bless him. The game is basically a remake of an old game, but with much differences in the mechanics and story, apparently. I only read the wiki page, bare with me. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is set in a world called Gamindustri, which is made up of 4 countries: Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox, and Lowee. A Goddess rules over each country, called the Control Patron Units, aka CPUs. The CPUs are constantly fighting each other to gain total control of Gamindustri. The game begins when the CPU of Planeptune got rekt by the other three and lost her memory, giving birth to our amnesiac protagonist.Thus starts the plot of the game. The game doesn't take its plot seriously, but that makes it fun. Pros:-Unique combo mechanic -Flashy attacks-Smooth animations-All the girls are waifu material -Characters are good-Story is not that original, but enjoyable nonethelessCons:-Needs a lot of grinding, but not the grinding I was hoping for -Repetitive level designs -If you buy this game you are a weeabooSo, why would you not buy this game? I demand you to get your wallet and toss your money at the screen this instant.			"

												The weeb in me loves this game. The RPG lover in me is left wanting more. The actual gameplay amounts to, breaking the enemy's guard, and then use your strongest attack until the enemy is dead. If you are not on the same level as the thing you are fighting, you're dead. And you'll need to grind. There are plenty of enemies that give a lot of experience so once you find those enemies you can get a lot of experience quickly. The actual gameplay of this game is not that fleshed out. You can move around and position your characters before you attack but the game does nothing to make you change where your characters are standing. An enemy MIGHT walk out of range from your party members and you MIGHT have to move them over an inch to attack them again. But there are no enemies that force you to move out of the way of a devastating attack. There are no enviromental hazards that force you to plan your movements during fights. Nothing like that. So being able to move your characters in fights is basically pointless. There's no real nudity in the game but there is a lot of cleavage and mention of breast sizes so it does well to titlate and make you laugh. But it doesn't do enough to challenge you in fights outside of: Are you high enough level? Ok you win. In conclusion, the fanservice is good, the gameplay is not. That being said. I can't really NOT recommend this game. I didn't get exactly what I wanted out of it. But that's not to say that you won't.			"

The story is a fun story, the design of the girls and the world are cuter then cute, the personalities are well written, voice acting is not in every scene but helps a lot and fighting does use some real tactics.Now, when will the others get on here?

Seriously play this game while having Kingdom Hearts battle music in the background while you're fighting. It's glorious!EDIT: DLC is tragging me back, it's 50% off, so I had to get it.			"

												Put Star Ocean, Final Fantasy and Phantasy Star Portable together with crazy cute flavouring and you probably have Hyperdimension Neptunia Re:Birth1.Hyperdimension Neptunia Re:Birth1 is an all-girl casted (spare a few NPCs) turn based RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously, with easy to learn but hard to master combat system. Felistella has taken the best of Hyperdimension Neptunia, Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 and Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory, ripped apart the first of the three and rebuilt it, bringing us the definitive Hyperdimension Neptunia experience. The story is presented using 3D animations in the visual novel style, has decent pacing and the humour has quite a few laughs (but some groans, too). You'll move the story along primarily through dungeons and events activated in one of the game's four cities. Dungeons are explored in 3D third person, with treasure to find, resources to harvest and of course, lots of monsters to fight. While exploring a dungeon, monsters are encounted by making contact with them. You can get a pre-emptive attack on these monsters by performing a Symbol Attack, in which you swing your weapon at their hit box in the dungeon to initiate a battle. Should you fail to do so, monsters have a chance to launch a Surprise Attack. Otherwise who gets the first move is determined by the characters' agility stat vs the monsters'. Once defeated, monsters respawn after about a minute for you to fight again if you so desire, though they are easy to avoid should you not as they have relatively short leashes. One thing to note about the combat is that it has some really steep difficulty spikes. All monsters are not created equal, and while the last fight may have gone smooth as butter, the next one may be tough as nails. Certain monsters can become infected with a virus that will recover all damage they have sustained, and provide healthy boost to their stats. A single viral monster can potentially wipe out your party without either careful planning, or a quick escape! The toughest monsters in each dungeon, fortunately will not actively chase you if you don't want to fight them. Seemingly sure of their superiority and unconcerned with your insignificance, 'Risky Monsters' will ignore your existence unless you actively engage them.Outside of the combat system, the game has fully fleshed out shops with new weapons and armour regularly added. But besides that, the player has the ability to add items to the store through the Remake system. The Remake system is this game's version of crafting, which, as you'd expect allows you to craft items of all varieties including, but not limited to consumables, weapons, armour and costumes. But you can also use the Remake system to, with the right materials, alter the game's difficulty (easier or harder), manipulate which items drop in which dungeons, or even create new dungeons and quests altogether, should you have obtained the required Plan(s) to do so. Some of the harder side dungeons, which are difficult well beyond that of the story dungeons as well as the DLC Colusseum, can add quite a bit of longevity to a playthrough, and into New Game+.At its end, as far as JRPG PC ports go, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 sets the standard. After a little buggy release, the game runs smoothly on PC hardware new and old, supporting a wide variety of resolutions up to 1080p (but not 1200p for my monitor, the dastards!). However, it has a fixed graphics quality setting that looks okay but is about par for the course with what a PS3 or VITA would be capable of. My solitary complaint about the port is that the game does not seem to run in true fullscreen. My screen still goes into sleep mode while the game is running if I have walked away for a few minutes. This might seem like an upside to some, but for me it's a minor annoyance. 8.5/10			"

												The first time I saw this game on Steam I thought: ""WTF is this game"" but I saw it was very positive among the community and fans of that series so I gave it a chance.Well after 72 houers its easily my favorite game right now. Its funny,likeble charcters (Nep is my favorite necause nepgear dont have any lines in this game), Easy combat to learn and master and A LOT of content that keep you playing and if you want even more you should get the DLC which is great if you still want more.The only downside is that we have to wait (and I hope that not for long) for Re:Birth 2 now...Easly one of the best JRPG games on steam and I hope that other companies like squre will learn to listen to thire fans and not throw bad ports to the PC fans.

												To hell with my old review, I can fully stand behind this release now.  Seems like most of the bugs have been worked out, and 1080p is now a supported resolution as well!  If you think you don't need to play this because you played the original on PS3, then think again.  This is a far more complete, more fun and less annoying version of the original.  Although the original's opening theme was much better...  But the biggest selling point for me is that the damned tunnels between lands are gone!  The updated visuals are gorgeous.  The updated gameplay is much more fun (no more gathering four items that magically become all healing and cure items).  There is no $10000 worth of DLC (there are 9 DLC items I believe, a few of which are free).			"

												There’s a kind of poetic irony in remaking a game designed to poke fun at the game industry, considering all the remakes and reboots already flooding shelves. To both its credit and detriment, Re;Birth1 carries that identity struggle throughout. Sometimes the in-jokes and references are spot on, while others fail to critique and instead repeat old mistakes. What could have been a new start for the series instead becomes a merely average role-playing game that just doesn’t fit together completely. It’s lighthearted, and sports some fun, giant-anime-weapon battles, but its lack of challenge causes it to grow stale quickly.The best part of the Hyperdimension Neptunia games is inarguably the concept: Four goddesses, each representing a different game system, are waging a “Console War” against one another in a cutesy, high-octane anime fashion. Following this idea, Re;Birth1 is filled with meta, fourth wall-breaking humor, and a good bit of charming self-awareness. Pretty much every character and party member you encounter along the way fits into some sort of anime or gaming archetype — Neptune, who represents the fourth (imaginary) console, is the high-energy, childlike protagonist, while Iffy is a smart tsundere who can get quite flustered at times — and Re;Birth1 actually does a good job of balancing character versus caricature. That's about where ""good balance"" ends, however.One cheeky addition along the same self-aware vein is the “remake” system, which changes aspects of dungeons like enemy difficulty and the types of items that appear. It’s good in theory , but in practice, it’s not all that fun to go through old dungeons again just to get new items. I didn’t think grinding was at all necessary, either, so “remaking” a dungeon to increase the challenge didn’t make a whole lot of sense.Grinding is made unnecessary, by the way, due to the relative ease of combat. It’s of the basic turn-based, open-movement variety, and I found it functional, yet underwhelming. The only strategy I really needed was to have my healer heal between attacks and kind of brute force my way through things, though a few harder fights were more satisfying. A partnering system that allows one party member to loan her battle perks to another while staying out of harm’s way adds another dimension to battle, but it’s not really necessary, and ultimately, it just made battles easier, not more exciting.The story and dialogue both suffer from the same identity problems that permeate every other aspect of Re;Birth1, being simultaneously irritating and endearing at times. If a monster was clearly too hard for the area, I realized it before the characters sassily pointed it out, and I don’t need a dozen mentions of the word “tsundere” to realize which characters fit the archetype. Again, the ideas were there, but they were either too shallow or too frequent, rendering them moot. But I also found it adorable and loved playing as a group of dorky girls, at least for a while.

												Extremely grind intensive and a really bad UI that takes a lot of getting used to.Also I find Compa rather annoying and the combat to be a bit tedious and lackluster. The miss chance also seems to be based on positioning and timing rather than any actual RNG. RNG takes over the item drop system, which is even more tiresome. The fact we have to grind out for hours just to beat the first boss of the game after reaching her in under an hour makes this leave a bitter dissatisfaction on my palette.			"

												Note: This is not a Visual Novel, so those who are complaining about it being a VN before getting at least 20 minutes into the game still don't know that it's just really long dialogue, which isn't that bad imo if you like a lot of weeb crap.The game works like a Visual Novel to tell the story, but everything is old-school JRPJ. Grind, Buy Items, do quests all day until you reach level *999 if you have the dlc.*FAQ:Is there any real seriousness in this game? nah.Do you have to buy the DLC? nah.Is the DLC worth it? If you can't afford 99 cent DLC that are 51% off (except for ""Additional Content1"" during the time of this review then I don't even know how you can afford an internet connection bill each month. You're buying overpowered characters and raising your level cap, similar to that of Borderlands 2/TPS but for two quarters each up to a dollar when the sale ends.Does the game crash alot? It depends on the pc. I've had no problems thus far.Is the game worth at full price? Yes, on the PS3/Vita or if you miraculously don't have crashing problems or have a 1600x900 monitor or smaller.Max res? 1600x900.AA? No AA.FXAA? No FXAA.Why is this game worth it?

												Just finished this, and have to say it was a pleasant surprise. A really fun, cute, and lighthearted story, likable characters, and an okay combat system. The combat felt like the weakest part of the game I admit, and at times the game relies too much on level grinding and enemies with cheap attacks. In addition, I noticed the game was guilty of re-using dungeons, just with a new enemies. However, the story kept me playing, as I mentioned, a lot of silly, entertaining dialogue and a great tongue in cheek look at video games. Overall, very enjoyable, and it made me a fan of the series. Well reccomended for fans of moe or those looking for a light JRPG.			"

												So, after almost 21 hours, I can safely say: Yes, fun has been had so far. Completely new to the Hyperdimension Neptunia games, it is quite enjoyable. However, it is a port. Without a controller, the controls definately take getting used to, and rebinding helps a great deal. I personally switched right bumper to E, and changed the Y button to J. That solved most of my issues, control-wise. The game content itself is enjoyable, adorable, and contains moe breast fanservice. The characters are adorable. Although, I will say I went directly to the DLC from the very beginning, because I got the game nearly immediately. Had a few issues with glitches early on, but glitches were quickly taken care of. And as far as that goes, as a first look, it's been enjoyed.			"

												This game is Funny as hell! it has a nice story and i would recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs!!!The only problem i had with this game is that you need to grind a lot! And this eats up time that you could be spending on playing the story line... But other than that AWESOME game!!!!			"

												Its a very japanese cute anime moe RPG. You know, anime chicks with chirpy voices and jiggling♥♥♥♥♥♥in tiny elaborate costumes wielding huge weaponry (giant syringe FTW). Full English and Japanese voice, subtitles and decent although most is not really animated art. The animated art battles are cool, if you like seeing scantily clad chicks do the traditional jump up in the air summon weaponry and fight anime battles. It feels very JRPG consoley. Run around on a giant map, hit enemies or they hit you and a battle starts. Battles are turn based with the ability to run around and choose attacks, and the plot is incomprehesible about some game-land where there are 4 goddesses, one of which gets ganged up on and booted out down to the land where the mortals are, where she is rescued by another jiggly chirpy girl. But youre not here for the plot. If you're an otaku fanboy looking for your waifu, or you're a weeaboo, you'll love this game. I'm not so sure on my end, cuz I'm not really into the whole scantily clad anime female fighting other scantily clad females as the♥♥♥♥♥♥jiggle away.But for what it is, and for people that are into it, its good. So I'm not rating it down, with the caveat it is VERY japanese and VERY anime moe RPG. If youre into that, you could do way worse than get this game. If youre not, the chirpy voices and fanservice will annoy you quickly.			"

												Definitelly an amazing game. Took me hours to complete it, but I loved every bit of it. It's half a rpg and half a visual novel. It kinda lacks in viarity in creature and section designs, but definitelly doesn't lack in character hat and dress types. And boobs. Cannot forget the boobs.The game is funny and has funny characters all around. And it even makes fun of the average tropes and cliches of JRPGs, which I find very amusing. There's sexual innuendos as well, but they are rather lighthearted ones. Which I didn't mind later on into the game. The story is kinda lacking in my opinion, though. There could be so much more.Gameplay is fun. It's turn based where you can move around in a area, but it has very little strategy. You just try and smash the enemy as much and as quickly as you can until it drops dead. To add more, there are various sections which can be used to power level really fast. So the story quests should go rather easy if you find out the mosnters that give pleanty of exp and are rather easy to kill with HDD'd ladies (spoiler: yeah, the universe revolves all around technology, specifically computer and computer games. So there's a lot of 4th wall breaking). If you bought all of the dlc, getting to level 999 is quite a trip. Even then though, you can just power level in a few hours of hardcore grinding.Honestly, the game is mostly all story, character design and hats, hats and more hats for ladies and their HDD's. Gameplay is fun if you like turn based, brainless smashing and big numbers, lots of grinding, and badges/collectables. I'm not complaining, as I kinda like that. But you should think twice if you dislike any of these things I mentioned, because the game's quite expensive. I'd suggest buying it at a discount unless you are a hardcore fan of the series or you imagine yourself loving the game/series.			"

I feel like I'm the only one, but this is a fun game that pokes at all the big consoles in the land of 'Gamindustri'. 10/10 would alt+tab again.			"

												Note: This is not a Visual Novel, so those who are complaining about it being a VN before getting at least 20 minutes into the game still don't know that it's just really long dialogue, which isn't that bad imo if you like a lot of weeb crap.The game works like a Visual Novel to tell the story, but everything is old-school JRPJ. Grind, Buy Items, do quests all day until you reach level *999 if you have the dlc.*FAQ:Is there any real seriousness in this game? nah.Do you have to buy the DLC? nah.Is the DLC worth it? If you can't afford 99 cent DLC that are 51% off (except for ""Additional Content1"" during the time of this review then I don't even know how you can afford an internet connection bill each month. You're buying overpowered characters and raising your level cap, similar to that of Borderlands 2/TPS but for two quarters each up to a dollar when the sale ends.Does the game crash alot? It depends on the pc. I've had no problems thus far.Is the game worth at full price? Yes, on the PS3/Vita or if you miraculously don't have crashing problems or have a 1600x900 monitor or smaller.Max res? 1600x900.AA? No AA.FXAA? No FXAA.Why is this game worth it? Boobs and semi-adorable/sexy dialogue.			"

												If you know what Neptunia is you don't need to read much of thisContrary to other recommendations hereThere are no realtime physics in this game despite what you might expectContent could be longer; story is shorter than I expected.Combat is a novel mix, reminds me of both turn-based like FF-X and strategic-realtime action like FF-XIIIGraphics could have been enhanced more - it still looks like it came off the PS Vita (which it did.)Music is a mixed bag. There are some individually nice tracks, some ear-worms, but as a whole the problem is a lack of coherency. It's mostly digitalized in nature as expected of the theme, but ... it just doesn't come together, especially if you go through the Audio Museum all at once. On another note some of the tracks have some really peculiar names.References: nep-nep/nowa-nowa			"

												Grindy. As in, hella grindy, but still fairly enjoyable.If this is your first nep game (as it was mine) you can easily pick it up from the start and not feel like you've missed anything story-wise. Gameplay is fairly simple even for someone new to turn-based RPGs. The humor of the game can feel beaten-in after a while, but all in all was still pretty good. As far as the content of the game, admittedly its a lot of copy and paste. Most of the dungeons and enemies are just reskins from earlier parts of the game. The characters are cute, and the animations for the EXE or SP moves can be interesting to watch the first few times. There's an offer of replayability thanks to some materials being limited to only be obtained once per playthrough, so if you wish to unlock everything in the game, you'll be playing through it multiple times.Its also worth noting, to those new to the series/JRPGs, Neptunia is basically a hybrid between an RPG and a Visual Novel. In my experience with the game, about 50% of my time was spent reading text (don't use the english dub, its awful), and the other 50% was wandering dungeons and killing mobs, until the second playthrough came and I was instead grinding mobs for specific materials.Even though the game has clear negative points, it must be doing something right to have kept me entertained for over 60 hours.

												One of my best favorite franchise in either game, anime, and manga, this game offer a good graphic JRPG Anime style. This is one of the most well-known franchise of Idea Factory that offer so many aspect and feature toward JRPG and Anime Lover. Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 is the true beginning of the story line in the whole franchise (I strongly advise you to play this game first before to know the whole plot).Pros:- Astonishing cute character development- Dungeon design looks fabulous- Great Soundtrack- Fascinating DLC (Especially DLC Character MUST BUY!)- Light Atmosphere story (Very Relaxing)- Challenging Enemies and Side Quest- Offer 2 different endings- Character customization is very vary (From Weapon, Skill, Armor, Accessories, and Clothes)- Transformable character are present making a potent hero in a serious battle- 2 languages available (English and Japanese)- Has a secret character- So many playable character- Various combo mechanism- Featured a Lily Rank system (Boost up the power of ""Paired Character"")- Unlimited leveling capacity (Can up to Lv.300)- Visual Novel Animation is very good- Variety of CG gallery- Unique battle system (Turn Based Movement Battle)- Hilarious conversation- Various parody element presentsCons:- Skills in every character is quite few- Has no real Open World system, it is more dungeon oriented game (Quite different by other most JRPG games)- The dungeon offer no other elements, except enemy, treasure, save point and area exploration (Which very standard and not unique at all)- Skill development is decent (no unique at all)- Very level and equipment dependent, so if your level and your equipment is great enough you can easily defeat almost all enemies in the game and that is quite boring (not really strategic and challenging)Overall this game is a masterpiece for the beginning of it's franchise, I highly recommend this game for Anime lover, RPG fan, and visual novel lover. I actually loved this franchise so much, especially the beginning one. Keep up the good work Ideal Factory and please keep adding your Neptunia series (with new content is better) on Steam, I gladly support you! XD			"

												I have three chapters left in this game, but I think I've played enough to say, GET IT NOW, or at least as soon as possible.  If you don't mind grinding, this game has the perfect amount of everything that any anime has ever had.  The story is hilarious.  Most of the cutscenes are told in VN form, but the few CGs are pretty good.  Also, I will say that I HATE dlc.  If it doesn't add anything significant (like skins and such) I personally despise it especially if it cost more than .50, but this is one of the few games where I will say BUY ALL THE DLC.  The two character DLCs are AMAZING.  One of them is a kawaii girl and the other is a flat chested boxer.  Both are very powerful, but not too OP that you can use them the entire game without a challenge.  I highly recommend you buy this game.  It is amazingly fun.  The only problem I would say is that the Mouse and Keyboard controls suck.  Play with a contoller.			"

												Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1, I love this game. I haven't played any of the previous installments of this series, but I personally do not feel like I'm missing out on anything.Pros:Witty and comical humor! (Nep-Nep makes this game great)Fun and intersting combatThe game delivers what a jrpg is - grinding levels (I enjoy constant battles to increase my characters levels and power)The story is actually fun to followSo many outfits to choose from!Cons:Because of the constant need to grind, the game doesn't feel as large as it should. Your time spent is in the same dungeons over and over.Lack of in-depth character customization (I didn't really expect this game to have it, but it would have been nice to have just a little more variety.The game is fun and if you enjoy jrpg this title is right up your alley. I own the other Neptunia games on Steam as well now because of this game and I expect the series only gets better. "

												Okay so, I LOVE the JRPG genre of games. The first I played ever was Kingdom Hearts, later on lead me to try Final Fantasy and much more. Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a remake of the original on PS3, you can also buy this game on PS Vita too. So what to expect from this game? LOTS! Firstly there is tons to do in this game in terms of quests, items, unlockables, and I have at this time of the review have only gotten near the ending of the first visit to Lowee. The game is full of laughs and for those who are dub watchers(don't worry, you can switch between sub and dub so EVERYONE BE HAPPY). Neptune the main character is well... a bit of a happy airhead who loves to break the 4th wall more than Deadpool ever did. To sum up the universe it takes place in(Gameindustri), its the personification of the game console wars we have irl(example PlayStation vs. Xbox vs. Nintendo vs. Sega). However its a typical turn based RPG with TONS of action and its quite fun. You will pick up on tons of references of other popular games like Zelda(""Its dangerous to go alone, take Nep!"") and even Final Fantasy(Pay attention to what she will say or sing when she levels up, you will get the reference). The game during the sale was about $3 and DLC's are reasonable, I believe on PlayStation Vita with PS Plus you can get it that price year round and also recieve the 2nd remake for the same price. All in all this is a great way to be introduced to the series and I DEFINATELY recommend. A solid 8/10 ""One of the best Neppin JRPGS you will play!""			"

												This game is the ultimate fourth wall break. It seems to me that some people who gave it a bad review don't get the point of this game. No one ever played Hyperdimension Neptunia for the gameplay. You spend a lot of time with grinding in dungeons full of weak enemies just to be able to defeat the next boss monster, because it took you down with two attacks earlier. Allthough the special attacks look pretty cool, the point of this game is that the dialogues are very funny and keep breaking the 4th wall constantly.So, if you want to play a game with good gameplay or great storytelling, play something else, but don't give such a great game bad reviews because you had the wrong expectations. If you look for something to laugh, buy it and have fun.			"
