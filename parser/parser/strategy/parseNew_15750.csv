												The Stranger won't play by your rules, pardner.A fascinating little game that actively refuses to be pinned down. It's a third-person FPS, but not really, because you are usually shooting tools rather than bullets. It's a personal story of a bounty hunter who's only in it for the money, except when it absolutely isn't. It's a methodical game of eliminating enemies with stealth and cunning – whenever it doesn't happen to be a game about massive explosions. Not even the tutorial seems to grasp quite what this is. Odd, but sort of brilliant at the same time.			"

												This game quickly became a stapple of my childhood back on the original xbox. I remember waking up early before school and playing before the day had even begun. Its a fantastic blend between 1st and 3rd person view that no other game has seemed to capture.  It looks great and plays even better for its age. And the crude, dark humor really makes it a part of the Oddworld universe. I will never forget my first runthrough of this game. One of my top five games of all time, hands down.Buy it.			"

												As someone who missed this game when it came to the original XBOX, this was my first time playing it and I must say it is fantastic! When comparing this HD version to the original, you can see that this is one of the best remastered jobs out there. The game still looks very good by today's standards with all the settings cranked up (via Nvidia Control Panel).This game also has one of the most innovative mechanics I've come across in a while: live ammo. You must hunt your ammo. This is a really cool twist and the ammo variety is quite great. The bounty system in the first half of the game is really fun and the second half succeeds as an action game as well. The blend of third/first person is also done particularly well.It's hard for me to really have any complaints witht this game. I was just surprised at how much fun I had playing it. If you missed it the first time or even played the original, I highly highly reccomend picking this title up. Here's hoping a sequel can eventually be made to expound on this Wild West gem.			"

												I use to see this game a lot at the video store as a kid and it really intrigued me but not enough to hire it out, never really gave it solid try and I regreted that decision until now. Thoroughly enjoyed playing this game in its entirety, the Oddworld universe is represented extremely well in this game with its dry humor and incredibly dark setting. There is not much of a connection between Strangers Wrath and the other Oddworld games beyond small refernces to products manufactured by the Glukkons and Vykkers (Bad guys in the previous games) spread throughout the Mongo Valley, but this detachment from the other games is not a bad thing as it gave the game an ability to explore more of the Oddworld universe and what inhabits it.Some bad things about the game, well the actual story and gameplay was enjoyable and the PC port controls were really smooth but trying to get a controller working on my end was an extreme pain so I just gave up.  The soundtrack was freaking radical, whenever the tunes started it really helped set the scene but the downside to this was the music sometimes bugged and stopped playing for me! In short if you can't be bothered reading whats above (Sounds better in my head). I really recommend you get this game if you are a fan of the Oddworld and its dark setting. If you just found the first two games a pain in the egg to complete this is a refreshing ride.[8.5/10]			"

												The gameplay was surprisingly good and offers a unique experience.  The graphics and environment offered a unique experience that would be expected from an Oddworld game.  Fair warning to those with AMD machines, as I ran into some pretty annoying bugs that caused me to crash to desktop multiple times, and I found others with similar machines had the same problem.  If you can put up with this small annoyance, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. [9/10]			"

Well what's more incredible is that this game fluidly, equally, and seemlessly blends both third person and first person gameplay in a hilarious, epic story about a badass bounty hunter. But there's more about this bounty hunter than meets the eye. This game was made when people still cared about making GOOD games  instead of cash grabs and you'll love it.

												This game is an adventure / FPS hybrid. You switch between the modes as you explore the strange Oddworld landscape. So you would do some jumping puzzles and then blast away the enemies with your crossbow. The crossbow is powered by live animals which you pick up as you travel along. You can pick up stingbees that rapidly fire at the enemies or spiders that web them and many more. The mechanic is a bit bulky because you constantly have to switch between 3rd and 1st person. The world itself is beautiful with various landscapes from forests to deserts to icy tundras and mechanical fortresses. It's a very fun game but a bit frustrating sometimes even on normal difficulty. The battle before the final boss was pretty ridiculous with enemies chain stunning you so you have no chance to survive (except luck). I would still recommend this. 7/10			"

												Stranger's Wrath is an interesting shooter slash third person game to say the least. You take on the roll of a mysterious bounty hunter named Stranger who is trying to gather 20 000 Moolah for a surgery he says he ""needs to survive"" but not more is said in the beginning of the game. He hates guns, and uses nothing but his crossbow on his hand with unusual live ammo like Fuzzles and Bolamites. PROS:unique game style+- 13 hour gameplay (on hard)Great visuals(I have to put this in) The way Stranger sprintsCONS:Most non-story achievements are brokenGame can be glitchy (in the end levels for me)CONCLUSION:Stranger's Wrath is an awesome game for anyone looking for something different in the FPS genre and just need a break from typical shooters. While the mechanics between first person and third are unsure what the game is supposed to be, they work together well enough to make the game enjoyable8/10 Silky Drawers			"

												Beware users of Intel drivers, this game will immediately crash under many circumstances. Mine happened to occur after the Oddworld Inhabitants logo came and left, leaving me with an error stating the Game Has Stopped Working. After doing some research, it appears that this port of OSW from Just Add Water (JAW) has only recieved one patch since this whole debacle started about a year ago, and since then, nothing from what i can tell. They seem content with leaving this game behind, with numerous issues, as the only dev comment I've seen on my particular issue was roughly eight months ago.Other frequent issues I've seen thoughout my research include:-Crashes occuring in the tutorial level-Game succeeding in loading main menu to only show a black screen.-Instances where Stranger does not move-Taxing on graphics cards. Possibly poorly optimisedThis is all extrememely disappointing as the game was a classic from 3 console generations past, and probably one of my favorite games ever made. This makes the fact that I will be contacting Steam for my money back, much more aggrivating.If you must own this game, check out it's offering on GoG.com, as I have heard that they include the non-HD version of the game with the HD port, and I've heard that this may run better. Or, if you have a console that this port was re-released on, buy there. I've not seen issues for those ports.Support Oddworld Inhabitants by buying their stuff directly, such as their recently released OST for Strangers Wrath. Please do not support JAW, or at the very least, don't support their PC endeavors by buying this port. The port is utter trash that it will only work for some of the people who paid for it, and JAW is as well for not stepping up to fix their problems, and leaving a classic like this in such a horrible state.

												[8/10] - Just Add Water's console-to-PC port reawakens the 2005 Xbox release with better visuals, audio, and stability on the PC... for the most part. Stranger's Wrath is a fairly straight-forward action/adventure strategy game that introduces a unique gameplay mechanic where your ammo consists of tiny creatures each with a distinct ability to distract, devour, and destroy your enemies. The game allows you to seamlessly alternate between a third-person view for ease of mobility, and a first-person view for shooting the critters at foes and obstacles. Every level brings on a diverse challenge that can be approached differently each time and delivers enjoyable boss fights that can be demanding enough to make you rethink your strategy. The story is interesting and comical and introduces twists and turns that completely change the atmosphere of the game without going too far out into the bizzare. It IS an oddworld, after all.On the downside, Stranger's Wrath suffers from some aggravating glitches and performance flaws that remind you of the horrors that follow game ports. Issues such as loading errors, frame-rate drop, achievements not unlocking, textures missing, and incorrect subtitles are littered throughout the game. Stranger, the protagonist, has poor voice acting and every creature of the same species has the SAME voice-over which easily breaks the personality of the subservient characters, and diminishes the quality of the game itself. There is not much progression other than unlocking unique ammo and some minor upgrades. Most of the more interesting unlocks are not revealed until much later in the game, but at that point it really starts get a lot more exciting and fun.Overall, I found the game to be satisfying to the end. Playing on hard and attempting to capture the enemies alive rather than dead makes the game challenging, but not at all frustrating. With a little patience to tolerate the technical flaws, Stranger's Wrath can be a very enjoyable experience. Out of all the games included in the Oddbox anthology, this one is by far the best out of the four.			"

												Stranger's Wrath is a really mindblowing and innovating game. Being 11 years old it still hold gameplay and mechanics, that are solid to this day. This game was so far ahead of its time.As a player you will get a huge amount of content, a huge variety of ammo and loads of different ways to complete the levels. You play as a bounty hunter and you are equipped with a crossbow, that uses ammo in forms of critters that you hunt. That means you shoot down bad guys with spiders, fuzzles or even bats! You choose yourself how you will deploy this ammo, as they all has their own purpose; wrap them in web, deploy as a living mine or shoot a living skunk that makes the enemy throw up. The games really leaves you with a whole lot of choices. You even get to decide if you want to kill the bandits, or catch them alive for a bigger bounty.The enviroment is great and I don't usually like deserts, but I found this one fun and exciting. It was in no way empty. As the game progress you are taken from the desert to the forest, temples, jungles and even more places, so the scenery constantly changes, with a lot of lore and detail, which keeps the player constantly occupied. Together with a lot of content and challenges, this really wraps up a good experience. I found to have ZERO problems playing this game and had no crashes at all. I was even surprised of how well and good the control and camera were. I felt it was made for PC. I did experience only getting the 'Easy'-achievement, even though I finished it on 'Hard'. All other achivements worked and I am sure this is not a common thing. The Achievements are fun and interesting to complete. They are realistic, but hard, so I would recommend doing them. Fun and a good challenge.For people who played the previous Oddworld games: You are in for a treat! Even though Abe and Munch is far away and not present, the keen eye will spot references and items from RuptureFarms and such. Even some of the wildlife that lives in these parts, also exists in Abe's part of Oddworld. The two are woven good together and the old-school fan will surely feel some nostalgia when noticing those things. The story is as always extremely good and really reflects on things from our real world. The game has a great message that is delivered with an awesome storytelling and interesting gameplay.This game's mechanics and content easily beats todays big games. They have always been very creative, the guys behind these games. The game is also very re-playable, which games rarely are.9.5/10*Would have been 10 if the Hard-achievement had worked for me. "

Teal DeerDevelopers: Oddworld Inhabitants Publishers: Oddworld Inhabitants Initial release: Dec 2010Genre: FPS, Action#Worth/NotWorth: #CautionAdvisedExposition, Concurrence and SummationWARNING: Contains live ammunitionOddworld: Strangers Wrath is quite a departure from the previous Oddworld games. No side scrolling or rescuing other inhabitants. Well, not in the same way at least. In Strangers Wrath, you play as a bounty hunter and for most intents and purposes his name is stranger. Early on it is established he desires a surgery (to live). It is left ambiguous why exactly. As a bounty hunter you have the ability to switch between first and third person camera views. In first person mode you have a crossbow; You have different sorts of ammunition used for various purposes. Some examples would be laying traps, stunning, doing heavy damage and immobilization. The thing is is that the ammunition is live. No no, actually alive. They are animals and insects you are firing. You even must hunt them yourself. Though you can buy them from the general store should you desire. Your base ammo, the one that is always there (as in infinite) is zapflies which also have the ability to charge if you hold (as in stop firing) for a bit. Which gives you the ability to always deal some damage as well as stun should you completely run out of ammo. Since you have a lot of options when it comes to ammo, you also have the ability to capture enemies alive as well as bounties. With the difference being more moolah (the actual name of the currency in game) To be spent at the store on ammo and more upgrades like faster regen for stamina, clip extenders and overall more stamina. Stranger is rather impervious to damage (relatively) he actually can die very easily however he can literally just shake and the damage is taken away. With the exchange being stamina; So it's important to keep track of. Now, the reason I don't outright recommend this game is after a narrative twist the game has a sudden difficulty spike I wasn't terribly fond of; suddenly favoring capturing enemies alive as the more effective option rather than the more difficult one with higher reward. Also your ammo bags have been reduced (if you got them) but now capturing enemies restores ammo. It's a weird switch that I don't think everyone will be okay with especially if you were really enjoying the game loop before the twist.THE GIST The HD retexture is much appreciated. The game looks and plays very smoothly. However the difficulty spike won't appease everyone. Much to my chagrin.Follow my curation for more "

												Oddworld: Stranger's Whrath HD is a first/third person game. You are a bounty hunter who works his way up from capturing and turning in wanted criminals for Moolah. The reason why is becasue he needs an operation quickly but it costs 20,000 Moolah. You play a character simply called Stranger who uses like ammo to trap his enemies which is the only way you can turn them in.+ The game looks great and live, throughout the game every place looks great and diffrent which keeps you intrested. The option menu is good since there is alot of diffrent options for the grathics so most computers can run the game. + Storyline works well and since you will get paid differently depending whether you capture them dead or alive, but of course its harder to capture them alive bt you will get paid more. You also get to choose what bounty you want to go get which give you more freedom.+ There is a good length in this game since its around 10 hours on easy, 12 hours on medium and 15 hours on hard. This a good amount of time, you will get more time if you try to bounty everyone and explore the surroundings thoughout the game.+ Stranger's Wrath can be a hard game at times, first few hours are fine but then it starts getting alot harder and you will die alot at some points in the game. Its at a good level of difficulty since its not too hard that you want to give up, the game will make you want to get though the hard parts which makes it very rewarding when you get though it.+ The controls are good and work well with the keyboard and mouse, you can also change the keys to what ever you would like which is great since they can be changed to your liking. Only problem is that Stranger's Wrath does not have controller support.+ The music is great, it fits perfectly and does not get boring or repetitive. The music mainly plays when your exploring or when your fighting bosses, this works well because it really fits in with the mood of the scene. You can get the soundtrack from the Oddworld website for free.+ Having Steam Achievements and a good story means that there are some Replayability in the game since you can go back to complete all the achievements or just play th egame again. There is not much but there is enough.+ Stranger's Wrath is ten years old now. The HD edition is now five years old. It still holds up and looks good to this day. I dont think it will look outdated in some time now.- The PC port is bad! Really bad. Most computer will be able to run the game but the main problem is that the frame rate is always really low... I get around 25 to 30 on a R9 280X. It you want the game then be prepared.- For some reason Stranger's Wrath HD is really buggy, the original game isnt but this is. There are lots of bugs and some of them are game breaking. Since they dont update the game anymore you will have to put up with it... Real shame is I love the Oddworld franchise.Overall I would say Stranger's Wrath HD is a great and fun game that most people will like. Its original and diffrent which is whats great about Oddworld. I rate Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD an 8 out of 10. I would recommend the game if you can put up with the port and the bugs.			"

												Overall it's a very good game, first played it back when it was released on the Xbox and I loved it then and I still love it now. I will not be giving away any spoilers because it's a game that everyone should play at least once, when I first picked up this game on Steam the only achievements were to get the bounties and now they added more and I think that’s great to see. However hearing people complain about that some achievements are broken does confuse me because all of them but one worked fine for me, The one that is broken for me is Sekto Suicide (at the time of writing this review) I went through the entire game three times (on each difficulty) and I earned the correct achievements for each difficulty, But when finishing it on hard mode to find out it's broken did♥♥♥♥♥♥me off a little bit but still does not hurt my love for this game and Oddworld games as a overall. I would give the game 9/10 only because like I said at the time of writing this people are having problems with earning achievements. If it ever gets fixed then change that nine to a ten!

Bounty huntin' platformer that's mostly a first-person shooter where your only real weapon is a crossbow that only fires living ammunition. There's a third person perspective but I only really found myself using that perspective for travelling and checking from behind cover. It ain't a traditional Oddworld game though it does take place in the same universe.Each town you go to has a bounty you can take to earn moolah which can be used to get yourself some upgrades or other possibly useful items. Each bounty or boss aren't entirely unique to one another though there can be an enjoyment had in each of 'em. After a town's been exhausted of its bounties you move on to travel to another town with bounties you can accept. Finding your next objective for the most part isn't always obvious or pointed out either. Directions are generally figured out by talking to townsfolk. Each type of ammo is used strategically whether you're planning on being sneaky or just straight up running in firing hornets at full auto, taking in baddies dead or alive, it's up to you.The stealth isn't very in-depth so learning from and manipulating it to your advantage shouldn't be very difficult especially since the AI can be as dumb as the characters they portray.

												Stranger's Wrath, (or for that matter, pretty much any Oddworld game) I have too much respect for. This game's art style and play style is astounding and I just can't give it enough applause. My favorite thing to do within the game is beating the poo out of Redneck-Chicken-People until they flip out and run into their houses, eventually they'll call you a ""P-e-c-k-e-r"" and start shooting at you. Anyway, I've had this game on the original Xbox since I was a wee little child and I just LOVE it. They have remastered the entire thing in HD and it looks amazing, I HIGHLY recommend this game more than any other game on steam, please get it... Seriously.. Get it now... You P-e-c-k-e-r.			"

												Have you ever wanted to step into the boots of a stone cold bounty hunter bringing in criminals and making piles of cash? Then this might just be the game for you. Oh and it takes place on an alien world where everything is crazy too.This game is great fun; it starts off a little slow but once it gets rolling you will have a hard time putting it down. Set in oddworld you know it’s going to be crazy. Every mission and town you go through has its own little narrative and everything seems to be an adventure all culminating in an epic tale of vengeance and surgery…..yes.I loved the bounty system, it’s one of my favourite things in any game and in this one it’s great. Take people in alive and get paid more money, even bosses can be brought in alive. It just adds another layer of challenge to the title. Something about collecting them all drove me to obsession.The story and world are obviously fantastic, neither are expanded on greatly but they add a sense that there is a lot more going on in the world around you and you are just carving your way through a very tiny part of it. The character you portray is a man of few words and that just adds to the mystery of who he is and what he wants.Now we talk about the weapon, you only get one but with the HUGE amount of ammo (living critters you catch and shoot at bad guys) you will not be disappointed. It is one of the most unique weapons I have used in any game and with all the upgrades you can get throughout the adventure it always seems new and fresh.The combat is fast paced and seamlessly switches from third person fighter to first person shooter. Both have their place and neither feels tacked on. There are tons of environments to explore and fight in and so many enemies to kill or capture each with their own personality. And the difficulty could be pretty brutal in places.I would recommend this game if you have a few hours to spare and want to get taken into a world that’s more crazy and odd than most. The npc’s are huge chickens for gods sake. On sale you have to have this.Have Fun ^_^ "

												In Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, you will fill the boots of a strange, otherwise mysterious bounty hunter who tracks down villains and outlaws for ""moolah"" -- Wild West Wanted-Dead-or-Alive style. You'll explore a grand world of frontiers ranging from old Western towns, uninhabited wildernesses and some more modern type industrialized compounds. The game allows you to play in either third person or first person mode where third person view will be used mostly for exploration and first person mode for when it gets down to action and combat. The main character’s name is Stranger and he needs to raise money for a medical procedure he must undergo in order to survive. Stranger will go from town to town through forests and wildernesses, capturing outlaws and fighting his way through mob syndicates...all in the duty of the bounty assignments he receives from the local Bounty Store.The only weapon Stranger carries is a modified crossbow strapped to his forearm. This is a mean weapon and its ammunition is actual living creatures and critters which he harvests from the environment. There are plenty of it crawling and bouncing around. This unique ammunition is also upgraded as the game progresses through its various levels which in turn is a good thing, a very good thing, because crime bosses become extremely difficult to take down later in the game, especially on hard difficulty settings. Other in-game role-playing elements include amour storage upgrades and knuckle dusters.Doing bounty hunts might start to feel repetitive later on in the game and the pattern rather predictable, but the story takes a spin towards something different and totally unexpected. The story. That is essentially what distinguishes the guys at Oddworld Inhabitants from the rest. Their story telling technique. To me, personally, Oddworld's games are treasures. I first played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on PC back in 2000 and then later during 2006 I played Stranger's Wrath (maiden release) for the first time on console. The upgraded port of Stranger's Wrath, namely the HD version was first announced in 2010 for release on PC and PlayStation 3, developed by Just Add Water and is one of the more distinctive games released from the ""old"" generation. It's entertaining and fun, story rich, beautiful in HD and demonstrates the passion and love you get from the Oddworld Universe. I'm Odd... I recommend this game!			"

I'm not saying the game sucks, I love Oddworld games and I'm sure this game is as good as the others I'm just warning you guys so you don't make the same mistake I did. Whatever Happens make sure to check the community discussions there is a chance that the developers might fix this...a small one...as you can see I've been hoping for that for a long time now...take care.

												I would very much like to recommend this game. I certainly can recommend the game itself, for it is an amazing game. An underrated hidden gem when it was first released. But this port is dreadful. My PC has the capabilities to run far more demanding games, such as Skyrim, but somehow falls flat when trying to run a game that was released on the original xbox. When I purchase a game I expect it to run perfectly, as advertised, without me having to fiddle around within the depths of its folders or what not. This does not run perfectly. It is unplayable in its current state. The game will constantly freeze for periods of increasing length the longer you play; the longest being at least 20 seconds. I have only managed to trudge through this to the end of the tutorial until it becomes unbareable. This was a waste of my money, and that's so disappointing to hear myself say as I love the Oddworld series and was willing to support them, but this is simply unplayable. I am yet to find any solution to this problem, if there even is one. I should have just whipped out my old xbox and found an original copy, rather then gamble on a HD remake.			"

												If you like western shooters with a ♥♥♥♥♥in story and dialogue this game is for you. You play as a Bounty hunter, collecting ammo from the wild that is varied in how it works against your enemies (exploding them vs tying them up vs ect), which are outlaws. Collecting outlaws alive nets you more money than if they're dead but it gets hard to keep them alive in certain situations. There IS an actual story and you progress from town to town, unlocking more ammo types and different outlaws.Plays great, looks great, good story too. Worth every penny.			"

												Out of alle the Oddworld games, Strangers Wrath was always the one I overlooked. Didn't have an original Xbox back in the day and when they released the HD version it was riddled with hella bugs. But now I finally gave it a whirl!Strangers Wrath is a unique blend of 3rd person platforming and 1st person shooting. Most of the game evolves around bountyhunting outlaws, those little bossfights give you room for lethal and even nonlethal approaches which you'll want to do to earn more moolah. True to the universe, the world is hella ...odd, one cool aspect is that the ammo for your gun are living critters which you need to hunt to restock constantly. There are almost a dozen different critters to use to give room for the own preferred playstyle. The game never got boring, allthough the first half until a certain reveal might overstay its welcome a little bit. But what happens leading up to the games end is ridiculous and definitely worth seeing.As expected and reported numerously, Strangers Wrath HD comes with some hefty technical shortcomings. This is as barebones as a PC port can get, I had to fiddle with graphical settings for almost half an hour until I had no strange FPS problems or weird bugs like my character not being able to move forward (Tip: turn vsync on!). There is controller support but it's not good, the game lets you rebind all the buttons but prompts show up as JOY1, JOY2. Fortunately the keyboard+mouse controls are totally fine and give benefits when aiming in first person mode.Strangers Wrath is a really really cool game which combines 3rd person and 1st person action unlike anything I've seen before and ultimately -considering it's over 10 years old at this point- left me very impressed. The world and its characters are exactly what you expect when Lorne Lanning gets to work his magic. Speaking of which, he really should make a new game!			"

												After the apparent shortcomings of Munch's Oddesy, the Oddworld crew wisely decided to invest in creating a new hero for the franchise, something that was fresh and fit well into the 3D scene. Abe never felt like he fit in with a 3D platformer and with Munch being tied to Abe... Stranger was a good alternative to explore Oddworld in a 3D envrioment. It was a risk; and one that payed off in aces. It introduces gameplay mechanics and an immersive story that devs struggle, more often then not, fail in leaps to pull off today. You hunt your bounties with live ammo and it's up to you to decide how to do it, or If you want to chuck the bounties in the slammer or get rid of them for good. The more useful ammo, such as bolimites, fuzzles and chipmunks come up quite freqnetly and is often high in the ammo department, while some of the more damaging creatures are rare. The game does push you towards getting the enemies alive through the abundant ammo of that nature and higher payout, but it's also often a lot harder for that route. Which makes two distinct playstyles and either way, you need to get creative. Bosses are often tough, and require good knowledge of your ammo in order to capture them alive. With the game itself out of the way, lets talk about the port.Many people have seen issues with performance, on my 7970, it runs well and I've never seen a problem. BUT. you need to check if it will run. there are some demanding features, such as grass, which will have in game implications if you're forced to disable them as you might not have any idea you can hide over there for example. The achievements in this game are also borked. they will not save progress if you quit. that is to say, you will bounty 250 bad guys and you won't get rewarded for it unless you either play the game for long enough to get it; or you save and farm quick loads so you can bounty one or two idiots over and over.

												Stranger’s Wrath is a really fun and unique FPS/platformer with a great atmosphere. Instead of guns The Stranger uses a crossbow that fires animals and each animal gives you different ways to approach enemies. The difficulty on Normal is actually well balanced, it’s not punishing but you need to play smart. This falls apart in the last section in the game with a stupid difficulty spike where you have to escape an area before it explodes and right after that is a boss fight with two minibosses that can infinite you to death. I did beat the game but because of this I suggest playing on Easy and save yourself some headache.People seem to have some trouble with crashes and the like, but I didn’t run into any. (Though it still is pretty un-optimized because running on high anti-aliasing drags the FPS down.) Overall though despite any flaws Stranger’s Wrath is a fun game. "

This is the game that made me try out Steam and I think it is a game that everyone should try.

												Ok so first off, BEST FPS I'VE EVER F**KING PLAYED. I played this game as a kid, and i loved it. I think i fell in love with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover! anyways, onto the actual review...""You're the Stranger, a mysterious bounty hunter on a mission to bag the ultimate prize. And you need that money like no one else because there is something very wrong with your health and the only way to fix it is a very costly operation."" Ok so having that goal of (oh no massive spoilers...) 20,000 moolah (yes thats the currency, and yes I know thats epic...) means that you have to resort to becoming a bounty hunter. Now you may think that sounds pretty cool, but think again... it's even better then you could have ever wanted! you are equipped with the Critter Crossbow, (and again it's as epic as it sounds) a crossbow that fires live ammunition, i.e Zappflies, Thudslugs, Stingbees and more! (i think the names are fairly self explanitory there) So equipped with this ammo you set off claiming bounties and slowly earning moolah... but then some stuff happens that if I told you would be incredibly huge spoilers so i won't tell you about them. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who even just vaugly likes FPS games.10/10, would run around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animal again.			"

												Having played this game as a child, replaying it was an interesting experience.The gameplay is unique, with the 2nd/3rd person combination and the 'live' munitions concept, although the whole 'run around and bounty some dude' that makes up the first half of the game feels stale after a while, but it is definately bareable and countered by the variety in environments and various enemy boss fights, which are all individually memorable.The plot and dialogue is actually quite good, it caught me off guard with its witty humour, charm and twists.The graphics in this HD update are reasonable given the games age.The music is a little scarce but fairly fitting for the environment, but the sounds used are something i really couldnt stand. NPCs often repeat quotes over and over again, and weapon noises are the same, making for a frustrating and annoying experience occasionally, most noticable the later portions of the game. The game itself is actually fairly short, being a linear action/adventure game, i finished it up in about 10 hours on hard, and it doesnt offer a tonne of replayability outside of steam achievements, and i noted a problem with the steam achievement system and the games save system with collectables.The game is fairly short, but its definately an entertaining blast and rewarding and memorable to playthrough.

												One of my favorite games of all time. An incredible amount of love and thought went into this, and it's immediately apparent. The originality, humor, gameplay, and meaningful undertones all come together to form an unforgettable experience.This game is simply... fun(ny). You can listen in on the hilarious dialogue of any character, laugh at the attention-♥♥♥♥♥ chipmunk farting on your crossbow and being ""allergic to your ugliness"", lose yourself in Michael Bross' amazing soundtrack, appreciate the truly unique design and setting, punch complacent chickens in the face and steal their money, notice the parallels between harmonious peoples being subverted by industrialism and a people out of allignment with nature; the list goes on. The gameplay is intense and both 1st and 3rd-person views are fluid and change seamlessly. The animal-ammo system is as awesome as it is funny, with each animal serving a specific purpose so you have a lot of options on how you defeat your enemies.Being an Oddworld game, the humor is what you'd expect... It's ♥♥♥♥in' hilarious! There's a lot of unabashed humor and when you really listen to lots of characters, things get funnier. I've never laughed so much from somebody saying ""I like oatmeal"" before. Oddworld's humor always makes me happy, and games that make you laugh this much are doing something very right! It's just so entertaining.Is it original? Well just look at a few screenshots of the game and you'll see there isn't anything out there like it. The characters are interesting, and Stranger (the one you play as) is pretty badass. The environments and music combine to create an other-worldy feel, different yet similar to the previous games, but still of it's own. Originality is an Oddworld staple.The story is good, but I don't want to reveal anything so I'll just say it has heavy environmental undertones. It's in no way preachy, but the connections between native peoples being killed off by a more powerful and ""civilized"" culture is definitely there, and it makes you think. This is a fictionized example of a very real and re-occuring issue in humanity. To me this is the icing on the cake, because not only is this a great game but it promotes a more positive and sustainable direction for humanity; living in harmony with nature and not against it. Since this game has so much sentimental value to me, I don't see many downsides, but other people might. If you're not invested in the story or experience then you might feel the gameplay style gets repetitive, but I think if you invest yourself in it, you'll find more than enough to keep you entertained throughout the game. Just pay attention to some of the aspects of the game mentioned above and hopefully you love it! It doesn't have much replay value unless you find each playthrough a novel and enjoyable experience. If yous liked what ya read, or feel like punching open a stall door and beating a Wolvark to death with your face while he's taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'd probably like this game, ya punkass. I knows I do.

												I played this on original Xbox years ago once and it made me want to play it again.I'll admit, the game is a little strange. You play as a guy named ""The Stranger"" who needs ""moolah"" (money) for an important operation. This game is Wild West themed, which means that the best way for you to make money is to collect bounties for cash. So you're a bounty hunter, collecting the biggest bad guys in the area. You get more money for capturing them alive than you do dead, and the best part is that even the minions can be cashed in.You don't fire guns though. Instead, you are armed with a dual fire crossbow that uses live bait as it's ammo. There are spiders that act as your lasso, bats that act like grenades, bees that act like machine gun rounds, and much more. It's a pretty cool take on the western theme.The world is filled with weird creatures instead of people too. You're some weird like guy that looks like no one else around, the major towns are filled with chicken people (they are really annyoing and have very cliche lines), there are weird native people that are like 2 feet tall, and then there are the bad guys which basically are all the same looking.It's cheesy, weird, annoying at times, but somehow still fun. Definitely an older game. If you can stomach this kind of stuff, it might just be a game for you. My advice if you can't decide whether or not to buy it, find some videos or pictures online of the game and get this game for cheap (like $5).			"

												Strangers Wrath is an interesting game to say the least. It's an FPS platformer that switches regularly from first and third person. What's unique about the game is the main character doesn't use guns. Instead the player uses a crossbow that fires small animals known as ""critters"" that do specific effects on enemies. As a result the game is a lot more stealth based then one might expect from such a title.That isn't to say it's not without it's flaws. It's fairly obvious early on that the game was designed with a child focus. The voice acting is fairly uninteresting and all the characters are portrayed as stereotypical caricatures of typical Old West characters. However it is a very well polished game, especially with it's HD re-release on Steam. Just remember it was originally exclusively an xbox game and as such wasn't designed to use a keyboard. I recommend using a gamepad as a result just so the Third person to first person jumps don't throw you off balance.			"

												I never got to play this on the original Xbox, so I am playing without nostalgia-vision. But I must say, this game is a quirky, unique fun experience. It mixes elements of FPS, third-person platforming, stealth, and action into a different and fun game.  I love the idea of the live ammunition, and each kind proves its uses in different situations. The game adds different elements of play as you progress, adding more thought and fun to the mix.Visually, the game looks pretty good. It's not state of the art graphics, but for a remastered og Xbox game, it looks pretty damn good. Story-wise, Stranger's Wrath has an interesting story about a seemingly selfish protagonist that sees its plot thicken. What really brings the game together is it's Western-style setting. Oddworld is a very fitting name for the setting, but it's a cool one. All in all, Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is a unique genre-bender that proves that other devs should take the risk once in awhile and break the standard format when it comes to making games. And the current sale price makes it a steal! Definitely worth adding to your library.			"

You can go the non-lethal approach which nets you more Bounty. Afterall you're a Bounty Hunter. Worth the purchase.			"

												An Action/Adventure/FPS hybrid from the developer Oddworld Inhabitants and published by Electronic Arts, Stranger's Wrath was a new direction for a franchise which had traditionally consisted of macabre puzzle games starring the character Abe.Stranger's Wrath takes place in a western-inspired world where you play as ""The Stranger"", a bounty hunter who must collect enough money for a life-saving operation via capturing outlaws.What makes this game unique is it's combination of the first and third-person perspectives which gives an interesting opporitunity to combine precise 3D-platforming and first-person gunplay via the use of a crossbow. Instead using conventional ammunition, you collect ""live ammunition"". Small animals that you capture which carry a range of different effects from provoking an enemy to a more convenient location, to blowing them to smithereens.Overall it's a great game which is too often brushed over, and easily worth your time should you have cash to spare.

												IMHO the most underrated Oddworld game out there - I played this game on the original xbox when I was maybe 12-13? Who'da thunk it I'd play it now when I'm 21 years old and still love it just as much as I did back in the day. Aside from the nostalgia factor it really is still a beautiful looking, smooth playing game. You don't just hunt your bountys, but your ammunition as well, giving a whole new meaning to the term FPS.  Laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off when I played it ages ago and still laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off playing it today, I could reecomend this to anyone, you really can't go wrong for 10 moolah, and I'm guessing it will be on sale a few times being an older game and all. By all means pardner start hunting them bountys gettin' that moolah.PS - the fuzzles might look cute but... don't try and pet them			"

												Very awesome, classic game. Very original ideas for the weapon and weapon types. I love it so far and I know it is going to continue to be awesome. Besides a little stuttering that happens sometimes I think only when going to a new area (might be something to do with texture loading), it runs flawlessly at 60fps at 1920x1080, controls are super smooth, and the game is outrageously fun. One of my favorite new games that I wish I would have played a long time ago. I stole this game at $2.50.8.5/10Note:I read through most of the negative reviews and saw that a lot of people have performance issues and crashes, and some can't even play past the intro. I am sorry for their luck because this game is really great. They are probably having problems because they use Windows 7 still or something, I'm not sure. I can report that it runs fine with no crashes for me on a i7 3820 @ 3.6ghz, 16gb ram, gtx 970, windows 10 pro.			"

												I cautiously recommend this game.It's obviously a very big departure from previous games in the series. No followers to rescue, no puzzles to solve, instead it's a surprisingly successful mix of FPS combat and third person action. The first-person third-person mix works really well and the controls are quite good (I played with an xbox controller). The combat can get a bit tedious at points, but overall it works.However the biggest problem of the game is this: the story establishes very early on that your character needs to save up a lot of money. At the same time it throws a bunch of upgrades at you which collectively take a huge chunk out of your wallet. So I ended up ignoring upgrades for a while because it was looking like it was going to take a serious amount of time to save up that much. But here's the thing: you don't need to save any money at all. Luckily I got sick of saving up and Googled it, but I can't even imagine how frustrating it would be to save up for two thirds of the game, skipping many useful upgrades, only to find out that it was pointless.This is such an obvious design flaw, I don't know how they left it in the game.

												A short, glib review. The problems with the game are relatively few. The movement controls in 3rd person can be clunky. There is a level toward the game's end that is confusingly difficult, and frankly sucked to play over and over again. It is a timed escape sequence with what seemed to be 30 seconds of grace time before it became unwinnable.The story is well done. It was understated at some points though, if only because it reveals things from the get-go. Delightfully quirky and quite charming. The ending was pleasant, too.Mechanically interesting, especially for the game's age, letting the player screw with the enemy AI in a number of different ways.Not my favorite game, but it will be worth remembering, which made it worth playing.

Not a review of the port itself. I was very fortunate in being able to have a rig which supported a smooth port experience. However, there were still occasional visual glitches and the game crashed every time after I died during the last few segments of the game. So even at its best performance the game runs only adequately.I wish I could say I enjoyed this game more. The most creative aspect of the game is using the creature ammos to capture or kill enemies. This dead or alive bounty hunting mechanic is the core of the gameplay, but it barely gets developed upon after its introduced, and what's worse is that they ditch several mechanics after the halfway point of the game. The game can be played in the 3rd as well 1st person perspective, but all the 3rd person perspective is for is very basic 3rd person platforming and combat, as well as traversing the levels faster. The game has a currency which the plot informs the player is very important, motivating the player to capture more enemies than they kill. This makes for interesting gameplay, as it takes longer and is more risky to capture enemies alive than it is to kill them, but alive enemies pay out more. The earlier levels are also built around a combination of stealth and cover, which combined with the creative crossbow tools, gives the play options in how to complete a level. There are also upgrades and ammo to buy, giving you more to do with your money.Without spoiling anything, about half-way through the game money stops mattering, your upgrades stop mattering and capturing enemies alive doesn't really make a difference anymore. This is a problem as multiple of the player's tools is built around distracting and stunning enemies as well as killing them. The dead or alive element goes out the window, and the game becomes a very generic console fps, complete with parking garage level design. It feels like the game ran short of time or budget and lost everything which made the game unique as a fps.Overall the game is enjoyable but bland. I would ultimately say that the game is average, but since I can only recommend or not recommend a game, I can't really recommend an average game when there are already so many good to excellent games to play on steam, especially in this genre. For Oddworld fans I would say its worth at least a single playthrough, just so you can have experienced another aspect of the Oddworld universe. As a fan of the first two games on the playstation I was dissapointed that not as much of the same atmosphere was found in this game, although that might be a consequence of the xbox graphics still not being able to provide the same amount of detail as the prerendered environments of Oddysee and Exoddus.FPS fans can pass on this game, but Oddworld fans should see this game through at least once. That's assuming of course they can get this port to work, since it is infamously unstable. Otherwise skip this port and find it on the original xbox.			"

Really wish they`d make something like this again.All ranged combat is first person, and melee can be either first or third person.  Semi open world, and nice environments throughout.  Neat inertia system for your character movement.  Enemy variety is pretty low, but it doesn't really detract from the game.  Ability to choose between live or dead capture is a nice feature on bounties.  Story is decent.			"

You have many RPG elements with upgrading weapons, health and so on by buying stuff from the store and getting far more money from catching the person alive rarther than dead.I highly recommend this to any fan of the oddworld series.

												A ""so bad it's good"" game. I got to a point where I encountered an unbeatable mini-boss and rage uninstalled.I was looking for charming and unconventional yet got outdated and tedious. The different weapon types were fun for a while, but the rinse-and-repeat level design and same-old-same-old ""bounties"" got really old. Plus, the last stages seemed so far removed from the original Western theme of the game that it was almost like two different design teams just spliced a game together. Think the Borderlands world without the fun.I could only recommend this game if you're feeling nostalgic and want to play something that was originally released on the first Xbox in 2005. Thankfully, games have evolved since then and there are tons of better titles to play these days.			"

												This game aged like Milk.Stranger's Wrath has a concept that on paper and for a 15 dollar purchase seems like a fun experience. Shoot critters instead of guns, set traps, hunt for outlaws. Sounds fun right?The execution is unforchanately poorly implemented. The game suffers from hit detection errors and missing sound effects. A first person shooter requires precise aim and I never felt like my shot was quite hitting the mark, I found myself clipping into walls frequently which is especially annoying when being pelted with bullets and trying to take cover. I spent the second half of the game being unable to hear Stranger speak and having his punch attack missing its sfx. The last third of the game becomes a monontus mess that I felt obligated to finish to justify my purchase. Go into an area, kill everyone, rinse repeat. The semi final boss has got to be some of the worst game design I've ever seen. Being webbed up and continously stun locked isn't fun or interesting as a boss fight, it's just frustrating. I remember really loving this game as a child on Xbox, but I see that was also just another case of nolstalgia glasses. This port is garbage, and the game hasn't aged gracefully. Watch it on youtube.			"

												Fun game, the way you can kill or capture enemies is done in a cool way. Same goes for the ammo you collect; you use creatures instead of bullets. How awesome is that ? The game has an open world feel to it, but it's not. It just gives you the illusion that it is. Anyway, you do quests and they mostly end up with you having to capture or kill a boss, along with their henchman. This is a port from the Xbox version but all things considered, it still looks pretty good. Sound is also good and as you can tell the gameplay is still nice and fresh. By the way, the company that released this version will also release a HD patch later this year, so things will definately look sharper then (and, if I recall correctly, models will also be updated). But I recommend you buy it, HD patch or not.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												Stranger's Wrath, well, were do I begin. I'd like to point out that because this is an HD remake that the graphics and sound are fantastic, but what about the game. Well, you learn early in the game that the protaginist bounty hunter, Stranger, has an urgent medical problem that needs to be taken care of, otherwise he will die, but the procider will cost 20,000 mullah(and in the game not only will u receive at most 500-1000 mullah at max from bounty hunting, u are constantly buying upgrades(unless u want to cheat by constantly beat up the towns-folk))(not to mention that the only resemblense to the other oddworld games with this one is Vlukkons and the Glukkons(yep, not even the Mudokuns apear in this installment,but it doesnt matter)), so Stranger is forced to do more bounties. Thats all I'll say about the story. The gameplay is also fantastic due to the genuies 1st/3rd person style gameplay with the Critter Lancher, one of the best weapons in gaming history due to fact that it can lanch any critter Stranger can fit on the hand crossbow and use them as ammo(the lightning bugs are the only critters that u use to farm critters and also have an unlimited ammo). The other elements are also done very well, as how you have to capture enemies and bounty people alive to get a lot more profit(its the dead profit times by high timing numbers like 5 or 4 or 3 or even 6). I dont know what else to say, get the game in the Oddbox(since buying the game by itself is stupid, seeing the Oddbox is 10 USD and Stranger's Wrath by itself is 10 USD), and play this magnificent game as well as the others now!

												(Played game on Xbox years ago so dissregard the hours) Very fun game, fast paced but not like any other Oddworld game. The weapons are intresting, you use live ammo to kill/bate/capture enemies. It's very short and there is not much replay value maybe 6-8 first time, it's very linear but keeps you on your toes.Pro: Fun, Fast paced, Intresting and unique story and gameplay.Con: Short and not much replay value.

												You know, it's sad really. I really wanted to like this game due to the creative weapons, location, and characters, but there is one HUGE issue with this game that kills any enjoyment: It is the most poorly opitimized game I have ever played. It's main issue is that the game will constantly crash at random intervals (sometimes after 2 minutes of gameplay). I'm still stuck on the first level thanks to those crashes! As for the controls, it's the same issue, but I can look past that. I can even look past some graphical issues (including one odd one where if you take a screenshot, it does a weird duplication to said screenshot). What I can't look past is the constant crashes and poor optimization. Heck, the developer of the port is doing nothing to fix the game! For as much as I wanted to like and recommend this game, I sadly can not. AVOID THIS GAME and pick it up on the original Xbox instead! It's better optimized, runs better, and is dirt cheap!			"

												There's a few people having issues with this game crashing on them. Seems to be due to multicore processors, from what the forums say. I would be one of those people. Had it where every time I would launch the game, as soon as I stepped on the first marker at the beginning the game would crash. This occurred no matter what options I set the game to, and I'm not about to go messing with my BIOS for a game. On top of all this, the devs don't seem too interested in even so much as responding to customers about how to go about fixing this. Sent them an email regarding the issue almost a month ago and never received a response back. Seems as though they've abandoned any support for this game whatsoever. You're better off getting the game on mobile, as they've at least responded right away after I accidentally emailed the mobile devs.			"

												This is a REALLY good game. The story is fairly simple. You are the stranger. An alien with a serious medical problem that is very expensive to fix. To fix it you need to get a LOT of money, and you do this by hunting down enemies Boba Fett style. This is probably the best Bounty Hunter game ever made. Capturing crooks and using skill to take them alive rather than dead is one of those things you'll feel really good about. Mind you, the game drowns you in money, so you can easily get all the upgrades without capturing the crooks alive and all that. (Probably for the best.) It easily combines first person shooting with strategy, platforming, and you need ALL of that together to beat this game. Because it doesn't pull it's punches. It's not Dark Souls hard, but it's one of those games where you need to think under heavy fire, and capturing all the bad guys alive is a challenge, but a good one. At around 60% completion, the gameplay changes a bit. Accompanied by a solid, if kinda predictable twist if you've been paying attention. (Though I still did a little gasp.) Bounty Hunting and money collection becomes pointless, so you might as well collect all the upgrades and not worry about saving up for later. Overall, I give the game a 9/10. It's amazing. Beautiful. Solid and unforgettable. But there isn't much replay content unless you want to try and capture enemies alive if you failed the first time. And a few hidden collectables. (Also some sections, especially a timed one at the very end that is VERY unforgivng, can be overwhelmingly difficult.)Play the game. It's a very solid port (I had no problems with it, but I've heard others have. So probably give it some research first.)			"

												Rating: 7/10Overview: Third/First Person Action AdventureThe Good:+ The game certainly is original in terms of its character, world and story. + Game controls between first and third person and does a great job switching between the two. Third person is mostly used for traversing the environments while first person is used for the crossbow to kill/capture enemies. + The premise is simple, but nicely executed. You collect a bounty and then proceed to go hunt it down, usually with a lot of enemies and obstacles along the way. The game is linear and you can only hunt one bounty at a time but each bounty is unique in its own way.+ Each bounty is unique, like a mini boss battle, each one requires special tactics. You can either kill or capture the enemies. Killing enemies is easier but nets you less money while capturing them is the opposite.+ Use money to upgrade your character+ Unique ammo, your crossbow can hold two types of ammo at one time. The Average:Graphically the game is decent, it certainly isn't ugly but nothing really stands out. The story while decent feels like it never meets its potential. It's hard to care about the main character, villains or anybody else. The Bad- Broken Achievements, exiting the game makes you lose your achievement progress. - I really hated the voice acting. - Game crashes after every death and load in the second half of the game. A reoccurring problem for many users with no fix in sight, making the game almost unplayable. I solution is to quit the game before you die and continue from the main menu. Conclusion:For some reason this game reminds of me of a Rare game back in the day. Animals that talk with cute fuzzy ammo to collect. A fun game with some serious technical issues that should be fixed. Given the age of the game its surprisingly holds up pretty decently.   "

												let me start out by saying that I love this game and the oddworld franchise as a whole. with that being said, this port is garbage. I can run games far more demanding than this one with no issues, and there ARE no issues until the game decides to crash for no damn reason. it's horribly ironic that a game company called ""just add water"" made this port that numerous people have had debilitating problems with since its inception. luckily I only paid $3 for the oddboxx on sale, but I still paid for it. this would be acceptable if it was a torrent from a sketchy website, but this is a purchase I made from steam. take out the trash, guys. no one should have to pay for a lazy, broken port from an amateur ish company that doesn't do oddworld inhabitants justice. if you care about your customers, prune the trees they eat from.

It't truly one of the last games too keep itself true as it mixes the good things about modern gaming (as they were striking it) as well as the good things from old games, oh and the crosbow is just amazing.

												Surprisingly a great ""Oddworld"" game, I said that in quotations because I was expecting this to be a departure of what makes Oddworld's storyline great.It starts off cowboy-ish, but it does eventually grab that Oddworld feel in the story and scenery.The gameplay itself is also great, it is not a generic FPS. You dont just get guns that hurts people, you get ammo types that knocks enemies downs or wrap them up, and you're rewarded for ""capturing"" enemies rather than killing them which I think makes for interest tactics on overcoming the enemies.Lots of PC port problems though. Lots of people reports crash, but the big problem for me was frequent framerate problems, would drop to the 30s sometimes. I think running in Windows 7 fixed the problem, but some weather effects will bring it down.			"

The story needed some work as it was a good one but the characters didn't have any personallity to them. The voice acting and everything was great but ith one or two more writers on staff this game would have been 5/5, spirit sucessor to conker but just falls short as the story doesn't come in till the end and the gameplay was semi repeative but was so a lot of fun.

												So far, the only two things I don't like about this game, are:1. Cannot change buttons/keys2. Cannot turn off the auto-centering cameraThe auto-centering camera REALLY annoys the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. I hate auto-centering cameras. An option to turn it off would've been lovely.			"

												This game is amazing! My favorite Oddworld story/character so far. The world, characters, and story are very unique and interesting and even keep you emotionally involved. I would play it again in an instant if I did not have so many games that I need to play. I am actually disappointed that this is not Overwhelmingly Positive.I REALLY hope that they make another Stranger game.P.S. - I did have a launching issue for awhile after I bought it, which was some time ago, but after some wait time, I tried again and it worked perfectly from then on.P.S.² - You know a game is a good classic when you make references from it in everyday life, and I actually do that.

												I bought this blindly in the sale, only tried the first oddworld game. This one is not even close to it.The game plays fluid, fast paced (if you want stealty) and you'll feel like a badass. The artstyle is unique compared to these days.The game is a mix of Third person and First person. (Mostly first person). I would recommend buying this game if it's on sale.Also many people seem to have problems running the game if you are using Intel integrated card.			"

												Finally, a game in the Oddworld universe that isn't horribly repetitive and boring.  This one is only mildy reptitive, but definitely has a lot of humor to go with it.  The controls are somewhat maddening at times, and I basically gave up near the end because I got tired of repeating the Stranger's escape from an exploding building  (yeah, spoiler alert) but all in all it's kind of a neat and twisted take on a first person shooter.

												I remember first playing the orginal as a 6 year old boy, and not knowing what was going on. xD but now that I'm older, I realise there's a lot more to the story than just shooting the bad guys (like most FPS games) this game also blends together first and third person gameplay very well! I highly reccomend this game especially if you want a break from the casual FPS games of our time. It has great graphics, especially for the time of its original release. (2005, If I'm not mistaken.)			"

												Stranger's Wrath HD is a great remastered game. It's not just a last gen game that has been upscaled for higher resolution, the character models have been remade from the ground up and the environment have more art assets, looking astonishing compared to the Original Xbox. The story is about a Steef named Stranger, set in the Oddworld universe, who is in desperate need for an operation, in which he became a bounty hunter to catch criminals to cash them in to meet his requirements to get it. Gameplay wise is a mixture between 3rd person platforming which also focus more on fighting and using agility, and a 1st person shooter in which you can switch views anytime seamlessly with a touch of a button/key. Instead of typical guns, you are equipped with a crossbow and you use live ammunition in which you can either buy in game or hunt for them. There are now a bit more features compared to its original release, such as unlocking concept art, new easter eggs, and select difficulties. Fan of Oddworld games and newcomers should definitely pick this game up!!!			"

												Avery unique game, you play the role as a bounty hunter in oddworld, trying to save your money for an operation. You can play in both 3rd and 1st to get the job done. You use a special crossbow, which uses bugs as ammo, and different bugs give you effects when used. For example you can use a spider to spin a web around a bandit, and while he is binded you can capture him, alive.			"

I was a little bothered by some of the controls for PC and didn't play for a while.HOWEVER, somewhere down the line, the game was patched and it added a few nice little options to the PC port. And it is now completely and competently playable without a gamepad! It's still just as beautiful as a decade ago, when I first delved into Oddworld!			"

Innovative gameplay that uses 1st and 3rd person very well. There's always a variety of ways to get your bounty which makes stealth and brute force both viable options. Also the dialoge is very entertaining and flows naturally to the point where it feels almost cinematic (but in a good way). Couldn't recomend this game any more.			"

												   Stranger's Wrath originally launched for xbox in 2005, only playable at 1360x738 because if you set it higher than that the screen looks a bit upward and tilted to the right to the point where the menu is barely seen, the game can lock 60 fps but the screen tearing is making my eyes bleed, and if I dont play with the v-sync, the stranger sometimes stays foot without moving and I have to jump first to start walking again. In the tutorial level when I used the squirrel bolt the enemy didn't even walked to it, it stays there and don't even move to the cross area where I'm supposed to lure him. Seriously this is bad ported for PC, the majority have a similar issue when i google my problems, how can people rate this version so positive? nostalgia maybe...			"

												I played the living hell out of this game on the original Xbox, it was FANTASTIC! And the game itself is.HOWEVER, Sadly this port of the game is amongst the worst damned ports in PC history,I am running this game on a GTX 770 and it frequently drops below 30 FPS, and this is on LOW settings.Try turning AA on, even the most basic form of it and the game suddenly runs at a nice and steady 4 fps, good! I wanted the game to be more like a slideshow anyway.The keyboard and mouse controls are just terrible so if you're going to pull yourself through this you better have a controller ready and even then things are very very sluggish and being precise with your aim is impossible, for those of you who did not know this game features an FPS mode where you launch various critters at your enemies to cause various effects, you also need to go hunting for these critters to refill your ammo, these guys are tiny, like, TINY, and in order to refill your ammo you need to hit these buggers whilst they're running around on the ground.It's impossible, sometimes I have to shoot 3-4 times before hitting the damned things whilst standing still and this is only when using the controller, using the mouse however it is just fine but good luck walking around using WASD.. So I guess I'll just walk with my controller and aim with the mouse, good!Let's talk about V-Sync, everyone who knows anything about PC gaming knows that Vsync can be a real ♥♥♥♥♥, I personally prefer to always turn it of since I have a high-end enough PC to run mostly anything without any hitches and hey, this game is from 2005, not a problem right? Well I couldn't tell you, because this game comes bundled with glitches, buggs and errors up the wha-zoo including this one wonderfull bug I call V♥♥♥♥♥♥If you disable V-sync, it disables character movement in the game.Alright I'll let you think about that for a moment, and no this is not something isolated to my system.Turning V-SYNC OFF... Turns of... Character movement? That's right! So ♥♥♥♥ you for even trying to turn it of, why did we even put the option in there? Because we wanted you to know this OUR game and we don't give no ♥♥♥♥♥.Oh and do you have an AMD graphics card? You won't be running this game, at all. So have fun staring at a black screen.I picked this game up quite recently and upon being struck with the glitch-fest that this piece of crap is I started googling around for fan-made patches and fixes seeing as the JAW company obviously gives no ♥♥♥♥♥, there are none, and I came across this brilliant little article from Giant Bomb.http://www.giantbomb.com/profile/blazehedgehog/blog/the-odd-tale-of-why-you-shouldnt-buy-strangers-wra/94292/This is where my mind was truly blown, this game used to be even MORE BROKEN THAN THIS? I don't even..Dear Just Add Water ( The people who ported this game to PC )Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥ seriously this is unplayable.Want to play this game? Do! it is an absolutely fantastic title, just go pick it up on Ebay for eight bucks, that's even cheaper than this broken mess and you're going to have a much better time.			"

												[size=+2]OddWorld: Stranger's Wrath HD: Review[/size]The Oddworld studios is a great studio that makes the game almost flawless this is the actual remake of the ""Stranger's Warth"" (the original version of the game was released to the XBOX only) to have better graphics and to be in multiple platforms such has Playstaion 3, PC, Android, IOS, Ouya and Playstation Vita.Well let's start with some aspects of the gameFirst stop OddWorld never released a game with the combat they literally just created ""OddWorld: Munch's Oddysee"" wich was the first OddWorld game that had a 3D animation with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera movement, carrying on Stranger's Wrath has a great camera movement, a good combat engine wich you can use the map and it's resources to do it stealth or go aggro all the enemies and hope you don't get killed, when I was playing the game I got really stealthy and decided to hunt the enemies one by one until I reached the boss and I was on hard mode so it literaly made my life easier I din't wasted a bunch of ammo and got captured the boss in ease, the only think I don't like in this game it's the short story it took me 16 hours to finsih the hole game in hard mode thats how short it is, and they are never making a new game about the legendary steed ""Stranger"" since they are focused giving a epileptic seizure to future generations with ""OddWorld: Abe's New 'N' Tasty"" and the up comming remake of ""OddWorld: Abe Exoddus"" wich will literaly make me epileptic (hope not, well they abuse in the lightning again) and forgot to metion that Oddworld was going to relase a game with engine of Stranger's Wrath but with a few changes called ""Oddworld: Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot"" got canceled due to the collapse of Oddworld Inhabitants, but has they got a new team now I know it will be released and people will love the studio wich I still love since I was a child.-----------------BUY THIS GAME GIVE SUPPORT TO THE ODDWORLD STUDIO!------------------			"

												Obvious mobile port but a hidden gem this one.Oddworld is a strange and unique place, even more than in Abe's odyssey you get to explore it a lot more here.The game is a mix of 3rd and 1st person action-rpg with simple yet ingenius mechanics.It is enjoyable, fun and at the right price imho!

												Very poorly done port.  JAW did a truly despicable job bringing this hidden gem onto PC.  Despite countless issues (crashing, lack of controller support, poor framerate, etc.), JAW has done nothing to patch out these issues.  They are very much capable of it.  The PS3 HD remake runs great, but the PC port is riddled with bugs.  Buyers beware.			"

												I hate hate HATE that I am leaving a bad review for this game as it is an original Xbox classic, in my opinion. But, it didn't work on my laptop. My laptop is an Asus laptop that I am able to run Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas on near flawlessly (with low settings), but it couldn't run this game properly, which makes no sense to me. I even adjusted the settings before starting. Certain parts of the levels would turn completely black, making it nearly impossible to maneuver through the level. Because of that, my saves couldn't be loaded due them being ""damaged"".A lonely tear streamed down my cheek as I requested a refund :'(			"

												Honestly this is probably the worst steam purchase I've even made. The game has been out for years and even though I've waited all this time for a patch, it's still unplayable due to it being a bad port job. Actually, it's become even worse somehow when they updated it to HD. I can't get the damn thing to run over 5 FPS even on the lowest settings and I am running the it on an intel i7 and a GTX 650 TI.I wish I could have returned this broken crap but I had the unfortuate luck of buying this abysmal port job before steam refunds was ever a thing.

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively. Gameplay: This was not my first time playing this game; in fact, this is my sixth time playing through the game, counting the five playthroughs I had of the Xbox version (also the game really can't do the ""Only on Xbox"" claim anymore, so that's kinda funny). I took a couple of years off from this game, since it was one of my yearly playthrough games, and coming back to it with both a new perspective and a new control scheme, this game is still as fresh as ever. It's a blend of FPS, stealth, and platforming that just works when it honestly shouldn't.The FPS elements can be very tactical in nature, with your main weapon being a crossbow that can hold two of nine available ammo types; each one having their own specific uses. You'll soon find the three or four that work for you and forget the rest, but again, that's not to say that they're useless. There does seem to be mouse smoothing and auto-aiming in this game, which can be distracting for some, but I never found it to be that big of a deal. They can be disabled, as far as I know. This game does have replenishing health, but it's different from how a Call of Duty game does it. You have a health and a stamina gague; the stamina gauge is replenished by either taking in enemies or standing still. Sprinting doesn't drain stamina, but it doesn't replenish it, either. You also use stamina to heal yourself, with a full stamina bar often recovering about 75% of your total health. There's a great deal of tactics to healing, with the choice oftentimes being made between ducking behind a wall or stunning everyone guns-a-blazing.Of course, another option is to stealth your way around areas, especially if there happens to be a very dense crowd of enemies. It's still recommended that you bag enemies, though, and it's all your choice how you tackle the areas. Your punch, if you've been upgrading it through the store, will most often knock out enemies in one hit. Goons and bosses have their own health and stamina gagues as well. Obviously, an alive baddie is worth more than a dead baddie, so do try to take 'em in alive. It is possible to take in every boss alive (some are pretty hard to do, though) with the exception of very late game bosses, but the stakes have changed at that point, and that's all I'll say on that.All in all, I didn't really have any issues with any of the areas, with the possible exception of the last bit before the final boss fight being one helluva difficulty spike. It's something that I can guarantee is different from anything you've played before, and even after six playthroughs, the game still feels fresh and juicy as ever. 10/10.Story: Man, this game has some great dialogue. It's easy to spend a while in towns just listening to what the Clakkerz have to say. The Grubs have some pretty great lines as well. Basically, there's a lot of lines in this game that'll almost assuredly get a laugh out of you if you even have a remotely crude sense of humor. The surprising bit is that the storyline actually gets good about 2/3 of the way through. That's not to say that the first 2/3 of the story are worth losing; it's just that the stakes become that much higher at that point. The ending is unexpectedly dramatic and actually really good. For a lot of great laughs and a surprisingly well-written story, I give the story a 9/10.Graphics: As expected from an HD port, the game looks great. One thing that I'm glad to have seen toned down from the Xbox version is the utterly absurd amount of bloom. Seriously, the amount of bloom in the Xbox version far surpassed any premise of artistic direction. Speaking of, the art direction of this game is absolutely fantastic; as to be expected from an Oddworld Inhabitants game. It's an excellent mix of high-tech gadgets and old-timey western aesthetics. The characters, enemies, ammo, areas... just everything looks fantastic. The technical aspects... aren't so fantastic. For starters, the game uses SSAA, which is HORRENDOUSLY inefficient. The game itself isn't too demanding, but the really weird part is that the game prefers my Integrated Graphics on my i5-3470. I could only really run it on 4x SSAA because of this (and yes, I did try and go through NVIDIA Control Panel; it didn't change anything). Even despite the not-so-great technical side of this game, the game still looks fantastic enough for me to give this game a 4/5 for graphics.Sound: Well, the music is pretty good. I always make the note as to whether or not I'd bring this along with me on my MP3 player, and I wouldn't really do that for this soundtrack, but there are some very good songs in there that fit the ""odd"" vibe this game is trying to pull. Voiceacting is great, with a lot of the humor coming from just the inflections that the voiceactors use. Again, it's hilarious how the Grubs seem to be speaking in all-caps. A rather disappointing aspect of the voiceacting, however, is that the voice clips are rather low-fidelity. I don't have the greatest audio equipment in the world (a Gamecom 777 headset into the included USB sound card) and I can hear the compression on the voice clips. It makes me sad. Surely they could've sourced some uncompressed master audio files or something? Because of this, I can't give the audio portion of the game a perfect, but I still feel alright giving it a 4/5.Overall scores are 10/9/4/4; 9.0/10. Despite not being the best coded port of all time, the gameplay is still very much worth your time and money.			"

												Oddworld Stranger's Wrath is not only a great piece of nostalgia from my childhood (playing it on the original Xbox), it is also an amazing game, especially when you think about how old it is!Differences between platforms: There really are no differences other than graphical ones; Original Xbox 480p Xbox 360/PS3 720p (HD) and PC 1080p (HD), so, if you want the game where it shines the most, get it for the pc.Quick Verdict of the story:Main Character: ''Stranger''Ultimate Mission: Raise enough money by collecting bounties issued by different cities/villages to pay for a slightly confusing operation you won't know too much about untill a major plot twist around half way through the game.Positives:- Hilarious Characters- Great atmosphere and environment- Quite long, takes about 10-15 hours to complete (depending on the difficulty of course)- Loads of different types of enemies- Great graphical quality (PC only, even though it looks fine otherwise aswell, you really do notice a major difference on the PC)PC GLITCH FIXES:Black Screen Of Doom  Turn Off Anti-AliasingCan't Move  Turn Off Anti-Aliasing (may need to turn off v-sync aswell) "

												While very different from the other Oddworld games, this game is probably my favorite out of them all. The switch between third and first person views is fantastic, the ammo is creative AND hillarious, the storyline is probably the best one I've ever played, and the general gameplay is one that will stick with you until the end of time. I couldn't forget this game. 13/10, so great!			"

												One of the best games on the Xbox, Stranger's Wrath is a unique first-person shooter/third-person platformer where you control the eponymous Stranger as he collects bounties and his weapon of choice? A crossbow that utilizes live creatures as ammo. Definitely reccomended to anyone looking for a fun game that's a lot different.			"

												The best console game you never heard of.  Stranger's Wrath was released on the original Xbox, but at a time when other games took most of the attention.  Worse, it was never made backward compatible on the 360.You don't need to know anything about Oddworld to enjoy this game -- it's not a sequel.  It's a very funny and 'strange' world -- you're in this Old West style country populated mostly by anthropomorphic animal-things (many of which are chickens), and you take bounty hunting missions to capture or kill trouble-causing outlaws.  You use 'live' ammo -- as in, the crossbow actually fires live creatures at enemies, which is really funny.Halfway through the game there is a MAJOR plot twist / reveal / change, which brings with it a nearly complete switch in gameplay style.  In most games this would be annoying, but this one pulls it off impressively and makes the game very memorable.  There were a couple hard / frustrating bits, but I loved just about every other minute.			"

												Alright boys and girls, It's time to take a trip to the feels (Of nostalga) trainBeing that this is one of my most loved games as a kid, on the original xbox i had to see the diffrence of the strangers wrath HDAnd to be honest it dosen't look half bad! Now i may of forgotten alot of the stuff i learned when i played the game years ago but hey i don't care, strangers wrath is one of those games that after you'll beat it you put it down, and go out and do other things for a while like read a book or take a walk ( if you're a casual) that or just play a bunch of other games that kick♥♥♥♥♥ and then after that, you can go right back into the odd world universe and love it. Well at least i can anywayAnd for those who haven't heard or even played any of the odd world games, let me tell you about this one. Imagine a game like red dead redemption, mixed with loony toons adult humor version, with a slight touch of animal cruilty (Cry sum moar PETA) as well as a few touchy feely things that are going wrong with the main character (I won't spoil anything even though you learn about whats wrong with stranger in like 3 countracts into the game) and bam you got this, of course with a few other bits and bobs added to it to give it its own special feelBut in the end, i have to say this game i remember most in all my years of gaming simply due to how unique it is, and trust me, it is! have you played another game where you shoot bugs rodents and other forms of wild life at westernized foes and bag em or tag em while protecting a town of chicken people? No? Then shut up, sit down, and enjoy the ride becuase if there is any copy cat  company that trys to make the same thing, their♥♥♥♥♥is getting blown out of the water by this game. But seriously why are you still reading this? buy the damn game.Also pro tip: Hard mode is really hard, would not suggest for casual gamers			"

												A departure from the original Oddworld titles, but comes into its own as a fantastically unique adventure game, mixing FPS and third person gameplay surprisingly well to balance out fast, in-your-face gunplay with slick, comfortable platforming and general world traversal relatively seamlessly.I can safely say I haven't played many games that wear as many hats as well as Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. The gameplay rocks, visuals are strange yet immersive, soundtrack is distinct and has some pretty great pieces, and the story is humorous while still managing to touch on some significant aspects of larger industrial expansion and what it does to the environment. I know that sounds preachy, but it's been a staple of the Oddworld franchise since the beginning, and every game does so just subtly enough to deliver a meaningful message through your struggle as the protagonist.Anyways, long story short, if you ever wanted a really weird Western, this is the best one you'll ever see. Now go trap some live ammo and hunt some goons!P.S. Lorne Lanning show us some more Oddworld bby pls.			"

												A solid game which perfectly remains barely aged. The game highly encourages stealthy tactics to deal with enemies, but you can take them with all you have if you prefer. The game has that Oddworld flavor we love (Although a very few species from previous games make an appearance), and despite having just 3-4 voice actors is more than enough to characterize the cast.Now, i have various negatives about the game but they are minor and probably nitpicking. The plot is extremely minor and you won't know what's going on until very late in the game (There's a good quantity of foreshadowing though), and that hurt my interest in the game to get my full interest (Aside the Oddworld brand). The difficulty curve sometimes is out of place as some late bosses or areas can be taken down with ease but a few early ones or previous to those are overwhelming. (Minor spoiler) The game will make you think you need to achieve certain goals but suddenly will take a completely different direction and make you feel the effort was for nothing (/spoiler).It might not reach the level of the original Abe games but Stranger is really up there just for gameplay. Is a good example of a game which goes for playability over plot, specially coming from Oddworld which is known from providing both and instead focuses on a single one.			"

If you have a decent enough system, then you'll be absolutely fine. Recommending a controller if you can use it, but otherwise great game.			"

That honestly disapointed me a bit, because you either have to take your hand off of your mouse or ASDW to switch ammo types with the arrow keys...  Nah, no, that's not where that goes.  It should all be on the left side of the keyboard.  On a controller, reload should be the left-most button(X), melee is the right-most button(B)-- everyone knows this.			"

Your real goal is to bounty hunt thieves.. But Ido must say I was purely the biggest a-hole on the game. Worse than the thieves and bandits.I went from house to house and knocked down fellas to get money.

												TBH. I never played an oddworld game in my life before this. an even then you can see at time of review, I only have like almost 3 hours. When I saw this game debut way back when I was a teen on the verge of manhood. it filled me with such excitement, the very concept of this game. at the time I THINK ""Gun"" was around and I absolutely loved that game. This looked like that with a fantasy twist. So, to the game - It opens up with a cutscene, our Hero is collecting some critters you see him afterwards setting them up on the ground nice like. Orderly. he then procedes to cover them with brush. A few seconds later We see a big ol'fatty chasing something through some wooded brush, vines everywhere. Its quick. Hes consistently popping off rounds with his blunderbuss, an just as consistently missing. Eventually we see what hes chasing is actually our hero, a Feline like bounty hunter. Got the raspy cowboy voice an all. Leather vest, Cowboy hat. He quickly turns the chase around onto the other fella chasing him. He leads him to where he had laid those little critters he collected earlier. Turns out he was just leading the guy on all along. he had a trap waiting for him. Nasty little buggers jump and start gnawing on any part of that bubblin fool they can sink their teeth into. Our Hero, procedes to use another spider like critter to than ensnare his catch. Wanted, Dead or Alive. Luckily for him, The Hero, Known as the Stranger. Does not use firearms.This game is basically Dog the Bounty Hunter with Furries.			"

												For a game of its age, it's looking pretty sharp with the HD update, leaping forward and distinguishing itself from the generation that saw it born.Stranger's Wrath although being part of the large population of FPS, it has enough entretaining elements to distinguish itself from the rest. The hability to whimsily switch between 3rd and 1rst person, be it to turn tail and dodge some bullets or close in and knock some teeth or simply exlpore your surroundings, 3rd person forces a change in strategy as well as gameplay. As for 1rst person, it is pretty standard with only a few variations and some elements thrown in, such as in a pseudo-stealth combat (e.i. neutralize-don't-kill, hiding) however stealth as itself is overpowered but really REALLY situational (scripted settled foliage) and could be better, maybe system limitations couldn't handle line-of-sight detecting at the time. However most of the combat is done in 1rst person, even though you can get creative and trace and strategy mixing 1st/3rd person, 1rst person is more reliable.As for the lore, even though it moves away from the style and tradition of the rest of the oddworld franchise, it still is rich and organic. A deep world to explore and an even deeper foreground as it forms part of the Oddworld universe, most of it deals with the themes of industrialization, explotation of natural resources and native kinship among others.My only complains are that it has not much replay value unless you really love the world they present (as much as I did, it made me lose the count of my plays), and the inclompete universe as the story has stalled and no new game releases have added something new to said universe since the release of the original XBOX version.

												While not perfect, this game seems to merit all its praise it has received over the past decade.Pros+ Combat, when all comes together, is very dynamic. Different small animals function as your ammunition with their own abilities. Third person melee and first person shooting blend a lot better than expected.+ Platforming and movement can be enjoyable.+ Simple, but rich story.+ Excellent varying environments and soundtrack.+ The game changes its style drastically about 2/3 the way through. To explain how would be a spoiler, but the ""stealth"" and non-lethal takedowns are let go in favor of a smashmouth approach.+ Sense of humor typical to the Oddworld games.+ Well balanced and rewarded careful strategy.Cons- Ear-bleeding-inducing voices. Almost all voices have been digitally altered to be a higher or lower register of a normal human... and altered quite poorly at that. - Early game's focus on ""stealth"" is extrodinarily basic and hard to maintain. Almost all confrontations turn loud.- To get a good reward, enemies need to be ""bagged"", requiring you to hold down control for about 3 seconds on EVERY enemy you knock out or kill. Can get repetitive and annoying.- The late game ammo types, mechanics, and lethal approach were more enjoyable to me than the early game ""tag and bag"" playstyle. Depends what you're into, but this seemed to be the best avenue for combining your attacks.- While there are plenty of ammo types, too many of them serve fairly similar functionalities.- Many boss fights. Some uninspired and annoying.While sometimes repetitive and a bit too slow paced, I enjoyed this retro first/third-person platformer/shooter/beat-'em-up thing. Try to avoid the ""greatest game of all time"" nostalgia filter reviews and enjoy the good this game has to offer that definitely overshadows its faults.			"

												Although my favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus, this is a close second. Unlike the previous games which are puzzle/cinematic platformers, this is a cocktail of an FPS, third-person brawler, platformer, and open world game (The open world is nothing large, but its competent). Above all that though, the main selling point of this game is the ammo. In this game you're not pumping lead into some random♥♥♥♥♥mercenarys, you're planning each move and thinking of fun ways to kill the many outlaws in the game. This is because you have bugs and small creatures for ammo, which can do a ton of things, like distracting enemies with the very annoying chippunk, or wrapping outlaws in webs to keep them on the ground for a easy capture with the bolamite. The game also has a fantastic sense of humor, as per usual with the oddworld series, and a lot of boss fights (Although a few are questionably designed). As for story, Its not as complex as the stories in the main quintology, but its still good, and it provides a good amount of lore for people who are interested in it. (Like me)			"

												A cool little game with a lot of charm to it.  I liked the western bounty hunter theme, and the living ammo was creative.  I also really liked a few of the story beats and set pieces.I will point out that a number of the achievements are broken, if you care about things like that.

												Oddworld takes a interesting spin on a First/Third person shooter with this title. With a perfect mix of platforming,shooting, and rounding up Bandits. Takes you into the oddworld......world in a different light and a different part telling its own great story and giving you a larger picture of what is oddworld.			"

												Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath was a surprise for me: I though I wouldn't like it because of the FPS structure, but I was wrong. After playing a while, the gameplay is better than what I thought. Third-person platforming and FPS action... not with guns but with a crossbow with living ammo caught from the wild. You go look for outlaws and capturing them with these in a western-alike style: excellent.  And be sure you think well how to clear an area, or else you are busted. There's also a plot twist in the middle of the game that is very interesting and incentivates you to play until the end. One of the cons I have is that the gameplay can turn out to be repetitive for some people, but still enjoyable. If you are a fan of Oddworld or someone that wants to experience a different platforming game similar to Portal (except for the portal concept and constant first-person view) I definitely recommend it.

												I love Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD. I had it on my ps3, but I could not get past a boss because I was only a stupid 13 year old who played Halo most of the time, so I saw that the Oddworld series was on sale for a cheap price, and I picked it up, I have not played any of the other games so far, but Strangers wrath is amazing. I love the switch between first person and third person view for different types of game play, and it was done very well. Platforming is quite simple, and if you have played any other platformer game, this won't bee too much of a challenge. The only problem I have with this game is that the default Xbox controls SUCK! I have tried to change them up, but the meny to do so is very confusing, and most of the controlls stayed the same as before. playing with a keyboard however feels very strange for platforming, but first person is good. I would definently reccomend this game to anyone who loves stealth games, platformers, shooters, and overall wierd games (in a good way). I will try to figure out the config menu, and I will edit the review when I get further into the game.			"

												One of the best games for the original XBox, yet it was never advertised as it was intended, and that kinda killed the game's chances on the public market. Quite a shame what shady business can do for an amazing game such as this.There were some issues getting it to work, and it's not friendly with XSplit Gamecaster, but it remains a VERY solid game for solo play. A gripping storyline and absolutely unique mechanics that I found myself coming back to after almost a decade, wondering if Steam had this gem. And thanks to JAW, it is here on Steam, and it's one of my favorites to play through. Not much replay value, but DEFINITELY worth the once through, or if you're feeling an itch to relive the glorious gameplay and laugh at the cheesy boss names (Jo Momma and Eugene Ius come to mind). A strong 8/10, and I would recommend it, even to people who don't like shooters.P.S. Oddbox is only like ten dollars and you get this with three other games that are all pretty damn good. Pick it up, it's DEFINITELY worth the price!			"

Stranger's Wrath is a devlishly humorous, innovative, immersive, and an example of what games should be.It has probably the best model for regenerating health, very unique ammo system, and can prove a real challenge when trying to capture enemies alive.

I have tried messing with the compatibility and settings for the game itself. The game runs smoothly for the time I do get to play it in that area. But as soon as I run to move to the next area it crashes each and every time. Very disappointing, loved this game as a child and was happy to see it in steam. Saddens me to give it a bad review.			"

												<Resolution change might do the trick for you!>What made me a SAD PANDA (Cons):1) Well I tried to play this on my ASUS Gaming RIG thats very much a beast but i got almost near to ZERO FPS unless i toned down the resolution to 1280x and disable Anti Aliasing. 2) The game then started good but may be it's my bad too that i don't prefer to play FPS/Third person shooter solely relying on WSAD movement keys. I generally prefer mouse cursor direction aided with WSAD for shooter games. Its like as if you are using a console controller to play this game. If you are like me you won't have easy time as this game also seems to need lot of planning and shooting in quick time.3) Also the camera in this game also din't help as it slowly auto adjust backs unless you hold on the mouse in that viewPros:1) The game looks amazing. It's hard to beleive this one is xbox classic era while it clearly better than many xbox 360 graphics out there. May be thats the reason this game won few awards for art and technology related stuff2) This isn't a regular button mash untill the enemy dies kind of game. There are lot of weapons and strategy involved in taking down those npc ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.3) If you can deal with WSAD only movements like a MAN then this game may not be that hard to tame.Recommend? YES!! WHY?? Chances are you might be able to run this game ok on lower resolution/graphic settings and in case you don't you can always get your cash refund as this game really deserves to give a shot at it IMHO.

The game environment is even more lush than before; the live ammo and all of the characters look great. It also runs smoothly - permitting you have, at least, the minimum system requirements. And, with the added difficulty selection system, you can make this game more challenging than before.Indeed, this game has been out for a while now, but I thought I'd review it just simply because it is a classic and, even now, it is still great.

												This game is just as good as its predecessors in the fact that it's both Odd, and it's got a whole lot o' world. The reasons i would recommend this game:1) The controls for both first and third person feel comfortable and responsive. (You'll be running round in third person a whole lot just cause it's so damn satisfying)2) The HD remake makes this game looks beautiful, not that the original was a bad looking game for the time by any means, you'll actually think it's a modern day release.3) The game is challenging but rewarding, just like the other titles in the Quintology. You'll be wonderfully frustrated. (If I could call it anything it would be that)4) The storyline aint too shabby either, but I won't talk about that for obvious reasons.			"

												Admittedly, the original port quality of the SD version (now unavailable, which is nice) was atrocious and in many instances completey unplayable. But with a massive failure comes the ability to learn from it, and JAW refined the port quality with the HD release. You'll find none of the original nonsense in this version, just a great game with that classic oddworld feel to it.As ""Stranger"" utilize living ammunition to dispatch your enemies. You can blow them up, fill them with holes, shred them apart or clobber them to death with certain projectiles, or you can go the quality bounty hunter route and take every outlaw you encounter in alive and roll in the sweet sweet moolah. You'll fight your way through farmlands, forests, ruins, facilities and now in beautiful HD, worthy of modern day screens. All the while, enjoying what is genuinely an instant classic and a worthy part of the Oddworld universe.			"

												It's definitely an interesting game. There are some good and bad, but some of the bad is probably just personal preference, aside from an issue I will discuss later. The graphics seem very nice for an hd remake. Texture quality could be better, but I was satisfied with it. The gameplay was awkward but had a lot of potential. I just wish you didn't have to keep switching from first to third and back to shoot stuff or climb things(technically you don't switch into third person, it just automatically changes the camera to that while you climb).My only real issue with this game is that my framerate was abysmal, despite well exceeding the system recuirements. I had to play the game at almost minimal graphical settings to get a decent framerate. This should be kept in mind if you don't have the greatest computer and plan to buy this game. Otherwise, it's a good game if you're into a somewhat silly storyline and don't mind sub par dialogue.			"

												A... unique experience. I love it dearly because I played it back when I was a console peasant, and it was an absolute ton of fun- and it still is! At least to me.It's a sort of platformer with core elements of a shooter, but not entirely dominated by them and it changes form a few times through, but not in unwelcome or unwieldly ways. I don't know why I like it. It's wierd, it's different, and maybe it's not your cup of tea, but would you at least give it a try? Look up a few videos, a few reviews, a few screenshots, and nab it while it's on sale?The one thing I know for sure is that I found it fun, and in the end, that's all it needed do.			"

												Now that this runs (somewhat), and the port doesn't COMPLETELY suck, this is actually pretty cool. I like how, so far, the ammo doesn't so much 'kill' the enemy, as it weakens them, and you fire living creatures, which is unique. I've never been much of an Oddworld fan, but this one's pretty awesome.			"

Its' story is far and above 95% of all other shooters I've played.  Adds a neat stealth mechanic and even manages to stay fresh 10+ hours in.

Nothing like a change from the norm when it comes to shooters, and oddworld has always topped the charts in the games they make and stranger's wrath is no different. It is always satisfying to set a trap, and watch enemies fall for it every time.			"

												This is a classic western, intermingled with science fiction and given a hearty dose of unique gameplay to round it all out.  The switching between first- and third-person views gives the player an intriguing array of abilities as they travel the western end of Mudos in search of moolah and ultimately safety.  The use of small animals as projectile weaponry is quite an entertaining twist on the standard ammo use one normally sees in first-person shooters.  Besides that, you can just shake off damage that's done to you - a better alternative to regenerating health, in my opinion.  Some Oddworld fans claim Stranger's Wrath is not a true Oddworld game, yet they forget that the very theme of Oddworld is there: corporate exploitation of a natural resource and the negative impacts that has on the environment.  Combine this with a hero-figure and you have a true Oddworld game.			"

												A finely crafted old school game set in the Oddworld universe and rather different from it's predecessor that was a 2D puzzle/platform game.Stranger's Wrath is a fun shooter/platformer hybrid with an interesting story and a badass protagonist. The game has a lot of influence from western movies in both it's asthetic and atmosphere, yet it has some truly whacky and also sci-fi elements.A must have for those who want some old school fun before all games had to be ""cinematic"", while this game might be linear it dosen't forget that it is at it's core a game and is meant to be fun. There are some good jokes and puns scattered throughout the game between the action and stealth sequences.The later half of the game is more action oriented and has much less stealth, but it's still equally good.

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Very few games make me wish they were longer. Out of all the oddworld games this one is the best. You use a mix of third-person platforming, and first-person shooting. It mixes very well. You spend most of the game fighting outlaws as a badass bounty hunter, but there is a still an amazing story to go along with it. It is also full of surprises. I recommend this to anyone that loves playing video games.			"

												The best console game you never heard of.  Stranger's Wrath was released on the original Xbox, but at a time when other games took most of the attention.  Worse, it was never made backward compatible on the 360.You don't need to know anything about Oddworld to enjoy this game -- it's not a sequel.  It's a very funny and 'strange' world -- you're in this Old West style country populated mostly by anthropomorphic animal-things (many of which are chickens), and you take bounty hunting missions to capture or kill trouble-causing outlaws.  You use 'live' ammo -- as in, the crossbow actually fires live creatures at enemies, which is really funny.Halfway through the game there is a MAJOR plot twist / reveal / change, which brings with it a nearly complete switch in gameplay style.  In most games this would be annoying, but this one pulls it off impressively and makes the game very memorable.  There were a couple hard / frustrating bits, but I loved just about every other minute.			"

Gameplay-wise, Stranger's Wrath feels like it's in a different dimension from the tales of old Stitchlips but it still has the great and unique Oddworld charm. Graphics look great, combat is quite tactical and I was lucky to have experienced only one or two bugs, none of which were game breaking. Was hooked from the start all the way up to the end.			"

												Oddworld stranger's wrath is a solid port of an original xbox game. The game is a first person shooter with third person movement, choose between killing bounty targets or simply catching them. You will progress through a linear story and world facing a few different kinds of bosses and enemies, all while collecting living ammo and to more easily defeat them. The plot is a bit heavy handed at hinting at things if you listen to the idle jabber of the cluckers, but the story itself is a nice simple one. Not many of the bounties are actually related to the plot progressing, but the game has some fun dialogue between Stranger and the Villians. Oddworld also has an interesting setting of industrial dystopia, full of weird designs and characterful creatures. Overall if you want a shooter with some unique mechanics, an interesting setting, & looking for a classic game Oddworld Stranger's wrath is  probably for you. "

												It's definitely an interesting game. There are some good and bad, but some of the bad is probably just personal preference, aside from an issue I will discuss later. The graphics seem very nice for an hd remake. Texture quality could be better, but I was satisfied with it. The gameplay was awkward but had a lot of potential. I just wish you didn't have to keep switching from first to third and back to shoot stuff or climb things(technically you don't switch into third person, it just automatically changes the camera to that while you climb).My only real issue with this game is that my framerate was abysmal, despite well exceeding the system recuirements. I had to play the game at almost minimal graphical settings to get a decent framerate. This should be kept in mind if you don't have the greatest computer and plan to buy this game. Otherwise, it's a good game if you're into a somewhat silly storyline and don't mind sub par dialogue.			"

												A departure from the original Oddworld titles, but comes into its own as a fantastically unique adventure game, mixing FPS and third person gameplay surprisingly well to balance out fast, in-your-face gunplay with slick, comfortable platforming and general world traversal relatively seamlessly.I can safely say I haven't played many games that wear as many hats as well as Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. The gameplay rocks, visuals are strange yet immersive, soundtrack is distinct and has some pretty great pieces, and the story is humorous while still managing to touch on some significant aspects of larger industrial expansion and what it does to the environment. I know that sounds preachy, but it's been a staple of the Oddworld franchise since the beginning, and every game does so just subtly enough to deliver a meaningful message through your struggle as the protagonist.Anyways, long story short, if you ever wanted a really weird Western, this is the best one you'll ever see. Now go trap some live ammo and hunt some goons!P.S. Lorne Lanning show us some more Oddworld bby pls.			"

												I love Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD. I had it on my ps3, but I could not get past a boss because I was only a stupid 13 year old who played Halo most of the time, so I saw that the Oddworld series was on sale for a cheap price, and I picked it up, I have not played any of the other games so far, but Strangers wrath is amazing. I love the switch between first person and third person view for different types of game play, and it was done very well. Platforming is quite simple, and if you have played any other platformer game, this won't bee too much of a challenge. The only problem I have with this game is that the default Xbox controls SUCK! I have tried to change them up, but the meny to do so is very confusing, and most of the controlls stayed the same as before. playing with a keyboard however feels very strange for platforming, but first person is good. I would definently reccomend this game to anyone who loves stealth games, platformers, shooters, and overall wierd games (in a good way). I will try to figure out the config menu, and I will edit the review when I get further into the game.			"

												Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath was a surprise for me: I though I wouldn't like it because of the FPS structure, but I was wrong. After playing a while, the gameplay is better than what I thought. Third-person platforming and FPS action... not with guns but with a crossbow with living ammo caught from the wild. You go look for outlaws and capturing them with these in a western-alike style: excellent.  And be sure you think well how to clear an area, or else you are busted. There's also a plot twist in the middle of the game that is very interesting and incentivates you to play until the end. One of the cons I have is that the gameplay can turn out to be repetitive for some people, but still enjoyable. If you are a fan of Oddworld or someone that wants to experience a different platforming game similar to Portal (except for the portal concept and constant first-person view) I definitely recommend it.

This game is more of an FPS, with a small dash of 3rd person platformer (very small dash). In this game you take up Bounties and you can choose to capture your target dead or alive.

												Oddworld stranger's wrath is a solid port of an original xbox game. The game is a first person shooter with third person movement, choose between killing bounty targets or simply catching them. You will progress through a linear story and world facing a few different kinds of bosses and enemies, all while collecting living ammo and to more easily defeat them. The plot is a bit heavy handed at hinting at things if you listen to the idle jabber of the cluckers, but the story itself is a nice simple one. Not many of the bounties are actually related to the plot progressing, but the game has some fun dialogue between Stranger and the Villians. Oddworld also has an interesting setting of industrial dystopia, full of weird designs and characterful creatures. Overall if you want a shooter with some unique mechanics, an interesting setting, & looking for a classic game Oddworld Stranger's wrath is  probably for you. "

												Stranger's Wrath has a pretty strong idea of what it wants to be and how to use gameplay to associate itself accordingly. However, it suffers from a few slight issues that brings what is meant to be a climactic finish to a strange wobble.So, plot. You are the Stranger, a lion-looking guy in Oddworld looking to hunt as a Bounty Hunter to save up enough Moolah for a very critical life-saving surgery. He doesn't use guns, doesn't care if they come in dead or alive, and kicks all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥ As in typical Oddworld fashion everyone's pretty self-centered but can be heroic when they care to be and everything's dirty, ugly, and casual. But it's all good, Stranger's Wrath has a heaping helping of atmosphere which really sucks you in, it's beautifully organic.Anyways without spoiling too much, about two-thirds in the genre suddenly changes. Then it stops being a case of dead or alive for bounty and a lot of use for the Moolah you've been making for over half the game becomes meaningless. Even worse, you only retain a small amount of those upgrades you've been purchasing for over half the game and other upgrades are just given to you periodically for free. Normal conventions are thrown out the window, which works given the way the game is framed, but it also completely invalidates its own system in the process. If you were trying to take everyone alive for the Moolah, you don't have a use for Moolah any more, hell you never really had a use for Moolah to begin with. It's just the plot says ""you need a lot of Moolah"" so you save up a lot of Moolah, shelling out for upgrades, and then having nearly all of them taken from you. This is what I mean by identity through gameplay, but again hard to explain without spoiling too much.From that point forward, your arsenal becomes upgraded and more powerful to better suit the ""kill everything"" idea, because they're a pain when they're alive since they're harder to catch while you're getting shot from all directions. And grabbing a bounty restores your stamina, which allows you to heal. Dead guys are faster to catch but disappear after a minute so typically it's better to have them dead if you're moving fast anyways, which you should. Or, you could just ignore everything and run to the end. Only a few situations in the later third of the game require you to fight everything if you're smart and move fast. There's no point after all as the only use for guys at that point is quick healing or more ammo which you'd lose more of fighting to begin with. This is fine given how repetitive and drawn out fights become when nearly everything has to die and there's lots of them.Ultimately I can give Stranger's Wrath a recommendation because it's full of charm and life while also offering a solid challenge. While it has its rough moments, it knows what it is and what it wants to be, it just happens to have difficulty with its own systems the moment you realize a good chunk of them don't even matter. Unless you're hunting for achievements.			"

												Although the story was interesting, The in-game dialogue tends to be repetitive and annoying, especially when you meet the grubbs and their high-pitched voices. The bounty/boss fights tend to be nothing more than the boss enemy spamming just 2 attacks at you repetitively, which is incredibly annoying when the boss is capable if immobilizing you with one of his/its attacks. And sometimes your movement will glitch up and freeze you in place until you fiddle with the controls for several seconds trying to get Stranger to start moving again.			"

												Stranger's Wrath requires fairly good hardware to run smoothly. If this isn't a problem, you'll love the game. Having played this on Xbox, I knew how the game should feel. This PC version seems to work excellently!In this game, you are BAD -♥♥♥♥♥bounty hunter, in every sense of the title. Here, you bag your prey however you like, whether you smack them around 'til ya knock 'em out, or shoot 'em up 'til their dead meat. Along the way, you find harsher environments, though the fight will never be too hard for you to handle.You're Stranger, you don't care what anyone says... you're draggin' their punk♥♥♥♥♥in, dead or alive.

												I may not have played this much yet, but I emediately realised that it was as amazing as I remembered it to be from the old days.   The next thing I realised was that I had forgoten that when they ported it in HD they did not add any custom button layout options at all...  That honestly disapointed me a bit, because you either have to take your hand off of your mouse or ASDW to switch ammo types with the arrow keys...  Nah, no, that's not where that goes.  It should all be on the left side of the keyboard.  On a controller, reload should be the left-most button(X), melee is the right-most button(B)-- everyone knows this.			"

												Very funny game. After getting over its never worn out gimmick of off-brand humor, the game has great mechanics and is one of the most unique FPS games I've ever played. It was great to replay this on the PC after playing on original xbox so many years ago.			"

												TBH. I never played an oddworld game in my life before this. an even then you can see at time of review, I only have like almost 3 hours. When I saw this game debut way back when I was a teen on the verge of manhood. it filled me with such excitement, the very concept of this game. at the time I THINK ""Gun"" was around and I absolutely loved that game. This looked like that with a fantasy twist. So, to the game - It opens up with a cutscene, our Hero is collecting some critters you see him afterwards setting them up on the ground nice like. Orderly. he then procedes to cover them with brush. A few seconds later We see a big ol'fatty chasing something through some wooded brush, vines everywhere. Its quick. Hes consistently popping off rounds with his blunderbuss, an just as consistently missing. Eventually we see what hes chasing is actually our hero, a Feline like bounty hunter. Got the raspy cowboy voice an all. Leather vest, Cowboy hat. He quickly turns the chase around onto the other fella chasing him. He leads him to where he had laid those little critters he collected earlier. Turns out he was just leading the guy on all along. he had a trap waiting for him. Nasty little buggers jump and start gnawing on any part of that bubblin fool they can sink their teeth into. Our Hero, procedes to use another spider like critter to than ensnare his catch. Wanted, Dead or Alive. Luckily for him, The Hero, Known as the Stranger. Does not use firearms.This game is basically Dog the Bounty Hunter with Furries.			"

												The original version on the Xbox was one of my favorite games of all time. Having the same game with much better framerate and with KB+M controls made it even better. A fresh shooter with interesting mechanics like live ammo and bountying, and a great plot twist that keeps the game going strong until the very end. If you haven't played this game before, don't pass it up.			"

												A hidden gem to those outside of the ""oddworld"" genre. The game Blends third person and first person gameplay styles very well. A innovative weapon system has you shooting a variety of different critters at your enemies. All baddies have a bounty on their head and can be taken in dead or alive for different cash rewards. I love this game a lot, just the villager chickens loose their camedic charm after a little while and become annoying to be around. I give this game though a 8/10. Really good, just a few things that keep it away from that 10			"

												I usualy play games on easy mode the first time through, then go back and do it on the harder difficulties, and this game was no exeption. Still, I found myself challenged through the entire game having to redo a few parts of it. The story isn't amazing, but it is interesting and gave me a reason to keep playing when I felt like giving up and trying later. overall, it is a fun game with an interesting concept... but you will regret buying this if you start with hard mode.

												Was looking forward to playing this game, can't even get past the first area without it crashing for what seems to be no reason. I have tried messing with the compatibility and settings for the game itself. The game runs smoothly for the time I do get to play it in that area. But as soon as I run to move to the next area it crashes each and every time. Very disappointing, loved this game as a child and was happy to see it in steam. Saddens me to give it a bad review.			"

												A cool little game with a lot of charm to it.  I liked the western bounty hunter theme, and the living ammo was creative.  I also really liked a few of the story beats and set pieces.I will point out that a number of the achievements are broken, if you care about things like that. (like the difficulty setting achievment)			"

												So after buying this game so many monthes ago, I decided to give it another chance. Now first time around buying this. The game was highly unstable. Very sporadic frames and crashes. Later on it got updated and many (not all) issues were cleared up. This is where I finally gave it a second chance.Now lemme offer a little bit of backstory. Feel free to skip this paragraph by all means because it will cover nothing of the game itself. So at a much younger age, I was a kid easily fascinated with anything my best friend would bring to the table. Simply put because when your young all there is are the people around you and he was the only person who would ever spend time with me consecutively at least. So growing up we were into many things. Stuff that spanned from the super nintendo all the way to the xbox 360 as time progressed. Yet there were things we skipped out on. Even though we would go on to play the oddworld series, we would never cross over this game. Yet growing up Abe and the other mudokons were so fascinating to me. I could never get enough of them. This game series ended up being some of the fondest memories growing up. I'll never forget Abe nor the monsters that went well out of their way to kill him. Now back to the review. If you read the above paragraph you would understand that my affection for this gaming franchise runs deep. As a kid growing up this was the game in the series I could never stop looking at with envy. I always wanted to give it a try but at the same time I was wary of it. Because the elements I knew and loved were technically not in play. This was the first or second game to feature not only a new character but full 3D visuals. While this game wasn't setting out to be cutting edge it sure left an impression on me. If you've ever played an oddworld game you would feel immediately at home. It has yet another rich storyline to keep you going. Humor is heavily voiced at many times in this game. I never felt the need to force myself to continue through this game. It had very easy immersion and a very defined goal with a secret that I couldn't help but rush towards blindly. Unwary of fleeting danger soon to drown my character before I knew what happened. Everything in this game is perfect to me. The stuff that they did add into the game just added to the definition of the game itself. Tell me of another game where your only way to hunt down people with woodland creatures of nature. There is touching up on upgrades throughout the game so that you're never truely cliffed skill wise against your enemies. But that doesn't mean there is a lacking of challenge. There were plenty of times where I was ready to chuck my keyboard out the window. Yet in the end I feel I'm walking away enlightened and at a stronger state of mind thanks to the strong efforts of this team. If you like fast paced action, comedy, and puzzles. Then give this game a try. If I had any artistic capabilities I would eagerly try to match the art style of this game in an attempt to help make cards and emotes for this game because it deserves the publicity once again. This game deserves to have it's story conveyed higher then some titles out on the market these days. This is a heart felt story of a rise from the ashes to avenge the fallen for the sanctity of the mind. This shows that you shouldn't lay down silently while your fellow man falls victim to lies for you might one day find yourself being judged just the same. This game showcases the unity of beings and how small efforts can amount to something far greater. I can't say enough that the meaning behind this game is truely beautiful and I wish that anyone even considering this game or who is reading this that they will give in and try it. Because I feel that they would near instantly fall in love with it the way I did.			"

												Helpful information: The game will not run if you attempt to play it through steam, you have to use the launcher from the game’s folder. It will also run like absolute garbage unless you turn off the Anti-Aliasing.F1 and F5 are the default quick save and quick load keys.Aside from a couple of issues the game is actually pretty fantastic. It manages to blend first and third person views near flawlessly, the whole “critters as ammo” gimmick is unique, well fleshed out, and makes using the double barreled crossbow exceptionally entertaining to use. And then there are the bosses. They did an outstanding job on the bosses and managed to stick with allowing you to choose whether to take them out lethally or non-lethally. And on top of that its story is actually good.And the game practically oozes character. The mysterious stranger is everything you could want in a Clint Eastwood-esque bounty hunter and all of the locations feel well designed and are a joy to play in. It also seamlessly manages to combine a Western and Oddworld into something truly original and interesting. But there is also something else that this game has which you don’t really appreciate until its gone and that is a lack of “fluff.” Most games you get your upgrades and then there’s a sort of lull in the missions where they just kinda feel copy pasted and like they wanted to artificially pad out the campaign but I never really got that feeling with this game. Then there are those issues I mentioned. Controlling the character can act up in some circumstances where he will either get stuck on a flat surface, rotating when climbing ropes is reversed from what you might expect, capturing enemies defaults to third person mode so you have to switch back to first person manually every time, and there is a mildly infuriating to control boat section somewhere in there as well.But these are all minor complaints for an otherwise grand game that was highly enjoyable. Definitely buy it when it goes on sale.			"
