												Works on Win7 64 after manual editing of .ini file.The first game of one of the three major hero-based TBS series. The game has interesting visual style, awesome sound and music. It's a competent TBS with terraforming and simple utilitarian combat mechanics.The story is very good and the overall lore is pretty epic. The undead here are not a r–µtarded reskin of daemons as usuall, but true undead, with their own agenda, not necessary ""evil"". Especially considering their origin story. Even deamons' faction not just pure evil like everywhere else.The voice acting can scare some off, but it is very good and really appropriate to the world of Nevendaar. Sound design is vivid and grimdark. Visual style combines some asian animu tropes with western epic style and adds layer of gritty medieval realism. While the 3D pre-rendered sprites are surely outdated, they are not that bad. And all magic animations are purely awesome.			"

												It takes some time before running this old game on Steam....Now I am sure it's playable, so I give it a ""thumb up"".(Thanks to this post  http://steamcommunity.com/app/281450/discussions/0/613937943176590167/Disciples has a simple game machanic and epic background story. It's one of my favorite games. Now it's on Steam. Still the same good old game! They did not even fix the occasional color problem, and the yellow ""miss"" are still everywhere in battles! Good memories XDAlthough I will probably leave this game in my library instead of playing it...I had already played it for hundreds of hours when I still got a CD-rom on my computer...			"

												Around twenty years ago there's three leaders among fantasy TBS: Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Wonders and Disciples. All of these are beautiful gem of game design. No, really, everything in this old game is perfect. Balance is good, music is charming and atmospheric, the story is simple but catchy and the art is really cool.  Also it's worth to mention AI. Despite second part, here you really have to fight, even on the easy level.Speaking in two words: You HAVE TO PLAY it!			"

TLDR: Graphics, music, and voice-overs are ridiculously cheesy and dated, but overall a fun game with a 1990's nostalgic appeal to it.  Don't pay more than five dollars for it, and it will be worth the money.Pros:+ Decent variety of units, spells, and abilities+ Incorporates city building (even if not 4x-like)+ Has some story (lore) to go along with the gameplay+ Quasi-tactical considerations in building your groupsMids:* Music is very loud upon installation (fix in options)* Scroll is very fast upon installation (fix in options)* Even ""Low"" setting may be loud (fix with Windows volume mixer)Cons:- No tutorial, and manual is not very comprehensive- Learning curve for counter-intuitive controls/navigation- Dated graphics, cheesy music, and inane voice-overs- Very little depth - plays more like a Nintendo gameConclusion:When I first saw the game, I thought I would hate it.  In fact, it was collecting dust in my Steam inventory for over a year before I tried learning it (which required checking out some YouTube tutorial videos).Once I played it a bit, I realized that it's one of those perfect games to play when you are bored, but don't have the brain juice for anything complicated, and would just like to kill things and build stuff.Wouldn't pay anything over $5.00 for it, but it's a keeper - as long as you can see past the graphics, music, and sound effects.===================================Fixes:===================================Game Won't Run:Open ""Steam\steamapps\common\Disciples Sacred Lands Gold\EXE\DISCIPLE.INI"", and replace every instance of ""C:\Programm Files (x86)"" with actual Steam pathExample:If Steam was located on another drive, such as ""G:\Steam"", then open the file ""G:\Steam\steamapps\common\Disciples Sacred Lands Gold\EXE\DISCIPLE.INI"" with Notepad (or other text editor). Replace ""C:\Programm Files (x86)\"" with ""G:\""Note: Ignore quotes, which were only used for delineation.			"

												The Disciples series has always been one of those I hold close to my heart. I started out playing a demo for Disciples II: Dark Prophecy and fell in love with that game's dark atmosphere, music and gorgeous gothic illustration used for the UI and character portraits. I then saw Disciples: Sacred Lands on a shelf in Circuit City. It seemed so unassuming sitting there among all the more recent titles. And yet it was that game that my eyes were drawn too. I paid the ten dollars for the game and walked out of that store feeling as if I had stumbled upon the holy grail. Now things could have gone differently. I figured I loved Dark Prophecy so the first one had to be good too right?I got the game home opened up the nice little box the jewel case came in and installed the game. A gorgeous cutscene played and before long I was in the game and having a blast. The core mechanics that made Dark Prophecy such a joy were present here. And while the game wasn't quite as pretty as its successor it still was a gem. A diamond in the rough. Today when there are so many big budget games that turn out to be disappointments. Its nice to see a classic gem like this find new life through digital distribution. If you are a fan of the Disciples series or Disciples II Dark Prophecy you owe it to yourself to play this game. Now there may be some issues with getting this game to work on modern PC's. But there seem to be numerous ways of editing the ini file to get it to run properly. I imagine you could also try running the game/steam in compatibility mode.			"

												I remember my dad getting this game with me many years ago and I was way too young to really understand what was going on so cheated my way through the whole thing.  Then got Disciples 2 and spent far more time playing that one.  Now in recent days i've come back to the original and find that it has a shine to it that the second one just didn't have.  Might be the simpler charm, or the (in my opinion) far more gratifying attacks and sounds over it's sequel.  Still has a bit of a difficulty curve to it, something in common with it's protoge.  My friends had more trouble with it than I did and it can be a turn off if you don't have a mind that has molded to the setting and playstyle a bit.For the most part it was a great first entry in the series and still holds up to it's sequel (and in my opinion much better than the 3rds).  I would reccomend it to those who enjoy the turn based playstyle and an old fantasy setting driven by story with gratifying combat.			"

												I am a person who grew up playing JRPGs, but I've never been a big fan of some WRPGs or RPGs on PC. In my opinion, sometimes they seem to bog the player down managing trivial details such as repairing armor, managing backpack space, and the narrative falls far behind. I was pleased to see that this game has an interesting campaign and the gameplay does not bog the player down in senseless micromanaging. Disciples Gold: Sacred Lands is a pretty good, but dated game. I bought this on a steam sale for $0.79, and I think it will yield many great hours of gameplay. The game seems pretty well done as far as the presentation is concerned. The game play took a little bit of figuring out, but I'd say I've pretty well got it now and I've never read the manual. To me, it reminds me a little bit of warcraft when it comes to the overworld and resource management. The fights play out like a simplified version of a turn based game. You do not really control what actions the players take or the order in which they take turns, but you control who they attack or heal, as well as the ability to skip players or run away. So, in some regards, it plays out like a top down Strategy RPG, but instead of the fight actions being represented merely as points of damage, it goes to a separate fight mode where the player has the ability to influence the outcome of fights. Then after the fight is done, it goes back to the overworld.All in all, I'd recommend the game, especially if you can get it on sale. 79 cents is a steal, and I'll be looking forward to playing more of this game.

												Disciples is a great game. The game offers 4 playable races being the Empire, Demons, Dwarves or Undead. The game is interesting because you start with a hero being a Warrior, Mage or Archer all with their own game effecting benefits and you assemble a party and level them up. You also build up your castle with specific buildings to level up your party, example being Footmen needing a Stables to level up into a Knight. With that said you need resources and to acquire resources all you need is to convert land underneath easily noticed resources. One thing to note is: I've played all Sagas(campaigns) all offering challenge, but something I found a little disappointing is some of the maps were reused, just the advantage was flip flopped.Overall I rate this game 8/10 - Flawed but amazing nonetheless.

												Disciples, Sacred Lands. Interesting, very old game. Same type of game as Heroes of Might and Magic, really, except instead of running hero faces into things to claim them as yours, every city you take expands a land of influence that takes gold mines and magic crystals for you. Unlike most old games, it doesn't suffer from horrific UI (looking at you, X-COM) though that is probably lent to by its simplistic nature.			"
