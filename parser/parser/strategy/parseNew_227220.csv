												""A great and unique trap-based spin on the tower-defense genre"" is the best way I can sum up Sang-Froid with.What does it have going for it?- Two characters to choose from.- Character development, both in terms of equipment and skills.- Good enemy variety, which will force you to adapt and evolve your strategies.- An interesting story.- A compelling artstyle.- Catchy ""folk"" soundtrack.What could be better?- The fighting system variety, which could be better.- Performance, which weren't great on my system, but still good enough to beat the game two times.- The English voice acting for some of the characters (the best voice is definitely the Devil's, though!)- The experience system, which is pretty basic in what it does while it could be much more.- The weapons system, which could use less straightforward upgrades and more sidegrades to choose from (similarly to the trinkets, where you only have 3 slots but have multiple useful things to choose in between).Overall, aside these minor issues, Sang-Froid is an absolutely entertaining game, deserving to be played at least once per character to experience both difficulties provided... and to prepare yourself for Tome II.

												Really enjoying this unique spin on the tower defense genre.The voice acting and writing is not very good, and the melee combat is unrefined but everything else (visuals, sound, overall story and controls) comes together wonderfully.Spend the daylight deciding what supplies you need, bullets (normal, blessed or silver) buying new weapons or armor or charms or just a lot of beer and whiskey. Lay out tons of traps and zip line towers to foil all the things that howl in the night. Will your preperations and timing be perfectly planned or will you be scrambling to save everyone from the wolves with your quick wits and blessed axe.			"

												A refreshing take on tower defense strategy with with a supernatural theme. Nice musical scoring, sound effects and a decent albeit simplistic storyline makes it more believable and immersive. It's quite addictive once you get into it. It's kinda short but I think has some decent replay value as the game's many traps, weapon types, magical artifacts and terrain based tactics provide for alot of flexibility and different approaches to progressing through the levels. There is also of course a fairly typical multi-branch skill tree that lets you develop your style however you want.You basically plan your strategy and setup your traps during the day and then execute it at night, the object being to survive and make it to the next night, which progressively gets more difficult. There are many areas of the map that need defending, so careful planning, timing and execution are essential. And the devs of course left the ending wide open for a sequel which I can say I'm looking forward to. Definitely worth picking up on sale.			"

												I've never played anything quite like Sang-Froid before and I'm sure you haven't either. If you took lumberjacks and werewolves and threw them in a blender with Rainbow Six's careful planning (and executing of said plans), the frenetic and intense last stand dynamics and overwhelming sense of impending doom of the movie Zulu, and a hearty glug of Canadian folklore, you'd be getting close to what Sang-Froid is all about. It's unique, refreshing, clever, thrilling, gorgeous and has a fantastic folk soundtrack to boot. One of my games of the year without a doubt.			"

Overall rating:9.5/10Highly recommended. Among the best games that I have ever played. Must play!""Atmospherically brilliant. Sometimes brutally unforgiving.""About the game (minimal spoilers):You play as either 'Jos' or 'Jacky': Two brothers, fighting to survive the night at their father's old wooden hut on the outskirts of a tiny snow-covered Canadian town. They are drawn together following the unexplained and sudden illness of their sister. She is far too unwell to be moved, and a broken bridge blocks safe travel to medical help and supplies. However, this soon becomes the least of your worries as strange packs of wolves begin appearing every night. You must face the reality that you and a handful of simple traps are all that stand between your sister and the evil that comes every time the moon rises. Plan well, fight bravely, and aim true, as the threat grows with every passing night...Will you survive the night, or will you be ripped apart by tooth and claw and malice?Helpful hints:  DON'T save up all your gold. Buy the double barreled musket; buy the ~3.5g axe. Holy weapon bless your melee weapon asap! Save your  fiery hits for engaging enemies with a higher fear factor than yours, then keep smacking them while they are still getting up. Don't put points into ranged skills. Avoid ranged, it's crap. Stay away from walls when attacking. (P.s. Using healing potions ruins the challenge.Jacky (big guy) is way too easy) Pro's and con's: [/u]-- Pro's: The setting was so, so enjoyable. This includes the main map layout and design, and the geographical setting as well. The story is great, breaking away slightly from the norm. Loved the survival element. No save-loading!! You either had what it took to live or you got ripped apart. Steep learning curb. Great selection of traps. Each had their own unique function. The melee combat style was difficult but rewarding. You had to learn when to hit, when to dodge, when to use your enraged hits. Don't think that just because you are swinging your axe you're not gonna get a claw to the face >:D Thoroughly enjoyed the crunching of snow beneath your feet, and wolves holwing, and ravenous eating noises when consuming baits, and  the whole forrest of evil creatures joining in a chorus of howling when you died. It was beautifully atmospheric, but never annoying. The sound of children singing or people moving around, out of view, during cutscenes or when visiting the village was some nice production quality. The tutorials were informative and effective. The gradual availability of traps as you progressed through the game was useful in not overwhelming the player, and also avoided the use of instant-win tactics, such using mass Fire Walls to funnel enemies towards your swining axe from lvl 1. Some of the voice actors were quite good. Particularly the Mayor, who, also played the voice of the Hermit, too.[/list]-- Con's:  In order of emphasis Almost a 10/10. Everything not mentioned was perfect! Those f*****g walls!!!Avoid touching walls during combat, because it glitches the swing timer, making attacking enemies hit twice as fast. Needs more weapon variants, and trinkets!!! Please, for the love of loot! The MONEY!!! There is a steam achievement for having 15 gold saved up. By the end of the game I had 50gold!!! In 1858 50gold was a huge amount of money. If you play efficiently (for me efficiency is the driving force of my gameplay) you soon amass a ridiculous amount of gold. There was NOTHING TO BUY by HALF-WAY through the game. The developers need to add some meaningful item upgrades so that players don't waste their time planning long and hard to efficiently fight the darkness. Why?? are there so many empty slots in the vendors' inventories? That's just deceiving to players, whom think that they should save up.Either fill those up with new items, or REMOVE the empty slots. Why?? Do the Mayor's House and the Church never become accessible? Please add more content. The starting axe (with a holy blessing endowed upon it) will last you until about 16th December.  (Keep in mind i was playing the NON-melee guy) That is pretty ridiculous if you ask me.   You even get a FREE axe which is effective against all enemy resistance types on 20th December, I think  so there's no point upgrading if you know what you're doing.  Ranged was completely unviable - too few weapon variants - targetting was slow - auto-aim hindered headshots - couldn't shoot enemies already beneath towers. Melee too powerful, even as Jacques WITHOUT melee-oriented skills, and the level 1 axe.[/u] There are a few 'invisible walls' on the map, which you eventually become familar with and learn to avioid, but which cause a lot of frustration when you get stuck. Eg trying to run over a small mound or between trees. Cannot snipe from an overhead path - can only shoot enemies while they are on the same path as you. Few minor bugs, such as the Spike Trap (which requires 3 enemies standing on it in order to trigger) only hitting 2 enemies. That f******g spike trap!! Got me so many times as I ran hordes of enemies over it, DESPITE me being an easy 5 metres outside of it's boundary. Please fix this bug. Every now and then an enemy will drop aggro while you are running away (despite his friends keeping aggro). Sometimes the Will-O-the-Wisps will appear on the other side of the map if you move from where they were when they went underground. Occassionally, an enemy will hit you while they are still on the ground. Jacques (the trap-oriented guy) is usually forced to rely too heavily on melee in order to be money-efficient. Felt that the traps weren't really as useful or permanent as they could have been. For example, the spike trap (pretty expensive really) might have remained after being initially triggered, doing a further 10 damage to the first two enemies to run over it. Maybe an option to reset wolf trap. (I chose Trap Guy, but prefered melee due to traps being less viable). There are some common fantasy themes of good vs evil, as well as some pretty standard tropes such as the helpless female, and the  evil guy in power - ie. the Mayor . These are a little overdone, particularly the way the writers make it very obvious whether someone is 'good' or 'bad.' Also, everything is black-or-white in the sense that someone is either a 'good guy' or a 'bad guy.' The writers could have brought in some shades of grey by looking at the human element of the decisions they make (  beyond the ridiculous reasons for the priest doing what he did, which seemed unrealistic and nonsensical ). Yet, you can't ask for too much from an Indie title. The character modelling was a little poor in places. Particularly Jacques.. and the Mayor's chin :P The was this blurry white glow on the ground surrounding the player, which looked visually unpleasant. The blanket over Josephine would always jerk suddenly a few inches over her body for a few seconds before her rising off the bed a few seconds afterwards. This was obviously an animation issue, to avoid showing her lower half, but it was low production quality and could have been a more fluid motion. Needed a 'don't show me this message again' feature to initiating a game with unspent skill points, and when you're low on ammo. Clicking it gets really old when you are saving skill points up for reaching level 14. Needed to have a 'save current twilight layout' option, so that if you had to stop playing you didn't have to redo your whole setup. Needed a 'refund skill points' button. Even if one-use only, or costly.[/list]			"

												Where to begin with this one? It's a fairly unique game that takes things from various genres. During the day - You place traps in an overhead view of the surrounding buildings you're meant to protect. You can go to town and shop for a new gun/axe, buy some potions (beer), and buy ammo. There's also a church that can bless some bullets or your axe for a fee. You may also upgrade your character with skillpoints gained from levels. They range from using your gun better, having more stamina/health to upgrading your traps so they last longer/do more damage. The trap upgrades are generally visual upgrades too. The enemies come in waves and each have their own path and target to the building shown. It even shows you the route they are planning to take to get there. Most damaging traps do not go off on their own. They are not place and forget for the most part. The automated ones generally are meant to slow down the beasts instead of kill outright. Placing a hanging net for instance (with which rocks are on top of) can only be deployed by shooting at it from a distance. To get the enemies to stand under it, however, you can place bait beforehand. They'll stay there and eat it until done...or die from your trap. There's also a spike trap that DOES go off automatically but only if 3 or more creatures are standing on it at the same time. Grouping the monsters together and making sure a lot of them go toward 1 bait/trap can be achieved by using a ""fire wall"" that blocks whatever path you so desire. The enemies that were going to head that way will now go a different route (the path will update as well) to their target building.During the night - You run around in 3rd person with your axe and musket. Before each new wave begins you have about 10 seconds to get into a better positon for the oncoming attack. Later levels this is important because the next area you might have to defend could possibly take you over 30 seconds to get there even if sprinting. Using your axe in melee combat is fairly basic and you can build up ""rage points"" that let you do special attacks. Using the gun, however, is difficult because this is the early 19th century. These guns are slow and take quite a while to reload....and you have 1 shot. The only way you'll be able to reload in combat is if the enemies are very far away or you have a greater fear factor than they do. Enemies grouped together (even weak ones) will not fear you (despite how manly you look). Alone, however, they will hesitate to attack you and the game shows you how long before the next attack. They also are afraid of bonfires (which you can place during the day) that you can light to give you a boost in fear temporarily. Then you fight through each wave until you're finished and it begins again the next in-game day. Failing a night will happen if some monsters end up destorying a building. It might sound simple, but in actual practice a fair amount of thought will go into your planning stage each day and then everything must work out as you hoped during the night...Beyond that, the story and the music's alright, nothing to write home about. Certainly could have been improved but it did the trick. Voice acting is okay too. Not great, but it's decent enough. The graphics fit the bill as well, but no more. The art style and UI was great and stylized though. The only other complaints I have about the game is that it's just not as polished as I would have liked. It's an indie game and they did great work, but preformance was just...all over the place for me. It never ran very well. That and sometimes the steam achievements didn't work. This is a known issue, but no fix for it. People are still talking about in the community hub forums.To wrap this up - Amazing game with great premise and I really hope they're going to make a 2nd game. This is supposedly  ""Tome 1"" so I hope there's more....especially with that ending. If they can learn from this game and improve upon it in the slightest I will be right there waiting to give them my money.			"

												""During the winter of 1858 something happened in lower Canada, near Wolvesvale.No one truly remembers what happened, but rumor has it that the DEVIL came to town......and that two lumberjacks hunted down his minions every night.They were, the OCARROLL BROTHERS!With solid PLANNING during the day...and cold EXECUTION at night......they became FEARLESS!""That's how the devs summarized the game in its trailer, and there's really not much to add to it. One of the best games I've ever played, worth every penny. Only downside I could think of is the lack of local and/or online co-op, though the devs were thinking of it for a possible sequel...This game is a great mix strategy, action, rpg and tower defense genres where you take the role of the O'carroll brothers, who are being besieged by Devil's minions, which are composed of all kind of wolves, werewolves and other mythical creatures.To protect each other and their cabin, they will have to plan during the day the strategy to follow at night, using their sister's foretelling powers to determine the number, type, wave and initial spawn point of the enemies that will attack during the night.With that information you will have to set up the traps for them, and even go to town to buy guns and items. But one must be wise spending their money and/or action points in doing so.Night starts as a tower defense game where you have to avoid enemies from destroying your buildings, though you can(and must) take direct action and activate some traps manually, or kill the enemies which haven't fell on them; since the game also features wind, which can render useless all your setup if you are detected when least expected.As for the rpg part, game features a complete set of skills to customize and develop your style by improving your character and traps in the way that fits you better.Have to say that game can be very, very punishing with poor planning and/or execution and stealth. It's actually quite challenging since you will have to set up your traps, then memorize the enemies, waves and spawn points in order to pull it off correctly and quickly under pressure and against the clock(not an actual timer, though the game is quite fast paced)...Last but not least, game's atmosphere and music are really sublime.

												A very canadian game about two lumberjack brothers who must protect their fevered sister from hordes of wolves send by the devil.And then things get weird...This game could be called a ""Strategic Trap Defense Game"" in spite of ""Orcs Must Die!"", only much more slow-paced. The gameplay is split in two parts: 1. The Strategy part: This is where you place your traps on a strategic map of the in-game location and take preperations for the night to come. The map shows you what enemies will appear, where they appear and which route they take. There's a variety of different weapons, items and accessoires you can buy in the shops that will help you to survive and you can change your loadout as you like. There are, of course, limitations in form of Action Points and Money. Every trap costs a different amount of Money and AP and once you run out of one (or both), you have to get along with what you prepared. There's also a Skill-Tree. Each time you level up you gain a skill point which can be used to further advance your traps or abilities in combat. 2. The Combat part: Where you fight enemies in a sort-of hack and slash manner and see how well your traps work. Lure the enemies in your traps and kill or weaken them and finish 'em off in close-combat. Your weapons of choice here are a axe and a musket, which has tremendous reloading time so you should reload it whenever you can catch a breath (you can speed it up by mashing the RMB but it still takes time). Naturally not all enemies will be killed by traps, especially since every trap only works once a night and the latter chapters have much stronger and more enemies, so get ready for some unfriendly close encouters. However, the game is never unfair and you can pretty much deal with anything as long as you're well prepared.The graphics are done in a well-mannered and eye-pleasing cartoony style way. The sound works prefectly (no glitches or anything) and fits the aesthetics and the music is catchy as hell, especially the title tune is really addicting.There are, however, some technical shortcomings I have to point out:1. You can't change the settings in-game. You have to go back to the main menu, basically ending your game, to get to the options menu, which is a really poor developer decision even for a indie-game.2. This is mostly a personal problem: Performance-wise it runs really unstable as long as V-Sync isn't active. Heavy frame-rate drops made the game run like a slideshow for me. Worst part is this really messed up my controls, I literally had to mash the mouse buttons so my character wouldn't just stand there like an idiot and letting himself get killed. Only after I enabled V-Sync the game would run acceptable for me.3. No Window-Mode, but thats no real issue for me. Just pointing out in case someone wants to know.Apart from those few problems it's a real fun game and if you like games like ""Orcs Must Die!"" or are looking for a different kind of strategy game, this one might be for you.

												This is not a tower defence game! It is a Hero defence game.It is a strategic action RPG game with linear story line where you play as one of the two playable character to defend the buildings primarily your own home from enemies such as wolves and werewolves. It has a very good tutorial and guide system that slowly implement new stuffs on each day and video guides that shows how the stuffs are used. Game will get tougher and tougher each day as more and stronger enemies will be introduced each night. More traps and buildings will be introduced as days pass by to help mitigate the stronger enemies. Game can be frustrating to play if you are a perfectionist trying to clear each night with as little points and $ as possible as it is not easy to fight a pack of wolves that swarm over you. Patience and tolerance will be needed as retries and restarts will be needed to re-plan, set more traps and fight again and again. You start everyday in a stategic/tactical phase where you can plan and set up traps, buy stuffs and equip the items and upgrade skills.( remember to upgrade income from woodcutting before cutting wood on that day)After planning, setting up and prepared, the action part of the defend will start at night/evening. Attack is pretty simple and standard with only 2 types of weapons available, axes and rifle. Melee attacks are mostly left clicks that auto aim at nearest target and a special 'rage' attack with a right click. Mastering when to attack, rest, dodge is important as each attack, dodge and run require stamina which run dry quickly. Rifle is a shoot and load system like musket which is very easy to use with its aiming system.The bad part of this game is most traps needs to be activated by the player and thus good planning is needed to clear the enemies all over the area. The melee attack is not very smooth to me and will take time to master as I keep failing to land blows especially the rage attack. This game lacks multiplayer co-op play which will be more fun to play.  I have cleared half of this game in hard difficulty and it is getting more and more difficult to play. My last game day took me 8 retries. Overall it is a fulfilling game to play after completing each day without trying to spend more. Update: completed hard. Awesome finale. Just realise that this game is just tome 1 and there might be a sequel incoming. Will be interesting if more stuffs and coop play introduced.			"

												I have to admit this game took me by surprise. I got it in a bundle and while it looked interesting, I put off playing it for several months. In fact the only reason I started playing in June was because of a promotion to earn credit on GMG for getting achievements, but I got drawn into the game and played the campaign to completion. And just about every aspect of it was great.The game has a very unique setting, in fact as far as I know it is the only video game ever made that takes place in 1858 French Canada. As someone with an interest in history, this was really cool to me. Considering how many games these days reuse the same tired settings over and over (genric scifi/fantasy, generic urban setting, modern war, WWII, etc.) it’s nice to see more games like this that finally start to tap the vaults of history for unique settings that have never been done before. Some people might consider the story a bit simplistic, but it’s still really good and somewhat unique. It centers around two lumberjack brothers, and their struggle to defend their sister, their home, and the surrounding area and people from creatures controlled by the Devil and other malicious forces. The story is told through cinematics and in-game cutscenes. The cinematics appear somewhat sparsely throughout the game, but they feature nice high quality artwork. Some may be disappointed that these cinematics are pretty low on actual animation, but considering this is an Indie game I can forgive that, and they still get the job done. The in-game cinematics, which feature the character models from the game, are also decent. I cringed a little bit at the voice acting at first, but as I kept playing I got used to it. It varies between the characters, some aren't that great and some are really quite good and fit the game very well. It's an Indie game so don’t expect AAA voice acting. In terms of dialogue, Jos can be a bit cringe-worthy at times with his simple meat-headed approach to everything, but most of the dialogue isn't bad once you get into the game. Obviously the story is a bit silly with the werewolves and magic and everything, so you have to have the right mindset coming into the game. At the same time, though, I think it is a good story that can be taken seriously with the right approach. Now, for the gameplay. Basically, at the start of the game, you choose which brother you want to play as. One acts as the “normal difficulty” mode, while the other acts as the “hard mode”. I only played through the campaign once so far, with the “normal” character. Basically, during the day you have a map of the woods around your cabin. Each day (the game takes place over a few weeks in December 1858 and each day is like a level) the map changes a bit, as new paths are revealed and there are new buildings you must defend. Looking at the map, you can see the paths the enemies will take in each wave (augured by the sister with mystical powers), and place a variety of different traps accordingly. Each trap takes a certain number of “action points” (which represent time for the characters) to set, and some also cost money. There are a variety of different cool traps that are unlocked as you progress, like wolf traps, exploding barrels, ballistae, and mortars, and other helpful things like watchtowers and bonfires. There is a lot of strategy involved in where you place your traps, and it’s awesome to see the plan you worked hard on play out perfectly during the night. During the day, you can also visit the nearby village, and later the Amerindian tribe, to stock up on supplies and buy new weapons. The game also features a pretty big skill tree, allowing you to upgrade a lot of different aspects of your character and traps. It’s simple to use and it really adds a lot of depth to the gamplay deciding which skills you want to upgrade and when for best strategy. During the night, the game becomes a third person action game. Many traps require some action on your part to be used, and most of the time you will also have to engage in fights against the enemies that the traps didn’t kill. You have an axe for a melee weapon and a musket or rifle for longer ranged attacks. The combat is a bit a basic, but it does have a really unique feature called “fear factor”. Basically there is a meter showing how frightened your enemies are of you. Over time they muster up for an attack as the meter reaches a certain point, and sometimes they become enraged and are no longer affected by the meter. You can do a number of things to bring the meter down before an enemy becomes enraged, such as shouting or standing near a bonfire. Keeping your enemies afraid of you offers more depth to the combat, and gives you time to reload your musket or regain some stamina. Overall it works well and makes the combat really great. Being surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves, watching as they slowly circle you, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, is a thrilling experience, and I’ve never seen anything quite like it in a video game before.The music in the game is fantastic. Every track is great and fits the game well, and I never got tired of hearing it. I should mention that this game can be surprisingly immersive, and the music really helps with that. The game also features interesting descriptions of the items, characters, and their backstories, so there is a lot of lore outside the cutscenes. For example, each axe and musket and some other items have a description detailing things like the year it was made, and what it was used for, etc. History buffs will probably enjoy this. There is also a lot of lore surrounding the enemies which relates to diabolism/demonology and/or pagan mysticism, which will probably be cool if you’re into stuff like that. A lot of it actually turns the traditional Werewolf lore on its head, and it brings in some elements from Amerindian culture for certain other enemies, so there’s definitely a lot of unique and original ideas going on here. With the great music and the attention to detail in the sound, text, and visuals, I found myself getting very immersed in the setting, even while just visiting the different shops and buying supplies. In terms of longevity, I got about 16 hours out of my first playthrough of the campaign, and enjoyed just about every minute of it. Of course your mileage may vary, but I’d say that’s pretty damn good for a campaign mode in this day and age. Of course it also has replayability, as you can play through the whole game again as the other brother, and have a slightly different experience.The graphics are nothing to write home about. It’s got a nice cartoony style that works well, but it’s nothing particularly impressive. I don’t have any complaints about it, I’m just saying you shouldn’t expect AAA graphics. However, the artwork featured throughout the game is really nice for the most part.There isn’t much to complain about. The game does lack a bit of polish in some places. The text is a bit sloppy sometimes, there’s a few noticeable bugs and glitches, and as I stated earlier the voice acting and dialogue isn't perfect. The game also seems to have some framerate issues for me sometimes, though it doesn’t detract from the game too much (I have a very capable desktop though so there’s no reason this game should have issues).Overall, this game is absolutely fantastic. Sure there are a few small issues, but they barely detract from everything that is great about this game. I highly recommend this game at any price you find it at. I got it in a really cheap bundle, but I almost wish I paid more now. Considering how great this games is, I think the devs deserve some compensation. So don’t delay, if you are even remotely interested in action, strategy, or tower defense, or just want a unique and immersive game, you will probably love this. If you want a number rating I would give it a 9.5/10.			"

												Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves is an amazing little game that really forces you to use your brain; a great combination between a strategy (tower defense style) game and a role playing game. Would rate it at 8 out of 10.Pros:- While it does have a linear path, it offers you with a lot of freedom on choosing the way you treat every quest (night), so it offers the possibility to replay it (dunno if really over and over again, but for sure for a few times)- Nice story, music and graphics (although cartoonish) that all contribuite to a nice immersion within the game- Offers both an easy and hard mode (plus any extra challenges you may set to yourself - like not use all action points or so), as well as optional strategy hints so it can fit a wide range of players (skillwise / smartwise)Cons:- Rather limited content - is the kind of game you fall in love, play for a whole night or some solid hours during weekend and finish it; you can try to replay it a few more times, but ultimately is not the kind of game to keep you busy for months.What I see this game great, even after you finished it and got bored of it, is as a distraction for guests (of any age) staying on your place for a few days and wanting to play something fun, but which doesn't requires a commitment / continuation. Could even see it as a group action where everyone colaborates with their thoughts on how to survive the night to come. :)			"

												A unique game that blends the tower defence and action genres in a very clever way. You play the part of one of the legendary O'Carroll brothers, trying to defend yourself and your sister from various evil creatures of the night, like possesed wolves, werewolves and some mythical beings refered to as the Maikans. To help you with this task, you have an axe for close combat and a rifle for ranged. Still, your weapons will not be enough, as your enemies are stronger and greater in numbers. That's where strategy comes into use. During the day, evil sleeps, so it's your chance to place traps in the forest. When night comes, those decisions will either save you or lead you to your doom. The graphics are okay (they look a bit outdated at times though), the sound effects and music are great and the gameplay is very challenging and rewarding; the game's strongest point. Seriously, don't miss this game. Thumbs up, all the way!			"

												This game is a gift to all gamers... It is a masterpiece. I believe its price and constant promos are evidence that you cannot price something so unique.Tower defense. Action. Strategy and RPG. All in 1 game but masterfully intertwined. You basicly gota defend your farm against werewolves and other creatures alike. You have a planning phase where you can place a whole array of traps and interesting devices. Before this phase you have an RPG phase where you can buy pots and better weps and armor. Why?Because you have an action phase after the strategy part, where you get to hack n slash and shoot everything that does or doesnt get caught in the traps you've set.  Basicly if you wana go straight to action (action) you can spec and gear (rpg) and ignore the trap setting (strategy) part.Seriously the gameplay is really fun. The difficulty progression is really well made and the story is quite entertaining aswell.I just cant wait for a sequel and i definetly recommend this work of art to anyone anyone that enjoys a good game. May it be action or rpg or strategy. this game has it all in a amazingly crafted mechanic and wrapped in a beautiful story and graphics. PS the music is as unique as the whole concept of the game and fits really well.			"

												Sang-froid's gameplay is phenomenal: The pre-battle trap-setting is immensely satisfying and rewards strategic thinking, which is further intensified by a fantastic skill-tree! If you do a good job before battle, you won't have to rely too much on the combat, which is mostly tedious (although the fear-factor system is genius). There are other issues with the gamee, for example the linear weapon upgrades, which ipso facto limits you to buy a new weapon mid and end-game at the most. Also, the story-telling might disagree with some people, personally I think it went well with the general late 19th century-mystic-goldrush-werewolves-dark woods atmosphere (brilliant!).I seriously hope the devs have planned another game of the sort, I wouldn't even mind a sequel. Thanks for a great game and bonne chance pour le suivant!			"

An enticing fusion of tower defense and 3rd person action RPG subgenres.Summary:The unification of these two genres has shown to elevate both of them. No longer are you viewing strategy purely as an observer who can blame failure on poor NPC AI. Similarly, slamming your axe into wave after wave of enemies becomes a more elegant, finessed activity when you have a plan to follow. This is Sang-Froid's strongest element. Its unusual setting in an unspecified part of lower Canada in December of 1858 is a delight. Its lively soundtrack is wonderful as well. Unfortunately, the storytelling aspects bear hallmarks of a low budget project. Edit: The developers have generously made this game free as of February 2017! This is the real deal as the product has not been updated or changed in any way.Full review:It is immensely satisfying to experience a plan coming together successfully in each of the 20 missions in this game. Initiating each stage brings you to an overhead map showing all the adversaries you will face and what their target is. It is then your job to choose where to place traps that are selected from a steadily growing list of options. Some trigger on their own when enemies are nearby but most require you to activate or aim them. Resources are limited so you'll need to try to find the most efficient combinations. Varying enemy types, each with specific resistances and weaknesses means that you can't get too comfortable by relying on just a few favorite trap types.Mission progression is smooth with something unique happening in nearly all of them. Sometimes you are given access to a new trap, other times the map is expanded with a new area to defend and still other times you must complete an action dictated by the story. I found the difficulty to be spot on. You are given the option of playing as one of two brothers but both play more similarly to one another than the game leads you to believe. Jos is bigger and slower than his brother but has a larger health pool. He is considered the Normal difficulty character while his brother, Jack, is labeled Hard. I played as Jos and then tried out the first several levels as Jack. At a glance, the skill tree that you fill out as you level up appeared to be the same for both brothers.Descending from your cloud top view into the chaos of combat you shift gears to a fast and focused style of action. You often find yourself moving from trap to trap to trigger them as attackers arrive. You'll also need to plug gaps in your trap defenses by meeting the beasts head on. When it comes down to it, combat is quite simple. You can perform a basic three-hit combo, execute an occasional power attack or fire your rifle at them. Your musket reloads slowly, so it's really only feasible to do so in between groups of foes. You'll hardly notice the simplicity though for how big a part traps play. There is also a fear mechanic that can cause opponents to pause before attacking you, making it easier to deal with packs.Money is gained by killing enemies and can be conserved by choosing less expensive traps. The town of Wolvesvale has several shops that you can visit in-between missions. There you can buy a range of items from new axes and guns to consumables and accessories with useful effects like increasing your Stamina pool. Retrying stages is easy with the option to either restart from scratch or keep your current trap layout if you think you'll only need to make a tweak or two. Players who regularly game on PC will find the controls intuitive and easy to pick up. There are a few minor quirks in controlling actions that don't feel smooth like switching to your gun immediately after swinging your axe. There is also an odd delay between when you stop sprinting and when you can start sprinting again, even if your Stamina is not depleted. It's worth noting that this game loads slowly, even on a solid state drive. The longest loading screen by far is when you first launch the game and that has the game's most memorable tune playing to keep you distracted.Cutscenes mostly play out in a live theater-like style. The backdrops don't fill up the entire screen and characters enter from the left and right to talk to each other. While the writing and voice acting are not very good, this setup can give it a strangely charming, cheesy stage show feel to it. There is some purposeful comedy present but at times I had a hard time discerning what was so-bad-it's-funny dialogue and what was intentional humor. The plot is a tale of mysticism and werewolves that isn't particularly memorable, though it does set a effective mood for the action. Depending on which brother you choose there are differences in the dialogue but the overall plot remains the same.I love the setting of this game. It is the snowy winter in a fictional southern Canadian logging town with a stated population of around 400. The types of people you'll meet there seem fitting for this remote lifestyle. This place is represented by an art style that gets the atmosphere right even if it lacks detail, polish and modern polygon counts. Its weaknesses aren't offensively bad but it does benefit from the dark lighting of nighttime play. Great ambient sound and music from French-Canadian composers further elevate the atmosphere of the game and also help to keep your attention off of any rough edges the visuals have.A closing note that I find interesting: Sang-Froid translates in French to literally ""cold blood"". In regular use it means ""coolness and composure, especially in trying circumstances"". That's a fitting descriptor for these two very capable brothers that find themselves in spectacular circumstances, under siege and with no one to call for help.			"

												(warning my spelling and grammer sucks, read at your own risk)This game was an amazing experience, and well worth 15 dollars. I usually don't write reviews, and when i do, it means i was extremely satasfied. It has a nice plot, 2 brothers protecting their sister from an army sent by the devil, Fun! The story is really good. The mechanics are good, has its kinks but nothing bad enough to mention. This game proves to be a challange too, Every night you have to defend multible buildings from multible waves of enemies. I can not stress this out enough, YOU WILL NEVER BE OP, 80% of the enemies in this game are much MUCH stronger then you and can kick your♥♥♥♥♥ To stay alive you need to play smart, never just rush into a fight, sure you could swing your axe blindly at the enemy, but it will only be good for about five swings, then you will be lucky to hit anything, and while you are sitting there  trying to get your stamina back the horde of monsters will be beating up on you, unless of coarse your fear factor is high enough, but you will learn about all that in game. I will now put down the pros and consPros:1. Great story line2. Great soundtrack3. Beutiful artwork4. Forces you to come up with a top notch stradegy for each night5. Its a breath of fresh air from the norm of todays stradegy and action games.6. Some other stuff, its almost midnight as i type this im tired ;-;Cons: 1. Heavily influenced by christianity, im a christian and i enjoy this but i understand that there are gonna be some people who dont want to play a game dealing with a religion that they dont follow. 2. At times a few of the enemies will keep spamming their fastest attack and you will not be able to land a hit on them, but dont let that stop you, you can always shoot them right? :D3. Also dealing in religion, if you are christian and you are easily bothered by anything dealing with the devil, you may want to avoid this game because the devil is a character that appears alot throughout the story. Though just keep in mind you are fighting an army of warewolfs and other beasts controlled by him :DHopefully this review is enough to convince some people to buy this game, if you do here is a word of warning, take your time when preparing for the nights because if your stradegy is off by just a tiny bit, everything could possibly go HORRIBLY WRONG, but you will have a chance to fix things while hell is breaking loose :D happy hunting everyone.

 Sang-Froid - Tales of Werevolves	 is a cute, atmospheric indie tower-defense game set in 19th century Canada, involving a stand against occult forces unleashed upon a family of two brothers and a sister. It has a nice visual style, interesting (yet simple) story and quite the content for the buck. With a solid arsenal of unlockable traps and weapons, as well as skills to build, the game offers a pleasant and intellectually stimulating experience.With various possible approaches to the missions chapters the game has a bit of something both for players who prefer fighting and those who prefer tactics. Yet, it seems that Sang-Froid is not as rewarding for players who carefully plan out their defenses as it should be, because with careful placement of traps and minimum involvement in combat, I was constantly out of money and struggled to get the best equipment in the first half of the game. Only after few chapters, did I discover that I could just buy potions and kill enemies, thus saving money for the equipment. And that's a shame, because I would rather be rewarded for playing smart instead of casual. This aspect of the game is also illustrated by the fact that the character gains experience both for succeeding and failing the missions, which allows to unlock new skills either way, thus becoming stronger. It means that you can just grind through stat boosts, save money for better weapons and almost forget about trap placement in the first part of the game.All in All Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves is a very nice Indie tower-defense Game!10/10 From Me Sweep "

												One of the most unique games I've played, and lots of fun. The traps are all thoughtfully designed, and none of them seem redundant. They must be used carefully and in concert with each other, and this makes planning your defense interesting, varied, and challenging. The atmosphere of the game is fantastic.			"

												Sang-Froid Tales of Werewolves is a game that is tough but fair. Artifice Studio did a great job of makeing a game that challenges, but never to the point where I wanted to give up. Each defeat filled me with the desire to rush back to the planning mode to ajust my strategy. But I am getting ahead of myself.The Game takes place near a small town in the Candian wilderness in The late 1800's, and features an enjoyable Traditional Candian Folk sountrack. This combinded with details like diffrent Alcoholic beverages that each have a blurb describing their historic usage, and provides buffs in battle, the two main charicters being lumberjacks, and the small town that you vist to purchase supplies work in concert to create the feeling that you are playing through a genuine Canadian Folk tale. This is only slightly hamperd by the sub par voice acting, (my biggest gripe with the game) and the somewhat outlandish traps that you gain access to later in the game.Gameplay consistes of two main segments. The first is a planning mode which allows you to spend your money and time units to purchase goods at the afformenioned town, and build traps to help fend off wolves. The second involves fighting the wolves useing the traps you have set up in the first mode along with your musket and axe. The former is where the real meat of the game is, as planning ways to deal with the hoards of wolves with your traps is imperative to surviving the night. It is also where the game really shines, all of the traps and items are useful and fun to use, and the game requires you to be clever with their placement. On top of this the devlopers also did a great job of easing the player into the game by slowly increasing the size of the map, adding aditional objectives to defend, and giveing you access to more traps.Overall I genuinely enjoyed my expericence with Sang-Froid Tales of Werewolves and recomend it higly if you are a fan of stratagy games.

Posted: June 14, 2014
												Easily one of the best and most unique games I've have ever encountered.+Well crafted role-playing elements+Best skill tree I've seen in years+Amazing sound track +Immense freedom with strategy+Complete new genre-Worst voice acting in a game I've ever heard (And I like the english VA in S.T.A.L.K.E.R)-Terrible story. Just skip it. Like, wow.I first saw this game years ago and thought it was focusing its efforts too much on being some try-hard, weird niche game.  I was wrong. Sang-Froid creates a whole new genre with a sophisticated collaboration of roleplaying, strategy and action. The roleplaying allows an insane amount of viability, permitting lumbering melee protagonists or lurking hunters to excel from the well crafted skill tree. Every node you spec into drastically changes the way you can handle situations and the impact of the specs are prominent; unlike most games with skill trees.  Your attack animations change, poisnous bait releases a green gas, and you end up planning your strategies around ever possible advantage you can think of.The surprising amount of strategy lets even the simplest of minds feel like a tactile god as they create their own routes, plans and ambushes which will synergize with the player's chosen skills. There's tons of choices to be made and you never feel like you can blame the game for your bad planning, since there’s  an unlimited number of ways to handle scenarios. Do you race the werewolf to the farm and take him one-on-one? Prepare a bonfire there premptivley to create distance between the two of you for the perfect silver bullet head shot. Maybe trap him first to weaken him, or lure him with bait into a hanging net or send him on a 5 minute detour around the map due to fire walls. Your strongest weapon in Sang-Froid is your creativity.The most heart racing moments are when your plans are coming together perfectly and you're desperately hiding, covering your scent and watching from the shadows as an Elder Werewolf crosses in front of you. You'll feel an immense feeling of supremacy as he passes you, yet incredible fragility as a single step would reveal yourself to the werewolf and risk the entire fruition of the meticiulous planning. Do you use your scarce silver bullets to take on the werewolf? Do you fight him and try to lure him to the hanging net and release it while he chases you? Do you activate your last bonfire to ward off the monster and aim your last silver bullet as he circles you, waiting for the perfect opprotunity to strike?  Then there is when things don't go according to plan. This is the other exciting part of the Sang-Froid: When you need to improvise, which will happen a lot. Panic and werewolves running rampent and it's up to you to make split second decisions on dozens of variables. Wolves are coming for the hen house, yet this Wendigo needs to be watched for the cannon shot. Perhaps using the wind to carry my scent I can buy the hen house more time, but I have to do it without alerting other werewolves and taking them off their set path.There're just too many mechanics in this game, all simple, but work seemlessly with one another, creating one of the most fresh and exciting games I've ever played.I bought this game on a 90% off steam sale on a whim, but I'd gladly pay the $15 realizing the polish and work of absolute passion put into this game.   Also, you WILL fall in love with fiddle music after this game.~A sequal with a custom level creator and co-op (with the two brothers) would easily perfect the longevity and creativity of the game.~			"

												 At the price point of $15 going on $2.99, I wasn't sure what to expect. But what I found was a pleasant surprise. This game is charming in an actual way. It appears small but it feels like the people who put this all together made this with a lot of love. I can see the budget went towards the gameplay sections. This shows when you start to actually play and see what you can do, from the planning of where your traps go, to the AI actually reacting to your pathing, it feels like a giant strategy toybox. This point can be emphasized even after you have placed things like the ziplines, barrels and fire walls as you can zoom in and physically see their placement on the map. This game has so many neat little parts that geuinely add to the overall feel of being this trapper in the northern woods of 19th century Canada. I really wish the game was a little more polished. The overall performance given to you in the voice over work is basic, which is a double edged sword of quality. Some characters, I felt like they should have had a different tone or lines better delivered. It sort of felt like a lot of stuff got moved at the last minute. It was strange but I can give an example. The young chief of the indians seemed to have an older voice than his wise counselor and it also felt like the voice of the two main characters had been swapped around. I felt like Jos should have had his voice actor reversed for his brother but that is just my opinion. Never once during combat did I feel the tension ease up and I always had my guard up. When I was playing, I had a moment where I was desperately clicking my right mouse button to load my rifle, so I could just maybe get one more shot off before the werewolves break through my first line of defense. I actually felt a slight bit of stress in that moment, and if you've successfully made me feel stress in a game, you've sold me. The tutorials are nice, fully voice acted and overall the presentation is really good for what it is. I know I haven't sold all the points of the game, but one last thing I feel I should mention is the music. Now when the music is playing, it feels appropriate. Tense. It sets the mood and even the menu music adds. The menu used as your planning display has this one tune in particular that makes me feel like I was playing Dark Cloud 2 back in the day. It really makes me relax and soak in the atmosphere.There is a lot of things I want to say that I can't accurately describe, it's sort of this odd sense of nostalgia that washes over me but it's wholly unique in its own right. The game is well designed, it makes me feel the effort put into it and while despite my Voice Acting complaint, it holds its own as a game. I really recommend it to people, for what it is, I couldn't ask much more of it. Maybe a bit more spit and polish would have served this game, maybe add a compass in the in-field hud and some other small details, but not once so far have I been disappointed. Definitely pick it up while it's cheap. If I had to give a rating? Like a 7.5? Low B? It's really good in a wholesome sense. Which is a weird way to describe it.   "

												its fun, but gets tedious very quickly.gameplay is a little rough arround the edges, a lot of polish is missing from a very good concept.animation is poor to say the least, and most of the 3d models are just terrible, but not as terrible as the voice acting.income curve seems very broken, as in unless you decide to spend ALL your money in one place you'll never get anything decent (at least not up to day 15 where I am) seems the game doesn't want you to take a balenced aproach at all, would be fine if there was the ability to generate more than a few cents a day.sadly, both of the mechanics in the game are underdeveloped (tower defence and hack n slash), the tower defence aspect is cripled by an unclear placement system and the hack and slash is lacking any kind of flow (say you run towards an enemy then attack, theres no animation that links them so it feels very clunky)while I do enjoy it, and will probably play it some more, there are too many issues to justify a thumbs up, but its only one major patch away from being good. (asside from the truly TERRIBLE voice acting, which is beyond salvation)if you can get it in a bundle, then do it, but its certainly not worth the asking price. not by a long shot.			"

												Awesome game. As it says, it combines action and strategy in a unique way. You can’t only rely on your combat skills and you would have to think carefully where to put your traps and timing is important because many of them needs you to be triggered. You will have to repeat some missions and think a different plan. And that’s what make this game a great one, you will be looking forward to doing it! I am usually discouraged to repeat a map in other games, but this game have a pretty solid strategy involved so you would love to give it a twist to your previous plan.And finally, the soundtrack it’s so good that I have to point it out!

												Wanting to give Strategy games a shot, I thought this game would be an easy intro into the genre, and I have to say I'm enjoying it. The story about the sister could of been dropped to 2 brothers simply defending the house, but what I like the most is the Soundtrack, where I've played plenty of big title games with Soundtracks not as good, you'll definitely find yourself tapping your feet. The variety of traps and enemies leaves the player with tonnes of options and obstacles to try and work their way around, and the perfect amount of freedom for those who want to use their brain and let the traps unfold and do the work, or if your in the mood to go toe-to-claw with the beasts. The graphics aren't brilliant and neither is the story, but for the setting, gameplay, artwork and soundtrack, i'd definitely recommend this game, especially for those wanting to get into the strategy games genre. Fingers crossed for a sequel with even more complex levels and possibly multiplayer would be awesome.			"

												This is a tower defense game where you don't have much resources. You can't just spam the map with traps, you have to be careful where do you lay what kind of traps. There is a bit too much handholding at the beginning (the first two days are tutorials telling you what icons to click) and there aren't too many levels in the game, but they're just enough for me to have fun and not to feel cheated. Surviving a level with three or four waves can be very satisfying.The gameplay and the theme mesh superbly and the story seems to me selfconscious about the subject matter (werewolves). The world of Sang-Froid mixes clichés of Christian and native American folklore as seen in movies and read in books. It's shlock, but luckily it doesn't try to be more than shlock, it's very entertaining.			"

												A Strategy game and a First Person Shooter Game made in Québec.It tells a story about a french canadian lumberjack who lives in the Old Canada (Québec).He tries to protect his house in the woods from werewolves and others demons.If they get to the house they will kill his bro and his sick sister.During the day, he builds traps and set up his strategy for the night.During the night, he hunts the werewolves with his axe and his rifle.This game is a unique gameplay in my opinion.It has some ugly graphics and animation, and some stop-motion video with dialogs.But, it doesn't matter cause the dev team doesn't have a budget like EA or Blizzard.They make such a good gameplay that you can forget this lack of visual effects.I've got it from Humble Bundle for a dollars with some more games that I don't give a damn about, but I know it goes often on sale for less that $2 on Steam, even if it is $5, it's worth it.I enjoyed that game for the gameplay but also for the story.If you are not from Canada, a French Canadian, or have any interest to know more about the Old Canada, you might find that game kind of boring cause it has some slow pace storyboard animation"" with a bit of our history.My final words are: I enjoy the game and I recommend it. Go watch a youtube review to know more about it, like this one from TotalBiscuit "

												Wow, what an unexpected gem this turned out to be. I'm not all up for Indie games, but boy do I recommend this one from the heart. Absolutely, try to give it a chance, Sang-Froid is truely something else and it's massively captivating, thanks to its uncanny music, unique, cartoonish looks (or sometimes even marionette-like characters during the cutscenes), surprisingly well done voice acting and a bit Orcs Must Die!-esque, but still unique on its own way trap/combat mixture of gameplay. The puzzles the game offer during its increasingly higher difficulty of levels also surprised me, because with the harder game mode (playing Jack) you really have to rely on strategy (placing traps and making the right decisions) instead of APM-based action hack'n'slash. It was fun figuring out the right way to do the levels, even though one does usually not finish each day (level) with the first try :)The only gripe I would have with Sang-Froid is the lack of intice to replay, other than trying out the other character and maybe different ways to finish the individual levels (the game does offer multiple solutions on each level and actual skill-trees, even an economy).If you'd like to play something different, please give Sang-Froid a chance because one of a kind, truely innovative games should be celebrated, not to mention that you'll probably going to get lost in awe during the 12 hourish length of the campaign. When I was playing it, it felt like when I'm reading a really captivating novel: the atmosphere just pulls you in and you can't stop reading (or in this case playing) until you reach the final conclusion of the story. Does it worth buying on the indie price-range it is offered on? Well if you've read my whole review up to this point, and you can't reach the conclusion, I guess Sang-Froid is not really for you anyway :) For the laughable cheap price I picked it up for, it was one of the best buys I've ever done on Steam. Gave my hope back for the Greenlight System for sure! :)JaSperB out			"

												There are probably too many games that take place in America to count nowadays, sometimes having it be just a setting, others making silly or outlandish portrayals of what life in the US of A is like. But that means other countries don't appear as often, particularly their neighbour to the north and my home country, Canada. Heck, we don't even have our own hero in Overwatch yet! So I was interested in playing Sang-Froid, since I heard it described a bunch in this thread as just about the most Canadian thing ever. Is it?Well, the story goes like this: it's Klondike-era Canada, and lumberjack Joseph and his sister Josephine have been run out of their town thanks to the priest blaming the local church burning down on her. This forces them to shack up with their brother Jacques, who Joseph is none-too fond of, and the feeling is mutual. There's not much time to think about that, though, as it turns out this priest has been bewitched by the Devil, who is corrupting the townspeople into werewolves and sending them to try and spirit their sister away for unknown reasons. Since they both care for her more than they dislike the other, it's time to kill some werewolves.Much like Orcs Must Die, you participate in the defense firsthand. You can play as either Joseph, who is quite physically fit and capable of fighting off enemies better, or Jacques, who is more of a hard mode where you need to rely on traps. Of course, the extensive skill tree is the same for both, as is most of the story, save some scenes where they're alone. It's probably inaccurate to compare this to Orcs Must Die, though, as Sang-Froid is more slow-paced and strategic.The story takes place from the fifth of December all the way to Christmas Eve, and as each day dawns you're able to go to town to buy items, equip your character, and of course lay traps for the werewolves at night. Each level has three waves, with the enemies in them almost always going for different targets; you'll have up to five buildings to defend by the end of the game. Thankfully just clicking on an enemy's icon will show you the exact path they'll take once they show up, barring distractions.If that sounds a bit easy, it isn't, as your arsenal is nowhere near autonomous. The only no frills weapon you have is the starting bear trap, which will kill a common wolf, but barely slow a werewolf down without picking skills to power it up. Most others you have to activate yourself or have some requirement before they'll trigger, like a net you need to shoot down with your rifle (which, being a nineteenth century firearm, you'd better not miss with), or a spike trap that will only trigger if three enemies are on it at once, which often requires luring them with bait or your scent. Engaging enemies yourself is tricky too, since there's a stamina system in place to keep you from swinging mindlessly, and most of them have a resistance to ordinary weapons; you'll need to pay to have them blessed if you want to get around that.All this means you generally need to go through the waves and prepare traps for each set of enemies, perhaps deciding which you can deal with yourself safely. The next wave doesn't come until everything from the previous one is dead, and it gives you enough time to move across the map if you need to, especially later on when you unlock watch-towers you can zipline between. If you screw up, the game lets you restart at either dawn, to place traps differently, or at twilight, if you made some misstep in execution. It's definitely not the kind of game where you can sit and watch as things march to their doom, but there was something about setting things up and watching - or listening - to it all go right.I beat the game in nine hour as Joseph, and enjoyed myself a lot more than I expected going in. I'd say it's a bit of a hidden gem, although it has been on sale quite a lot at this point. I'd thoroughly recommend it so long as Canadian accents don't make you recoil in horror. Last I checked the developers were still planning on making a part two to the game, and I hope they do if it's as good.			"

												""Sang-Froid - Tales of Werevolves"" is a cute, atmospheric indie tower-defense game set in 19th century Canada, involving a stand against occult forces unleashed upon a family of two brothers and a sister. It has a nice visual style, interesting (yet simple) story and quite the content for the buck. With a solid arsenal of unlockable traps and weapons, as well as skills to build, the game offers a pleasant and intellectually stimulating experience.With various possible approaches to the missions (chapters) the game has a bit of something both for players who prefer fighting and those who prefer tactics. Yet, it seems that Sang-Froid is not as rewarding for players who carefully plan out their defenses as it should be, because with careful placement of traps and minimum involvement in combat, I was constantly out of money and struggled to get the best equipment in the first half of the game. Only after few chapters, did I discover that I could just  buy potions and kill enemies, thus saving money for the equipment. And that's a shame, because I would rather be rewarded for playing smart instead of casual. This aspect of the game is also illustrated by the fact that the character gains experience both for succeeding and failing the missions, which allows to unlock new skills either way, thus becoming stronger. It means that you can just grind through stat boosts, save money for better weapons and almost forget about trap placement in the first part of the game.There are also some minor faults:- Combat: the character can only move in four directions – no diagonal moves and change of a direction is not seamless; the camera movement during the fights is also a problem.- Navigation: that mini map sure makes your head spin and you can easily go the wrong way, which could be a crucial mistake when the time is running out- Trap placement: there is a hidden grid, but there are areas where it is not always possible to place fire wall tiles in straight lines. The game likes to add an extra tile to your desired construction sometimes, thus wasting your limited action points. It sure would have been more convenient, if it was possible to add a tile by tile and remove them tile by tile instead of all the firewall.- Economy: the action point cost and prices for some traps doesn't seem balanced for me against their potential usefullness. For example, I never used an explosive barrel during the game, because it is an expensive trap with limited usefullness and there is a high risk of failure.But despite its flaws ""Sang-Froid"" is a very good game and I recommend it to all tower-defence fans or someone who just wants to take a break from shooters like I did.My overall rating: 8/10.

												Simply put, the most well concealed and shiniest (or 'gemmy', if you will) of hidden gems. Some may criticize the voice acting and writing, but I didn't think it was that bad. As a Canadian, I think they successfully emulated the sort of accent you'd hear when you're far from the cities. It can be comical at times I won't deny that, but I honestly believe the comedy is intentional in those cases.It says I only have a few minutes played at the moment, but I have beaten this game several times with both brothers, only it was not on my account.The gameplay is an interesting blend of strategic planning and real-time execution. Also, one of my favourite soundtracks of all time. Seriously, it's that good. You can find the tracks themselves in the game files.I just friggin' love this game.			"

												I really like this game. It is unique and does a fantastic job of blending action, strategy and rpg elements together. The gameplay is a lot of fun and there's always something new waiting for you right around the corner ie a new gun, axe, trap or monster. The game's story is very interesting too with all the schemeing that goes on. The only parts i didn't like so much about this game were the graphics and voice acting. The graphics look nice but it seemed as if they couldn't decide whether to make the game look cartoony or realistic. It's hard to explain but it just sometimes seems weird to have a cartoony lumberjack next to such a detailed tree. The monsters look REALLY good though; i was actually getting scared at times when i'd see a werewolf's glowing eyes shining as he lunged towards me. The voice acting was a little awkward at times but it's no big deal. I did like the Devil's voice. All in all this is a great game and i'm glad to have bought it.			"

												Amazing game.Perharps the best artwork i have ever seen in any game.Soundtrack is also great and really adds to the outstanding atmosphere which the game provides.It is not as fast paced as Orcs must die instead it focuses much more on strategy than action which is good in my opinion.Upgrade system is well made and money is scarce so you have to use your brain to manage your resources and survive.The level of difficulty is well balanced.My only complain is about combat which could be a lot better (especially aiming with rifle is really frustrating at times).Also the story is a bit short which is sad because there is no other mode so you are forced to play the campaign.Overall 9/10 a well made game brilliantly presented.

												This game is delicious! Waves of wolves try to get a good taste of fresh human flesh V´´V.  At night... every night they attack a small farm owned by two nasty lumberjacks and their sister. Those filthy lumberjacks put up a huge variety of dirty wolf traps, towers and even shoot at everything that approaches their farm using either ordinary, blessed or silver bullets. Those cowards seek protection near lit fire places and assault all those poor hungry wolves with axes. Luckily there are enough different types of wolves and werewolves that vary in strenght, speed and ability to keep the game fair for the wolves. So sometimes the game can be challenging for the lumberjacks, Jos and Jack, too, (I think this is how this food is called) and if they didn't try hard enough a pack wolves can finally feast on their well-deserved succulent midnight snack inside those small cabins. At most times those foolish lumberjacks seem to have huge problems with their conrols, that leave them vulnerable to attacks. Their moves and attacks are quite unreliable, laggy and look unpolished to me. In general I think this game is an average tower defense game, which definitely is more than worth its money (90% steam sale in my case). Aside from suprisingly long loading screens the game is well paced and doesn't get boring too soon. You might end up spending more time planning your stategy for the next night on the overworld map than actually surviving the night. I also think that this game doesn't have a great replay value and I don't really know why (maybe I'm already tired of seeing wolves being murdered). If you are one of those players who insist in pin-point accurate gameplay or blockbuster action, you should stay away from this game! But if you are easily affected by a mysterious and dark atmosphere, neat soundtrack and interesting ideas you should definitely give it a try.			"

												Sang-Froid is a tower defense and action game fun mix that will suck you in. Its always the same setting won't annoy you until you hit the very ending. However, thanks to its constant additions of new traps and creatures, the game stays entertaining till the end.Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves is a brilliant game, peppered with original ideas, a unique setting, and an interesting premise. It is a clever amalgamation of asynchronous tower defense and synchronous brawling. It teems with pride and gusto, and should be lauded for attempting something bold, fresh and inimitable. It just needed a little more love, a little more time, and much better visuals.Issues aside, this inventive, supernatural mash-up is absolutely worth possessing--demonically or otherwise.			"

												Here we have a fantastic game with a compelling story, rich atmosphere and a unique feel from its stylized graphics and original soundtrack. The opening music alone is worth the current sale price ($1.49-almost as much as a song on iTunes), although I'd recommend this game even without a discount. 1850s Canada is quite the refreshing setting, an unfamiliar time and place that only adds to the unfolding mystery.Sang-Froid definitely has an indie feel to it-especially with the cutscenes-but the gameplay mechanics are intuitive and solid. I love the different stages in each level, from placing traps and planning a defense during the day to executing your plan come nightfall, for better or for worse. There's this sense of escalating urgency to the whole thing, as if there's just not enough time or resources to make it through to the next day.In one instance I stood upwind from a pack and heard their howls as they caught and followed my scent. I snared an oncoming  werewolf in a bear trap and crushed it to death with a quick shot to the overhanging rock pile I'd placed, then I frantically ran from its companions back to a bonfire by the cabin, rolling this way and that out of their clawing reach, barely able to light the fire before running out of stamina, and just able to frighten the beasts to catch a quick breather before axing them all to death in a ferocious back-and-forth dance around the fire-only to have to sprint right over to the next building in a panic to catch more of the werewolves before they could finish tearing everything to rubble. Exhilarating!9/10 - highly recommended!			"

												Summary of the game (no spoilers). At first, my review was positive, but then I changed my mind. Here is why -Story 3/5  -> Original, somewhat engaging, but a bit shallow Graphics 4/5 -> for an action/tower defence game pretty decent Voice acting/ cinematics 1/5 -> terrible voice acting, but that is not such a big deal. Cinematics are a nusiance. Gameplay 2/5 -> You want to play. You want to think about the layout of your traps and strategy. But the game will not let you. It is very easy to place the traps, and melee combat is mostly about going near enemy, hitting MB1 (your character will target and hit enemy automatically, even if they are behind you) and sometimes dodging or running away. Shooting would be more fun, but you need to reload every shot which takes way too long for practical purposes and is impossible in melee combat. You can not place traps exactly where you want them, (I am not talking about terrain restriction now), so they happen to be too much to sides for maximizing their potential - and that is just irritating. You also keep XP even from nights you fail, so you are rewarded for failing. It also makes the game less chalenging, which sux.In-game mechanics and options 5/5 -> there is everything that fits the atmosphere and nothing more that could disturb or overhype it. It is detailed, but not overdone, they put a lot of time into it and they did a good job. It also works quite well, I only saw one or two minor bugs. + they explain the mechanics very well.Saves and loads mechanics 0/5 -> Daytime starts by cinematics, after that you tend to plant traps for waves of enemies that come at night. There may be 1-6 waves each night. If you screw up even the last wave, you need to start from daytime again (you can relocate the traps) and go again through all the waves. If, however, you decide to turn the game off, it will start with the beginning cinematics of the day the next time you play it, and your traps will be deleted, so you need to place them again. The game loads extremely slowly for such a small game, but the loading song makes up for it. Fun 3/5 -> This game had great potential. It could have been so much better, perhaps the most complete tower defence / action game hybrid ever made. After a few rounds (when my review was positive) I had great expectations and was looking forward to playing this game. But as I played, it was becoming somehow irritating because of the factors mention above. Still, it was a decent game.Shoul you buy it? No. It is definitely not worth the price. However, If you see it on a sale like -80% or so, then YES, you will not regret it.			"

												Sang-Froid is a charming game made by a team of 6 people. It's amazing how such a small team can create such a fun tower defense title. And with that much polish.The game can be compared to Orcs Must Die in that you'll be running around killing enemies as well, in addition to your traps. Now, the traps must be placed prior to starting the game so there's no adding traps once the game has begun. Thankfully the map shows you which enemies will spawn where, what traps are most effective, and where they're headed. A level can have up to 6 waves so it's important that you try to remember the roads your enemies will be taking in order to get to your bases in time. Killing enemies will earn you money which can be used to buy new weapons, gear, potions and ammo. Completing waves will also earn you experience so you'll be able to upgrade your character with more health, or make your traps more effective.For a tower defense game the story is actually pretty good. They put a lot of effort in it and the cutscenes are well done. The voice acting, however, is mediocre at best, which is a real shame. It's just so wooden and brought with no emotion at all. The music, on the other hand, is solid and the voices of your enemies are well done, too.The graphics are cool, and the characters use a certain style, which I liked. The game doesn't support 2560x1440, which was a little bit frustrating for me personally as it made the game look blurry. But since the rest of the game is so well done I'll just ignore it.The game can be completed in about 11 hours, by the way, so it's also pretty lengthy.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Please find the full game review here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/447uj90uenoj13y/Sang-Froid%20Review.pdfThe game design structure is unbelievably well-managed and fortunately, the game is a neat example of ""How one can execute their ideas into the virtually living entities!"". From the theoretical point of view, the game follows a simple tower/hero-defense pattern : During the daylight, get prepared for the nocturnal attack of the Werewolves; buy weapons; set traps; use the gathered skill points to equip your character with perks and yet you're ready to start a nightmarish night! But in fact, practically, it's not that simple at all cause there are really plenty lot of important things to take care of before embarking on the Werewolves killing adventure. Ladies and Gentlemen, please be assured that ""every"" game design element will effect your performance during the night! You're not about to face a game, as said, ""with minor RPG elements"" as the game provides a magnificent hierarchy of character power-ups that reminds you of classic old school RPGs while at the same time regards the fact that the game is being represented to post-modern gamers. And that means the hierarchy system avoids any sort of sophisticated rules of choosing this ability instead of that. The player's first,second even third mistake is not their last mistake as the game gives you the opportunity to think over your strategy once again....In addition to the strategy planning, ""Sang-Froid"" is also a 3rd-person tactical p.o.v. which make you confront with the enemy with melee or ranged weapons. During the 3rd-person experience you'll have to protect the playable character while defending specified buildings or areas and that's when two style of game-play, tower and hero defense, are mixed up with each other in order to give birth to a brand new mechanism style of survival-horror. ...By the first glance, the story may seem like a simple ""Tale of Werewolves"" but as the narration progresses, other twist will save the story from being a linear tale to multiple story lines told in parallel channels in order to add a deep sense of suspense and excitement to the core tale. The story is often narrated by cut-scene in the form of two/three-personage dialogs and sometimes by illustrated cut scenes all of which are empowered with charming voice acting. The music is perhaps a part of game-play as it won't let you down during the night battles. It's so motivating to hear a well-chosen merry  Celtic/Francophone-Canadian Folk* songs during a face-to-face battle with a Grand Werewolf as it brings hope into your heart letting you chop the Wolf fella in two. That's not the only thing one can mention about the voices in the game. Perhaps you'll admit this after you've hear the warming voice of the tutorials narrator. The sound effects design of the game will make you feel yourself in a real forest of frozen maple trees, near a hut with a smoking chimney, under the pale light of the full moon playing hide-and-seek as the dark clouds pass by and eventually a cry of a wolf in a distance......To conclude, I'd like to state that fortunately ""Sang-Froid : A Tales of Werewolves"" is based on a great story-line which is followed by appealing presentation, making the excellent game-play a much better experience.Vandad*Please Note: I'd be more than grateful if any of the respectable readers let me know what the exact academic name for these category/genre of songs is.

												This game is awesome.. starts of kinda easy then BAM werewolf. Holy hell. Just try to kill as many things as u can early on without traps as they cost you money that could be used on upgrades. Really great game would love to see a sequel or another game in the same vein as this. Buy but read reviews first it may not be your style of game.Would drink Canadian liquor again  10/10			"

												PROS: Some deep mechanics like talent trees in the same nature as D2 or Titan Quest but a bit watered downFaithful representation of the time period (1850's)Interesting tower defense concept in that its meant to be played differently than other tower defense gamesCONS:Clunky controlsBadly voiced bad cutscenes full of bad writing....bad. Pacing is too slow. Overall I couldnt find much incentive to play beyond the 5th level. It was just boring to me.  "

												Mislead by the screenshots into thinking that this would be a competent strategy game with an artistic flair; couldn't have been more wrong.  Gameplay is, at best, banal and repetitive.  Despite the appearance of strategy elements, the actual gameplay is primarily action-oriented -- that is once you can get past the tedious hand-holding tutorials.  What really drives it into the trash heap is the writing, cutscenes and VA.  Combat is primarily action-based, with a thin veneer of tactics on the surface.  Once you actually have some contol of the tactical aspect, you quickly realize how effectively limited your options are.  Most traps are ineffective and you end up using the same basic traps ad nauseam, in typically the same places every day.  The buildings that you are required to defend are apparently made out of rice paper, because a single wolf can destroy any structure located on the opposite side of the map in a matter of seconds, causing you to fail the night.I understand the gun mechanic is intended to supplement combat, but it's not enough to save you from the tedium of constantly running around and wildly swinning an axe.  The timing of events in combat is imprecise and slightly unresponsive.  The game is touted as being a variation on Tower Defense, but let's be clear:  Get used to swinging an axe, it's 80% of what you do.The writing is unbelievably bad.  It seems to be composed of lifeless tropes, clichés and hamfisted exposition.  The idioms are inappropriate and inconsistent with the setting, the characters are dimensionless, idiotic puppets playing out a callow farce.  Even the poor spelling, punctuation and  grammar exposes the lack of education and sloppy QC of the people involved.You're expected(?) to endure panel cutscenes at the beginning of each 'day' that foreshadow the subsequent combat scenario.  I cannot adequately describe how crass and farcical these scenes actually are, but subjectively speaking, they're awful.  Beyond the terrible writing, you have to listen to even-more-terrible voice acting.  The 'actors' mispronounce words everywhere (to almost comic effect), even inconsistently mispronouncing each other's names.  The characters are native to the story's setting, which is in northern [read: French] Canada, yet they manage still to mispronounce the names of Canadian cities.  Again, the 'actors' cannot even remotely keep their accents and idioms on target -- instead they meander all over the place, ranging from faux-British, to faux-Canadian, to Texan, to Mexican.  The female character central to the story is French-Canadian, pale skin, long red hair and -- get this -- voiced by a borderline-illiterate Hispanic woman.  The two protagonist brothers aren't voiced much better, either.  It's painful to listen to.Pros:  - Looks like a strategy RPG.  - 3/10 gameplay. Not the worst game on steam, sadly.Cons:  - Not a really strategy RPG.  - About as tactical as Gauntlet Legends.  - Traps are only a minor gimmic.  - Shallow, repetitive Hack-and-Slash gameplay.  - Controls are loose/laggy.  - Poor QC/QA.  - Awful writing/storyline.  - Terrible voice acting.  - Mostly comparable to a sloppy PS1-era fantasy action game.  - Almost shovelware.2/10:  Would not buy again.

												Essentially a tower defense game with some bells and whistles, similar to Dungeon Defenders. The game is two parts. Part 1 is planning for the wolf attacks at night in which you are able to see the waves, which enemies are attacking, and which paths they will take to a variety of buildings you are charged with protecting. Losing any of the buildings results in a failed night in which you must redo. Each type of wolf/werewolf has different stats, strengths, and weaknesses. You have a variety of traps that can be as simple as a bear or spike trap, or more complex, like a hanging net of rocks that you must shoot at when your prey is underneath. Each trap has either an Action Point cost, money cost, or both on it. These are the costs to set them on the map and limit the amount of things you can plop down on the gameboard. Leftover AP can be used to chop trees once you unlock the mill, thus providing you with more money for unused resources. Keep in mind though, once you do this, you can't use those points to buy extra damaging traps that can help you in the next mode. Once you start the night, you play Part 2 which plays out live action. You can pause the game in map mode, but as soon as the map drops, the wolves are coming.In addition, there are some interesting features in the game. For instance, you have a stamina bar. Of the two weapons you you start with (axe and rifle), you must be careful as to not tire yourself out. Running uses stamina as well. Also, when you run, you make more noise. Wolves are alert and can hear you the more noise you make. So, firing your gun obviously can alert them. You can also shout, which will call wolves to the last spot you shouted and (if they are close enough) cause them to fear you. Fear is an interesting feature in this game. Wolves will pace around while their fear wears down and then they attack you. You can yell to increase this, but eventually, the pack will attack. You can ward off wolves by building fires - they tend to not like these - and stand near them.But not for long. Fires wear out. You can take pot shots at them with your rifle, but reloading it requires you to tamp the shot with powder packets, so it's not like you're using a machine gun. Obviously, you can't do this under duress.After a successful night, you are graded on how many creatures you killed, the skins or parts you took from them (which gives you money), and how in tact the buildings are. XP and money is awarded (you also get money per kill in the game while playing in the live action mode). At this point you can go to town and buy more bullets, better weapons, gear to wear which gives effects, or potions and blessings from the local church on your items. You can also spend skill points in between levels in which you level up. Skill points accentuate your abilities, allowing you to rage for longer (an ability you naturally have while swinging your axe successfully), increase damage from weapons, set better traps, or reduce the time in between loading bullets. There are many skills to improve.The game has some flaws though. Firstly, the voice acting is really not all that great. The story isn't necessarily bad, but with poor voice acting, it really takes a back seat to just the gameplay.. which is fine. But it would have really brought the entire thing together to have a solid voice cast like in Bastion. The cut scenes are also pretty shoddy. I don't mean just in an amatuerishly drawn sense. Some of the models don't even look finished, especially when you look at how their fingers and hands work. When you play in the game, you don't see any of this. It's grossly glaring in the cut scenes however. And there were some minor annoyances, such as not being able to sell my starting gear once I improved it (it just stays in your inventory.. haven't figured out how to even scrap it). And, I have to travel back to my house to swap out new gear, then go back to town to sell it. I can't seem to do any of that in the buy/sell screen or in town. Minor frustrations. "

												This is a really great game if you want to play just a little bit in the evening throughout the week. It mixes strategy planning and real time action pretty nicely. I like planning and strategizing, but I get bored if that's all there is. So, it's an even mix of both. Very nice.The controls were a little difficult sometimes and the game would get a bit laggy, but overall it wasn't too much of a problem.The final night was really hard for me, but it made the game that much more satisfying. I don't feel like it was so hard that I didn't want to come back to it, but not so easy that I wasn't feeling like it was a challenge.Hope you enjoy.I would definitely recommend it.			"

												This game is a real gem and really deserves credit for it. It's really easy to get into and near impossible to master. Every day you have a new attack to defend yourself from with a set budget. I spent hours on some maps trying to save as much as possible while still beating the objectives in order to upgrade my gear sooner.So in a way I'd say that this is a money management/tower defence/stealth/action game. I have never played anything quite like it and that is the game's biggest strength. I'm not blown away by the graphics or the character designs though but they are solid and the game ages really well in my opinion. I should say though that the game is a pain to beat and the difficulty spikes pretty early. So if you are easily discouraged this game might not be for you. But I for one will come back to it more than once trying to optimise every level and be as rich as possible at the end credits. Just for fun of course!			"

												9/10 - Just like in real life all your problems can be solved with alcohol and a good axe.The game is a mix between tower defence and third person action, pretty similar to Orcs Must Die, Dungeon Defenders and Sanctum. If you enjoyed any of these games you'll probably love Sang-Froid.Every night your house is attacked by waves of wolves and werewolves and you must set traps during the day to protect yourself when the night falls.The first few levels are meh, but as the game progress you'll be dying quite a lot of times each night until you can find the appropriate strategy for each level (especially if you're autistic like me and started the game on hard mode).The gameplay is divided in two parts, the planning mode during the day where you can buy stuff at stores, equip and level your character and spend money/time setting up traps on a overview map of the forest near your house, and the action part during the night, when you actually control your character around so you can ambush wolves with your axe and traps.Although the graphics are ""dated"" the game still looks fine. Simplistic, but better than most indie games out there.The OST is great, I mean, listen to the first video on the Steam store page. The background music always sets the perfect mood for whatever is happening. It's one of the strong points of the game.To sum it up, it's an amazing tower defense and action game, challenging as hell if you play on hard mode, great atmosphere and excellent game mechanics. Definitely worth the full price.			"

So you get the basic wolves as well as werewolves, windigos and shamans.The game is based on a planning phase then an execution phase. Set your traps and then execute the plan to defeat waves of enemies during the night. Skill tree allows you to tailor your lumberjack to your playstyle. The story is adequate but no more than that. Enough to pull you through if you enjoy the gameplay and give a reason for new enemies and objectives.So you you are interested in a strategy game set in a far different location then it is well worth it			"

												Sang-Froid is a terrific game which unfortunately suffers from not being particularly well known. The story won't have you on the edge of your seat but the key players are well written and likeable. As for the gameplay, it's an interesting blend of tower defense and a sort of hack and slash. Defend your buildings from the wolf hordes for as long as your traps hold out and then wade in with axe and rifle to finish the job. It's a terrific concept that consistently feels fresh with new traps and enemies unlocked every so often. Combine fantastic gameplay with two playable characters who play very differently from each other and some basic RPG elements to make the two even more unique and you have a very entertaining, very enjoyable gaming experience.

												To put my praise into one sentence: It's like this game is part 3 in a series. That is to say, it has so many interesting mechanics and ideas at work, you'd swear they were introduced over several games. But no -- somehow, Artifice has managed to come up with a half dozen new ideas all at once, and each builds on the last wonderfully.By far the most important is the ""fear factor"" -- this system really makes it feel like you're fighting a pack of wolves, unlike every other game where enemies just run up to you without thought. I never knew I wanted a ""realistic"" wolf fighting game before, but there you are.Aside from the gameplay, the music is impressive and catchy, but most other aspects do fall a little short. The graphics are dated and the voice actors aren't remotely up to the job. But the game itself is so different and fun that I can easily look past those flaws.My only other complaint is that with every stage introducting new things, there isn't much time to play around with each individual feature. It sounds odd to basically want filler, but having a second stage between each change would make it feel less rushed. On the other hand, it does contribute to an on-edge atmosphere, since you have to deal with the unknown every single level.			"

												Essentially a tower defence game. The devil wants your sister. He releases wolves on your territory every night. As a lumberjack your duty is to keep your sick sister sheltered from the damned. During the eyes of dawn you strategise. Via a map you set traps, fire walls, bait, along with a myriad of other apparatus to fight off the large variety of enemies. Visit town to stock up and upgrade. The usual stuff. Night time is done in real time. You go out and try to survive. It's unforgiving on hard difficulty so it's certainly not devoid of satisfaction. Game could use some polishing, better animations and voice acting but I digress. Indie games continue to flourish.			"

												A somewhat different take on the tower defense genre. Not as polished as you'd expect. Talent tree is pretty boring and doesn't leave much room for variation. Melee combat is incredibly clunky and you really just end up spamming the same attacks over and over. After almost 2 hours of playtime that I DID put into this..  it still felt like I was in a ""tutorial"" as I still gradually being given new structures/traps each time a new enemy type was going be engaging me that round. While not necessarily a horrible thing to open up new structures over time.. I don't like the idea of being ""forced"" to use those structures the second they're available, thus the tutorial feeling. Overall: Nothing really grabbed me once I started playing, melee combat was clunky and irritating. Voice actors were kinda goofy too. Also, no reason to NOT pick the huge lumberjack brother as you'll just get murdered because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system using the other guy.I wouldn't recommend it full price, then again if I could go back in time i'd stop myself from wasting my time as well soo....

												Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves is the only ""werewolf defense"" I've ever played, but I'm having a hard time imagining one other game doing it better.Strategy, action, rpg elements, all mixed together very well. I really like the gameplay. It's cozy, it's interesting, fresh, there is a lot happening, and it is beutiful.The game could have more options regarding difficulty, to have a really challanging mode/setting would have been great. It's not too short, but I wouldn't mind if it was longer. The voice acting mostly sucks.			"

												Awesome action/defense game! You start off protecting your farm with just a musket and axe, but by the end of the game you can have dynamite kegs you can shoot to demolish werewolves and zip line towers from building to building. 4.5/5			"

												This game is AMAZING the music the story the gameplay all are great! I recommend it to everyone! It's so cool. The music while playing it's the thing that keeps you more to continue playing! I love this game for everything! Another thing it's that in the start it isn't so hard but when you keep playing it gets more difficult and that keeps you playing more too! It is just one of my favorite games and one of the best games I have ever played! :D			"

												Sang-Froid is an impressively complex RTS, with creative, realistic traps that remain grounded in the setting. Every level requires a careful plan, without a detail of the enemy's plan overlooked. The tension is palpable, as timing is everything: will the wolves finish the bait and move on your house before you've finished killing a werewolf clear on the other side of the map? How long do you have before the bonfire goes out and the pack closes in?Set in pre-Confederation Canada, the setting feels real and is well-maintained: every weapon, potion, trap and setpiece fits in the world. Even the prices are accurate to the time (eg. A bullet only costs a penny, and to bless them costs ten cents). Budgeting your money becomes another challenge; saving up for a better gun becomes difficult when you still have to worry about affording your silver bullets and spike traps to survive the next night.As a game, it is quite fun and exciting, but there are some issues with the presentation. The graphics are nothing pretty, but adequate. The music might wear on your nerves, depending on your taste, but like almost everything else, it is accurate to the time. There is one problem that stuck out, and that is the voice acting, which is bad enough that it falls noticably below the standards that every other aspect of the game meets. Despite the obvious setting, the characters do not speak with the proper accent, nor do they acknowledge the severity of the situation in their flat line-reading. My reccomendation would be to turn off the voices, and I'm thankful that the option is provided.Once the voices had been muted, I had a wonderful time with this game.			"

												This game is very good.  A lot of people say it's like Orcs Must Die, and while it is to some degree, I would have to say that it is much more strategic.  In the day you actually get to tactically lay out your traps (as opposed to OMD where you run around in 3rd person doing it between Waves) - you have information about each wave and a good idea how you want to set everything up.  The music is also really good.			"

												I purchased a bundle just to get this game, and I would have just as quickly bought this by itself.If you like strategy and tower defense games, you will really love Sang-Froid - the execution is fantastic.The aesthetics are very good and the music flows well with the theme and atmosphere. The controls are not too difficult to master, the tutorial videos are given quickly and right before each new mechanic (like new traps) is introduced. Recommend you do not skip these, as they are very helpful. The learning curve is not too bad, however, preplanning and strategy is critical to this game, and the game has a nice feature where you can restart at dawn or dusk (allowing you to restart with or without all your traps still on the field). The story is pretty decent, however, I must admit that the theme does not appeal to me very much (devil + his minions) - I've started skipping the cutscenes. Each ""night"" or level adds a layer of complexity, adding new traps, enemies, and areas of the map (the logging company will clear new areas every few levels). The upgrading tree offers a lot of different areas to select from to best match your preferred play style, and there are 2 characters to select from (one specializing in combat and the other in trap-laying and strategy). You can go to town to buy new weapons, bless your weapons/buy blessed bullets (to do extra damage to ""evil"" enemies), and later you have the option of buying silver weapons (to use against the Maikans {wolf humanoids; distinct from werewolves}). In the preplanning screen, you can select traps to use. These all cost action points, however, the ones that also cost money are permanent and will persist through the nights so long as they are not used. You can also click on the wave tabs to see which enemies you will be encountering. A very useful feature is your sister's precognition, which will show you where your enemies will travel if you click their tab - this is essential for planning where to place your traps. As you progress, you will unlock more buildings that provide more AP to your pool, however, they also provide more targets for your enemies. You lose if any building is destroyed.There are many cool mechanics during gameplay, one being wind and shouting. Wind affects where your scent can be detected, and shouting also pulls all enemies from a large radius. You unlock a talisman later in the game that allows you to manipulate where the wind is blowing - very useful for pulling enemies from an even larger radius than shout. A red icon shows where enemies will look for you, and you can use this to lure them to your traps (like spike traps or hanging nets {with rocks}). Fear factor is a very interesting concept, and enemies will attack you when their fear factor matches yours. This allows you to control the flow of combat - so long as your fear factor is higher (like when you are near a fire) than your enemy's, they will be less likely to attack you right away. Werewolves have a bloodlust ability that gives them infinite fear factor (aka aggro). Attacking and defeating enemies will lower their fear factor, and there are items that further increase your own (like necklaces and potions/drinks).The game runs incredibly well, and it is extremely fun to plan out how to best deal with your enemies - especially in the later nights when different groups and waves will target different buildings. Investing in zip line towers is critical to increasing your mobility. There are also fire walls, and these are integral to survival because they will force enemies to reroute (to potentially longer routes), buying you more time to deal with your priorities. Blocking enemies off completely will cause them to take the shortest route (and the damage). Any leftover AP you have can be used to cut wood, providing you much needed money. Maximizing your trap efficiency and wood cutting will ensure that you have a of money to spend on weapon upgrades and other equipment.If you are interested at all or enjoy TD-games, you have to give this a try. It is one of the best TD-games I have come across.Strongly recommend!			"

												This is not your typical Tower Defense game.  The action involves both placing traps, then some 3rd person melee fighting.  Your axe is your primary method of taking out the beasts.  You do get a musket to use and can load it with blessed (costs extra) slugs, but with the slowness of loading and getting the gun ready, it is by no means a ""Primary Weapn"".  The gun is there to be used as a mobile trap and only while the mobs are still afraid of you.This game is not ""Action Packed"", there are a ton of speed bumps here.  While the cut scenes provide a dialog and story that isn't found in other TD games and I apprecaite that, it does feel ""slowing"" to me.  Much of the game is spent going to town to spend your pennies (wisely), setting up your traps, working out a strat or wrapped up in dialog.  The battle-time where you're running around swinging your axe winds up being cut down to maybe 10% of the overall game time.   (Note: I didn't time it out to verifiy ""10%"" but it feels like very little time, goes by quickly.)If you try to go back and replay a map, you lose all of your progress.   So you can't replay ""Day 3"" with ""Day 7"" gear.  Again, this is ""Forced Story-Line"" gameplay.  You can't muck that up with better weapons/traps.  It would be nice to be able to do that though, since you could gain XP and Cash to make moving forward easier.This is a good Stategic Thinking trainer though.  You really do have to plan out your night, where you're going to run and when.   You have unlimited time to sit there planning out your trap placement and sequence of movements.   (Stay at farm for wave 1, move to the chicken coop for wave 2... etc.)  The Zip Line is an excellent addition for movement though, you will greatly appreciate that tower!  Walking is slow and running burns your stamina too quickly.Overall, I give it a Thumbs Up, but for the reasons listed above I'm going to say ""buyer be aware"". "

												A somewhat different take on the tower defense genre. Not as polished as you'd expect. Talent tree is pretty boring and doesn't leave much room for variation. Melee combat is incredibly clunky and you really just end up spamming the same attacks over and over. After almost 2 hours of playtime that I DID put into this..  it still felt like I was in a ""tutorial"" as I still gradually being given new structures/traps each time a new enemy type was going be engaging me that round. While not necessarily a horrible thing to open up new structures over time.. I don't like the idea of being ""forced"" to use those structures the second they're available, thus the tutorial feeling. Overall: Nothing really grabbed me once I started playing, melee combat was clunky and irritating. Voice actors were kinda goofy too. Also, no reason to NOT pick the huge lumberjack brother as you'll just get murdered because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system using the other guy.I wouldn't recommend it full price, then again if I could go back in time i'd stop myself from wasting my time as well soo....

												Essentially a tower defence game. The devil wants your sister. He releases wolves on your territory every night. As a lumberjack your duty is to keep your sick sister sheltered from the damned. During the eyes of dawn you strategise. Via a map you set traps, fire walls, bait, along with a myriad of other apparatus to fight off the large variety of enemies. Visit town to stock up and upgrade. The usual stuff. Night time is done in real time. You go out and try to survive. It's unforgiving on hard difficulty so it's certainly not devoid of satisfaction. Game could use some polishing, better animations and voice acting but I digress. Indie games continue to flourish.			"

												One of the better games I have ever played in a long, long time. Set in the 1800's, you play as either Jack or Jos, two brothers trying to fight against Devil-possessed wolves and protect their sister. Quite a fun game too, as you come up with different strategies, new weapons and traps, and more.I have to admit, when I first saw this game, I didn't think much about it. When I downloaded the demo, it was a whole different story. I was immersed in the setting and storyplot, and I loved the game so much that I went and bought it. I'm extremely happy to have it, as it was and still is one of the best games I have ever played.			"

												The graphics, voice acting and story all leave something to be desired, but where it lacks in those categories it more than makes up in unique and genuinely fun gameplay. It's a diamond in the rough. If you can look past the aesthetics that everyone clings to these days, and think of it more as an early stage of this type of game, it's truly fantastic. I'd like to see it with the polish it deserves, but even without it you're bound to have a good time. If you like strategy games, but also have that part of you that loves to smash through enemies in beat-em-up style, you're getting the best of both worlds with Sang-Froid. As I said above, it's a diamond in the rough, so not everything is seamless, though it's very close.All in all, for $15 you're getting a lot more bang for your buck than the same old game that's been coming out the last 15 years and wants $60.

												I've barely scratched the surface of this game, having played a paltry 78 minutes at the time of writing, but I've enjoyed this more than quite a few of my recent steam purchases (and they cost double the full price of this gem!).This is a twist on the tower defence genre that I haven't seen before; third person hack & slash combat, with traps that trigger in a variety of ways. During the day you can stock up on supplies and buy shiney new weapons, then plan your strategy and place your traps in order to survive the coming night's wolf attack, then survive said wolf attack!For the £1.10 I paid for this in a flash sale yesterday I've struck absolute gold. I'd have happily paid full price.			"

												Just about an hr and a half into the tower defense game, Sang Froid Tales of Werewolves, and for $1.50 or 90% off asking price, this was a steal!! I kept my expectations very low. I thought, why would a $15 game be discounted more than 50%? I had to find out. It's about hunting werewolves! That alone had me interested. The story is about 2 brothers Jack and Jos, at odds with each other but have to work together to help save their sister Josephine, who is possessed by some evil spirit. You have to choose one of the brothers to control. Jack is the more strategic character that lays traps (according to the game difficulty, it's hard). Jos is the stronger of the two, an effective melee attacker (game difficulty, it's easy) to which I'm assuming that he has a bigger health bar. I chose Jack to play.What I was surprised about SF was how much you can do. From basic combat with wolves and werewolves, to planning out strategies to take on waves of enemies (mostly wolves and werewolves). Each successful night, gives you XP to improve your character, weapons, and traps. You can go up to level 15. Very well designed maps, menus, tutorials, and screens. The art direction follows more of the comic cut out look during the cutscenes. And it's nicely done. The controls are not the best, but very manageable. You can use a melee weapon from up close and ranged weapons from a distance. The best part about the combat is that you can use both types without overusing one or the other. I haven't played much strategy/base defense games before. The closest that I can think of is Assassin's Creed Revelation's tower defense (which was a bad addition to the franchise). Sang Froid Tales of Werewolves is a very good tower defense game. Get this game before the deal while on sale.			"

												First off I reccomend this game entirely to anyone who enjoy's the following.Werewolves.Good story.Tactical gaming.A challenge.If all of the above topics appeal to you  I believe you will enjoy this game.What I like about it. (Spoiler-Maybe?)Firstly I like the story/topic. Two brothers trying to survive and protect their ill sister as werewolve's and other creatures  descend upon them. The topic ""werewolve's"" it's an easy place to make a rich story and as you get farther in the game it becomes so.This game does and does not hold your hand, You are explained everything in great detail and taught how to play the game but it is wholey up to you to excecute what you have been taught and at certain times flawlessly. it really leads you calmly into the woods then leaves you to the wolves. The gameplay is exillerating! you plan out everything all of your traps, what weapon's you will use, where the enemy is coming from, what type of enemy and how many there will be before nightfall. You plan and learn as you play the game and you are forced to do so. Then when night comes you see if your tactic and preperation payed off, Did you miss something? or forget something? Did your traps work like you imagined they would? did you bring enough silver or blessed bullets? you find out quickly if what you had done the day before was enough to help you through the grizzly night.You purchase items from the town and other places to help you against the varied and versatile creatures. You start with a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor woodsman's axe and an old musket, They get the job done for a while but not for too long at least not in the state they're in. So you look to upgrade, Walking into the blacksmith's shop you spot a nice looking lumberjacks axe that put's your  current affair to shame' however... It cost's 5 dollars! tripple your current allowance for shiny axes. feeling crummy and that the world is against you you walk into a chapel to angrilly pray at god! But as you enter a nun approaches and seeing your axe she offers to bless it with holy power effectivly doubling it's current strength she'll bless you'r normal style bullet's too. Suddenly that crap axe is looking pretty swell and your musket doesn't make you want to use it to shoot yourself in the head.This game does a really good job at pulling you in, At least it did for me. At first I didn't know what to think playing the first few chapters I was let's say... unimmpressed.  but as I progressed I was compelled to continue and the more I played the more I felt that way, That drive didn't wear off for me and it still hasn't.What I don't like about it.Bug's they are in every game and I hate them! (Unless they're funny)What I like about it.Everything else! I can say that I like just about everything in this game I really have no bad to say about it. But that's just me. Anyone reading this is their own critic as it should be, You're just looking for some insight on a game. But I know and you know that it doesn't really matter what I or anyone else sais, What matter's is how you feel when you play the game.Thank's for reading.P.S. this game has a demo! simply search ""Sang-Froid"" on steam and give it a go!

												Here we have a fantastic game with a compelling story, rich atmosphere and a unique feel from its stylized graphics and original soundtrack. The opening music alone is worth the current sale price ($1.49-almost as much as a song on iTunes), although I'd recommend this game even without a discount. 1850s Canada is quite the refreshing setting, an unfamiliar time and place that only adds to the unfolding mystery.Sang-Froid definitely has an indie feel to it-especially with the cutscenes-but the gameplay mechanics are intuitive and solid. I love the different stages in each level, from placing traps and planning a defense during the day to executing your plan come nightfall, for better or for worse. There's this sense of escalating urgency to the whole thing, as if there's just not enough time or resources to make it through to the next day.In one instance I stood upwind from a pack and heard their howls as they caught and followed my scent. I snared an oncoming werewolf in a bear trap and crushed it to death with a quick shot to the overhanging rock pile I'd placed, then I frantically ran from its companions back to a bonfire by the cabin, rolling this way and that out of their clawing reach, barely able to light the fire before running out of stamina, and just able to frighten the beasts to catch a quick breather before axing them all to death in a ferocious back-and-forth dance around the fire-only to have to sprint right over to the next building in a panic to catch more of the werewolves before they could finish tearing everything to rubble. Exhilarating!highly recommended!			"

												Sang-Froid takes the concepts from a large variety of different styles of games, and mashes them all together to create a truly fun and unique experience.I keep hoping this is type of game Epic Games has in mind while they are developing Fortnite. The idea for this game is great, and while it's game is a tad sluggish in it's execution, it by no means fails. Highly Recommended.			"

												I've barely scratched the surface of this game, having played a paltry 78 minutes at the time of writing, but I've enjoyed this more than quite a few of my recent steam purchases (and they cost double the full price of this gem!).This is a twist on the tower defence genre that I haven't seen before; third person hack & slash combat, with traps that trigger in a variety of ways. During the day you can stock up on supplies and buy shiney new weapons, then plan your strategy and place your traps in order to survive the coming night's wolf attack, then survive said wolf attack!For the £1.10 I paid for this in a flash sale yesterday I've struck absolute gold. I'd have happily paid full price.			"

												I highly enjoyed Sang-Froid because you get to kill demonic and mystical wolves in the name of chivalry. The gameplay was very intuitive but the well narrated and detailed tutorials were much appreciated after skipping them initially only to view them later for the sake of completeness.Also, the highly responsive gameplay, well-rounded gameplay mechanics (trap placement , skill trees, etc. )  and trap\weapon arsenal kept the experience fresh until the end, which is the only gripe I have with Sang-Froid.After the end, the choices are limited on how to proceed in the current campaign. You cannot repeat previous levels in the campaign without consequences. If you want to go back to a certain day, you lose all the progress made after that point. In addition to fixing that flaw, this game severely needs an ""Endurance Mode"" and another mode that features randomization of the enemy's attack patterns. My issues with the game still shouldn't dissuade you from purchasing Sang-Froid -- even at full price -- because it is more than worth it.			"

												This game is hard, yet fair with tense as hell combat and a lot of room for strategic use of traps. The atmosphere is superb. The voice acting is lack luster, buck this is an issue I can easily look past, especially considering how much fun I had. This game demands a sequel both to straighten out some of the kinks and just so I can play more.Edit: Oh! I didn't even mention the music! It's just wonderful and it really adds to the overall feel of this game. I love it.			"

I finally got to play it after 2 days. Long story short, best game i have played in a while. Definitely up there with Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons. The music is  the best i have ever heard in any game. Especially the one during the loading screen. If you want a fun not so hardcore game, 100% get this one. The gameplay is also easy, well at the beginning. It's all about planning and using your head. I could go on for ages but I 100% recommend this game to any gamer out there. Won't dissapoint. I promise :)			"

												This sh.it is AWESOME. Every new «mission» is divided into the daytime, when you plan your defence, place the traps, and buy stuff, and the night, when you act, defending your buildings. Between normal and hard choose hard — the game will appear quite difficult, but that's what you came for. Though there are a lot of parameters, traps, items, etc., you'll find yourself well-informed about every new feature, after watching short but informative video tutorials, appearing all along in your adventure. The best thing about this game is that you have to plan (during the day) every your move, and try to keep the sequence of your further acts together in your head (during the night). Meanwhile, it's not just a mind game, where you plan-and-execute... Actually, the «execution» part is made of real action, filled with suddenness, emotional experience and adrenaline.A rare gameplay masterpiece. 92 out of 100.			"

												Although I'm not usually one for the tower defence genre, I was happily lured in by the setting of Sang-Froid. What other game takes you to Quebec in 1858? You play as one of two brothers who are both good men at heart but somewhat troubled and not particularly liked by civilization. When your sister falls ill after being run out of town by a two-faced priest, the tiny cabin you hole up in becomes full of family turmoil and the epicentre of attacks by possessed wolves and more. Family woes aren't exactly put aside as monsters come night after night, giving a great feel for the brothers.Gameplay is a merge of tower defence and third person action. During the day you go to town to buy booze, weapons, and gear and set up all sorts of traps from simple wolf traps to hanging nets of rocks to much more elaborate tools like spring-loaded spikes and ballistas. As is often the case, you unlock more and more goodies and more routes and more places to defend as you rely on a mix of trapping and just beating things with an axe or shooting a musket. Depending on how you spend your skills every level can also help out your preference of play.So with a unique setting, variable gameplay, a great soundtrack, and enjoyment all round, if you remotely like tower defence and/or third person action, Sang-Froid is a must!

												First off I reccomend this game entirely to anyone who enjoy's the following.Werewolves.Good story.Tactical gaming.A challenge.If all of the above topics appeal to you  I believe you will enjoy this game.What I like about it. (Spoiler-Maybe?)Firstly I like the story/topic. Two brothers trying to survive and protect their ill sister as werewolve's and other creatures  descend upon them. The topic ""werewolve's"" it's an easy place to make a rich story and as you get farther in the game it becomes so.This game does and does not hold your hand, You are explained everything in great detail and taught how to play the game but it is wholey up to you to excecute what you have been taught and at certain times flawlessly. it really leads you calmly into the woods then leaves you to the wolves. The gameplay is exillerating! you plan out everything all of your traps, what weapon's you will use, where the enemy is coming from, what type of enemy and how many there will be before nightfall. You plan and learn as you play the game and you are forced to do so. Then when night comes you see if your tactic and preperation payed off, Did you miss something? or forget something? Did your traps work like you imagined they would? did you bring enough silver or blessed bullets? you find out quickly if what you had done the day before was enough to help you through the grizzly night.You purchase items from the town and other places to help you against the varied and versatile creatures. You start with a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor woodsman's axe and an old musket, They get the job done for a while but not for too long at least not in the state they're in. So you look to upgrade, Walking into the blacksmith's shop you spot a nice looking lumberjacks axe that put's your  current affair to shame' however... It cost's 5 dollars! tripple your current allowance for shiny axes. feeling crummy and that the world is against you you walk into a chapel to angrilly pray at god! But as you enter a nun approaches and seeing your axe she offers to bless it with holy power effectivly doubling it's current strength she'll bless you'r normal style bullet's too. Suddenly that crap axe is looking pretty swell and your musket doesn't make you want to use it to shoot yourself in the head.This game does a really good job at pulling you in, At least it did for me. At first I didn't know what to think playing the first few chapters I was let's say... unimmpressed.  but as I progressed I was compelled to continue and the more I played the more I felt that way, That drive didn't wear off for me and it still hasn't.What I don't like about it.Bug's they are in every game and I hate them! (Unless they're funny)What I like about it.Everything else! I can say that I like just about everything in this game I really have no bad to say about it. But that's just me. Anyone reading this is their own critic as it should be, You're just looking for some insight on a game. But I know and you know that it doesn't really matter what I or anyone else sais, What matter's is how you feel when you play the game.Thank's for reading.P.S. this game has a demo! simply search ""Sang-Froid"" on steam and give it a go!

However to me, that's extremely rewarding. Typically this type of foresight is reserved mainly for tanks and troops ie military. But this pleasant game made it work fantastically.

												This was a tough one. This game has lovely art, great controls, a fun combination of strategy and action, and an enchanting mythology set in old Canada. A plague of possessed wolves and werewolves begin attacking a small Canadian village and two estranged brothers, one a trapper and one a lumberjack, must unite to protect their beloved sister as the Devil seeks to claim her for his own. Imagine ""Orcs Must Die"" mixed with ""The Howling"" and ""The Exorcist""! It's glorious! But after less than an hour, I had to stop playing and uninstall it because, honestly, I love wolves. For whatever reason i feel a deep kinship with them, and being required by a game to kill nothing BUT wolves -- wolves which react realistically and whimper when hit -- was beyond the pale for me. Nevermind the fact that these wolves are possessed by the Devil, acting entirely out of character (which the game, to its credit, repeatedly acknowledges) and mutating into hideous anthropoid forms -- you're still killing wolves. I can't bear it. I recommend this game highly, but not if you are as viscerally attached to lupines as I am. If you don't mind fighting demon-wolves for the soul of your family? PLAY THIS!			"

												This game is a different kind of tower defence. You use the night to set up traps to kill or impede the werewolves and other beasts, and then you have to finish what's left off yourself.This requires you to plan and make a strategy each night, which is really cool, thinking about how best to lure the max amout of werewolves into the most efficient trap and how many you can beat with your axe to save money.The story is charming and the game oozes charm and atmosphere, though the voice acting is fairly bad.If you want a different kind of tower defence game, and want to beat up werewolves with an axe, then this is the game for you!

												- 8.5 / 10 -This is a truly unique indie gem! Spectacular systems of strategic TD, combat & character leveling. The cut-scenes are slightly lack-luster graphically wise, yet it portrays an intriguing tale of demonic influences. While it is co-written by best-selling Canadian author Bryan Perro, the dialogue @ times can leave something to be desired. However it's redeeming qualities far out-weigh any minor gripes I have.Over-riding all minor flaws is this games ability to deliver a unique blend of strategy & combat with RPG elements, nice gameplay & satisfying progression.

Amazing Indie Game! First watched the trailer, thought it seemed like an interesting game, and hey! It was very cheap! Didn't  have high expectations, but damn was I foolish to have that, because this game was really good!Starting the game and up comes the loading screen. Suddenly a playful tune turns on, which was this amazing cool soundtrack. Didn't even bother that the loading screen was long, since the soundtrack was so fun to listen to. Playing trough the game and I still enjoy the soundtracks. The traps are cool, and it really seems that the developers has put a lot of thought into the traps and their purpose. And little did I know that they had so many different creatures. Planning a strategy for each wave and could never use the same strategy twice really made my head ache. Really fun! At the final stages of the game I had to actually write down my strategy to remember because it got so complex. Very few games has done that for me, and that is a really good thing. One also had to thing ahead to make short tactics for one day and long strategies for days ahead.The story was well thought trough, and was really compelling. Enjoy it a lot. The graphics really fit the consept of the game and usually I'm a ""grapichs ♥♥♥♥♥"" and just play games with great graphics, but with this game I didn't bother at all since it was so giving.MUST BUY if you like Tower-Defense Third-person Shooter RPG! Or simply just buy it no mather what because this game was outstanding!Really looking forward to  eventually a sequal or  a new game from these developers :D			"

												Overall was a fun and interesting game and worth buying. Especially if you can get it on sell.Loved the fact that the planning aspect of the game just didn't make the game easier to complete the levels, but is necessary to even have a chance to survive.The storyline, voice acting, and ""cut-scenes"" are to be excepted of a indie developed game. Nothing fancy but it gets the job done at the end of the day. This is by far the weakest part of the game.The game itself is well designed otherwise.The traps, the defenses you plan during the day, are simple to understand and use. The combat, while it may take a few levels to master, is effective. Lastly, the achievement system is simple yet effective.The game is also the first of at least two planned games. Personally, I'm looking forward towards the next game in the series.Review based on roughly 25 hours played, two playthroughs, with both brothers, and 100% achievements completed.			"

												Interesting fusion of strategy, tower defence and 3rd person action wrapped up with a quirky theme which is overall an enjoyable experience and worth a look if you want something different!The game has you taking the role of one of two brothers defending initially their cabin, but eventually a number of buildings and locations throughout a forest from ever increasing waves of wolves, werewolves and other mythical  creatures. Gameplay is split into two phases: Day Phase: This is basically the 'setup' you are presented with a map of the forest showing the spawn locations, number and targets of the various enemies you will face during the night. From here you can set traps, or place other structures to help you survive the night. You can visit shops to buy new equipment which the money you earn and spend skill points which are unlocked by levelling up your character to give you bonus abilities. Night Phase: During the night you must take control of your character to enact you plan by running around the forest, springing the traps you have set and taking on the enemies in combat (both gun based and melee). The game provides a good variety of enemies, each with different strengths and weaknesses to plan for, and a range of traps allowing you to pick your tactics. The 'Lumberjack' theme is nicely carried through the game in the art style of the menus and the soundtrack. The 3rd person combat is a little clunky, but is designed to keep you thinking tactically rather than just charging into a group with your axe. The game certainly has negative points which might put some people off. The story is overly complicated, fairly non-nonsensical and unnecessary. The voice acting/dialogue in the cut-scenes isn't amazing and in general I didn't like the way it was told, mostly in dull dialogue between characters. Occasionally there would be a cut scene represented in a kind of hand-drawn animation style (completely different to everything else) which actually worked really well and I can't help but think the game designers should have had a simpler story, but stuck to this style. The loading times are also quite long and although you can restart a mission at 'dusk' with all your traps in the same place, you still have to go back to the planning screen, start the night, go through the inventory screen, wait for the level to load  and click through any cut-scenes before you can make another attempt at a mission you failed, which gets annoying if you make a few mistakes early on in a mission.

												If you see this game by any coincidence just go and grab it since its for free anyway.The gameplay bases on well planned strategy in advance and action based real time fighting which is really a lot of fun and keeps you entertained for long time. The concept of planning the strategy and executing them in practise in such a fairy tale atmosphere is really an interesting combination and is really well implemented in this context.Story, Voice , and the gameplay elements itself are also suprisingly excellent as well.What amazes me more is the pure fact that its completely free, i would have been even ready to pay for that game , a big thanks to the developers.

												Sangfroid is an action-tower defence game, like Orcs Must Die, but with more emphasis on tactical planning. It has some neat ideas that provide a fresh experience within the genre. You're a 19th century Canadian lumberjack, and your home is under attack by werewolves and other mystical creatures. Each level is split into two parts, day and night. During the day you can see which enemies you'll face, and which path they'll take. You can place traps, spend XP on upgrades, and visit town to buy weapons and equipment. Then you fight at night, using your traps and 3rd person combat. You can't place any new traps, your gun reloads slowly and melee attacks reduce your stamina. But this is good, because it really forces you to think ahead and carefully plan every move. The difficulty curve is nicely balanced. The story is good, but sadly the voice acting is awful, and graphics are not fantastic. Its very stable, and I got 9 hours from one playthrough, so I'm happy with value for money.			"

												I enjoy it when a game designer approaches a pre-existing genre from a new, flavorful perspective. For example, I think it would be neat if we could get rid of the zombies in a lot of these survival/horror games and instead put the players against mummies in Egypt.So how did I react when I saw that Sang Froid was a tower defense game, set in the Great White North, where you must protect a house with an axe and a musket from waves of werewolves sent by the devil? My reaction could be summed up in one word: SOLD!Sangfroid (pronounced san-frwa) is a french word for “the ability to stay calm in difficult or dangerous situations.” This game requires exactly that.  Most games give you relatively fast recharge time or a clip for you gun rounds, so you can afford to miss shots occasionally.  In Sang-Froid, you have to reload your musket after every shot.  In many instances, you have to stall the wolves while you reload your musket, and you have to build that time into your gameplan and make every shot count. You have a lot to do and a short time to do it, but the key thing is that you keep calm and carry on.I once heard this genre referred to as a “boots on the ground tower defense game,” and I think that’s an apt description.  It reminds me a little bit of Brutal Legend; I even remember thinking during one mission “this does to tower defense what Brutal Legend attempted to do with RTS, but it does it right.”  After reading other reviews, I have seen the game compared to Orcs Must Die and/or Sanctum.  If they are anything like Sang Froid, I am excited about giving them a try.While Sang Froid requires timing, I wouldn’t call it a twitch game.  That said, it is one where you have to remain alert to the larger danger while keeping your attention on the specific task at hand.  The stages were hard, but satisfying.  whenever I finished one, I felt like Hannibal from the A-Team. (""I love it when a plan comes together."")The overall flavor to the game is light, campy, with a good story and just the right amount of cheese.  The game constantly changes graphical styles between game play, cut scenes, and dialog. If I wasn’t such a fan of Ralph Bakshi’s animation I would likely find this quite jarring. I wouldn’t be surprised if other people found this annoying.The digital storytelling technique used in the game serves as a reminder that it is a low budget title, but I think that added to the overall charm of the game.  The characters appearing and disappearing during dialog reminds me of the dialog from Guild Wars 2 or Aqua Teen Hunger Force. The folk-style soundtrack makes me think of what country music must have sounded like before country music existed; it keeps the player in the moment, but remained light enough to keep it from feeling like a horror game.Sang Froid is an excellent tower defense game with a lot of charm and an interesting story.  Give it a try.			"

												I realized the true potential of this game just as I saw it in the GreenLight. Well, this game is really worthwhile! Strategic and roleplay features make incredible atmosphere of a folk horror tale, which is supported with a fantastic soundtrack. Highly recomended!Advatages:1) Comfortable system of strategic planning and fiendly interface.2) Wonderful roleplay system: without an odd complexity, but with a good variety.3) Enchanting soundtrack!4) Very realistic gameplay: we get money from selling wolves' fur and lumbering (gold doesn't run out from killed enemies instead of blood)5) All the cinematics could be skipped.Disadvantages:1) I agree that the style of graphics makes the spirit of the game, but some models could be much smoothy.Потенциал этой игры я понял, когда голосовал за неё в GreenLight. Но, как это у меня заведено, ждал скидок 50+ %. Игра оправдала ожидания. Стратегические и ролевые моменты на высоте, адреналина в драках тоже хватает.Плюсы:1) Хорошая система планирования ловушек и удобный интерфейс.2) Отличная ролевая система. Не замороченная, как это любят в современных играх, но достаточно разнообразная, чтобы выбрать свой стиль игры.3) Очень приятный саундтрек.4) Продуманные детали сюжета и геймплея. Например, деньги мы получаем от продажи шкур и от работы на вырубке (а не собираем брызнувшее из чудовищ, как  сок из ягод, золото)5) Почти все ролики и заставки можно пропустить.Минусы:1) Графика, конечно, могла бы быть и получше. Хотя, отчасти такая прорисовка добавляет атмосферности.			"

												Very unique game, pushes the DEFENSE genre ahead of the competition with its awesome strategy gameplay and the awesome story/atmosphere. You set up the traps during day and at night is when the action/violence starts. Very addicting, good music, voice acting, atmosphere and gameplay, this is a game to check out! Another indie classic for PC!			"

												Play as one of two Québécois brothers and help them in defending their 19th century Canadian farmland from sprites, demons, and as the title would suggest, werewolves. Highlights are a superb musical score, variety of historical weapons, full RPG and economics system, and an overall unique aesthetic.I would say this game surpasses ""Orcs Must Die!"" in quality.

												It's an interesting take on the Tower Defense with Combat Avatar hybrid style of game, giving a lot of choice in each level as to the emphasis you want to place on traps or melee combat. The cut-scenes really really need an 'advance dialog line' button, but I haven't quite brought myself to skip them unseen.			"

												I am not one for strategy games but Sang-Froid's graphic cuts & careful choice of coloring put a joy in my very precious gaming time. I either like something or I don't-hopefully the same goes for you. I don't like [especially] FPS (first-person-shooters),Strategy games or point-&-click. Now, to incorporate these together in a game adds an appealing turn in the gaming road.Sang-Froid mixes 3rd person gaming with strategy. Ohhh the weather..I love wintry cold settings...Sang-Froid is set in the freezing, snowing cowboy west. Something like a canadian condition. Inherent yankee language throughout. Having completed it was I left with a good feeling? Yes!Every time I got up from the game...yearning to sit back down and continue the story...that good!! In the story the evil-one (himself) steps in the storyline, comprising of 2 brothers trying to save their sister from death. The red-indians and that lore. Do I want a sequel? I do!			"

												Before I start, let me say that steam measures my game time wrong, I've spend at least twice as much with it and there still is plenty of way to go.Pros :- very satisfying and tactical gameplay- large variety of different weapons, tools and strategies available to the player- different types of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses- changing environment that requires you to adapt and develop new tactics- decent layer of character customisation - constant challenge throughout the campagain, does not get boring- interesting and well-told story- good style and music- does a very good job of introducing the player to the mechanicsCons :- graphics, although not terrible, are definitely not a strong side of the game- combat takes a little getting used to and tends to feel clunky- campaign is the only mode and it could be a little longer - wish there were scenarios or a map editorNote : This game is not for idiots, therefore if you feel like the level of your inteligence has dimished severly after years of watching anime, playing call of duty and mmo games, don't bother. It is also not for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥so if failing at a mission makes you want to cry and uninstall, just do it and get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ operation ( make sure to eat lots of soybeans aswell ).8/10, very good, go and get it			"

												I bought it on sale, and from the first looks it felt kinda boring but now every time I want to skip some usual big name games I go back to Sang-Froid, indeed this soundtrack and well suited atmosphere makes you look like Davy Crockett, except u kill Werewolves. Story is written in some fairly made cutscenes with low level actors, but it is all together packed nicely for a relax trip to snowy wastelands. This game actually reminds me on my childhood. When I were 10 yrs old I loved cartoon made novels by Sergio Bonelli Editore S.p.a. (Zagor Te Nej, Blek Stena, Komadant Mark). Love them now and I highly recommend game for late night before sleep fun time.			"

												Absolutely.  Fun game that challenges the mind and reflexes with strategy and action.  It also has fantastic music and a setting that you don't see very often.  Despite not having the most polish, this game's atmosphere works very well.  The only downside that was immediatly apparent was the voice acting.  Even then it didn't take away from the game.  Everyone who can should buy this game.			"

												A massively under-rated game. I would recommend this game to anyone! I picked it up in a sale and haven't regretted it. I haven't been brave enough to try it on hard yet but standard difficulty is challenging enough without it becoming to stressful- trying to get to all of your buildings in time to protect them. A really good range of enemies and defenses, I would have liked some better weapons, you don't really need any other axe than the first one. I liked the levelling system, as you can't purchase every perk it makes you personalise your character to your style of play.10/10			"

												Very rarely do I write reviews for games but I felt this one deserved it. This game takes several elements from my favorite genres (RPGs, Strategy, Action/Adventure) and puts them all into one very well-done package. The decisions you make when leveling and planning your strategies are tough and have real consequences on the outcome of the game. Often times you are on your toes trying to get from one place to another on the map and the sense of urgency during the nights you are trying to survive is persistent and effective. The story was very interesting and keep me playing. I almost beat this game in one sitting to find out what was happening. It is a unique and dark story line set in the late 1850s and the time period and setting really add to the story being told. Gameplay elements are good, there are a few small bugs but nothing that really got in my way of enjoying the game. The graphics are simple but they work-it is an indie game but deserves way more attention. There are hand-drawn cutscenes from time to time that add to the experience. You will hear several people talk about the music in this game and let me say they are not wrong in stating it is excellent. I loved it so much I tracked down the artists online and will be buying the albums. They are all French so it was a bit of a hunt but the music is so good it didn't bother me. I hope to see a sequel to this at some point. I would highly recommend this game, especially when on sale.			"

http://lantredugeek.com/pc-sang-froid-un-conte-de-loups-garous/Qu'est-ce que ce jeu?Le principe de base de Sang-Froid est assez simple; les deux frères devront protéger leur sœur contre les hordes de monstres que le diable leur envoie la nuit. Pour ce faire, ils devront utiliser l'environnement qui les entoure à leur avantage et préparer de savants pièges et outils qui leur permettront de tenir une nuit de plus. Passons au travers des quelques éléments qui constituent ce magnifique jeu; 


YouTube™ Video: Bande-annonce de Sang-Froid - un conte de loups-garous 

			Views: 6,473		

			Nouvelle bande-annonce du jeu vidéo indépendant Sang-Froid - un conte de loups-garous, dont l'histoire a été co-écrite avec Bryan Perro, l'auteur d'Amos Daragon et de Wariwolf.		

 Les deux frères / niveaux de difficultéSangFroid_Feuille-PersonnageEn commençant votre partie, vous aurez le choix de jouer l'un des deux frères (Jacques ""Ti-Jack"" et Joseph ""Ti-Jos"" O'Carroll). Les deux frères représentant les deux niveaux de difficulté du jeu; Facile/Difficile. En jouant avec Jacques O'Carroll (le mode difficile), vous serez un chasseur agile et rusé. Vous devrez faire preuve d'ingéniosité à l'aide de vos trappes et de votre fusil de chasse, étant plus faible physiquement que votre autre frère, la ruse sera votre meilleure arme! En jouant avec Joseph O'Carroll (le mode facile), vous serez un fier bûcheron fort et robuste. Vos coups de hache seront forts et puissants, il est également important de remarquer vous aurez beaucoup plus de facilité à résister aux attaques de vos ennemis. Les deux personnages auront accès aux mêmes actions, objets et arbres de compétences. Cependant, les différences se joueront au niveau de la résistance physique, de la force de frappe avec la hache, de la précision aux armes à feu ainsi que l'agilité de chaque personnage. Tandis que l'un sera beaucoup plus résistant, l'autre devra garder ses distances. Et alors que l'un possède une meilleure maîtrise de l'arme à feu, l'autre devra se préférer l'utilisation de sa fidèle hache. La phase de préparations (le jour)SangFroid_Jour-MonstresLe jour, c'est votre période de préparation. Vous aurez accès à une carte détaillée de l'environnement dans lequel vous allez combattre. Sur ladite carte régionale, vous aurez la possibilité de voir des cartes de monstre vous permettant de planifier vos défenses grâce aux prédictions de votre petite sœur, Joséphine. Ces cartes vous permettront de connaître chaque type de monstre, l'endroit d'où ceux-ci débuteront leur attaque, leur trajectoire ainsi que leur but final. Une mission se déroule généralement sur deux tours (ou plus), les prévisions de Joséphine vous permettront également de connaître d'avance l'ordre d’apparition des monstres pour chaque tour.SangFroid_Jour-TrappesPour vous défendre contre les monstres, vous aurez la possibilité de placer des pièges de toutes sortes pour vous aider dans votre tâche; appâts pour ralentir certaines créatures, feux-de-joie pour effrayer certaines créatures, murs de feu pour changer la trajectoire de vos ennemis, trappes-à-ours, et plus encore! Chaque monstre possède ses faiblesses, et ce sera votre travail de savoir quels pièges sont les plus appropriés aux situations dans lesquelles vous vous retrouverez. Pour installer un piège ou une installation, vous devriez utiliser vos sous ainsi que vos points d'action. Après un certain point dans le jeu, vous serez dans la mesure d'échanger vos points d'action contre des sous supplémentaires en coupant du bois.SangFroid_Magasin-GeneralPendant la préparation de vos défenses pour la nuit, vous aurez également la chance de visiter le village de Val-aux-loups afin de faire quelques emplettes aux différents magasins du village. Vous pourrez y acheter armes, balles pour vos armes à feu, objets de guérison, etc. Afin de pouvoir faire vos achats, vous devrez utiliser les sous que vous aurez amassé au courant de vos dernières aventures. (Vous aurez des sous pour chaque monstre que vous aurez tué, pour chaque mission complétée, ou bien en vendant du bois.)Une fois que vous êtes préparés, il ne vous reste plus qu'à attendre que la nuit se lève. La phase de combat (la nuit)SangFroid_NuitEt la nuit, c'est là que l'action commence! Vous aurez un petit laps de temps pour déplacer votre personnage là où vous le souhaitez avant que la première vague d'attaque ne commence. Par la suite, vous devrez vous assurer que chaque créature a bien été tuée pour sauter à l'étape suivante. Pour ce faire, vous pourrez activer certaines trappes manuellement (pièges de roches suspendues, feux-de-joie, etc.) ou bien attaquer les créatures directement à l'aide de votre hache et de votre fusil.En combat, vous pourrez courir et sauter, faire des roulades pour esquiver les attaques, lancer de puissants cris pour attirer les créatures au loin ou effrayer les créatures tentant de vous attaquer, attaquer vos ennemis à coups de hache, tirer à coups de fusil, utiliser les objets que vous aurez achetés au magasin ou même tomber en rage quelques secondes afin d'asséner des coups encore plus puissants aux monstres qui veulent votre peau. Faites attention à votre barre d'énergie; chaque fois que vous faites une action physique (coup de hache, courir, rouler, etc.), vous utiliserez une certaine quantité d'énergie. Une fois la barre vidée, vous serez exténué, et deviendrez une proie facile. Il est important de prendre de petites pauses lorsqu'il est possible pour éviter que cela n'arrive!Une fois que vous aurez anéanti toutes les vagues de monstres, vous aurez complété la mission. Vos récompenses en sous vous seront alors distribuées, et vous pourrez attaquer le prochain jour pour de nouveaux défis. Il est important de noter que chaque nuit apporte de nouveaux monstres ou de nouvelles possibilités/mécaniques de jeu qui vous demanderont de pouvoir vous adapter rapidement. Qualité graphique, artistique et sonoreSangFroid_ChargementCertes, les graphismes du jeu ne sont pas les plus beaux, et ce, même si vos paramètres sont au maximum. Les modèles utilisés pour représenter les personnages et les créatures font un boulot très convenable et du moins, le jeu n'est pas laid. L'ambiance générale et le style artistique de Sang-Froid nous permettent d'oublier très facilement les quelques lacunes côté modélisation, textures et animations. SangFroid_DiscussionsMalgré le style artistique intéressant de Sang-Froid, le jeu possède une grosse lacune côté doublage. Malgré le fait que les voix francophones utilisent un français d'antan (ce qui facilite l'immersion d'ailleurs), nous avons l'impression que les acteurs lisent directement un livre sans regarder l'animation des personnages. Également, il est important de noter qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de cinématiques dans le jeu, le jeu utilisant plus ou moins le même principe que les jeux de ""nouvelles interactives"" où l'image des personnages est placée au-dessus d'une boîte de texte. Seule différence est que chaque texte est accompagné d'une voix, et que l'image est remplacée par un modèle 3D quelque peu animé. ConclusionSang-Froid est la preuve que le Québec est capable de grandes choses dans le monde du jeu vidéo. Le petit studio indépendant d'Artifice Studios a su créer un petit bijou que tous les amateurs de jeux de stratégie devraient se procurer. L'univers utilisé pour le jeu est unique et utilise une époque peu exploitée par l'industrie, ce qui lui donne un charme exceptionnel. La qualité graphique du jeu est un peu basse, mais le style artistique de celui-ci nous fait rapidement oublier ces quelques lacunes. Le jeu ne possède pas de modes multijoueurs, mais offre tout de même un excellent facteur plaisir. Nous vous conseillons de vous le procurer dès maintenant!HISTOIRE/NARRATION - 8.5UNIVERS/CONSISTANCE - 10PERSONNAGES/ENNEMIS - 9QUALITÉ GRAPHIQUE - 8QUALITÉ SONORE - 9QUALITÉ INTELLIGENCE ARTFICIELLE - 8.5FACTEUR REJOUABILITÉ - 7.5FACTEUR DIFFICULTÉ - 7FACTEUR INNOVATION - 8.5			"

												Despite the rough graphics and voice-acting, despite the hack & slash being lacking, it blends together with a rich atmosphere, capable RPG elements and ingenious strategic compentents to come together as a deeply clever and immersive game that has no equals in a genre it has created all by itself: Which I'd like to call Strategic Action Defense. In essence, the game is a unique, ingenious bland between a rudimentary third person hack&slash and a clever (tower) defense game in the most strategic sense possible. Anyone would be excused for thinking of isometric Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games like LOL or DOTA, or Orcs Must Die where the combat is hectic, constant, fast paced and deals with hundreds of mindless mobs marching towards your side, but Sang-Froid is not. Instead the action is tense, tactical, clever and far more personal.Every game, you start off with a top down perspective of a pine forest through which snowy trails wind towards your cabin. They're paths taken by an onslaught of wolves out to tear it down. This is the planning phase. At first, you just need to defend the cabin where your sick sister lies, but soon the barn, mill, church and more buildings get added to the community under your care. Your sister is a special kind of sick however. She can see from where the wolves are coming to attack those buildings and what routes they'll take, through visions.This is where the first difference between the game and others like it become apparant: It's personal. When you choose to leave the planning stage and enter the world, the third person hack&slash ensures that your character is the most versatile weapon you have and there really aren't that many wolves, especially in the beginning. Its just that the wolves are capable of coming in from anywhere and your character is just one man with a tiny bar of stamina that can't possibly cover the large stretches of space between buildings AND safely fight more than a few wolves at the same time. And when you do choose to engage, the wolves aren't fodder either. They really are characters in their own right.Personal combat is involving. Should they have all pounced at once, they would have torn you apart, but a complex system of fear and intimidation, using roars, fires and actions, will see them circling while you deal with those few who manage the courage to take swipes at you. You are are armed with axe and rifle, but the axe will quickly sap your stamina and your rifle is an antique that requires 10 seconds of loading. Tougher foes arrive by themselves or in pairs, but these are often so durable that they take just as much time as any one of those packs.Combat is a long process against worthy foes then, but time isn't something you have as more packs all over the map close in on your buildings.This is where the traps come in, and a good deal of patience and savvy from you. Using the planning phase ahead of the third person action phase, allows you to not only prepare your own community through the purchase of gear, but to prepare a strategy for dealing with all of these packs at the same time. And instead of just placing down towers that splash the occasional damage, these traps are of the visceral, personal kind, suited to dealing with a foe that would have given you so much trouble in melee.Bearclaws will instantly kill the four legged wolves. Bait attracts and slows them down, giving you precious extra time. Placing nets with an avalanche of rocks in them high among the treetops, will bury werewolves when timed right. Place kindle in certain passages and set it alight to redirect packs.Some of these traps work automatic. Others are far more involving. The net trap for example, needs to be triggered by a shot from your rifle, preferably after luring the werewolf underneath through the use of deception: Bait or a shout to lure it there.If there's one thing the game does exceedingly well, it is to establish the relationship between hunter and hunted, or making you feel like a rugged outdoors man triumphing over nature through wit. You are keenly aware of just how frightful and tough a werewolf can be in combat, so seeing it carried off through the air on the sharp tip of a ballista bolt after you've personally set it off and tricked the wolf in the right position is a gleeful moment. The transfer between planning phase where you control the map, and action phase where your control is limited to the range of your gun is a disempowering one. The map is tidy, but on foot, the mill is a world away. All you could do is set some spike traps around it, only to realize you couldn't do the same for the werewolf you are about to face for lack of cash. There's only a bonfire for him, to keep him back. ""Will it work?"" You will wonder.In such a moment, a sudden swish-click-yelp sound in the far distance of the frozen wintersky, will make you smile as you keep warm around the lit bonfire.Other than this, the game itself has charm too. Its not a looker, with somewhat decent animation and bearable graphics. Sometimes, the voice acting is cringe-worthy too, with a cast of would-be native Americans barely able to manage the accent. But a cast there is however, with cutscenes and a story too that - although not particular exciting - perfectly enforces the atmosphere of being a Canadian lumberjack on the frontier of a dangerous wildernesses. The mythology of werewolves and Canadian folklore is handled with careful respect and soon you'll be facing creatures from both British Canadian Christian fables and Native American Folklore. Even items are carefully described for their history in logging and Canadian history. I don't even mind the completely outdated method of clicking on individual buildings when going to town to buy gear. It adds to charm. The sound and music make up for a lot and once you manage to see past the outdated looks, you'll appreciate the cartoony feeling and the perfect v-shaped broom closet that is your main character. "

												I didn't know what to think about this game when I started playing, it seemed kinda ""meh"" at first, but.. then I realized hours have passed and I was still playing... I just couldn't stop!Once you get passed the terrible looking cutscenes and the extremely campy, laughable voice acting, you'll be treated to the awesome unique style, story and gameplay that makes this game very addicting and fun to play.The difficulty will either make you hate or love this game, you have almost limitless ways of slaying your foes, dozens of traps, trinkets, pistols, rifles and melee weapons. Each enemy have its own weakness/strenghts and it's up to you each day to prepare for battle at night (where the action takes place) you really need to plan ahead to succeed, just winging it doesn't cut it.The visuals won't blow you away, at times they are actually quite painful to watch.. however, for the most part, they work, they fit well with the unique style of the game, in the end I was actually enjoying the ""old timey' look, still not sure what happened with the cutscenese tho, they seems to be rendered at sub HD resolutions...Overall, it was a surprise hit and I'm looking forward to ""Part 2"" If your looking for something different, you just might be surprised like I was, check it out, you never know :D7/10			"

												A nifty little take on tower defense in the same vein as Orcs Must Die!, Sang-Froid offers up a healthy dose of enemy variety, strategy, and just plain fun.  The cutscene work is very shoddy, but if you can look past it you'll find a great game.			"

												A massively under-rated game. I would recommend this game to anyone! I picked it up in a sale and haven't regretted it. I haven't been brave enough to try it on hard yet but standard difficulty is challenging enough without it becoming to stressful- trying to get to all of your buildings in time to protect them. A really good range of enemies and defenses, I would have liked some better weapons, you don't really need any other axe than the first one. I liked the levelling system, as you can't purchase every perk it makes you personalise your character to your style of play.10/10			"

												Very rarely do I write reviews for games but I felt this one deserved it. This game takes several elements from my favorite genres (RPGs, Strategy, Action/Adventure) and puts them all into one very well-done package. The decisions you make when leveling and planning your strategies are tough and have real consequences on the outcome of the game. Often times you are on your toes trying to get from one place to another on the map and the sense of urgency during the nights you are trying to survive is persistent and effective. The story was very interesting and keep me playing. I almost beat this game in one sitting to find out what was happening. It is a unique and dark story line set in the late 1850s and the time period and setting really add to the story being told. Gameplay elements are good, there are a few small bugs but nothing that really got in my way of enjoying the game. The graphics are simple but they work-it is an indie game but deserves way more attention. There are hand-drawn cutscenes from time to time that add to the experience. You will hear several people talk about the music in this game and let me say they are not wrong in stating it is excellent. I loved it so much I tracked down the artists online and will be buying the albums. They are all French so it was a bit of a hunt but the music is so good it didn't bother me. I hope to see a sequel to this at some point. I would highly recommend this game, especially when on sale.			"

												A game that surprised me in more than one way. With a good story, nice atmosphere , offering a lot of ways to survive each night and adding a RPG skill tree for your character to evolve when enough experience is accumulated, Sang-Froid Tales of Werewolves was indeed a worthwhile experience. I took my time with this game, and played with Jack (higher difficulty) and it proved to be challenging. You must be careful how you spend your action points each day and your money, so planning is the key action here. Taking on the werewolves, wolves, windigos, fire demons on your own without traps is not reccomended. If you want something quite interesting to play that will keep your mind busy with setting traps as well as being cunning in combat, this is the game for you. (you also get bonus points on enjoying this game if you like werewolves, wolves in particular!! )			"

												Sang-Froid is a good game with a unique take on the classic tower defence genre. You still have towers and traps. You still defend. However, the majority of your traps require you, the player, to operate them. So, the gameplay is shifted to focus on player mobility and positioning as opposed to statically looking at a top down map. The game is also soaked in theme and has a good story to go with it.My only two complaints are the length (I felt i was just getting into the game when it ended) and that I personally don't care for the artistic style of the in game cut scenes. The intro cut scene (shown above in the trailer) is supurbly done. Unfortunately, for most of the game the cut scenes are two characters with a static background (example above in the screen shots for the game). It's OK... but dynamic cut scenes would have been far better.			"

												An excellent RPG/Tower Defense hybrid. While I find that many Tower Defense games that put you into the action become to frenetic and less tactical, Sang-Froid gives a good balance of personal action and methodical strategy. The gameplay elements built on top of the tower defense elements (enemy fear, sound, wind) provide interesting strategy choices as well as really helping the thematic feel of the game.All in all it's really well done, fits together, and is a lot of fun, I'd definitely recommend it.

												Seems like a real gem of an indie game. Personality and care in design seem to be dripping off it, despite some meh voice acting (to be expected in the indie scene though). Too bad it refuses to run in full screen, no matter how much I play with the graphical settings of both the game and my computer. The icons render too itty bitty to read, and the game is essentially unplayable. This is a apparently a problem with my monitor, in the sense that my monitor uses tech that is more advanced than what the game supports. But even when I scale my monitor's resolution down to 1024x768 and adjust the game's settings to match it, the game window just gets smaller and smaller. I get the best results keeping the monitor at 3200x1800 and running the game at 1900x1080, but even then it still takes up just a third of the screen. Probably a problem unique to my particular monitor, but unfortunate that I don't get to enjoy the game as intended, and I just wanted to put that out there as a potential warning, even if it is an unlikely one. The game still gets a recommendation on spirit alone.			"

												All aspects of the game are wonderful, made with thoughtful complexity. Strategic phase where/when you place traps, simple skill tree and some various items that nevertheless push character in the direction of your prefered playstyle, and combat phase where your strategic planning unfold, all are beautifully interwoven into great game of quite unique genre.And what makes you constantly motivated throughout the game are new strategic elements that evolve step by step till the end. Its a shame that such a great game got so untalented actors and dialog writer.Another downside of the game is that it doesnt have other play mode than the story play mode which is quite short.If you like making strategic solutions, timed 3rd person hack and slash alike action with a scent of rpg then this is the game you will enjoy.9/10			"

												I have not played this game in awhile, but I wanted to give a review in light of the possibility of increasing its visibility via Steam nominations.  I have played no other games in this genre, but many compare it to the Orcs Must Die series.  This game combines elements of FPS, tower defense, and RPG wrapped in a beautiful package inspired by obscure history and folklore.  Combining Quebecois and indigenous folkloric elements in a mid-nineteenth century milieu, there is no setting like it.  This is very refreshing in a culture industry where ""generic high fantasy"" is now ubiquitous and passe, often falling back on Tolkien without understanding what makes his oeuvre magisterial and immortal.  Some have criticized the voice acting for a lack of polish, but it has a heartfelt community theater style that charms, entertains, and fits this project.  The stakes and tension in the story grow steadily to fever pitch, and the cliffhanger left me wanting more immediately.  There are several mechanics and ways to play, so you can experiment with different styles-guns, potions, traps, magic-in each playthrough.  The tight time and resource management in some missions and the overall arc heightened the sense of excitement and urgency and the need to engineer a perfect defensive strategy.  I preordered it for $13.49 years ago and still believe it would be worthwhile at even twice the price.  It is just that fun and unique.  The only real criticism I have is that the game is not well optimized and is slow to load initially, but I think it is a triumph when considering the time and resources available to such a small team.I very much hope more attention and sales give the developers the wherewithal to forge ahead and make the sequel this game so richly deserves.

Took me 20 hours to complete the achievement and i'd say it was fun. I certainly hope they make a 2nd part of this and consider making it a multiplayer. also kinda similar to Orcs Must Die! but much more difficult.

												I expected to like Sang-Froid more than I did. It's stylish and the music is great and I enjoyed the low-tech theme and Quebecois flavor. And I can overlook the bad voice acting. The visauls were good enough; strategy games are rarely about animations and cutscenes anyway. But every strategy game lives and dies by its gameplay, and I this is where I really felt let down by Sang-Froid. Combat felt repetitious, and I found it frustrating that traps didn't always catch critters when their paths went directly over the traps. It felt less like strategy and more like fighting a finnicky game by playing the encounters over and over with minor adjustments.Most frustrating, though, was the amount if time it took between scenarios. There's so much story and not enough gameplay. and the gameplay didn't really live up to the wait, for me.Still though, Sang-Froid is stylish in spades! I wish more games took thematic chances like this, and it's a worthy entry in a busy Indie scene.Did I enjoy Sang Froid enough to finish it? No. Do I think that you should try it and decide for yourself? Yes!I'm looking forward to future entries from Artifice Studio.			"

												I am absolutely amazed by the love of detail in this game. The music, the entire artwork with the interfaces and such, it is just incredible. Also the story is well written and the skill tree gives room for different playstyles. Sure, the graphics could be better and combat could feel a little more smooth, but it is not supposed to be a DmC or anything like that. It is a rather strategic game, that favors resource management even in combat. Another thing I want to point out is the amount of time they put into explaining everything with ingame tutorial videos, you will never feel like you missed something. This game is highly recommended to anyone that wants something out of the box, I love it!			"

												Brilliant concept, I enjoy how this game addresses how one could face off against multiple opponents through the use of intimidation. However, I do not recommend you get this game because the execution of this one great idea is poor and is not focused upon. Most of the time you will be running between control points babysitting them.Really wanted more from this gameplay, very sad. Oh and the rest of the game (cinematics, RPG elements) is laughable. To the creators I'd say fantastic job on trying to do something new, I never found a bug or a readily abusable exploit. A game I would love is in here but too much running from point A to point B to guard buildings made of wet tissue paper.			"

												Sang-froid is a great game, in concept! The translation of the idea into a videogame is also done well, mechanics-wise. The big problem, for me, is how unpolished and frustrating the execution has been, especially for a 15€ game.The game feels dated in almost every respect. Graphics, story-telling, how the combat and guns work, transitions, item system, etc. etc. Everything is very imperfect and takes way more time than it should.I don't want to make a full blown review, so I'll try to very briefly state the most glaring problems.I've played the game twice. Once on Easy Mode, once on Hard Mode. Easy Mode was very uninteresting. Combat over strategy. Hard Mode was infuriating, since, while strategy was the focus, the combat was still very much required to a great degree, while your character was clearly very underpowered. As a result, almost every mission required multiple tries, even after I had the strategy laid and should have worked. I completely ignored the story and all of the other aspects aside from mechanics in the second playthrough.Why? Because it's terrible. Honestly. The story is fairly cool, especially since I do like fairy-tale and folk stories, in general. The problem is how the story is delivered. It's... mind boggling to me. The story is told exclusively through ""cutscenes"" that are merely characters talking to one another. Nothing fancy. The problems are: the writing isn't good, coupled with horrible voice-acting. I don't think the actors were in the same room at all. Each line feels completely disconnected from the situation at hand, and the tone is completely off. It just doesn't deliver.Then, there's the fact that, visually, they use some pretty bad 3D models, just because. The animations aren't all that great either. Nothing justifies the choice for these ""cutscenes"". A simple 2D conversation, with little animation and no voice-acting could have been much more polished without half of the work. Not to mention that this had nothing to do with the game. Yet, it's one of the main elements of the product, and it sticks out like a sore thumb.It's really, really, bad. I don't understand this choice at all. I could understand a sub-par execution, if it was a new idea, or something. This brings nothing new, nothing impressive. On the contrary, it's glaringly bad...The game itself, for those of you not aware, is like Orcs Must Die, although the tower and combat phases are completely separated. First, you place the traps you can. Then, you fight each wave successively, with combat. That's fine, although it can be kind of annoying when you don't know exactly what will come at you (they tell you which enemies and where, but there are nuances...) and you have no chance to fix mistakes without restarting.You'll get a plethora of different traps that you can later upgrade, but some of them are mostly useless or situational.Still, they fit the setting, and some combinations were fun to use.You can also buy potions and weapons in the town. Potions are useless, except from the health ones. The others are burnt money, unless you're on the last missions. Why? Because you barely get any money to upgrade. So, why waste it on consumables? You gain so little money that you'll take until the last few missions to be able to get a decent combination of weapons. Espcially on hard mode.Far too long.The upgrade system is cool, although you can completely lock yourself if you use your points in the wrong place. You can ""undo"", but only when you choose where to put them. If you ""confirm"",you're stuck with them.Ok, what's next?Graphically, it's a PS2 era game. If that. You can't see 7 meters in front of you, and I'm not sure if it's a design decision, or a performance choice. Then, the game suffers from fps problems when there are too many enemies active. And I have a 3.4Gz quad-core. There's no justification that I can think of, really.The combat is extremely clunky. That could be fine, since you're not supposed to use it a lot. Except... that you need to, since traps are very limited. So except lots of restarts. The game has a lock-on system that will often change targets when you least want to. There are some enemies that will go underground to heal when they're low on HP. So, you want to kill them asap.  The problem is: when there are several characters, the game may very well choose to target someone else. Well, crap...The gun suffers a similar problem with the auto-aim. It ""snaps"" to the closest target... sometimes. Sometimes it also seems to lag, and suddenly aims completely off, leading to a failed shot. You also take a loooong time to reload, which is cool. Bullets are also fairly expensive, so the point is to hold on to them. Which is infuriating when the game throws your aim off!Here's another thing: the game rewards you for using less traps. You can use Actions Points to cut trees, instead of placing traps. This further encourages combat, rather than strategy. Encourages the clunkiest system... And unbalances the game has a result, a bit. On Hard Mode, where you want to maximize traps, you end up getting way less money, making it even harder to upgrade, thus making the future missions even harder.There's a bit of a snowball effect, here... and not a good one.Then, there are various other problems. The interface is big and full of boxes, and still manages to miss several very important aspects... You take far too long to navigate from the stores to the village and your home. It's the clicking, but there are way too many. There's also a lot of information missing, leading to even more time wasted...There's no plain restart button that starts you exactly at the level you were in. You always have to go to the strategy screen, and then click like 3 or 4 times to confirm textboxes before you go into the level. It doesn't help that there's always a load screen between transitions. So, except 2 loading screens every time you make a mistake and want to restart. Or simply die...I realize this review is a bit toxic. I apologize for that. The game isn't terrible. The game itself, if I ignore everything else, can be fun and challenging, at times. The problem is that the game has way too many issues in too many different places, and it results in a very frustrating experience, overall.It tries to do a lot more than the game itself, but it doesn't know how. Seems like a lot of wasted work. I just can't understand the people claiming it to be a ""masterpiece"". In concept, it's great. Execution... not really. Orcs Must Die is a far more enjoyable game (both of them, in my opinion) and they provide more content than this, for a lower or equal price. And undoubtedly more finely tuned and polished.			"

												Now, THIS is what I call a good game!You see, a big part of a game can be decided by it's first impression. Some games do it wrong and plaster your face with 3rd party launchers past Steam and a ton of logos.When I started Sang-Froid, I was instantly welcomed with a plain loading screen accompanied by the single best intro theme I've heard in months, if not years. Not kidding, I was actually disappointed when the game finished loading and the song got cut off, so much I actually went and found myself the full into song online.However, after the intro song + narration I was sure I had a neat game at my hands and I wasn't disappointed: Whilst the graphic and animations certainly aren't worthy of an AAA title (and there are a couple animation errors all across the game), they provide exactly the charme the intro already emitted. Overall, a really nice part of the game is it's atmosphere: You indeed feel like playing in the later colonial era, a time filled with issues of belief, mystic and tales. Except for the horrible facial models, everything the game shows and tells you feels really authentic.Of course we are here to play a game though, not check on a visua novel, so how's the gameplay?Intriguing, to say the least. The early days start out really simple. Go there, shoot that wolf, axe those other wolves some questions. Quickly you learn that any enemy group with more then two enemies means certain death if you don't fight with a brain (and an eye on your stamina gauge).But as the day progresses, so does your equipment, your character and, of course, the enemies, both in quality and number.On daytime, you get the next bit of the story and place traps and other devices. As soon as the sun falls, you run around, trigger the traps and defend up to 5 locations at once. Impossible you say? A nice challenge, I say, given the game has a really fair difficulty curve (and an additional 'difficulty setting' in form of two character, with one being clearly weaker then the other and advertised as 'hard mode').Overall, Sang-Froid is exactly the kind of great game I would wish every indie title would be.Though, there IS a little catch: The game has no replayability value. At best, you will go and play it twice, assuming you started with the easier character (I didn't, and are welcoming the difficulty. Albeit this cuts my potential playtime in half.) I'm currently 2/3rds through the game in mere 4 hours.This feels a tad short, especially if you got to consider the base 15€ price. I personally purchased it in the 90% off deal and therefore are HIGHLY pleased with the price-playtime ration.Judgement: 9/10 (Can't give it a 10, even though not gamebreaking, those animation glitches ARE annoying at times)Must-buy if on sale and on 5€ or less.

												A mythic tale of a frontier town, a farmstead, two brothers and a cursed sister, a priest, the devil and a horde of ferocious werewolves. Hell, that's a premise I wanted a piece of!Alas, Sang-Froid is a good idea that lacks in execution in just about every way. The story is nicely thought out, but let down by crude visuals and all-around shoddy voice acting. The gameplay, which promises setting traps and fighting werewolves quickly shows it's true colours, revealing a simple yet quite unfair hack'n'slasher with fickle trap-setting underneath. The combat is hard, but for all the wrong reasons: your attacks do little damage unless boosted with some booze, your gun is next to useless against most enemies, the traps only affect some enemies and not all of them and while you wail away at an enemy that hides and regenerates health faster than you can kill it, another group of enemies has burned down a critical building on the other side of the map, causing you to have to restart the night!I wanted to like Sang-Froid, but I just couldn't. It's a small-budget project trying to be a big-budget project, and the shortcomings bring it down like a house of cards.

												This game has a great premise and some great music. The old French Canadian life on the frontier with appropriately cultural music is a very original idea.Unfortunately, the gameplay is extremely clunky and clearly programmed by amateur developers. The melee combat lacks proper animation, and there is nearly no satisfaction in making contact with enemies using your axe. The anmation suffers from that feeling where your animations are simply ""played"" when you perform a move, and don't feel connected to the game world at all.It's a shame that the game plays so poorly, as I was not inclined to explore it very far at all.

												Enjoyable gameplay with good atmosphere. I enjoyed the trap laying and excecution aspects of the game. I do not recommend this game, though. The reason being that it contains some of the worst writing and the very worst voice acting I have ever witnessed anywhere. Storyline could be passable were it not for the instantly despisable characters and their pathetic attempts at emotion. Perhaps if you can ignore such aspects, you might enoy this game but if the story and its pieces mean anything to you, avoid it.			"

												It was hard not recommending this game. It has a lot going for it, including originality. Ultimately I felt it misleads by presenting itself as a FPS tower defense hybrid. It doesn't feel like either to me. The traps are nothing like towers (or some games substitute creatures, soldiers or heroes for towers.) The first person fighting using muskets that take FOREVER to reload.Unlike others, I enjoyed the voice acting, and the corny story.I think many will enjoy this game. I did not.			"

												For some reason I'd been sold this as an ""action rpg"" which it kind of is but it has more in common with the ""action tower defence"" genre, with a trap planting section and a shooting section. This would make for an interesting combination, however sadly the likes of Sanctum and Orcs must die already exist and they're much better.This is a ""soft"" non-recommendation as it's not terrible, just not as good as similarly designed games.

												This game is a real gem! It's a clever, intruiging action strategy title with a great atmosphere. It's hard to describe the game without going too much into specifics ... it's a bit in the vein of Orcs must Die, combined with some Hack'n'Slay and RPG elements. It has tactical planning and ""Tower Defense"" parts in it as well as challenging combat sequences. Sang-Froid is a real interesting game that stands out of the crowd by combining it's great gameplay elements with a very good, intruiging atmosphere. And it's a hard and challenging but very rewarding experience! The voice acting is not top-of-the-notch and some may not like the story but when it comes to the pure gaming experience, Sang-Froid is among the best games of this year! Must Buy!			"

												This is a very original mashup of several different genres - a tower defender, an rpg and a TPP masher to name a few. If I had to name one game that is similiar to this one it would probably be Orcs Must Die!, but it is still very very different. Sang-Froid's setting is enough to make it stand out from the rest. The story being told takes us back to the times where the northern american settlers lived aside native indians. The player plunges into the role of one of the two O'Carroll brothers, forced to fight for the life of their ill sister and their own as well. Game consists of two distinct parts - the 'tactical' phase, taking place at dawn and the 'action' phase where our tactical plan is being put to test. Would you expect Orcs Must Die ! clone, you'd be up for a big suprise, a selection of deadly machines that chew, chop and incinerate mindless hordes of enemies is replaced by simplistic traps, overhang nets filled with stones and baits that only slow down your enemies. Most of the traps are disposed after being used and aside from a handful barely useful tools, they require to be set off manually with a painfully slow reloading rifle.Well, the game is difficult. An easy setting (represented by Joe, the burly O'Caroll brother) turns out to be nowhere near easy. On the other hand failure comes free-of-charge and you can repeat and rethink your tactics infinitely, as long as you're not satisfied with the success. There's nothing cheap about the challenge, not Borderlands 2 half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥design or numbers ridicule. It takes a bit of thought to survive each night, but it's both satisfying and rewarding once you make it.Obviously the game is not perfect. A little rough round the edges, some animations could be a tad more refined and so on - but that's nothing you wouldn't expect from an indie game coming from a very small studio. My biggest gripe is the awful voice acting which does nothing but hinders the story told. I'd glad with no va at all, in favour of the subtitles, unfortunately the option isn't there. On the other hand the folkish score is loveable and really adds to an already great package.Bottom line: buy it, these guys deserve your support. It's definitely worth it's current price-tag and getting it on sale is a no-brainer.			"

												Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves combines tower defense with wilderness survival horror and a little resource management/trade, and achieves this hefty little combo with style and panache.  There are some truly original mechanics in the game, such as the ""fear factor"" that pits your own character's fear (or bravado) against that of the blood-hungry beasts of the night - when the werewolves pluck up enough courage, they will attack; this passing of time is represented by a meter on the HUD.  This mechanic can create some really tense moments as you frantically struggle to reload your flintlock rifle, or try to get away to a well booby-trapped spot on the farm before the hairy hordes close in for the kill.  From historically accurate weapons and equipment to an easy to access resource management element, there is plenty to keep the player engrossed in many hours of werewolf bashing.

The player plunges into the role of one of the two O'Carroll brothers, forced to fight for the life of their ill sister and their own as well. Game consists of two distinct parts - the 'tactical' phase, taking place at dawn and the 'action' phase where our tactical plan is being put to test. Would you expect Orcs Must Die ! clone, you'd be up for a big suprise, a selection of deadly machines that chew, chop and incinerate mindless hordes of enemies is replaced by simplistic traps, overhang nets filled with stones and baits that only slow down your enemies. Most of the traps are disposed after being used and aside from a handful barely useful tools, they require to be set off manually with a painfully slow reloading rifle.Well, the game is difficult. An easy setting (represented by Joe, the burly O'Caroll brother) turns out to be nowhere near easy. On the other hand failure comes free-of-charge and you can repeat and rethink your tactics infinitely, as long as you're not satisfied with the success. There's nothing cheap about the challenge, not Borderlands 2 half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥design or numbers ridicule. It takes a bit of thought to survive each night, but it's both satisfying and rewarding once you make it.Obviously the game is not perfect. A little rough round the edges, some animations could be a tad more refined and so on - but that's nothing you wouldn't expect from an indie game coming from a very small studio. My biggest gripe is the awful voice acting which does nothing but hinders the story told. I'd glad with no va at all, in favour of the subtitles, unfortunately the option isn't there. On the other hand the folkish score is loveable and really adds to an already great package.Bottom line: buy it, these guys deserve your support. It's definitely worth it's current price-tag and getting it on sale is a no-brainer.			"

												This game is a real gem! It's a clever, intruiging action strategy title with a great atmosphere. It's hard to describe the game without going too much into specifics ... it's a bit in the vein of Orcs must Die, combined with some Hack'n'Slay and RPG elements. It has tactical planning and ""Tower Defense"" parts in it as well as challenging combat sequences. Sang-Froid is a real interesting game that stands out of the crowd by combining it's great gameplay elements with a very good, intruiging atmosphere. And it's a hard and challenging but very rewarding experience! The voice acting is not top-of-the-notch and some may not like the story but when it comes to the pure gaming experience, Sang-Froid is among the best games of this year! Must Buy!			"

												Reading negative reviews,people seem to be comparing it with Orcs must Die and and condemning the lack of freedom. But that's exactly what appealed to me! Mind you ,i played with Jack on the first run(basically,hardest mode),and finding that perfect combination of traps,your combat presence,and sequence in which you deal with multiple waves was the best feeling(loved the zipline towers,allowed for more challenging maps).The ""fear"" mechanic brings much needed order and planning into combat,minimizing risk of botching a good run if you prepared beforehand.Don't forget that Orc Mus Die also have its ""perfect builds"",which you tend to fall back into and raise the tedium aspect.Overall, i recommend this for ""perfectionist"" type of players,who love tower defense genre,but just about ready to play more experimental mix. Don't worry, combat here is  more tactical then it tends to be in these types of games(Sanctum,OMD).PS:You mind need to work a bit on your aim though,reload times are crippling early on.			"

												Ultimately this game was well thought, and put together. Although if they had just put some extra time to fix the minor things could have been much better. When I first start the game, it takes about 1-2 minutes to get past the load screen when I have 200 fps. Now, I'd be more okay with sitting in a load screen for 1-2 minutes if there was actually something going on, or had better music. It plays the same sound track that is about 20-30 seconds long on loop till you get past the load screen. Then you jump straight into a cut scene that doesn't make much sense till you play the more of the game. Although if you don't take the time to play the game you won't find out why they threw a random cut scene in your face. Warning, when werewolves come they're loud as all hell can get. I have my setting on low for sound effects and music and my computer volume at 5 and it sounds as if there was a actual wolf howling in my ear. That♥♥♥♥♥♥is loud. You get about 2 charaters that you can pick from, either are large burly man or a smaller man. They show a girl, that at first I thought you could play, but when I hovered over her, I couldn't. Now, I haven't played very much of the game, so maybe later in the game you can play the charater later on. Cut scenes from what I have seen I am not pleased with. I hear 2 different pitches from just being in a regular game, to a cut scene the voice can have a different pitch or almost sound completely different. From seeing the first cut scene within the first few seconds I expected lips to move at least. If you look close enough, sure you can see 100 pixels move, but it doesn't look like a lip is actually move, but just glitching. They show other larger things moving in the cut scene, but what I couldn't understand is not a simple lip movement? There was a very small story from what I was getting at. The usual werewolves are destroying farms etc. So, I would strongly reccomend against buying this game for the story line, because it's mainly a tower defense game.  The actual gameplay it's self is very well put together. Will I be playing more of this game, probably. The way they did the traps, was some what acurate, but well thought for the game, so that wolves don't just go ""HAH ♥♥♥♥ YOUR TRAP"". They also didn't make the traps insanly over powered. Now, there are different leveled wolves which makes the game more interesting and makes you think more about how to place things, because if you place things in then wrong spot you can lose the night. The game is pretty much a 3rd Person, Strategy, Tower Defense game. I would reccomend the game to those who enjoy games that you need to think, and just run around in cirlces in. Like I said the game was well put together, and unique for how they did this.			"

												Amazing.Love the different aspects of theis game, the developers realy make you think about how you are going to plan the traps for the night to give you an edge over the monsters.And i love the fact that they make you pay dearly if you have misplaced a trap or a bait and you will have to mak do with your axe.Also making the main character waeker than the enimies is a great idea it realy makes you think that if you have to use hand to hand combat (or in this instance, axe to claw) you have to use every thing you can to get an advantag, from using your musket, making an attmept with your axe, or even luring your enemies to a trap that hasent been used. Also I love that you realy have to use anything to put distance between an army of werewolves and yourself and bonfires are the best to do so, because if you think that if just yur axe will get you through the night your are wrong.And having the buildins to protect is a great idea it makes the night less about making sure that the character lives and more about making sure the builds survive.All in all ""Sang Froid Tales Of Werewolves"" one of the best stratagies/action games I have ever played.Hope they release a sequal, remeber this is tome 1.

												I am so pleased that I got this game greenlit, it's a amazing game. You play as one of the O'caroll brothers who ends up defending their sister from werewolves. In this game, the story of these werewolves and wolves is that they are under the control of the devil. Werewolves are created from souls of sinners that are expelled as they sleep and then merge into a wolf, creating the humanoid wolves you fight, but there are a range of other creatures to fight which have their own weaknesses and strengths in reguards to how traps effect them, in lures work and what might do more damage.The story is very good and the switching between axes (holy for one type, silver for others) and preparing traps makes the stategy all the more interesting. There are also three types of bullets. normal, holy and silver which have their uses, however the rifles they use are old fashioned musket rifles so you will need to make sure that one shot counts and kills whatever you are shooting at. The only things that let it down is it suffers from Brutal Legend's idea of replaying missions where if you do it, you erase all data of the missions you completed after that and so you can potentially farm xp or cash to help you in the final battle or just to improve yourself in the events, however unlike Brutal Legend you are given a clear warning before doing this. Buy this as soon as possible, I highly recommend it!			"

Also, love the ♥♥♥♥ing music.I will update once I have put more time into this game.Update 1: Still loving the music. I really like the strategy/tower defense element of the game. You have to really plan your attacks. Otherwise everything will go to hell. The 3rd person control is a little janky, but it does the job. I also really like the little bit of story telling. It is comic book-esque.			"

Amidst the trash that has come from Greenlight recently, this game stands out as a beacon of the potential that the system had to offer before it was squandered.A game about defending a cabin from an onslaught of werewolves...enough said. Not worth $14.99, but if you can get it on sale, then do so.			"

												This game was one of the first games I saw on greenlight. The premise looked interesting, but I wasn't sure how well it would work. After playing the game though, I cannot recommend the game enough. Having to tactically place and manage traps was surprisingly engaging. Fine tuning a trap layout after a failed night was rewarding. The melee combat isn't perfect, and it was designed to be that way. Enemies are threatening in combat, which means you have to balance your stamina, your attacks, and your fear level. It all boils down to an absolute gem, with an charming aesthetic, and an absolutely lovely soundtrack.			"

												This game is similar to a tower defense-style game such as Sanctum, where you place towers but are also controlling your character in third person from the battlefield. You don't actually place towers though, you place traps in an attempt to stop werewolves and other creatures of the night. Every day begins with you setting up your traps in a bird's eye view style. This leads to an interesting metagame where some traps cost AP (action points), but also money. It becomes difficult to balance setting up enough traps to win, while saving enough money and AP(which can be converted to money) to get better gear so later levels are easier. It's really fun trying to find the most cost-effective way in which to win a night. Also, your character fights with an axe and a musket.			"

												This is a really interesting game. As an action tower defense game you can't avoid comparing Sang-Froid to Orcs Must Die. However, these games are very different in gameplay and layout. In Sang-Froid you prepare all your traps before starting the level in contrast to OMD where you start the level and then place traps. In that manner Sang-Froid is a little more slow paced and not quite hectic as OMD, but enough with the comparison. Let's focus on Sang-Froid alone.The story isn't the strongest side of Sang-Froid and the same could be said about the voice acting and cut-scenes. On the contrary the music is really great and it's a perfect fit for the game. The surroundings and the environment also suits this game nicely. I really like the cold, snowy lumberjack theme. The game evolves around one single map which you play every mission. It could let you to believe it would get boring quickly, but the map changes enough along with the objectives that it doesn't feel boring. The traps offer a good variety of different killing possibilities. You can upgrade weapons and traps for the fur you sell after killing wolves or werewolves. You could also buy potions and other useful item between each level.What I would like to have seen is that when you play the game the second time with the other brother you know all traps, how the map works etc. but you have to listen to how to use the traps again. It would have been nice to have these things unlocked after you beat the game once. Also, a co-op mode would have been a nice feature. Perhaps in a sequel? Or as the story in this game turn out, a prequel would be more fitting...All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it was well worth the money.			"

That is because, like there, you deal with enemies posing real threat by preparing in advance. Each enemy has it's own quirks, strenghts, and weaknesses, and while they are not as tough as the videos make them look, they do pose enought threat to make you want to adapt to those strengths and weaknesses.What makes the game hardly replayable is the fact that it's a lot more learning curve dependant than an average game. So for example, you'll get your fun from figureing out the way to get 5 enemies with one spike trap, but once you know how it's done there's nothing notably satisfying about that any more.The story and visual style also remind me of the original witcher somewhat. That is because, like there, they are not ""hollywoodish"", which is a compliment in itself, if you ask me. Noting else good to say about them though - the game is visually poor and pale. And the story is bad in more ways than one... Rarely have I seen a story that's both religious enough to irritate atheists, occult/blasphemous enough to irritate monotheists, plain enough to bore the fans of the mystic themes, and bland enough not to impress a casual reader. I seriously can't imagine what they were thinking while making a game with that story...That said, the games are meant to be played, not read or watched or heard (btw, the soundtrack here is great, if you ask me), and this game is worth playing.

												In my opinion it is a gem in the sewers of clones stininking up the market. A granted the cutsences are about as entertaining as a puppet show. But you once you look past that it is a rock solid tower defence. It can get edgy when you know one missed shot on a rockfall could mean the diffrence between wolf kababs and getting mauled to the respawn. I played the less durable of the two brothers for a hardy game experince and don't regret it.Pro: Truely unique tower defence. Nothing feels more fufilling then having everything go as planed. Or on edge when things fall apart. In relaton to lining up the crosshairs and clicking M1 on a generic FPS with helth reguvination.Pro: Uniqe game mechanics. Not wanting to spoil to much, but lets just say I wish I could wash the wolf blood off when the wind picks up.Pro: Imersive as I said nothing is more on edge when a single shot gone wrong or a trap not going as planed ruin the plan set. Or hacking your way out of a 6 wearwolf choir when you realize you forgot the bait.Pro: Beautyful music and great audio quality.Con: Puppeter cuttsences. And bland perdictable dialog. Could be improved using accents or slang from the era.Con: Combat can get sticky even with full fatige. Hitboxes can get hit and miss. Comparing the hitbox registration to TF2 or Day of DoD. though it is slightly better.Con: Not much replay value its just the story line. No sandbox, endurence, multiplayer, or much customization. Granted the game is emersive I just don't have the urge to play it again. Still I got 10-12 hours out of the game. So did I have as much fun as going to the movie theator or more fun then the amout of ice cream sandwiches? That awnser is yes.			"

												Although the animation is quite simple and cartoony, do not let that put you off; it is actually quite fun to play. The strategy involved, the increase in difficulty on the challenges to survive each night, with a plot to push the story along was quite captivating. Also I could never say no to a game with a little bit of fantasty creatures like werewolves in it. 10/10 for me.			"

												Sweet merciful heavens is this game weird.  And I love it.  Sang Froid is a strange beast.  I know it won't be for everyone, but for me, it was pure bliss.  The story is actually fairly unique, taking a different spin on the werewolf lore than the usual and throwing in some native american lore for good measure.  While it is a bit campy, it's fun and one of the most Canadian games in existence.  It has great flavor and atmosphere.But how is the combat?  In a word, clunky.  The game mixes setting traps, some automatic and some you have to trigger, alongside fighting in third person.  The traps are very cool, but the fighting itself is a bit awkward to get around, whether it's swinging your axe or aiming your gun.  However, if you can get past that, it is a ton of fun.  There are some ingenious mechanics, such as having to take into account how your scent is carried on the wind, the long load times of a musket rifle, and how afraid your enemies are of you.  This, combined with setting traps and planning your battles in the day, and actually fighting at night, makes for an addictive experience.Comes highly recommended.  I played through both campaigns and loved each of them.			"

												A very entertaininging low-budget game.Providing an original and exciting setting, and a story which isnt over-done. Your main task is setting up traps and protect your family lot in Canada from attacking wolves and worse.The game progreses in levels with bits of story between and the possibilty to visit town for supplies or perhaps a new weapon, and then more traps must be set before the dark..The music of this game is folk music from Canada and so fantastic! It takes you straight into the atmosphere of the game and the place. Example:

												I was excited from the first time i saw the info on this game. ""Tower defense? Third Person Brawling? Beards? Werewolves? This is going to be awesome!""I'm the kind of person who WANTS to like every game he plays. Heck, I even made myself like Two Worlds for the xbox 360...This game was a heartbreaker, though. Yeah, it had good music and nifty art, but the positivity stops there.There were more glitches in the first 20 minutes of play than you could find in any other 3 alpha-stage games combined. The combat system fell so far bad, it actually took away from the game. I play PC games quite often, even some twitch-shooters, and I have never seen lag like this. It takes roughly 2-4 seconds for any single command I make to be enacted in game.I thoroughly hope the developers will spend a little more time fixing this one. Maybe they can polish this up and turn it into an enjoyable gaming experience and have it back in our hands. Until then, I consider this game a full waste of my funds, and will not even attempt to open the file again.			"

												The basic gameplay is pretty good but the pacing is terrible. I doubt the developers played through their own tutorial. You get a short video when a decent item description would have done the job. Rather than encouraging players to explore, the game assumes the player is a moron and tells you exactly what to do, step by step for the first 3 levels. That is in addition to the pop-up tutorials every 20 feet. If you think the gamers will be too stupid to figure out your game, maybe the solution is to make the mechanic more intuitive, not have 2 dozen videos explaining various concepts peppered in waypoints.The game does get more challenging and fun later on but the interface remains clunky. The game is plagued with interface issues: you can undo traps but not work, the hud favors artistic flare to actually providing information (health bar most guilty), you have to navigate through a half dozen buildings in town for upgrades and items, even though it could have easily all been fit into a single interface.The game lauds it's exciting and epic story. Yet aside from an awesome opening cinematic, the game chooses to tell the story in laughable animations. They are poorly dialogued, occur much too frequently and worse, doesn't inform or drive gameplay at all. They break up the pacing of the game and most of the characters are one dimensional. Instead of a handful (yes more than 1) of animations every level, a cinematic every 5 would have been amazing.I bought Sangfroid expecting an exciting indie game with fresh gameplay. The gameplay mechanics are pretty interesting, maybe even enough so to be called unique and exciting. But the rest of the game feels just like the bloated mess out of major studios. If this is an indie game, it most certainly doesn't feel like one. Gameplay was the coin spent to purchase all the frills in the game.			"

The graphis are amatoresque, the voice acting is below average, to say the least, the gameplay is clunky, the whole atmosphere gets to be dishearteningly mediocre and bleak.

												Not a particularly good game...  The gameplay consists of the player fending off several waves of werewolves and other creatures sent each level.  Most of the strategy in the game involves preparing traps and other items to assist the player before each ""night"".  To help with this the number, location, and targets of each enemy and when they appear are given before each level.  If all else fails the player can try to kill anyenemy directly with an axe or rifle.  The ability to prepare the field before each level makes the game interesting, especially as most traps and items are readily avialable for the player and there's a wide variety to choose from.  Unfortunately, most traps are difficult to use as they require careful enemy positioning that quickly becomes problematic to impossible as the number and variety of enemies increase in each level.  As enemies are relatively easy to kill in melee combat, as your character is somehow able to dodge like Kratos and can easily stun lock most enemies, I gave up on using traps altogether, in some levels, and just ran around beating everything into submission.  Oh there is a story, but it's not worth talking about.  Nonsensical plot with bad voice acting throughout.   Pro's:- Wide variety of traps and enough info provided to adequately plan against enemy attacks- Upgrade system- Fluid combat systemCon's:- Voice acting- Storyline makes less sense the more you think about it- Repititve level design- Traps poorly balanced (some way overpowered, while others are Ineffective or overly difficult to activate)- Too easy to kill most enemies in melee combatOverall I'd give this game a 6/10.  Best to save your money for something better.			"

												Let me start this off by saying that I REALLY wanted to enjoy this game; Sang Froid features an original and interesting idea, but is marred by plain out lazy execution.The first serious problem you will encounter in this game is the terrible pacing. It starts you off in a child-like hand holding tutorial which you must suffer through. The tutorial is explained by an older gentleman in segmented videos. This format leaves absolutely no room for learning or experimentation. The hand holding doesn't stop with the tutorial vidoes either; through out the game you are constantly bombarded by annoying pop ups containing tips.Another problem, although small, and perhaps unimportant to some, is the poor voice acting, which is painfully apparent. This is honestly some of the worst voice acting I've ever encountered. The acting and dialogue feels incredibly forced and not fluid at all. This lack of fluidity also applies to the cutscenes and animations. The combination of all this makes it impossible for me to be invested in the story.I was expecting the saving grace for this game to be the combat, unforunately, the combat is actually shallow and uneventful. With the assisted aiming and large packs of enemies, fighting foes turns into a mouse clicking fest in which you will find yourself monotonously smashing the attack button. There is a ""fear"" mechanic which is meant to play in with the stamina feature. Enemies have a ""fear"" meter that slowly builds. Upon reaching a certain point of fear, the animal will then attack. In the time spent waiting for an animal's fear to rise to an attacking point, you'll have time to reload your rifle and let your stamina regenerate. So by the time the enemy comes to attack, you're already fully loaded and prepared, which really dictates the pace of fighting into an almost turn based setting. I have no qualms with the day time planning strategizing portion of the combat.When you combine all these problems with the unintersting and sporadic story, you feel left with a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game with poor atmosphere.Ultimately, I can only reccomend this game to children, or perhaps even first time gamers who need generous doses of help and guiding.

												I'm not trying to bash indie games. I am very glad independent companies are able to create and publish their work and i will support all the ones that are worth it. This one is not.The 3D art is ok. The 2D art - dear god, I can draw better and I don't even have an art degree.The voice acting - *sigh* i feel bad for complaining, i know not everyone has the budget for real actors, but you know how other developers get away with this? By not having voiced dialog. I would rather have to read than listen to what sounds like an awkward highschool kid trying to act and miserably failing.Game mechanics - there are some interesting ideas i guess. But it was so limited - the skills, the traps, everything felt not polished enough, not evolved enough. This is a game that could use a big name company makeover, because without it - it's just a sophomore-year video-game class project.The game was pretty challenging at times too, but overall it just felt like a chore trying to finish it.

												I could talk about how the mandatory auto-aim often picks targets that aren't what you're pointing your musket at. I could talk about how the traps in this trap-based tower defense style game often have iffy collision detection. I could even talk about how the game has awful framerate and lag issues despite not looking very good at all, making anything that requires even the slightest bit of precision feel entirely luck-based.But I suspect that you have better things to do with your time than to read the rants of a complete stranger on the internet, let alone playing a game that despite a unique premise and a refreshingly ""Canadian"" theme manages to be an nearly unplayable mess.

												This is a 3rd person tower defense game, defense, with being able to walk around at the same time, sort of like Dungeon Defenders, without the multi player and with less armor to use.  The leveling system seemed pretty advanced, and the gameplay and characters were comically stupid.  While the mecanics worked fairly well, the game really seemed to lack story, or  a drive to continue playing.  The game was ok... While I can not recommend this game simply because I'm not a fan of tower defense, but what I can say is, for those that enjoy this type of gameplay and gamestyle, it is definatly worth checking out.

												Not as much fun as I thought it could be.Before the game actually starts, you get the chance to buy items or build traps on the map. When the night starts you try to lure enemies into the traps or you kill them yourself.The core idea of this game is promising, but controls are not very smooth and the number of traps or options is pretty limited which makes the game repetive and easy. You may kill the enemies with traps, but in the end it all boils down to you slashing them with your axe or shooting them with your rifle (and all of that with clunky controls). So there is not much strategy involved.Usually, that alone would not be enough for me writing a negative review, because it all depends on your taste. The main reason why I would not recommend this game is the loading screen bug.When you start the game you may be caught in a endless loading screen. Finally, when you manage to get to the main screen, you may not get any Steam achievements later, if you Alt + Tab during the loading screen before. This is kinda bothersome, especially if the loading takes considerably longer than most games. So if you want to get achievements, you are forced to watch LOADING...			"

												Sang-Froid, is a strange game. It is a mix of tower / trap defence that is very similar to orcs must die! However, this is a poor copy of the latter. It is clunky and buggy with very little room for personal choice. While the game gives you options in terms of traps, it does not in the way you use them if you wish to win. Some good features are the story, the music and the art style which is quite quirky and fun. The bad is that there is little to no freedom for the player and the game is quite buggy.In this case I would not recomend the game unless it is on sale and you have a lot of patience.Ticklepants			"

												A first person tower defense game like sanctum or orcs must die.  The setting and idea is awesome but it's a pretty amateurish effort, the metacritic score is incredibly generous.  The movement and combat are clunky, you move, swing, & turn like a slug.  The interface has way too much going on with all kinds of silly little extra mechanics to pile onto the basic uncompelling gameplay.  Animations are stiff and jerky, sounds are generic and repetitive. The voice acting is so unprofessional it sounds like the devs got a bunch of their friends together some weekend in a studio to read some lines they were just handed. "

												So, this is a game that seriously confused me. When I first saw it, I wasn't sure if it was an action-style RPG, or what it was, but when I actually PLAYED it, the horrible truth dawned on me... it's a focking tower defence game! Now, I'm no stranger to the TD-genre, both the armchair general type where you just place towers/turrets/whatever down on a map to stop/kill the incoming enemies (Defence Grid or Plants VS Zombies), and the ""up close and personal"" kind where you actually get to do some runnin' 'n' gunnin' yourself (Orcs Must Die! and Sanctum), but Sang-Froid isn't really either. Taking enemies on in a head-to-head fight is to say the bloody least STU-PID unless they're just basic wolves and you're playing as Jos, AND WHY WOULDN'T YOU, SINCE HE'S APPARENTLY BETTER THAN WEAK-MODE JAQ IN EVERY SINGLE WAY!!! Anyway, where was I... oh, yeah. Sang-Froid's gameplay. It's an interesting enough concept, but the execution is like a wobbly, woinky... something. Basically, it's flawed as all FOCK! The music isn't BAD, but it's nowhere near GOOD either, and the cutscenes honestly look like they were made with cardboard cut-outs of the various characters, i.e. they're basically shïte. So, it all boils down to the final number. The show-ender. The, uh... yeah, whatever. I'm out of analogies. Here's the score. 4.7/10			"

												This game is mildly amusing. Story and voice acting are atrocious. The ""Irish"" sister is voiced by a Latina woman who mispronounced a few pretty basic words right off the bat. Items in the loading menu are mispelled and the text communication is grammatically incorrect and hard to understand at times. Animation is very plain looks and feels very homemade like a flash game from newgrounds. Yes that is what this game really reminds me of... a flash game. It has bugs, and some of the game mechanics dont work as they are presented to. it would be great for free but i paid $1.50 for it and i still feel kindof ripped off.			"

												I really want to like this game as the presentation and story are really great and want to draw me in but unfortunately the poor pacing and slow trial and error gameplay really shatter my interest in this title.The UI, the way the story is told and the writing itself is very cozy. It really makes an interesting universe until you actually do start controlling your chosen character then it really goes down hill. Gameplay comes down to building defenses and then defending the buildings your supposed to. Early on this isn't so bad until you start hitting 3 or more buildings where you have to defend them all and they are all vastly far from eachother and in the event of one being destroyed you lose so you end up having to do a bit of multi tasking in order to keep everything together and this can require trial and error as you figure out what will work and what wont for each mission. The combat though is very floaty and dousn't feel very solid. If I didn't know better I would think you weren't actually supposed to go into direct combat with enemies since it feels very poor when compared to the presentation quality of the rest of the game. Its clunky and at times it can be difficult to hit enemies with your melee attack and in the process get hit yourself. Some of the aspects like fear and rage are very interesting but unfortunately managing these aspects on top of the combat on top of defending your buildings isn't really fun after a time as you battle with the clunkiness while trying to do everything before one of your buildings die. The pacing really becomes a problem at the point where the game becomes challenging as it gets so slow that the high points are not high enough to actually make it worth it.So maybe I will someday play more of Sang Froid but for now I really have no impetus to play more of it and would rather just like to see the story play out but not enough to actually beat the game.Also for as basic as the graphics are its very poorly optimized. Many basic video settings such as windowed mode are not supported either. So once you start peeling back the facade the lack of structure shows. As an analogy I think that fits this game at where I am in it.			"

												While I think the finish of the game seems rather professional, I don't really find the gameplay all that satisifying. The FPS/TPS aspect of the game doesn't really feel quite right and the strategy aspect feels a bit lame. I'd recommend against this unless you get it on sale for $2 or something really cheap, or unless you want a game that's super-Canadian. (It seems as though one of the goals was to make the game as Canadian as humanly possible. At least it's not titled ""Tales of Canadian Werewolves"" or something goofy like that.)			"

												Sang-Froid is a hybrid 3rd person action / tower defense game that excels at neither. In fact, both elements are constantly tripping the other up.Basic premise: You defend various buildings against monster (mostly wolves and werewolves during the night, and build/upgrade during the day. You kill monsters with both traps and your axe/musket.On the surface it's a great idea for a game. You're trapped in spooky isolated woods and during the day you have to spend your limited time choosing how to survive the coming sunset.Why it fails is because the 3rd person movement and controls are so sluggish, the map is far too spread out, and the majority of the traps require you to be present in order to take effect but you can't be everywhere at once.3rd person action: super clunky melee swings and musket reloading. I realize it's not going to be as fast paced and adreniline pumping as a dedicated action game, but if it's going to be THIS clunky and boring then they should have just ditched it to make this a full on tower defense strategy game. You're not shooting huge guns like Sanctum, you're dealing with clunky axe swinging. There's a system where you have to manage the wolves' fear level; keep them afraid enough so the entire pack doesn't jump you at once. This might have been interesting in a game with better combat, but it's just frustrating because you don't have time to deal with it because your other building are all the way across the map.Overly large map: The full map (once all locations open up) is larger than most DotA maps and it takes a good 2 minutes to traverse the entire thing. It's way too slow and you have to be everywhere at once. Later on you can build ziplines to travel quicker, but then you have to sit through the slow climbing animations like it's a Zelda game, plus the ziplines cannot go through trees and the whole map in one winding forest. Since it's 3rd person, you can only see what's in sight of your character and have little idea what's happening other than some icons on the map. This is a big problem because...Non-automated traps: The majority of the traps in the game require you to be present in order to work. You must shoot ropes to drop rocks on wolves. You must light bonfires. You must man turrets. The whole point of traps should be to cover areas you can't be at. If they can't do that then what's the point and why not just make it a full on action game? There are a couple traps that theoretically take care of things when you're not there, but they're unreliable. You can lay down flaming trenches that monsters can't cross, but it's very hard to tell if the trench is completely blocking off a path or if there's one tiny pixel you missed that monsters can pass through, derailing your entire plan and forcing you to start over. Likewise with lethal traps. You can place 3 lethal traps at a chokepoint and sometimes all the monsters will run into them, sometimes none. It's totally random which is the opposite of what a good tower defense game should be.The story: The devil is summoning monsters to attack you. That's the entire story, but they drag it out with non-animated, horribly acted, boring cutscene after cutscene.There was a kernal of a good game idea buried in here somewhere. If they were going to make so many traps reliant on you being present, they should have turned it into primarily an action game. If the action was going to suck so much they should have turned it into a pure strategy game. In trying to do both they compromised each other.			"

												It's aboot time I did this here review eh.Well I tried this here game a coople months ago and got pretty bored quickly I might say, its got alright gameplay but feels very gritty and old, like something from 2002 or someting'. Read this here like as if you lived in newfoundland or newbunswick b'y.I can't say I would git dis her game I tell ya, shes too bland and boring in my opinion b'y.Old gritty graphics that are outdated and not even enjoyable in that way, nothing positive about that. The gameplay is slightly boring and just bleh. You will deal with just a mess of monsters coming from every direction you can think of, up, down, left, right, rileft, up der b'y.Has a nice talent tree with good customization and plenty of traps and weapons to play with, giving you a decent toolshed of death to kill native werewolfs and the devils monsters. You can go to town and buy more bullets for your musket, dip your axe in holy water to deal extra damage, buy alcohols or clothing to help your defense and offense and use unique items to change the winds path or other fun stuff.Its simple, easy to pick up and has a decent tutorial to teach you what the hell is going on, but it just was not for me and I say look up the screenshots and maybe check out a video or two, I got it on sale for 2$ CANADIAN so I won't hurt too much up here in the north.Personal Rating: 2/5			"

The music is certainly the best part of the game.  I'll give a nod to the interesting art design as well, but the execution is pretty sub-par.The game itself is a mashup of tower defense and third person brawler/shooter, with the map you're defending expanding after each round as you unlock new tools and resources.

												Fun game! When I first saw the title I was excited, but then i saw it looked like a hard to learn Strategy game which I rarley play and have time to learn. When I saw it go on sale for 75% off, I decided to give it a try. First thoughts? LOVE IT! The creators have done a fantastic job at so many aspects of this game. 1.The music and sound design are great. 2.They mix story, strategy with some good hands on fighting and killing of wolves! 3. IN GAME VIDEO TUTORIALS that take you step by step through each aspect of how to play and what each thing does. They don't just leave you hanging, they take you thorugh several games and mission with a video showing what you need to know, how to do it, and then let you try it. These aren't just static images. These are fully voiced and animated lessons for everything you need to know! So if you are like me and have a hard time figuring all the features out, no need to worry! They teach you everything. 4 STARS! Great game.			"

												Yeah,... I gave this an honest try. Look if you want to make games, you should have animation skills. The game seems like it might be okay, but it's just not good enough to hold my interest.A shame, but it is what it is. Everything is what it is. The world is what it is. You are what you are. I am what I am. Wow, so insightful, I deserve a billion dollars. "

												Awesome game.  Unique concept. Interesting upgrades and leveling to keep you addicted.  Atmosphere is top notch.  I loved the look of the land as it evolved, just felt right.  My favorite part of the game had to be ""day time"" or ""set up time"".  I really enjoyed placing fire walls to lead the enemy onto the path I wanted them to go, hitting all the traps I intended. Just a piece of advice though, don't go spending all your money or Action Points during set up, as the best weapons will cost a lot later on, making it a good idea to budget your funds and to use the least amount of traps possible.The only real cons I see in this game are lack of co-op and little replay value once you beat it, other than trying the harder difficulty.Highly recommended and the devs are currently looking at some cool ideas for the sequel, or 2nd tome if you will.  And some of those features, like co-op, sound really great so please support this so we can play more games from these devs.  I'll be keeping my eyes on these guys, they have legitimate talent.			"

												Great atmosphere, terrible gameplay mechanics.I love the setting the game takes place in, sort of a dark fairytale world that is reminiscent of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horsemen story, only with werewolves...and the devil.Unfortunately, it has a terribly long and boring tutorial system that constantly interrupts the game to (over)explain relatively simple mechanics. (Like almost every mobile game does nowadays)  Once you get through those, you are thrust into a very hectic level without a real sense of where enemies are going to be coming from, or in what order, so you have no idea, really, where to put your traps until it actually runs through the scenario once.  I really hate trial and error gameplay, and this game is particularly unforgiving to the unprepared.  If you don't have the right traps in the right place, heaven forbid you could take on the enemies effectively with your trusty rifle.  NO, you are going to die, and then restart the level.With the awkward controls and trial and error gameplay, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												the concept was neat and interesting, and the music isnt bad, but jesus christ this is one of the worst games i've ever even ATTEMPTED to try and play, i cant even say i properly played it because you cant get past the tutorial, the game wants you to stand there, unable to move, or swing your axe, while you have to reload the rifle and use it, meanwhile a wolf is murdering you, and you flinch and have to restart every time it touches you, add in the fact that it takes an ungodly amount of time to reload and you have an unplayable game. oh and in the INCREDIBLY INSANELY RARE scenario in which you DO manage to kill the wolf, you wont be able to move afterwords either, likely because the wolf will have knocked you FAR out of goal range.

												Meh...I know I haven't played this game much, but it hasn't given me any reason to play it more.  The main frustration with this game is that it has a lot of cool and unique gameplay nuances, but unfortunately, the nuances of the gameplay can't redeem the gameplay as a whole.  I know that sounds odd but hear me out.  Imagine going to a restaurant.  They have the most amazing lemonade, but the rest of the food blows.  Does it make for a good restaurant?The combat gets old quickly and the graphics are almost hard to look at.  Not that the graphics are necessarily bad, but they are just kind of awkward, like a bad PS2 game thats trying to be somewhat realistic, but just ends up looking goofy.  The story is somewhat unique, but isn't prevalent enough to make a difference.All in all, this game is more laughable than it is an intense werewolf game.  If you want to try it, wait for it to be on sale for dirt cheap, but don't pay more than $3 for this game. "

Although it's only fair to point out that even the most gifted of actors would struggle with that terribly written dialogue. I actually stopped playing due to how much it annoyed me.So...if horrible, horrible voice acting is an issue for you, I would recommend against it. Aside from that, it's a fairly average action game with some tactical elements. (Best tactic= shoot wolves with gun until dead)			"

												A Tower Defense/Third-Person Action hybrid in the style of ""Orcs Must Die!"" based on Canadian lore. The game's structure is broken into pre-mission cutscene, pre-mission preparations, the actual defense of your structures on foot, and a post-mission cutscene, with no deviation in this structure. Of the twenty missions available, the first few are thinly veiled tutorials which quickly ramp up in difficulty once supernatural enemies are introduced. Unlike most games, the difficulty doesn't budge; for the most part it was a non-stop train ride through a frustratingly difficult game. I was finding myself quickly frustrated and had to restart missions many times because of accidentally hitting myself with a lethal trap, getting sidetracked defending one objective while another was being destroyed, or just dying from being overwhelmed by enemies I was unprepared to face at full health because they ""dodged"" a trap I set for them.While the story is good enough to push you forward and explain character actions and interactions, it really feels like it was stretched thin and simply made to build a game around. There are no sidequests, no mini-games or diversions, no non-main story character to chat with, or even any non-story or non-shops to visit while in towns. I loved the game's atmosphere and environments but much of the game feels rushed and lazy, as if the devs said ""this is good enough, ship it!"" The story also seemed to end abruptly and un-satisfyingly, as if the devs couldn't decide to lead into a sequel or not.I would love to see a sequel that wasn't such a barebones narrow corridor of gameplay. Simple touches, like actually being able to walk around in towns, would have added much to the atmosphere of the game. This could have been a cozy, atmospheric game with a unique spin on tower defense, but instead it feels like a quick in-betweener for a dev looking to make money for his next big project.			"

												Combining action and strategy in a unique way, Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves transports you into an epic folktale co-written with best-selling Canadian author Bryan Perro (Amos Daragon, Wariwulf), in which two feuding brothers will have to put aside their differences to save their sister, who is pursued by the Devil himself! This time however, sheer brute strength won't be enough to save the day as your enemies are way stronger than you are. Only your wits and the ability to combine ingenious traps to setup deadly ambushes will give you a chance to see the sun rise again on your frozen piece of forest...			"

												As an opening to my review I would like to point out that, unlike some other publishers out there, Artifice Studio respect the Steam community and it's trader users, people who invested money in getting multiple copies of the game at a certain discounted price for trading purpose (by trading games for items we often can get our hands on other games for a fraction of the price even if already heavily discounted from other steam users who have those games) and, it would seem, they respect* that we didn't spent the money simply to see the same deal occur the next year during the anual summer/winter event and that is a good thing. *Last time Sang Froids was discounted at 90% and, right now at the time of this review during the summer event of 2015, it is 80% off and the few of us who got the game at the most advantageous price can trade with more ease compared with the games that have the same discount price showing up event after event making it difficult to make even the slightest profit from these games.You're welcomed to leave comments on this review about this subject to help us build a better trading community. On with the review now...-----------------------------------------------The game itself is pretty unique as you have hack and slash battles and first person shooter elements combined with some tower defence aspects like traps and buildings that you must defend from the invaders and lots of upgradeable abilities thrown in for good measure. The music and voice acting compliment the game ambiance in all the tongues available. The story is created in part by Bryan Perro who is famous around here in Quebec. In short you shoot werewolves after luring them under and around all sorts of traps that you acquire as you progress into the game and unravel the mystery that surrounds the town of Val-des-loups (Ancient town that no longer exist here in Quebec). Lots of fun, interesting story and good music.			"

												Sang Froid: The Tale of a Double Whammy of Garbage. It is a TD/action game and both aspects are done in a way that suck balls. The melee combat just feels awkward and the TD aspect is boring and not done well compared to other games such as Dungeon Defenders.I realize this got a 79/100 metacritic average and I even read in the forums someone saying they have 321 hours in it but despite trying to force myself to like this I can't. The first hour of the game is about 30 minutes of tutorials/interruptions, 10 minutes of cutscenes, and 20 minutes of gameplay which is about 5-10 minutes on the planning screen/in town and 10-15 short minutes of actual gameplay. It feels like the whole game is about 50% TD/action and 50% adventure game and adventure games blow. Maybe as you play on and get the five thousand tutorials out of the way, there is more gameplay. The game just has such a bad indie game feel I couldn't stand it long enough to find out. HOW IN GOD'S NAME DID THIS GET A 79 META AVERAGE???The action game part, melee combat, is imo poorly done. Just feels awkward and clunky. Also, my guy can swing only a few times at a wolf before running out of stamina, like he smokes nine packs of cigarettes a day and has trouble breathing or something. I am out of shape badly and I could swing an axe at wolves for a good long while before I was out of breath. Combat just feels generically done. And mouse control does not feel right either because it A) uses mouse acceleration to spin the camera faster the quicker you move it and B) also does not have sensitivity matched up right on the axis'. X axis (left & right) is fine but Y axis (up & down) is too low and it makes a odd matchup and feels awful, and there are no options in the game to change it. When they can't even make the controls feel normal, that is bad news.The planning screen where you lay traps looks like crap, and all other menu screens have a crap look and feel about them. Where good games look smooth and crisp in their menu's, this one's presentation value is just sharp, dull, and ugly. That leads to the other part of the game, tower defense mechanics, which suck balls. After laying down traps and nets and stuff, I start and since they are coming from 3 different paths all over the map and the traps don't do anything whatsoever but slow them down slightly, it's like where the fk do I go first? So I pick a spot and go fight a werewolf. While I am doing that, the traps I put down slowed the others only barely so the houses are getting attacked now. The net traps I put down are hard to get anything to go underneath, especially when it says my shout isn't ready yet and I don't even think I used it yet. The wolves usually just walk passed my net trap so it is a waste and I just killed them with the clunky crap balls melee fighting.If you want a TD/action game that is properly reviewed as a good game, try Dungeon Defenders. If you want a TD/action game that all the reviewers played blindfolded, play this. I mean it honest to God boggles my mind as to how this game got a 79 metacritic average. The melee and TD portions of the game are both a nightmare compared to Dungeon Defenders.5/10, if that.			"

												For now is a no. It takes forever to load, packed with animations and intros that you have to deal with every single time you start the game. The game doesnt run smoothly. Combat is goofy. The tutorial is incredibly slow and exactly when you think you made your way through it and you can now start to play free with no more interruptions, they make you watch videos for new items and traps the game introduces. Yes, videos.The artwork is confusing and with no continuity (you have a certain style for the menu, another different one for the animations, another one for the loading screens....), quite upleasant, seems like three or four different artists put their hands on this, only to eventually merge everything together. The concept is nice, I like the theme that made get this, I wouldn't complain as I got it on sale but it isn't anywhere close to worth the full price.			"

I quickly uninstalled this game. It's my biggest disappointment since joining Steam.The review system would have been useful when I bought it. Yes, most of the reviews are positive, but they mention enough about the lack of polish and the ""tower defense"" feel to know this isn't for me. I expected more strategy/RPG in the mix.			"

												I really can't say much about this game. The acting is bad to the point of laughable. Think the old Resident Evil games. The story telling is very confusing, too; at least the part that I got to. It's unoptimized to the point of getting 30 fps on a decent rig (I can get 60 on TF2 at max graphics) and the controls are horrific. The button layout itself isn't the problem, it's the input delay. You press your attack button then 1.5 seconds later, it finally happens. I crashed twice: once during the initial loading screen (that went on for 4 min) and once during gameplay. You know what unplayable games always score? 0/10 It's a shame, too. This was the most impressive greenlight game I had seen at the time and I waited a long time...for this. It's laggy, it's buggy, it crashes like crazy, it's unfinished, and we'll need mods soon, so come on in, Bethesda fans!			"

												If there's a better game out there about 19th century French-Canadians fighting werewolves, I haven't found it.But seriously, this is actually pretty fun. It's a lot like Orcs Must Die in that you're setting traps to deal with waves of werewolves and other supernatural creatures. There's a fair amount of strategy involved and you sometimes have cases where it seems like the map is impossible, but there's always a solution somewhere. The writing is pretty corny, but I enjoyed this.			"

												This game out of Montreal is very fun and satisfying to play. If you can overlook the awful cinematics and lackluster story telling, the game-play is pretty good! A Chapter or ""level"" consists of 2 phases: daytime strategy planning and night time combat. During the day you can visit shops in town to buy or upgrade equipment, consumables and stat modifying accessories. As well as plan your strategy to survive the coming night by setting up various traps, zip lines and build combat influencing objects like fires or shrines. Each one consumes daylight hours and sometimes money too, so it's a balance to survive as efficiently as possible in order to further fund your plan. I recommend playing on ""hard"" though. At night, you dash around your ever expanding forest territory to defend your friends and their homes from unholy wolf creatures. Combat system is simple and imperfect but still pretty fun. Decently designed skill tree to level through as you gain experience. Also some unique mechanics like wind direction potentially ruining your plan by giving away your scent and the degree to which your enemies fear you needing to be managed.Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack, one of it's strongest features. Found myself humming all the music and listening to what I learned was Quebec style folk music that I would have otherwise described as ""Celtic.""  Certainly worth the few dollars currently being asked during the sale, 15 to 30 hrs of fun strategy & third person action despite simple graphics.			"

												Pleasantly surprised. Kill werewolves as a lumberjack in most frightening setting on earth, Canada in Winter.Picked this up in a humble bundle. Solid game that I lost a few hours into, and a very refreshing take on the action strategy genre.-You play as either a Canadian lumberjack or hermit trapper, fighting wolves and werewolves.-Canadian whisky and beer are you power ups, which is awesome.-Game mechanics are solid, and match the games theme, wind affects your scent, shooting and moving make noise, both can cause enemies to target you. -Character progression and economy are meaningfull. Seems well balanced so far.-Voice acting is a bit rough, I skipped most cutscenes, but it gets points for having a simple but charming art style in game.If you like things like orcs must die, or dungeon defenders you'll enjoy this game.

												Its a good game. If you liked orcs must die you would like this, however this is more difficult.You cant rely on traps to do everything for you & the enemies are a lot more difficult & vicious than OMD, its a challenge with a lot of unique features such as taking the wind & noise in to account when trying to trap/kill the wolves & much more... which is a good thing, your always running around & there are no breaks between waves, if you get overwhelmed you are pretty much dead there is no iWin button.Its a cool little game & its the first one these developers have made so goodjob so far, i recommend it for all tower defence enthusiasts, its a shame there is no co-op because it would be perfect for this game as there is only two characters to choose from but i can see why they chose not too, the game might be too easy with two people playing... but then again they could have just ramped up the difficulty... who knows, maybe in their next game.

												Canada, eh? But seriously, consider this game. It's definitely one of those hidden gem idies you occasionally find, because this game is tons of fun. As a tower defense/action hybrid, it will test both your mind and your mettle, rewarding strategic planners and skilled combatants alike. Granted, some of the production values are a bit low (animations and voice acting are kinda bad), but this is an excellent game at the very core of its mechanics, especially for a game that was made by such a small team of guys. Buy it, love it, and have fun killing dem werewolves in the meantime!			"

It's a lot better then I thought it would be, its beautiful at the cut scenes, and is a good enough to get you worrying about a barn you need to defend!

												Sang-Froid is one the of most disappointing games that I've played. I went into it thinking that it would be like Orcs Must Die but with werewolves, which sounded like a pretty awesome premise; instead, it turned out to be a clunky, dull action game with strategy and RPG overtones.The worst part of the game for me is the interface. The font used was definitely picked for style rather than legibility, making it tricky to get a quick read on your ammo count. The health bar is a strange, bifurcated heart which again is not helpful for at-a-glance info. You wield two weapons, but instead of using a toggle, weapon selection is modal. You have to hold down a key to keep the rifle out. Reloading the rifle is boosted by button mashing which is an egregiously stupid mechanic. The whole town's worth of shops could have been condensed into a single screen. The fear factor UI is painfully unintuitive but works decently once explained. I think even the developers realised how bad the UI is because the tutorial is filled with videos describing in elaborate detail how everything works. When you've gotten to that step, you need to seriously rethink your design decisions.The gameplay is where things really fell apart. It seems like most traps are one-use-only which kills the tower defence feeling for me. Because you can't rely on traps, you need to dispatch a good chunk of the enemies yourself. Unfortunately the lumberjack runs quite slowly, hits weakly and reloads his rifle in a period-correct fashion. Combat is a slow and tedious affair with the player's weakness being balanced out by the enemy's reluctance to attack. To top it off, the animations are surprisingly unsatisfying.Calling the game an epic folktale is a bit disengenuous. The writing is 90s after-school cartoon caliber and the voice acting is pretty wooden. The animations are disappointingly stilted and exacerbate the problem; using static portraits would have been a major improvement. Worst of all, it takes itself way too seriously.It's possible that the game gets significantly better after spending enough time on it. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other games that are better right off the bat.			"

												A very interesting and challenging game. To proceed from level to level, accurate planning of resources and appropriate development of character is essential. Unfortunately, ""the farther into the forest"", the level of difficulty is greater, and in addition to the good plan, you will need reflexes and good timing, so often you will have to repeat the same level over and over again. The game is worth its price and you can spend tens of hours playing and pursuing its challenging achievements.			"

												Surprisingly a really good game. Sometimes you start a game and they are so into their world that they give you a novel length of information that you can't possibly retain. This story simply gives you the details you need and who the characters are. Along with that, the tutorials are great. I hate the ones the that make you perform every action, ""Swing sword, good, you swung you sword."" This gives each thing a quick little video to basically tell you what to do without boring you to death. The voice acting needs a little work.So one sale or not, buy the game.			"

												Not even through the entire prologue yet and this gives me chills at what I'm getting into. Rather challenging and fun TD-ish game. Pretty unique, given how levels require you to plan, bait, and trap enemies rather than set up grids of death for them to grind through like a majority of toward defense games. Being a piece on the field yourself as one of the main characters, needing to watch your step,and  stay one move ahead of packs of werewolves (and other bump-in-the-night things) brings a whole new thrill TD for me.Only regret is not buying this sooner. I'm hoping that Tome 2 definitely comes out soon.			"

												Now here's a game that caught me by surprise. Sang Froid: Tales of Werewolves is Montreal-based Artifice Studio's first title, and in spite of some general shabbiness in its presentation, they've done enough things right here that I'll be keeping an eye out for their future releases.In Sang Froid, you play a pair of Canadian woodsman brothers, defending their sister (as well as the surrounding community) from nightly assaults by supernatural forces both Christian and Pagan in nature. Gameplay takes the form of an innovative and wonderfully executed combination of chop-em-up action, clever tower defense, and Rainbow Six-style tactical planning. Each day presents you with a chunk of storyline, and then lets you spend your limited daylight hours setting up traps on your property or logging at the local lumber yard for extra cash (which is spent on weapons, items, and some of the more dramatic and powerful trap-types). Thanks to your psychic sister, you know ahead of time what kinds of enemies will be attacking, where they'll come from, and what they intend to destroy; setting appropriate traps for each situation is crucial to survival, as you can only be in one place at a time, and your combat prowess is hardly a match for a single werewolf, let alone a pack of several.When night falls, the assault begins and you get to see if your defenses hold up. Armed with an axe, a rifle, and whatever consumables you've brought with you, you must do everything in your power to wipe out the assaulting units. At its simplest, you can engage opponents in melee, killing off opponents that you either hadn't set traps for or which manage to survive whatever you'd prepared. While the controls are a little wobbly at times, the combat options are innovative, simple, and very intelligent. When you aren't out busting skulls, however, your job will be to run from trap to trap, activating them at the right time to deal the most damage, or letting the enemy catch your scent and then luring them to their fiery/spiky/bouldery doom. Several enemies are very resilient to your weapon attacks, and without intelligent use of traps they can be nearly unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat. You can get around this by wielding blessed or silver weaponry, but you can only carry one axe at a time, and you can't have it both ways.I haven't had this much fun with a game in a long, long time. All the trap varieties are useful in their own way, adding interesting layers to the strategy. Plotting out the most effective and efficient layout to take out enemies is a bit intimidating at first, but quickly becomes very satisfying; there's nothing quite like knowing you've set up a fool-proof murder gauntlet and then seeing it work like a charm. Running through the woods, sneaking up on your prey as it munches on the bait you've left out; or ziplining over the forest to engage a band of demons at precisely the right moment... Each night's encounter is demanding enough to make you work for it, and all the elements involved in pulling it off are simply fun. Based purely on the gameplay, Sang Froid is an easy title to recommend.It does have a few weaknesses though. The game suffers beneath an occasionally stuttery framerate, no-budget cutscenes, fairly basic character models, a script that's difficult to take seriously, and a voice acting cast made up of amateurs (several of whom likely have English as a second language). This is more than counterbalanced by a gorgeous musical score, an unorthodox and inventive setting that drowns out the actual writing, and the stellar gameply mentioned above. If it weren't for the fact that nobody seems to know it exists, I'd say Sang Froid has all the makings of a truly great cult classic.			"

You will often find your self swinging at air(if you swing at all) when you try to attack with your axe.Plot and dialogue scenes are versatile enough that the gameplay is designed for adult tactical thinking, but the storyline is for your 5 year old who's sitting in your lap.

												This game is good. Very good the controls are good and the combat is good (more on that in a second). The musice is good and the story is good. It has a very intresting and Canadain charm. The thing that may make or break this game are small things. This is a independant game, so the look of some stuff is not polished but steel ok. Also like I said about the combat, it's hard. It picks up early on when you fight stuff other than wolves (no spoiliers). This game will make you it's ♥♥♥♥♥  and there is no difficulty level change (that I can see) so it's reall a ""one size fits all"". But here are some rules to know if you want to buy this game. -do you like fun: yes -do you like good music: yes -are you canadain:yes (not manditory) -Do you have money to buy this game:yes (manditory) If you answered yes to all manditory questions get this game!!!!!!!

												Great Game!Very interesting and creative. It is true that it might be a bit rought around the edges, but it comes from a small developer with limited time and budget. Besides what at least I most appreciate of indie games, B-games or whatever you want to call it, is their capacity of bringing something new to the table and this game totally does.It has mechanics I have never seen before, it is well balanced with enemies and traps, it feels a bit like a playable folk novel set on 19 houndreds in deep Canada, good story line and interesting to any who wants to learn a bit about amerindian mythology.Graphics, animations and voice acting are not great and some parts are a bit slow too, but besides that a fun game with good replay value. I got it when it got Greenlight at it has been more than worth it. Actually would love to see a Tome II with a sequel or prequel. Also would be great to see how the developers improve the weak aspects of this game and come up with a really awesome game!			"

												An enjoyable mix of tower defense and light action.  The game is dripping in so much culture you could tap it and make syrup out of it.  It's a  fun Canadian title that is best enjoyed in French, so much raw cultural banter is lost in translation.  Québec players will enjoy this most.			"

												This is a fun game with an interesting planning/action phase.  it has a very unique setting that adds alot of flavor.  If you have fewer then 10-15 unplayed games on steam I would pick this game up.The game is pretty well balanced and the combat is fun, if a little bit luck based.  It's a game that's worth picking up and putting down over a few days.  Some of the night sequences can be tricky if you don't change your tactics/use old items and traps.  I think that using the same map is a design shortcut, but the game is overall a well designed and tight production.Very indy story.  I don't know who Amos Daragon is, but I don't want to ever read anything else by him.  I'm not sure if it's a translation issue, but I just wanted to skip the story the entire time.Games I had a similar amount of fun: Don't Starve, Reus.I'd still rather be playing: Dota 2 (always)			"

												Canadian Gothic Horror Tower Defense!Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. The Devil himself has corrupted a nearby village and seeks a girl currently recovering in your cabin. Together with the few remaining townspeople, you have to defeat the armies of Wolf Packs, Werewolves and Dark Spirits that assault you during the night. Use the daylight wisely to plan your strategy and stock up on supplies, and slay the armies of Satan after nightfall.The game combines the round-based tower defense design with a very unique combat system. Use Shouts, Baits and Campfires to turn your foe's natural instincts against them! And to top it all off, it has a true Canadian angle to it. Very cool game!			"

												An amazing game. The idea of such an amazing concept only comes around every once in a while. The artwork and the time spent on this game shows how much the developers put into this game, and its worth just as much if not more. The game surprisingly is a little more quiet than what it should be. In other words, very underated and most consumers probably agree that more people should know about the amazing game inside the screen. If its not a 10 its a 9.9!			"

												Part-strategy, part-action, with a good skill selection tree, two difficulty setting using the two main characters and Canadian lore (we have lore?). Add to that an appealing art style, A+ music appropriate to the setting (also best loading music ever) decent voice acting and a intriguing story, this may be the best lumberjacks vs werewolves game I've ever played...well, ok, it's the only one but that doesn't lessen my enthusiasm.  4/5 A little bit of frame rate issues during some battles is the only detrimental mark against it.

												Presentation The game is divided in three forms: The cut-scenes, which are nicely represented by beautiful art in 2D, as if you were reading a book, the strategy part of the game which is represented by a map in which u have a 360 degree view of the terrain u must defend and in which u can zoom in and out and finally the action part, in which you actually put your plan into action.  The action part is cartoonish but still very enjoyable to look at and in 3D.  If you are looking for 'Crysis' graphics, look elsewhere.  It's much more art oriented.  The music is taken from canadian folklore and is quite nice to listen to.  As for the sounds (explosions, beasts roars, axe hits, guns firing,.) they are well executed and add tangibility to the game.GameplayAs mentioned above, this is a mixed game, whereas you play a tower defense game at first and after that you put your plan to execution in a 3rd view action game.  In the strategy part you are presented with a comprehensive map that tells you which creature you are going to fight, their number and their headings, i e where they will attack.  It is there that you have to put up traps to stop them from attacking buildings and thus destroying them or else you fail the scenario.  You have complete control on which traps to use, and where to use them (as long as they are unlocked from progressing in the game).  You are only limited by the in-game mechanics, i e money and action points.  The second part is as said putting your plan into execution, and this is done by pressing the 'Start the night' button in the map view.  You then have control of a lumberjack armed with an axe an a rifle and equipped with potions.  This part is rendered in 3D with a 3rd perspective aspect.  The controls are responsive and the animations are well done.  You can view in real time your traps, set them off if needed to and coming to life.  In all my gameplay, i have encountered one bug related to a specific trap, the spike trap.  Sometimes even if i was standing outside the spikes, they would hit me anyways and kill me with the other beasts standing on it.  Othe than that the gameplay is fun and sometimes even scary!ConclusionFor a 6 member studio, this game is remarkably well done.  I encountered no bugs and everything worked as described.  Depending how much time you wanna spend in the strategy map, this game should take between 10 to 20 hours to complete.  The game is not without cons, and personally i have 2.  First one is regarding the resolution.  Maybe the Devs will patch this up but for now the highest resolution is 1080P.  Second con, if they would also patch the icons in the 3D view which are not big enough with higher resolutions.  Other than that i highly recommand this game. "

												You like werewolves and european folk lore? you like tower defence? you like strategy? WELL THEN! you have come to the right place! Sang-Froid offers all these things. In this game you play one of two brothers each with their own pros and cons as you try to find help for your sister who is being hunted by werewolves and all sorts of hellspawn! and to do so, you place traps through out the forest the surrounds you cabin, and the planning fase is truly a joy to experience, did i say experience? speaking on the subject of experience, inbetween missions you get to spend your experience that you earn slaying werewolves and you get to level up your characters skill trees, and you can also use money you earn in the town to upgrade your weapons or buy other useful consumables and other items! (assuming you didn't spend it all on traps! which admittedly are a necessity if you want to succeed) All in all a very enjoyable game that i would reccomend to anyone if the things i have mentioned pique your interest!

												This game is good. Very good the controls are good and the combat is good (more on that in a second). The musice is good and the story is good. It has a very intresting and Canadain charm. The thing that may make or break this game are small things. This is a independant game, so the look of some stuff is not polished but steel ok. Also like I said about the combat, it's hard. It picks up early on when you fight stuff other than wolves (no spoiliers). This game will make you it's ♥♥♥♥♥  and there is no difficulty level change (that I can see) so it's reall a ""one size fits all"". But here are some rules to know if you want to buy this game. -do you like fun: yes -do you like good music: yes -are you canadain:yes (not manditory) -Do you have money to buy this game:yes (manditory) If you answered yes to all manditory questions get this game!!!!!!!

For the sake of you and your brother, just do it.Controls get screwy. You will often find your self swinging at air(if you swing at all) when you try to attack with your axe.Plot and dialogue scenes are versatile enough that the gameplay is designed for adult tactical thinking, but the storyline is for your 5 year old who's sitting in your lap.

Great trap synergy, a vast skill tree and a well thought-out preparation system allows for some fantastic strategizing and variation of gameplay.

												This is actually quite a fantastic little game.  Though it only took me roughly 4-5 hours to beat, I only played through once.   (you get to play through a second time as ""the other brother"", which easily doubles, if not tripples the gametime).  The first part of every night in this game is the trap set-up.  This takes a bit of thinking, and in later levels might rack your brain a bit (which is a good thing for all puzzle games).  The second part of every night is where you actually fight the werewolves and other nasties, making sure your traps function properly... and you'll know if they don't.  Admitedly, the last level (boss) frusterated me quite a bit, but after...  A dozen tries, and looking up a walktrhough I managed to get it.  I'll go ahead and spill the beans on that, to prevent frustation for any future players;  The boss (the invisible beast) can only be killed with your sister's blood on a bullet.  Assuming you make it to the boss, and you use your glasses to ""see"" him, AND you beat him up...  He'll get beat  up until 0 health, then he'll stand there dizzy for a matter of seconds (it's very fast).  Shoot quick with your blood-bullet while he's dizzy and at 0 health, and don't miss!  Or he'll regenerate, and you'll have to beat him up all over again!That being said (even with that minor frusteration), this game is certainly worth taking a look at, and was fun and frusterating (in a good way) - after all, if a game's no challenge, what's the point?

During the day you see the map of the area and what/when creatures are coming.  You have a certain amount of action points and money to set traps in various locations, because you will not have time to deal with every creature.  After your strategy is set, you begin the night and see how well you planned.This game was incredibly enjoyable.  I'm glad to see there's still good ideas out there somewhere.

												One of the most satisfying games I've ever played. You are completely underpowered, yet so balanced at the same time. Levels will take time, you will spend an incredible amount of time planning, and you will have to scrap your plans, but when your plans work, it is one of the most rewarding experiences a game has ever given me. This game will beat you down, you cannot beat it unless you have a mastery of your traps, and you will love it for not letting you take the easy way out.			"

												Did you like ""Orcs must Die"" well this game is also good. If you like werewolfs and their lore, and a very good storyline.It's a tower defense, 3rd person defense game. it relies a lot more on player interaction than other games. Pros:- it's a hard game.- Player interaction with traps.- It also feels like an RPG at the same time.- Good story- WEREWOLFS ( i love them)- Like the time of the Pioneers well this is perfect for you as well.- Two main Characters with their own story (they are brothers, they will both be included no matter which you pick, but the story is seen from their different stand point)- Good ways of planning before an attack.- Good level up system/talent tree.- has an interestinf money system.Cons:- Can at times be too hard.- Could have a better planning system (sometimes traps are not where they should be)- Only easy hard mode, no inbetween.- Little to no replayability.Good game i like it even better than ""Orcs must die"", but it doesn't have much replayability. if it was a cheaper game which came on sale more often i would give it a better recomandation. But it's still good 7/10.			"

												A good unique tower defense game with a mix of action and RPG.The story is well done and the towers  and monsters in this game are intreasting but the voice acting and melee are ok.You buy items like bullets that can be blessed and potions durning the morning as well as traps which are limited so you will have to think about what is the best plan. Durning the night you fend off the beasts from some areas like your home or the mill.It is hard game but rewarding. A great game I recommand this for people who like strategy games , myths , werewolfs and want a challage.			"

												A continuing evolution of the Tower Defense + OTS Combat genre, Sang-Froid strikes an amazing balance between so many different gameplay elements. A dark and well crafted story weaves the campaign together and keeps you engaged from start to finish. During the day you can examine the types of monsters that will attack during the next night and the routes they'll take. You then use your time units and money to place traps. Leftover time can be used to generate additional funds, which can be spent in the town on weapons, ammo, trinkets, and consumables. By tying money and time together, Sang-Froid forces you to make tough decisions when planning your day. It's a balance between putting the bare-minimum of traps down so you can afford upgrades without getting yourself killing the process. Combat at night is fun and tense, with good controls and a variety of monsters that need special tactics to take down. You'll find yourself juggling defending different objectives and, once again, your greatest enemy is time as you fight to clear one attack as quickly as possible so you can make it to the next objective in time. Over-all a great game on many levels, and a must-buy for anyone that enjoys Tower Defense, werewolves, or strategic OTS combat.			"

												Canadian Gothic Horror Tower Defense!Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. The Devil himself has corrupted a nearby village and seeks a girl currently recovering in your cabin. Together with the few remaining townspeople, you have to defeat the armies of Wolf Packs, Werewolves and Dark Spirits that assault you during the night. Use the daylight wisely to plan your strategy and stock up on supplies, and slay the armies of Satan after nightfall.The game combines the round-based tower defense design with a very unique combat system. Use Shouts, Baits and Campfires to turn your foe's natural instincts against them! And to top it all off, it has a true Canadian angle to it. Very cool game!			"

												A very cool variant of the tower defend games. You play by day setting your traps like a puzzle to smash with your axe whatever went wrong by night. It's just lovely to make complicated sets work. The art is simple and beautiful, the music is great sets quite a mood for the game. The story could have an inch or two more of depth but is not at all bad.In short, the game is very cool.			"

												Part-strategy, part-action, with a good skill selection tree, two difficulty setting using the two main characters and Canadian lore (we have lore?). Add to that an appealing art style, A+ music appropriate to the setting (also best loading music ever) decent voice acting and a intriguing story, this may be the best lumberjacks vs werewolves game I've ever played...well, ok, it's the only one but that doesn't lessen my enthusiasm.  4/5 A little bit of frame rate issues during some battles is the only detrimental mark against it.

												Sang-Froid is an awesome buy for $1.50! it blends action and strategy nicely and sort of reminds me of a zombie defense type game except it takes place in the late 1800s in a small lumberjack village and you're fighting off hordes of wolves and werewolves and you can lay traps down to even the odds. Also has a nice combat system with a fear factor level. Check out my video review to see the game hands on

												  A very nice game. While story didn't grip me, mechanics easily carry the game. It's a mix of tactical trap-based defense and real time 3rd person cmbat.  By day you set up your traps, by night you run around while the waves spawn activating certain traps, luring monsters, simply fighting or panicking because something didn't go as planned and now you have an angry werewolf on your heels.   Even real time combat requires planing and tactics. You have to manage your stamina, musket amunition and reload (it's 19 century) utilise fear through fire and  well timed attacks. Intimidated enemies give you some time to aim, reload or catch breath because getting caught in a pack of even basic wolves will hurt.  The game offers huge amounts of gameplay variation - multiple traps, trap combinations, extensive skill tree to customise your playstyle. Clear waves without moving from your front porch? Funnel enemies around 1 big exploding barrel? Drop bait to keep them occupied until you and your new silver axe can catch up? Snipe from watchtower perch? Mix and match.  Mechanics are robust, soundtrack's nice, didn't notice any glitches or bugs (wave spawning notwhistanding).I highly recommend this game for unique mix of mechanics.

												This game is definatly not as bad as it looked at first. When I first got this game in a bundle, all I could think was ""Great.....This game looks like another boring game to just try to say I did and get the achievements."" Which I can say I have done on VERY few games. But if you can look past the sketchy graphics and somewhat odd voice acting, this is a great game! It is basically a tale of two brothers and their sister in an adventure that plays out like a tower defense game. This is a greenlight and at the time of me writing this review is on sale for $2.99 and I would most definatly advise anybody somewhat interested in tower defense games and deep lore into the supernatural to get this game.

												I thought it looked cool, and the narration is wonderful, but the controls are just...blegh. I'm running as if controlling a joystick or on an axis. I simply can't adjust or sidestep to line myself up with my enemies. I'm basically running around and trying to revolve around the wolves in the hopes that whilst in 'mid-orbit' they'll be within reach and I'll be able to kill them. It's also running pretty badly on my laptop, which is sort of understandable, but if it can take Borderlands 2, Pre-Sequel and Dishonored, it should certainly be able to take this game's averagely-rendered graphics.

												I'm not usually a fan of tower defense style games, but I actually enjoyed this game quite a bit. You fight off waves of enemies, but using traps and your own musket. There is an interesting fear mechanic, and levels are challenging while giving you an ammount of freedom in how to approach them. There are RPG elements that gave enough choices to make me feel like I was powerful while at the same time always leaving me wishing for the next level or making hard choices. Finally, with the time period, plot, and music, I enjoyed the games style. It isn't the longest or best game you will play, but I think it was well worth the $15.			"

												I like Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves for 3 reasons:1) The game play - It has a great mix between 3rd person action (smashing wolfs with axes, guns and what not); stragety in terms of placement of fire, traps and where you put your charcter & upgrading of your weapons and traps between the action.2) I love the setting - and the idea of a remote french canadian forrest town harrased by warewolves. 3) Different monsters require different tactics making you try different ways to bring them downWhat i didnt like about it:a) I found the story is a bit weak and i ended up skipping the cutsceans towards the end - i just didnt buy into the emotion behind saving your sick sister - the voice acting was fine, but it could perhaps have better script writing.b) Ended too quickly - just when i was getting into the gameplay it was all over.c) Little replayability - some variety is very much needed to make me want to play it again, such as a much harder difficulty level so i can test my skills - also some randomisation in where the monsters spawn as once you have fuigured out the tactic to a map - there is little incentivve to try another tactic.Would i recomend it? YES! and i very much hope the developers will relsease an expansion / DLC with more maps, more characters, more weapons as the gameplay is very fun and is the true highlight og the game. "

												Note that this review is based on just a few hours of play; I haven't completed the game yet.Let me get this out of the way first: The cutscenes, both cinematic and in-engine, are pretty terrible and the story isn't anything to write home about.  The animation doesn't look especially good, the voice acting is sometimes questionable (on top of that, they don't pronounce things right for French Canadians which hurts my suspension of disbelief), and the writing occasionally veers into downright cringe-worthy.  I still appreciate that the cutscenes are there, since they do at least tie the missions/nights together, but I don't really enjoy them, per se.Sang-Froid is sort of a combination 3rd-person action game and tower defense strategy, and fortunately, it pulls the gameplay off reasonably well.  The strategic and tactical elements of planning out your traps and then trying to execute your plan is quite satisfying.  The game has a surprising amount of little intricate details, like how your enemies can track you via sound and scent, and how you can use an intimidation system to buy yourself some breathing room, which come together with a variety of traps, many of which require some manual management on your part, to make a game that you can actually sometimes feel cunning during.  In a testament to the developers' enemy design, the monsters actually feel fairly varied, even though their variety is in reality little more than rock-paper-scissors, and they kind of fall to the same axework.The game is at its strongest when you're planning your traps out, or rushing across the map to trip a net full of rocks just in the nick onf time.  You really get caught up in the moment, watching your plans come to fruition, or hearing the distant sound of a spike trap impaling a bunch of wolves while you're in the middle of a fight.  Unfortunately, the combat system doesn't measure up to the traps.  The ranged combat system has a far too aggressive auto-aim.  It's useful when you're trying to line up shots on circling wolves, as the rifle is meant to fire too slowly to make manual aiming feel rewarding.  But when you're trying to trigger one out of several clustered traps of nets filled with rocks, the game's inability to know which one you actually wanted to shoot as their autoaim fights each other can completely ruin a trap.  Not being able to move while reloading is frustraing, but I understand and accept the developer's decision in that regard, as it does make shooting the rifle ""mean"" more -- it makes using the weapon a resource beyond just the ammunition it takes, as the reload time can be a serious liability in the middle of a wave of enemies.The melee combat system feels clunky and vague.  It's more like Don't Starve than Arkham Asylum or Assassin's Creed.  While hitting enemies with your axe is rewarding, the enemy ""tells"" for attacks are generally not obvious enough to make the dodge system really pay off.  You'll hit a werewolf twice, then suddenly get knocked over when they attack back, seemingly without warning.  You also have little control over what you're doing beyond ""swing axe,"" so sometimes you'll knock enemies away when you'd rather be pressing the attack.  I find myself perpetually short of stamina, which probably means I'm fighting wrong, but it still is frustrating.   The real problem though is that while the enemies behave differently in terms of traps, in combat, they all seem to fight pretty much the same; or at least your tactics for fighting are pretty much the same.  All that changes is which weapon the enemy is particularly vulnerable to, which doesn't make for especially satisfying combat.  (Then again, I get the feeling that melee combat is *supposed* to be somewhat discouraged in the game, and almost making it dull does sort of discourage it.)Each night is pretty short, but can be reasonably intense as the timing of some of your traps can be quite tight.  This gives each mission an almost bite-sized quality, so it's easy to play a couple nights in spite of a busy schedule.  It also lends itself to the ""just one more"" phenomenon in a way that longer missions would not.Sang-Froid has its rough spots, but I feel that the game realizes the goals it set out to achieve, and by keeping itself short and sweet it manages to emphasize its fun parts and keeps the less fun parts from becoming tedious.

												Interesting game, it takes mutliple elements and fuses them. Theres fps, tower defence, rpg, and a story. Everyday you get new story elements, you do shopping, setup your traps, invest your skill points, and then you start the waves. I got it for about 3.50 US and its worth it. The thing I will nitpick about is they refer to Native Americans as Indians.  So when I go to the Indian village they are saying I travel from Canada and cross the ocean and find a village in India.  Indians are in India which is in Asia. Stop calling natives Indians.			"

												Nice indie tower defence game. Took around 20-30hrs of playtime to 100%. Much of the playtime is used in formulating a strategy for the upcoming night; determining which traps to use, where to place them, and how to create and use chokepoints on the map. The map is basically the same each night, but expands into a different area every few days. The variability from one level to the next therefore comes from differences in which enemies will attack, how many waves you'll face, and where on the map they'll all spawn. During the fight, you play in 3rd person perspective, luring enemies into your traps but also fighting them with your axe and rifle.			"

												Here is the most canadian game ever made, and what a joy it is to play.  If you liked Orcs must die, you will probably love this game.  Each day you prapare your battle plan, set up traps, study enemy routes, and spend the rest of your time getting a bit of money for weapons and gear.Then night falls..  What follows is then a hectic, fast paced dance of blood and steel as you run around activating each part of your plan, seeing it in motion, and hopefully killing your foes before they destroy everything.This is not an easy game, but when you survive a night by the skin of your teeth, burying your axe into the last enemy, it will be a victory worth cheering.

Do not expect a AAA title with extremly high resolutions and the budget was limited of course, but the way it´s designed has got its own charm.			"

												This game is one of those hidden gems in the steam market, I bought this game with a coupon which made it pretty cheap (less then a dollar)At first I looked at the reviews of this game, and they were quite positive, then I bought it and understood why the reviews were very positive and got pretty hooked into the game in the first 10 minutes of playing the game. Defintely a reccomended game in my book. (:Good points:- Very easy to learn if you watch the little tutorial videos that are very well done on showing how you can use them- Gets progressively harder as time goes on- Good story telling and cutscenes- Aim system that is pretty good- Graphics feel like it fits with the game- The game delivers what it supposed to deliver- Old timey feel is spot on- a tower defencey planning phase that will really make you think about what to do and when failing you think what did I do wrong or how can I execute this plan betterBad points:- Voice acting isnt the greatest- Hit boxes can sometimes be off- Movement is a little weird - Sprinting in narrow spaces can be annoying "

Fun to plan out your traps and route during the day and experiment with that for the night time battles. You can tell by the animations in the story that a lot of work didn't go in to that side of it, but the actual story is decent and the gameplay is fun, which is what counts. I recommend it, especially if you happen to find it on sale! 7 out of 10 imo			"

												One of the most underrated games of 2013, Sang-froid has absolutely amazing and fresh game design. It cleverly brings the gameplay elements one at a time to let you get familiar with each of them but it's up to you to truly understand how to master the game and to develop strategy to survive each night. The game is super well balanced, never too much nor too little money. Just enough to get by, and successful plans feel greatly rewarding. With that Sang-froid explores a really nice part of the canadian folklore. The music match that mood perfectly and do a great job at immersing you in the game. The one and only thing I can criticize about the game truly is the quality of the voice acting, the 3D models and the animations. It doesnt really get in the way except during the cutscenes. The rest is bloody brilliant.			"

												This game is definatly not as bad as it looked at first. When I first got this game in a bundle, all I could think was ""Great.....This game looks like another boring game to just try to say I did and get the achievements."" Which I can say I have done on VERY few games. But if you can look past the sketchy graphics and somewhat odd voice acting, this is a great game! It is basically a tale of two brothers and their sister in an adventure that plays out like a tower defense game. This is a greenlight and at the time of me writing this review is on sale for $2.99 and I would most definatly advise anybody somewhat interested in tower defense games and deep lore into the supernatural to get this game.

												Now here's a little gem.  You need to survive 24 nights out in the woods with all sorts of wolves, werewolves and other creatures coming after you.  During the day you see the map of the area and what/when creatures are coming.  You have a certain amount of action points and money to set traps in various locations, because you will not have time to deal with every creature.  After your strategy is set, you begin the night and see how well you planned.This game was incredibly enjoyable.  I'm glad to see there's still good ideas out there somewhere.

The plot is good too, I expected something a lot more stupid but the story is what keeps you going night after night.Random tip:-upgrade the sacred tree skill once and once only, that allows it to solo kill 2 maikan enemies (4 shots required, unupgraded trees shoot 3 times) and to dispatch a windigo without being present (by placing two of them, 5 charges of 10 dmg each for a total of 100) "

												  A very nice game. While story didn't grip me, mechanics easily carry the game. It's a mix of tactical trap-based defense and real time 3rd person cmbat.  By day you set up your traps, by night you run around while the waves spawn activating certain traps, luring monsters, simply fighting or panicking because something didn't go as planned and now you have an angry werewolf on your heels.   Even real time combat requires planing and tactics. You have to manage your stamina, musket amunition and reload (it's 19 century) utilise fear through fire and  well timed attacks. Intimidated enemies give you some time to aim, reload or catch breath because getting caught in a pack of even basic wolves will hurt.  The game offers huge amounts of gameplay variation - multiple traps, trap combinations, extensive skill tree to customise your playstyle. Clear waves without moving from your front porch? Funnel enemies around 1 big exploding barrel? Drop bait to keep them occupied until you and your new silver axe can catch up? Snipe from watchtower perch? Mix and match.  Mechanics are robust, soundtrack's nice, didn't notice any glitches or bugs (wave spawning notwhistanding).I highly recommend this game for unique mix of mechanics.

												Sang-Froid is an awesome buy for $1.50! it blends action and strategy nicely and sort of reminds me of a zombie defense type game except it takes place in the late 1800s in a small lumberjack village and you're fighting off hordes of wolves and werewolves and you can lay traps down to even the odds. Also has a nice combat system with a fear factor level. Check out my video review to see the game hands on

I've not come across any bugs, and I've enjoyed it so far, and fully expect to enjoy it some more.Graphics are of a cartoonish quality - high quality, well drawn, atmospheric - but if you're looking for photorealism, go elsewhere.No criticisms thus far.

												Described as ""one of the most CANADIAN games you will ever play"", Sang Froid is a story based defense game based upon the writings of a renowned French Canadian novelist (Bryan Perro). The game sets you in Quebec in the 1800s, setting you against the forces of wolves, werewolves, and other supnernatural opponents, forcing you to defend your sister and family from them using both your physical prowess and your knowledge of hunting and trapping. This isn't a tower defense; this is truly something worth playing for the ultimate, one man army strategist.			"

Its style, lore and gameplay are truly ""indie"". It is an original, niche game which you should try just for the unique feel of hunting damn werewolves. In general it is a tower defense game mixed with third person combat, the combat system is a little bit clumsy and simple, but it has its features like fear factor or rage attacks. In general it is an interesting title and you should definitely get it on sale.			"

												This is a fun game with an interesting planning/action phase.  it has a very unique setting that adds alot of flavor.  If you have fewer then 10-15 unplayed games on steam I would pick this game up.The game is pretty well balanced and the combat is fun, if a little bit luck based.  It's a game that's worth picking up and putting down over a few days.  Some of the night sequences can be tricky if you don't change your tactics/use old items and traps.  I think that using the same map is a design shortcut, but the game is overall a well designed and tight production.Very indy story.  I don't know who Amos Daragon is, but I don't want to ever read anything else by him.  I'm not sure if it's a translation issue, but I just wanted to skip the story the entire time.Games I had a similar amount of fun: Don't Starve, Reus.I'd still rather be playing: Dota 2 (always)			"

Each 'mission' you have a set amount of money to spend on traps... the more efficient you are at not wasting money, the more money you can spend on better gear/upgrades/etc. This creates a sort of minimalist approach.. you're constantly trying to place as little traps as possible, and setting up a perfect wave by wave traps and backup plans that you can fall back on if something doesn't hit. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you pull of a perfectly planned 5+ wave defense is like nothing I've felt before in a game. Even when something goes amiss and you manage to pull through by the skin of your teeth.. it's great. There's enough RPG skill tree mechanics and 3rd person fighting skill to make it a lot more 'alive' then your normal TD game, too. Buy it! You won't regret it.			"

												An amazing game. The idea of such an amazing concept only comes around every once in a while. The artwork and the time spent on this game shows how much the developers put into this game, and its worth just as much if not more. The game surprisingly is a little more quiet than what it should be. In other words, very underated and most consumers probably agree that more people should know about the amazing game inside the screen. If its not a 10 its a 9.9!			"

												Really enjoyed the mix of set-up strategy and in action tactical aspects to this game.  Just ensure that your pc/laptop can fully support it.  Otherwise it doesn't scale down well and the low frame rates make it almost impossible to play.  I say almost as you'll know that you nearly beat that wave/level the last time even with the frame rate issue.  So a minor adjustment to your traps, load out or last level up skill selection would...  It extends the game a lot.			"

												HI guys Its PlacidBadger.An indie game Good???? Not possiable you say I say yes, it most certanly is. The very first thing that Hits you like a brick wall at a 100 mph. is the music, you boot the game up and BAM!!! in your face strong intense music that sets the tone for the game to insue. Followed buy a girl telling about the most tarifying experince of her life happened to her and her brother s in that cold winter of 1858. with upgradiable weapons and traps at your disposal, Bon FIres to Keep the night wolfes Warewolfes and other Hell spawns at bay. Did I mention as you defend your home at night during the day the local logging outfit cuts down trees and makes new logging roads for thier use. but also new avanues of attack for the onslaute of enemy. SO Strap on  your Caulk Boots and toque. Sharpen your Ax and load your muzzle Loader for a Tower defenes style game. Now one of the few things I did notice that were of was the acting was well not the best B movie quality. I was expecting french accents atleast to be used by the the Brothers.  But the story line more than makes up for the sub par acting. I hope this helps in your descion on the purchase of this game if you want to see more reviews check out Rogue Ocean gaming on Twitch and Youtube. A great group dedicated gamers. http://www.twitch.tv/rogueoceangaminghttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgcOD8bFbPO5kcE-OZKCwQ "

												Did you like ""Orcs must Die"" well this game is also good. If you like werewolfs and their lore, and a very good storyline.It's a tower defense, 3rd person defense game. it relies a lot more on player interaction than other games. Pros:- it's a hard game.- Player interaction with traps.- It also feels like an RPG at the same time.- Good story- WEREWOLFS ( i love them)- Like the time of the Pioneers well this is perfect for you as well.- Two main Characters with their own story (they are brothers, they will both be included no matter which you pick, but the story is seen from their different stand point)- Good ways of planning before an attack.- Good level up system/talent tree.- has an interestinf money system.Cons:- Can at times be too hard.- Could have a better planning system (sometimes traps are not where they should be)- Only easy hard mode, no inbetween.- Little to no replayability.Good game i like it even better than ""Orcs must die"", but it doesn't have much replayability. if it was a cheaper game which came on sale more often i would give it a better recomandation. But it's still good 7/10.			"

												This is a great underrated game!The story is very straightforward and predictable which could have been polished and worked on.But the focus of the game is in the strategy mechanic over the traps. And the levels can be very tricky if you're stingy and keep trying to save money instead using your traps. So it's a good challenge and you can finish the levels in many different ways.Definitely recommend buying the game, specially if it is on sale.			"

												This is a pretty fun game!  The theming is very well done, I like the vast majority of the artwork a whole lot, the music is awesome, and the gameplay is really enjoyable!  I would compare this game to something like Orcs Must Die!, but with slightly more emphasis on planning and strategy, and with a tiny bit of resource management (time units & money) to spice things up a little.I do acknowledge that this is an indie game, and I don't want to seem like I'm judging it unfairly, but my only real criticism of Sang-Froid is that I don't much care for the character model close-ups during the cutscenes (they are perfectly adequate for normal gameplay, however), and that I think better voice acting, perhaps with some/more exaggerated French-Canadian accents, would have gone a long way toward keeping with the terrific atmosphere the rest of the game is brimming with, and also toward justifying the $14.99 price tag.  Personally, I feel like that's ever-so-slightly high -- I would've purchased this game at some point before it went on sale, if the full price was closer to $9.99.  That said, this game is an absolute STEAL at the current sale price of $3.74!			"

												This game is good. Very good the controls are good and the combat is good (more on that in a second). The musice is good and the story is good. It has a very intresting and Canadain charm. The thing that may make or break this game are small things. This is a independant game, so the look of some stuff is not polished but steel ok. Also like I said about the combat, it's hard. It picks up early on when you fight stuff other than wolves (no spoiliers). This game will make you it's ♥♥♥♥♥  and there is no difficulty level change (that I can see) so it's reall a ""one size fits all"". But here are some rules to know if you want to buy this game. -do you like fun: yes -do you like good music: yes -are you canadain:yes (not manditory) -Do you have money to buy this game:yes (manditory) If you answered yes to all manditory questions get this game!!!!!!!

												Quite an entertaining game, with a very complex strategy and planning element to it. The action part itself could be more fluid but once you get the hang of it, it even gets exploitable with you handling huge crowds of werewolves all by yourself.The soundtrack and is quite charming, and I just love the loading music. Quite a smart way to setup the mood while the game starts up :)The way traps are handled is interesting, and sometimes unpredictable. However later on there's one trap in particular that gets too strong and would pretty much automate everything, if it wasn't for the high number of waves. I highly recommend it if you happen to enjoy rich pre and in-battle strategy as well as the occasional action scene.As for story, it seems engaging so far, but this is the just the First tome. Nice cliffhanger to make us look for more. As of writting, Tome 2 is being produced. Check more information on the steam community section of the game :)			"

Even if sometimes you'll disagree with some of the design decisions, it's unique setting and compelling gameplay will make every victory satisfying.- Performance is bad. It never became terrible or unplayable, but the almost one minute loading screen and the overall low framerate is as much a mistery for high end PC owners as it is a hindrance to the gameplay.Overall, a very unique and interesting game that makes me excited for a bigger, better second volume.

												Every effort was made to try and not ruin the plot of the game throughout this review. However, no promises can be made.***Possible Spoilers follow***An amazing game for the price.  It is definitely unique, albeit a tad bit easy.  I started the game with Jos, although I really wanted Jack because I was hoping for more gunplay.  Changed to Jack after day 3 because it seemed a bit too easy to NOT play on the mode I had originally wanted.Although I found the gunplay severely lacking, I still enjoyed the game.  Honestly, aside from shooting Net traps or occasionally shooting enemies as they ran up, I rarely used my gun at all.  Even sitting on bonfires, I found it more advantageous to run out, do a full combo once or twice, and then run back into the saftey zone of the warming flames.However, when you think about it, that merges great with the historical and realistic (for a game about demons and werewolves) feel that the developers were trying to create. It wouldn't make much sense for you to be running around with a musket firing off round after round during the time period the game takes place in.I wasn't entirely thrilled by everything in the game though.  I spent a lot of the nights just sitting around waiting on my traps to go off and still using a good chunk of my AP on cutting lumber for money.  I actually found myself purposefully letting enemies get to my buildings each wave so I would have something to do.  If you understand how the traps work, you could literally clear almost every wave with traps alone.Overall the combat system itself was poorly made.  You get your ""autoattack"" consisting of left clicking up to 3 times for a combo (and with your stamina thats about 6-8 clicks until you fatigue) or rightclicking to spend your ""rage"" points. Once you learn the system its pretty childish.  Left click combo (3 clicks) to knock an enemy down, run / sprint in circles (run around and only sprint when they get close to avoid attack), and then combo again and repeat. Throw in an occasional Right-Click for a stamina-free attack/knockdown here and there. Doing this you could take on Wendigos and The Invisible Beast no problem. After around days 3-5 I never found myself using the roll (spacebar) except during fights with the ""Fireflies"". There was just no point in wasting all that stamina when a quick sprint away would dodge most if not all attacks and leave you with a lot more stamina.The ""Fireflies"" were probably the most annoying thing in the game.  Before you get the hang of fighting them, you will find youself constanly trying to take one down, only to find yourself slammed in the back by a fireball from another one and knocked down while the one you were fighting disappears underground to heal himself back up to full.  And thanks to the aforementioned combat system, you were really limited on your choices in fighting them with your axe.  Even once you learn how to fight them, you will still find yourself catching the occasional fireball and cursing at them.**Small spoilers**Which doesn't even matter towards the last few days of the game.  A very unique factor in the game was that enemies only took full damage from certain types of weapons (Normal, Blessed/Holy, or Silver).  So you had to decide what type of axe you wanted to bring with you or your types of bullets to stock up on (although as before, the gun is pretty useless unless you REALLY want to shoot something).  And then they add in THE AXE. Anyone who has played the game that far knows what I'm talking about, and others will know when they get there.This axe does full damage to everything. EVERYTHING. So now nothing is resistant anymore.  They basically took their system and threw it out the window for the last few days of the game, making the game even easier when it was supposed to be getting harder.  After you get the axe any combat is cake.  Wendigo? No problem (although a ballista will take it out in 1 shot with the skill point). I wouldn't recommend fighting a Wendigo hand-to-hand (because they cannot be knocked down, only backwards), but it is still pretty easy. And the Fireflies become cake. 15 Health? Kinda annoying to fight when they're resistant and can heal.  After the axe they go down in about 4 or 5 swings.**End Small Spoilers**A lot of the traps become obsolete later on as well. The wolf trap (20 AP and some money) is all well and good early on for insta-killing 1 wolf. Later on when the wolves come in packs of 3 there is little point to it. I put 1 point in trapping just so it would hold things (mainly Maikkans) for 10 seconds so I could set a spike trap and wait for more enemies to run up on the one stuck in place. Spike traps were better for the wolves because at 55 AP they save you AP and you can set them on the spawn point to drop the packs as soon as they zone in. The hanging nets become pretty much useless unless you want to use it on fireflies, and even then since it spreads the damage around between the enemies underneath you have to run up and finish them off.  I found that setting a Cross under a net, shouting, activating cross when they got near, letting it do some damage, and then dropping the trap was the best way for clearing a group of fireflies with minimum effort. And bonfires were pretty much useless because, as I mentioned earlier, you could get through almost every wave in the game without really having to fight anything if you set your traps right.**Small Ending Spoiler**And the ending itself was just, bleh.  There was no real feeling that you had finished the game.  It just ends like any other day in the game. There was no big feeling of triumph after you had finished it. It ends on a definite cliffhanger, but for the time put into the game the ending just isnt there. You get like 30 seconds of cutscene or so like you would any other day of the game.  You don't even reunite with the brother whose soul you saved. Everything was building up to you defeating this super demon and saving the village, you defeat it, and then thats it. A small cutscene, and its over.  Nothing about saving the village, saving your sister, saving your brother, nothing. It just ends, and rather poorly at that.  I even found myself googling the ending afterwards to see if I had missed something.**End Ending Spoiler**But all of that aside, there was something about the game that compelled me to finish it.  It could have been the gamer in me that didn't want to leave a game I had bought unbeaten. It could have been the uniqueness of the game itself.  But everything aside, I did find the game very enjoyable for the price and would recommend people to pick it up. Some people may want to wait to pick it up on sale (I got mine on sale) because although $15 for the game isnt a bad price at all, the game DOES lack a certain polish that would make it a must-have. I would definitely recommend that it at least gets placed on your wish list and for you to pick it up at some point, because it is definitely a unique and intriguing game even with the flaws in the game itself.I would like to see a sequel made, but the developers are really going to need to flesh it out a lot more to make it worthwhile, and the story is going to need to have some major work put into it. It felt like it was just a side thought to the game to spice it up a little bit in between the repititive nightly routine the game falls in to.			"

												Sang-Froid appeals to me in a huge way, there is very little that I actually dislike about this game. The game is very creative and also innovative for games in general; adding interesting mechanics and ideas that are difficult to find in any other game!Simple things like having enemies able to fear you, smell you and hear you, make this game stand out from anything else you could find.What I like:- Great progression - The game is constantly adding new mechanics, enemies, traps and weapons, so it never becomes stale.- Planning - Allowing you to set up traps and decide what to defend during the day, and setting the plan in motion at night is a brilliant idea, and feels so rewarding when you accomplish the level.- The Lore - I usually don't pay attention to the setting of the games world, but Sang-Forid makes me care about the folk history, the overall aesthetic to the game is really amazing.- The Music - The music appeals to me in EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WAY POSSIBLE, simply fantastic. It is also very fitting for the world it is set in!What I dislike/ could have been improved:- The story/ Dialogue - I am interested in the story, but due to the fact it was made by french developers the translation from French to English can sometimes come off poor or cheesy, not all the dialogue is bad though and most of the voice actors are actually quite good. It is sadly just not as strong as the rest of the game, but the fact that the developers were able to pull it off in the first place is a positive in my opinion!If you haven't guessed it already, I adore this game and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!

												Unique and interesting combination of action and a limited amount of strategy with a backdrop of a story (adventure?).  This is the sort of game you'll only find from an independent, executed at a pretty high quality visually and audio-wise.  I've not come across any bugs, and I've enjoyed it so far, and fully expect to enjoy it some more.Graphics are of a cartoonish quality - high quality, well drawn, atmospheric - but if you're looking for photorealism, go elsewhere.No criticisms thus far.  Well worth the small price of admission.			"

												Quite an entertaining game, with a very complex strategy and planning element to it. The action part itself could be more fluid but once you get the hang of it, it even gets exploitable with you handling huge crowds of werewolves all by yourself.The soundtrack and is quite charming, and I just love the loading music. Quite a smart way to setup the mood while the game starts up :)The way traps are handled is interesting, and sometimes unpredictable. However later on there's one trap in particular that gets too strong and would pretty much automate everything, if it wasn't for the high number of waves. I highly recommend it if you happen to enjoy rich pre and in-battle strategy as well as the occasional action scene.As for story, it seems engaging so far, but this is the just the First tome. Nice cliffhanger to make us look for more. As of writting, Tome 2 is being produced. Check more information on the steam community section of the game :)			"

												This game manages something spectacular. It makes me realize how terrible it's graphics are in one moment and completely overlook it in the next, with its amazing gameplay and story.Simply said: Sang-Froid is a marvel of its kind. It chose a very underused setting, took its mentality, weapons and general feeling and turned it into an extremely challenging tower defense.This is no ""Orcs must Die"". Here you face just a hand full of enemies and you can plan all you want, which makes the strategic part much more rewarding. Since its the late 1800, your weapons are flintlock muskets and silvered hatchets, all while you fight to a great folk-song music. Now... there are some negatives... the cutscenes are terrible, making the still pictures look amazing. The game is relentlessly hard and combat is very stiff. Then again, you play as a lumberjack or a trapper, not a fighter. And still, it is incredibly rewarding to place your one bullet in a werewolf's head and frighten his comrades with a bonfire, while you watch your character shove your last holy bullet in the muzzle.

												Gosh, THAT was frustrating experience! Game was really hard for me, and fps drops when rushing to save falling laneline or deal with trap misfire didn't help much. Little space for improvisation, high demands on controls. But maybe I was too scanty with my traps and employed risky plans.Though it was interesting and had ""one more turn"" syndrome.May replay on hard difficulty someday, if I would need challenge.			"

												One of the great little gems to shine out of the cacaphony overload of indie games on Steam. I grew up in minnesota, so when I saw werewolves, and canadian foklore, and RTS AND action...I hit the purchase button faster than a Wendigo sneezes ice. It has a great folky soundtrack, and great hand-drawn visuals, especially the menu and town interfaces. Being that it is indeed an indie game, the game budgets and amount of people working on this  title would be laughable to a mega-corp like Ubisoft or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly EA. So there are a few expected rough areas, but they don't detract from the overall game. Mainly, the voice acting was terrible, I felt like random people off the street were pulled in to read children’s books to 1rst graders. If they every make a TOME II, it would be great if they addressed this. Conversely, the sounds while playing the game and the music are very well done. It really sends a shiver up your spine playing this in your room at night, the sounds of the wind rushing through trees, the crack of branches and snarls and howls of the beasts just over the hill expertly done to always create the feeling you will be attacked at any moment. Mechanically the game works pretty smooth, and is challenging to say the least. It creates tense and relentless action when you hit the go button; it actually is scary in a way. There is a sense of dread and nervousness as you hover your mouse over the ‘begin’ button…setting in motion the nights terrors upon you.  You hope things will work out and you will survive, but it always feels as if the odds are stacked against you. My one complaint is the pacing...the skill tree becoming unlocked only started to open up toward the end, and by the time I could really afford some better weapons, there were only a couple missions left. I wish there was a patch to adjust this a bit. I love a challenge, but I hate seeing cool things that I can't afford and can't have fun using, then it’s over. When it was over though, I can say it was definitely a sense of accomplishment! This makes me want to go back now, play with the harder brother and see if I can get those last few achievements, which are not just filler achievements.Overall, for a couple bucks, this game is well worth it, is unique, and hope to see their next game...though it looks vastly different in theme. A great 'first' game for this small team in Canada! "

												SNAPSHOTAn action-RPG / tower defense game that looks like it was made by third graders. Thankfully, it plays like an 8th grade level.OVERALL - 3.5 / 10PROS+ combat feels responsive+ music is good+ planning each level is interesting+ relatively bug free (unless you're trying to get achievements, in which case the opposite of that)CONS- awful models (texturing is ok at best)- awful voice acting- awful writing- way too many game mechanics overly complicates almost every portion of the game- replaying levels *intentionally* disincentivized- every level uses the same map for the entire gameDETAILSWhere to even begin with this one. I really wanted to like Sang-Froid, I really did. Overall I like the concept of an action-RPG + tower defense game (Orcs Must Die! does it fairly well), and the movement in the game doesn't play all that poorly, but overall it is extremely poorly executed.Probably my biggest gripe is that combat-related gameplay itself is just a pile-on of systems that's only purposes seem to be to limit what the player can do. First there is stamina, which is a combined limit of being able to run as well as your ability to use melee combat. Melee is frustratingly bad, especially the targeting. Often times you'll be attacking an enemy that's about to die and then suddenly the game will switch targets on you and you'll be swinging at something else on the other side of the screen, leaving that low health enemy free to do whatever it wants (which 90% of the time means regen to full or cast a meteor swarm down on your face). It becomes even MORE frustrating when enemies start becoming ~90% resistant to normal damage, so unless you have a weapon the enemy is weak to you won't be doing full damage. Ranged combat requires you to reload after every single shot you take, which takes an inordinate amount of time (there's an *achievement* for reloading in under 3 seconds). You can speed up reloading slightly by mashing a button, which seems to only distract the player from how long it actually takes. Also of note for ranged combat is that it has headshot and non-headshot hitboxes that ""lock on"" (poorly) that are infuriating more often than not. Next, there's a ""fear"" system that was supposed to help players not fight enemies all the time, but in practice way too complicated and cumbersome. On top of all of this there are still traps for players to place, each of which only has *one* use per level (seriously?) per trap placed.Paired with this combat system is ~ 3 different enemies (there's one ranged enemy in the game, and then a few minor variations of a melee enemy) and *one* map that goes through extremely minor changes and expands slightly between levels. Also of note are the ""two"" characters to choose from, which in reality only vary in starting stats so I'm still not sure why the choice even exists. If there had been half as much time / effort put in to adding all the limiting factors in combat and 4x as much time put into adding real variations in content, it would have potentially been a much more engaging game. Unfortunately, while it seems all of the development efforts were spent in adding combat systems, combat gets old very quickly without a change in enemies to face. The different starting points and number of enemies each wave helps masks this problem slightly, but that wears thin pretty quickly.On top of all of this, replaying levels is almost completely out of the question. You CAN go back to a level you've already completed, however it erases ALL progress past that point. There is one achievement for completing the game for each character, but why anyone would do that is beyond me. The game doesn't play differently for either character, save for the fact that one of them has less health AND stamina than the other. Skill points that are awarded each time a player levels up only seem to annoy a player more than help them, most of which only add minor amounts of damage. The skill points spent almost never make a difference in whether or not an enemy dies; either the damage added is already overkill, or it adds such a minimal amount that you're better off walking up and meleeing them instead.Easily the worst parts of the game are the ""animated cutscenes"" between levels. I could forgive the awful models if there were a lot of them (or if this game was made in 2006), but there are comically few to be seen and it was released in 2013. It is very apparent that the entirety of the modeling / animation efforts in the game were spent on the cutscenes, which there are unfortunately ~1-3 of every single level. The voice acting is as cringe-worthy as the models, and the writing is almost as bad. Given that the story is based on French Canadian folklore, however, that means 90% of the work was already done story-wise, so how that was screwed up so poorly I'll never know.Overall, this game has a lot of things in place to distract players from the fact that just about every system was poorly planned and designed, so if you're really into shiny things feel free to pick it up. If you're not easily fooled, however, stay as far away as you can.			"

												This game is definatly not as bad as it looked at first. When I first got this game in a bundle, all I could think was ""Great.....This game looks like another boring game to just try to say I did and get the achievements."" Which I can say I have done on VERY few games. But if you can look past the sketchy graphics and somewhat odd voice acting, this is a great game! It is basically a tale of two brothers and their sister in an adventure that plays out like a tower defense game. This is a greenlight and at the time of me writing this review is on sale for $2.99 and I would most definatly advise anybody somewhat interested in tower defense games and deep lore into the supernatural to get this game.

												I thought it looked cool, and the narration is wonderful, but the controls are just...blegh. I'm running as if controlling a joystick or on an axis. I simply can't adjust or sidestep to line myself up with my enemies. I'm basically running around and trying to revolve around the wolves in the hopes that whilst in 'mid-orbit' they'll be within reach and I'll be able to kill them. It's also running pretty badly on my laptop, which is sort of understandable, but if it can take Borderlands 2, Pre-Sequel and Dishonored, it should certainly be able to take this game's averagely-rendered graphics.

												I first bought this game a few months ago while it was on sale for something like $5, but I bought it around the time I had a handful of assignments and papers to write during school, so I never got around to playing it. Fast forward to Summer, i've got a broken xbox and a handful of games I don't want to play, so I try out Sang-Froid. Greatest $5 game purchase i've ever made. What's cooler than being a couple of Irish-Canadian lumberjacks fighting off werewolves?? The game forces you to utilize traps to equalize the playing field, because you're not going to be able to take on two werewolves at once in hand to hand combat. Great time killer, interesting story, extremely pleasing aesthetic, moderatley challenging, even on the easier (Jos') setting, and just downright enjoyable.			"

												A continuing evolution of the Tower Defense + OTS Combat genre, Sang-Froid strikes an amazing balance between so many different gameplay elements. A dark and well crafted story weaves the campaign together and keeps you engaged from start to finish. During the day you can examine the types of monsters that will attack during the next night and the routes they'll take. You then use your time units and money to place traps. Leftover time can be used to generate additional funds, which can be spent in the town on weapons, ammo, trinkets, and consumables. By tying money and time together, Sang-Froid forces you to make tough decisions when planning your day. It's a balance between putting the bare-minimum of traps down so you can afford upgrades without getting yourself killing the process. Combat at night is fun and tense, with good controls and a variety of monsters that need special tactics to take down. You'll find yourself juggling defending different objectives and, once again, your greatest enemy is time as you fight to clear one attack as quickly as possible so you can make it to the next objective in time. Over-all a great game on many levels, and a must-buy for anyone that enjoys Tower Defense, werewolves, or strategic OTS combat.			"

												     Let me start this review/ reccomendation by saying this: This is the most Canadian game in exsistance. Never has there been a game more Canadian. So disclaimer, if you do not like Canadians ( or thinking, since it is a stratagy game) this is not the game for you. Now that thats done with, lets begin.     Sang Froid: Tales of Werewolves is an action/ stratagy blend set in Canada( go figure) in the late 1850's. It follows Jack and Jos defending their land and their sister from attacks from hell. Night after night new paths open up, and occasionally new buildings to defend, making it harder for you to defend. Sang Froid: Tales of Werewolves is a great reddemer to Werewolves and Canadians alike since the series that shall not be named ( I know its set in Washington State, but everyone is more Canadian than American, and if you cant figure out what it is then heres a hint: Still a better love story than ________.

												Mobs don't always go where their pathing says they'll go, which means Josephene is trying to kill you. Chop off her head. Do it. For the sake of you and your brother, just do it.Controls get screwy. You will often find your self swinging at air(if you swing at all) when you try to attack with your axe.Plot and dialogue scenes are versatile enough that the gameplay is designed for adult tactical thinking, but the storyline is for your 5 year old who's sitting in your lap. That's a plus, at least. "

												I first bought this game a few months ago while it was on sale for something like $5, but I bought it around the time I had a handful of assignments and papers to write during school, so I never got around to playing it. Fast forward to Summer, i've got a broken xbox and a handful of games I don't want to play, so I try out Sang-Froid. Greatest $5 game purchase i've ever made. What's cooler than being a couple of Irish-Canadian lumberjacks fighting off werewolves?? The game forces you to utilize traps to equalize the playing field, because you're not going to be able to take on two werewolves at once in hand to hand combat. Great time killer, interesting story, extremely pleasing aesthetic, moderatley challenging, even on the easier (Jos') setting, and just downright enjoyable.			"

												Overally 8/10.Petty cool concept and decent strategy game. Didn't like how there are some instances where you HAVE to fight hand to hand even though it was a strategy game. Would have been better if everything was solvable with traps only.Game could have been improved by forcing you to handle larger groups of enemies. Worth playing overall.			"

												As this is on sale now I though I might give a short recommendation. This game is possibly the most unique strategy game I've seen. It offers a wide variety of innovative and unique gameplay mechanics. The levels play as both a tower defense puzzle where you place elaborate traps around the map in order to take enemies out passively, and as an RPG with strategy components where you engage the enemies actively with rifle and axe. The fear meter is a very interesting mechanic where the actions of the enemy depend on the amount of fear both you and your enemies have. For the discounted price (€2,- here) this game is absolutely worth it. It is also the most Canadian game ever.			"

												Unique setting, simple but not dull combat as the combination of traps and weapons keeps things fresh... all in all, an excellent little effort. And I do mean little; it takes place over twenty days, meaning twenty levels, and then it's done. On the downside, the voice acting is mediocre, though not ""Oh dear sweet Cthulhu devour my mind that I may be free of this torment"" level (see: Disciples 3, Dawn of War). Seriously, though, you've set your game in frontier Canada, your main characters are French-Canadian, and you couldn't find any Quebecois to help with any of the voice acting? All the same, this game is a throwback to classics like The Horde and its newer versions in Orcs Must Die and other tower defense FPSs, and is fun, compelling, and challenging. Totally worth one's $15.			"

												Misleading is the best summary I can give. From the trailer, it looked like a great hack and slash with tactical planning, but ended up having Rainbow Six bloopers where if you don't do everything perfectly, you are screwed.The graphics are pretty good. They remind me of a  launch title for the PS2. I don't like how little I can adjust the graphics and because of the lowest settings available, it isn't fluid for frame rates (I hover around 40 instead of the preferred 60). I can't even adjust the resolution outside of my monitor (16:10), so I'm forced to 1244x800 instead of picking something lower when there are options to select lower.The reaction times for attack animations are a bit off. The stamina bar affects attack speed, but creatures like the werewolf tended to almost blink towards me like a flash step and I couldn't swing to counter attack in time. Things like that prevent  a lot tactical fighting, especially when certain creatures like the Were-wolf are too fast to run away from and you'll pretty much die if you don't strike first with a trap.Sound effects are passable. I wanted to listen to my own music fairly quickly, but the intro song alone was pretty good while it took two full minutes to load on a fairly modern machine. (made in 2011 with the latest parts at the time).All together it is frustrating to the point I don't want to spend too much time replaying levels because of the inability for the characters to be useful. It is Rainbow Six all over again and the old Rainbox Six games were cool atmosphere but quit-inducing rage sessions due to bad AI and weird decisions from the Devs for gameplay, just like this game.

												The only negative point in this game is its length - 12 hours for Joseph, 15 hours for Jacques - and that's all folks. But on the other hand, you are not getting tired of the game. All other sides of Sang Froid - tactical planning, night fights, story (maybe, a bit naive, however, still fascinating) - are making this game really interesting. If you are interested in unusual games - it's your game. If your're going just to have some fun - it's still your game			"

												An excellent game for those who like a more active twist on the Tower Defense genre.

The music and setting are a big plus.			"

												Having picked this up for just a couple dollars during a Steam sale I can honestly say I am not sure if I've ever received this much enjoyment for so little money. I had spotted the game on Greenlight many months ago and was intrigued by the novel and clever premise for a hybrid strategy/tactics/action. Even then at the 15 dollar mark I was strongly considering the purchase if the game turned out to be good fun. Sadly, the game flew in under my radar on release and I forgot all about it until I noticed it at the top of the User Review list on the Steam sales page. You play as one of two brothers living in the woods on the outskirts of Wolvesdale, somewhere in Canada. The winters are harsh here and the prowling wolves even harsher. Lil' Jos, the burly big brother is more than capable of whopping wolves with his axe, shooting them with his musket, and setting traps. The other Brother, Jack, is a more frail sort and you will have to lean heavily on your ingenuity with traps to succeed with Jack as your choice. At the start of the game you are first introduced to Jack and soon thereafter, Jos and their sister Josephine. Josephine has come down with a fever after a travesty at the local church parish involving the pastor. I won't spoil the story for you, as it does a fine job of effortlessly tossing the Christian and pagan at you without being heavy handed or conciously offensive. Christian motifs figure prominently in the story as well as pagan and Native American belief. The characters are well done and push the story along quite well. Josephine begins to prophecy foreboding events and the two brothers resolve to get her to town for medical treatment. After the nearby bridge has mysteriously burned down, events begin to domino toward ever more sinister happenings. You'll face two varieties of wolves, 2 varieties of werewolves, and a handful of other mythical creatures such as the Amerindian 'Maikan"" which amounts to their verison of the werewolf myth, as well as Will-o-Wisps and the like. The Devil plays a major role and is puppetering the corrupted pastor and townsfolk to play out his wicked game in an attempt to destroy the townsfolk, the brothers and their sister. The writing is solid and the voice acting is competent. I'm enjoying the cutscenes story unfold into the missions you are tasked with. The main game consists of a pre-game tactical strategy map where you purchase and place any number of devious traps to incapacitate and dispose of the hellish fiends. The game has a good learning curve and introduces you to the myriad devices slowly; as it should. This aspect of the game is very reminiscient of the Bullfrog Dungeon Master games of years gone by. Great fun is to be had plotting your tactics to deal with the many waves of enemies that are tasked with destroying your assorted buildings. To write of all the many traps and how to use them would amount to a miniature FAQ and so I will leave much of that to you, dear reader, to research. To say the developers gave you a treasure trove of gadgets is putting it mildly. At the beginning of each match you are also able to use the money you acquire from defeating the creatures to purchase better weapons, ammo and gear. A coventry nearby can bless your bullets or axes, respectively, so as to deal greater damage to the diabloical creatures. The general store sells an ever increasing number of muskets that have authentic descriptions of their real world counterparts with some very nifty trivia thrown in. You also can purchase new gear and ammo. And the hotel furnishes you with an assortment of liquors that have varying effects on your character in battle.During the match proper, you will be scurrying as your very life does depend on it. Following the routes you planned during the pre-game phase you will have to be front and center for certain traps to be effective. The deadly net trap requires you to shoot the net and drop it on the creatures below. If you have a bait present under the net you simply take your time and fire. Otherwise, you'll have to get crafty and 'shout' for your enemy to come inspect the area. Bonfires help buff the 'fear factor' that  keeps the creatures at a distance as they prowl slowly around you looking to strike. During this time you can reload your musket and go for the headshot without worrying about being ripped to shreds.  Fire walls can be strategically placed to alter the route of your enemy. Watchtowers with ziplines to other parts of the map are a lifesaver when you need to 'be there' quickly to prevent destruction of your precious buildings. This is only a smattering of the many traps available. Nevermind all the possibilities on how to use them in conjunction with each other.And I haven't even touched on the player levels. Much like an RPG, you earn experience points that allow you to upgrade many traits. Typical character buffs like more health, stamina, and the like as well as quicker reloading and stronger traps are available. But there are also quite a few unique buffs such as poisoned bait that damages the devouring creature or increasing the damage done as a 'sniper' if you should decide to try for a shot from one of your watchtowers. I could go on and on about all the neat features of this game with impunity. The game is well balanced and is a blast to play once you grasp the game mechanics. Most of the game elements will feel familiar to the hobby gamer. But by combining them in such a manner requires an enjoyable pause for thought that many modern games no longer ask of you. To have my intelligence and keyboard savvy simultaneously challenged has been a real treat.  The art style is charming and the music very well done. The graphics are rather modest for a modern game and have a World of Warcraft nature to them but serve the game quite well.  Artifice Studio is officially on my list of promising developers to watch. I cannot recommend this game strongly enough. Especially for the money. A MUST BUY!			"

												Did you like ""Orcs must Die"" well this game is also good. If you like werewolfs and their lore, and a very good storyline.It's a tower defense, 3rd person defense game. it relies a lot more on player interaction than other games. Pros:- it's a hard game.- Player interaction with traps.- It also feels like an RPG at the same time.- Good story- WEREWOLFS ( i love them)- Like the time of the Pioneers well this is perfect for you as well.- Two main Characters with their own story (they are brothers, they will both be included no matter which you pick, but the story is seen from their different stand point)- Good ways of planning before an attack.- Good level up system/talent tree.- has an interestinf money system.Cons:- Can at times be too hard.- Could have a better planning system (sometimes traps are not where they should be)- Only easy hard mode, no inbetween.- Little to no replayability.Good game i like it even better than ""Orcs must die"", but it doesn't have much replayability. if it was a cheaper game which came on sale more often i would give it a better recomandation.

												I'll admit I was very wary of this game when I took my first glimpse in it's direction. While othing seemed mechanicly wrong with the game from the get go, nothing really stood out to me either as anything worthwhile. However with a recent sale, and a good friend of mine recomending it every chance he got, I decided to pick the game of and give it an honest chanceThe first thing I'll mention aout the game is that while the combat has a clunky feel to it, it's surprisingly enjoyable and really fits the theme of the game, if theirs any time I found myself frustrated with an outcome in combat it was because I hadn't managed properly and felt the weight of it come crashing down on me. You play one of two lumberjacks fighting the Devil and his werewolf, spirit army. Pretty badass concept but it's up to you to be the badass of the story, the game won't do it for you.Resource management is key to winning this game, and the trap and resource system is set up harsh but fairly. You really need to pay atention to what your actually able to spend on upgrading your personal gear like weapons, protective clothing and consumables, because while a good axe or rifle may come in handy, they only help you against one or two enemies before your overwhelmed, however a proper trap could take out four enemies in one go, nothing beats a properly executed trap.The game also has a fear system, allowing you to scare off certain enemies , and help even the odds against the packs of wolves that often surround you. Alot of enjoyment is to be found making your enemies hesitate to atack you and start having to size you up before their confident enough to strike again.Lastly but cerainly not least is the soundtrack to this game. This game has one of the best soundracks I've ever heard. It definitely has music you can stomp your foot to (I speak from experience on this.) The music of this game brings everything to another lvel, it makes combat even more enoyable, it gives you a goo sense of the world, and it's just plain fun to listen too.In short Sang-Froid is a challenging but rewarding game that offers fun gameplay, a badass story, and some of the best music you'll ever hear in a video game, if not just in general. I'd recomend this game to anyone who likes a nice challenge and is a fan of strategy. I'd give Sang-Froid an 8/10. It's not the highest budjet game, but you most certainly et your dollars worth for it, most of that with the soundtrack alone.			"

												Amazin game, the nights make you full of fear :) while the battle engine may not be the best on the market, but it has some unique and very interesting ideas, I loved the fear factor.

												One of the most underrated games of 2013, Sang-froid has absolutely amazing and fresh game design. It cleverly brings the gameplay elements one at a time to let you get familiar with each of them but it's up to you to truly understand how to master the game and to develop strategy to survive each night. The game is super well balanced, never too much nor too little money. Just enough to get by, and successful plans feel greatly rewarding. With that Sang-froid explores a really nice part of the canadian folklore. The music match that mood perfectly and do a great job at immersing you in the game. The one and only thing I can criticize about the game truly is the quality of the voice acting, the 3D models and the animations. It doesnt really get in the way except during the cutscenes. The rest is bloody brilliant.			"

												Sang Froid is a wonderful Indie game. To quickly sum up this game, it's an action-based tower defense with a story tacked on to boot.  You set up your traps during the day and defend your buildings at night using traps, axe, and rifle. The monsters come in waves and you need to set up your traps and your positioning to respond to the monsters and their path (which you can later manipulate).Combine that with a levelling system (arguably on rails as if you survive the night, you'll level but even in failure, you can level up) in which I have yet to find a single ability which wouldn't be useful depending on playstyle. There are two playable characters which determine the difficulty of the game. Jos is a tough strong guy whereas his brother Jack is better with a gun but not as tough. I had a really good time with this game however, there was not a great deal of play time available. You need to survive 20 nights and the story completes itself. There are plans for a Sang Froid 2 however, the company just released Conflicks on Steam and the follow up might be a while in the making.  I would also have loved perhaps some more choice in the story but for their first effort, Sang Froid was a gem. I would give it a 8.5 out of 10 but totally worth your time and money.			"

												Nice indie tower defence game. Took around 20-30hrs of playtime to 100%. Much of the playtime is used in formulating a strategy for the upcoming night; determining which traps to use, where to place them, and how to create and use chokepoints on the map. The map is basically the same each night, but expands into a different area every few days. The variability from one level to the next therefore comes from differences in which enemies will attack, how many waves you'll face, and where on the map they'll all spawn. During the fight, you play in 3rd person perspective, luring enemies into your traps but also fighting them with your axe and rifle.			"

Each day you prapare your battle plan, set up traps, study enemy routes, and spend the rest of your time getting a bit of money for weapons and gear.Then night falls..  What follows is then a hectic, fast paced dance of blood and steel as you run around activating each part of your plan, seeing it in motion, and hopefully killing your foes before they destroy everything.This is not an easy game, but when you survive a night by the skin of your teeth, burying your axe into the last enemy, it will be a victory worth cheering.

												Really enjoyed the mix of set-up strategy and in action tactical aspects to this game.  Just ensure that your pc/laptop can fully support it.  Otherwise it doesn't scale down well and the low frame rates make it almost impossible to play.  I say almost as you'll know that you nearly beat that wave/level the last time even with the frame rate issue.  So a minor adjustment to your traps, load out or last level up skill selection would...  It extends the game a lot.			"

												I admit, the game looks a little rough around the edges, but it's a phenomenal take on tower defense games .The cutscenes are a little cheesy, the graphics aren't all that great, but the gameplay is unparalleled. Each 'mission' you have a set amount of money to spend on traps... the more efficient you are at not wasting money, the more money you can spend on better gear/upgrades/etc. This creates a sort of minimalist approach.. you're constantly trying to place as little traps as possible, and setting up a perfect wave by wave traps and backup plans that you can fall back on if something doesn't hit. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you pull of a perfectly planned 5+ wave defense is like nothing I've felt before in a game. Even when something goes amiss and you manage to pull through by the skin of your teeth.. it's great. There's enough RPG skill tree mechanics and 3rd person fighting skill to make it a lot more 'alive' then your normal TD game, too. Buy it! You won't regret it.			"

												I got this for $7.49 during a sale. Warning: This is a indie title. If you can't stand games that are not perfect, turn around now.Gameplay: You play as one of any two brothers that each night fight to defend their cabin as well as other buildings as you progress. Each night you prepare your map from a top down perspective by putting down traps and obstacles to slow down, damage, and/or kill waves of   werewolves and other creatures. During this time you can also travel to the nerby village to buy supplies(a hub of storefronts). Here buy drinks that heal or give you bonus, supplies, and upgrades your weapons(axe and rifle). When you are ready the night begins and you are put into third person to fight each wave.The story/animation/voice acting is what you would expect of a indie game. Not terrible, but not that amazing.If this is for around $5 and don't mind something differen't, give this game a shot. It is one of those gems you never hear about.			"

												Sang-Froid is a really interesting and innovative hybrid action-strategy game. Each level consists of a planning/strategy phase where you spend time & money to set up traps followed by an action phase where you attempt to defeat the wolves & other enemies with your traps, axe, and musket, earning money for each kill. The voice acting is uneven but none of it's nails-on-chalkboard, the difficulty curve is very smooth, and the in-game tutorials are quite adequate. Also, fun.			"

												This is actually quite a fantastic little game.  Though it only took me roughly 4-5 hours to beat, I only played through once.   (you get to play through a second time as ""the other brother"", which easily doubles, if not tripples the gametime).  The first part of every night in this game is the trap set-up.  This takes a bit of thinking, and in later levels might rack your brain a bit (which is a good thing for all puzzle games).  The second part of every night is where you actually fight the werewolves and other nasties, making sure your traps function properly... and you'll know if they don't.  Admitedly, the last level (boss) frusterated me quite a bit, but after...  A dozen tries, and looking up a walktrhough I managed to get it.  I'll go ahead and spill the beans on that, to prevent frustation for any future players;  The boss (the invisible beast) can only be killed with your sister's blood on a bullet.  Assuming you make it to the boss, and you use your glasses to ""see"" him, AND you beat him up...  He'll get beat  up until 0 health, then he'll stand there dizzy for a matter of seconds (it's very fast).  Shoot quick with your blood-bullet while he's dizzy and at 0 health, and don't miss!  Or he'll regenerate, and you'll have to beat him up all over again!That being said (even with that minor frusteration), this game is certainly worth taking a look at, and was fun and frusterating (in a good way) - after all, if a game's no challenge, what's the point?

												It is elaborated game enough. You should medidate about eath step you make and deeply thinking about strategy. Carefully choose skills and weapons. If you ready for this I may buy it, when it is on sale.			"

												Did you like ""Orcs must Die"" well this game is also good. If you like werewolfs and their lore, and a very good storyline.It's a tower defense, 3rd person defense game. it relies a lot more on player interaction than other games. Pros:- it's a hard game.- Player interaction with traps.- It also feels like an RPG at the same time.- Good story- WEREWOLFS ( i love them)- Like the time of the Pioneers well this is perfect for you as well.- Two main Characters with their own story (they are brothers, they will both be included no matter which you pick, but the story is seen from their different stand point)- Good ways of planning before an attack.- Good level up system/talent tree.- has an interestinf money system.Cons:- Can at times be too hard.- Could have a better planning system (sometimes traps are not where they should be)- Only easy hard mode, no inbetween.- Little to no replayability.Good game i like it even better than ""Orcs must die"", but it doesn't have much replayability. if it was a cheaper game which came on sale more often i would give it a better recomandation. But it's still good 7/10.			"

												Brilliant. Combines strategy and action delightfully, and with intensity I would not have guessed. Each level works out to 2 minutes in the shops, 45 minutes of planning, a short derailment to fix a boneheaded mistake, 5 minutes of action, and a bit of exhaustion.Plot aspects are a bit puppet-show-y, but adequate. The characters are simple, but none are worthless. It's hard to be annoyed at having to protect someone who helps you lay more traps. It is the struggle of siblings against a grave threat, with both the problem and the solution enhanced by different members of the community.The gameplay is interesting, and absolutely astounding how much the designers give you with so few resources. From manipulating sound and scent to lure your foes into traps and ambushes, to simply running away to regroup, reload, or activate some fun toy you left for a fallback. So many sensible options to choose from... I haven't had a game stretch my tactical thinking like this in a very long time.I raise all the thumbs I have to this game.			"

												Игра стоящая. За такую цену со скидкой в 75% стоит взять. Лично я жду продолжения. Рекомендую всем.*****This game is very good. By the spirit, by the story, by gameplay as well. Its not a project you will play for months like Skyrim, but this game grants you a lot of positive emotions. Gameplay divides into 3 parts: something like RPG where you research some new skills, manage your money to purchase new traps and weapon. The 2nd is to place the traps on the map and planning your fight against enemies (which are different by abilities and combat tactics). The 3rd one is fighting itself in the manner of tower defence with an actie character (you may choose one of two brothers) you play by.Especially I like the story, seems its inspired by Washington Irwing tales. It touchs you. By this hot price EVERYONE who interest the games should try it. I recommend hardly. I bet you'll enjoy it. I wait for the continue of this game in production now. The music is AWESOME! True irish folk tracks.			"

												""Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves"" is a fusion of tower-defense, strategy and action genres, that gets all its elements JUST right. Set in mid 19th century in Quebec, the game is a delight to play and for the most part, is amazingly immersive. First, here is a brief about each of the three genre elements:Tower-defense: The game follows the standard ""place towers --> defend against waves"" profile. You place defensive and offensive traps in the day, to defend 1 to 5 of your buildings (the number increases from 1 to 5 over 13 levels) in the night. The traps are varied, paths are all well marked, and variation in enemies is also good. The map is amazingly good in global top-down view as well as the zoomed in 3rd person warcraft-like view. No level is frustratingly bad/difficult but each level takes a certain amount of smarts from the players.Strategy: The number of factors you have to account for is quite considerable. Placing traps not only take money, they also take up action points. Each day has a set maximum of action points. This makes sure that even if you save up money, the game doesn't become lame easy. Money in itself is pretty tight, at least for the first half. Wanting to buy better gear forces really effficient trap placements. Health, stamina, fear factor, weapons, potions, and later on even wearable items come into play (more on that in next point). Your character also levels up slowly so you can improve certain attributes; however you level up barely 16-17 times and the skill tree has ~40 skills. Thus, this aspect acts as customization suited to your own playstyle. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and balance of strategy.Action: This is the twist factor of the game, and in my opinion, really what makes the game shine. The strategy and tower defense alone were enough actually to make a whole game. But after you place the traps and the night begins you yourself go out with your axe and your gun, carrying potions, items, and 3 types of bullets with you. This aspect adds a LOT of playtime to the game, and makes you execute the traps you placed in the day. You also see your planning unfold in front of you as waves after waves of enemies fall to your cunning traps. There are certain fixed outposts for fast travel as many times waves have enemies rushing in to many buildings simultaneously. The later enemies especially need to be dealt with manually, and there are many traps that make it easier for you - one damage over time, one shooting fireballs, and even a bonfire that temporarily makes the enemies ""fear"" you. The wind direction also plays a role as your scent is carried to the enemies with the wind. If you are at the wrong place at the wrong time, enemies halfway across the map will smell you and run to you and abandon their fixed paths, wasting your traps and probably killing you.  Again, A+ to the devs for great execution and seamless fusion of first person action with strategy.Pros:-Solid mechanics, no bugs, just the right length to give a satisfying experience while being fun-Great balance of all ingredients along with all-round balanced strategy elements-Immersive atmosphere, all thanks to amazing folk music selection played at precisely the right pace-Two difficullties (so slight replay value)-Achievements are decent, they give a kind of ""special"" challenge, nothing gimmicky-Responsive devs (on Steam forum, that I know of)Cons:-Voice acting, dialogues and cutscenes in general are the weaker points of the game; nothing game breaking but if the devs were short on cash/talent they could've forwarded the story using comic strip format (like Max Payne), narration format (like the intro video of the game) or maybe even plain written story format-Apart from that, I just found the last 20% of the game slightly monotonous, the reasons being:As you proceed in the game and if you are half-decent you have a stockpile of cash even after buying all the best gear for the last 5 levelsAlong with that, if you're buying all potions from the start and hoarding them, just axe-hacking most waves becomes an easier way out by the end and ridiculously so with the right perksLast 5 levels are just 5-6 waves of repeated enemies, no noveltySumming up all 3 points, I think the devs could've had waves with enemies swarming in large numbers by the end levels that would force liberal cash usage and disallow you from brute-forcing it by making you impossibly outnumberedApart from those nitpicks, the game is really innovative and near-perfect.Final verdict: Recommended!8.5/10, well worth the full price.

												This is a great tower defense rpg. I paid for this game when it came out and it was well worth the money. At the time of this review this game is free so it is definitely worth a try so pick it up while you can. I love werewolves and the dark atmosphere of the game but I have to say my favorite thing about this game is the music. If I had the option I would buy the soundtrack, the music is that good. Try this indie gem youll enjoy it.			"

												Truly a phenomominal game. I have never seen a game set up quite like this one. The story is great, Atmosphere is well set, Tactics is absolutely crucial. (If you run in and try to gun everything without utilizing your traps you will die in the worst possible way you can imagine.) Quite challenging in some levels requiring careful planning which is excelente if you enjoy a challenge in your games. But by far the best thing about this game. (At least in my opinion.) Is the soundtrack. The sound track for Sanfroid is by far the greatest sound track i've heard for any game i've played so far! It would be absolutely silly to not give this game a shot. I guarantee you would absolutely love this game! I will be absolutely thrilled when sangfroid tome 2 comes out! Happy hunting lads! (Note: Please disregard the ammount of hours i have put into this game at the time of posting I've had a bad computer for years so when i run it it has been very choppy but with my new rig it runs like a dream perfect so be expecting to see a LOT more hours out of me!)
