												I dont usually feel urge need to write review for games..but when i do..Earth 2150, in one sentence:  ""The Forever Shining jewel of the past"".This game not only stands for itself, but it stands for an era of gaming and gaming industry.Its the era when studios care to impress the gaming population and offer as much content as possible and with quality to come with, and wasn't driven by money as first priority.This is not your typical C&C game that after 7 missions of singeplayer sends u back to your desktop to spend $$$ for expansions packs, or the studio was ""too lazy"" to add naval units or other core features. Earth 2150 came out in 2002, and set a new era of RTS gaming, since it was (if im not mistaken) the first full 3D RTS game in the market.-The Story in a nutshell:its 2150, and the over-use of nukes in the recent wars by 2 of major factions has resulted in kicking the earth out of its normal orbit straight into the sun.So now the earth's destruction is inevitable and led to all 3 factions working on big projects to evacuate (their) popluation to Mars before the earth explodes.-GameplayThis is not your typical Paper-Rock-Sccisors RTS/ this unit counters that and that counters this .....You research tech, which comes in the form of Chasis for ur vehiciles/ships/aircraft.You also research a large variety of weapons, and ammunitions, togather you build those weapons on top of ur units creating different type of units according to your taste, different chasis sometimes allow u to combine weapons togather.The maps are big, and the approach to attack is different in each game, especially vs other players, since its hard to forsee what tech he is going for; is my enemy rushing rockets tech with homing capabilites? or hes going right into plasma cannons or air units?You can manipulate the terrain , create trenches to block enemy vehicles, flatten the terrain, build bridges, and...construct an entire tunnel network...yup...u can literally dig under fortified enemy bases for back-door attacks.Most weapons require ammuntions, so u need to consider this when fighting far from your base (supply depots and aircraft handle ammunition delievery).Campaign-The Beauty of the campaign is that its no entirely linear; you are set with a global objective of getting a large amount of credits towards the evacuation of the planet.Within missions u need to find the balance between building an army and researcing tech, to sending credits to ur spaceport for the main goal, if u fail missions the game doesnt end, sometimes u just lose the tech/content that u could have received withing that missions, and in some cases u are presented with different missions on the globe due to the one u failed.you only fail the campaign if u fail to achieve the required credits when the timer runs out ( and you have plenty of time, the timer doesn't pushes you to rush missions at all), i finished the first campaign with 109 days left (out of 183) and i took all the time in the world in each and every mission i played.The missions vary from destroying enemy bases, sneaking and exploring huge tunnel systems, recovering artifacts and prototypes, testing new tech and the usuall destroy your enemies.You can finish the campaign earlier, u dont need to reach ""final mission 20"" to end the game, its all up to your methods.you do u have general time limit before earth goes boom though..When the global timer gets close to zero, the map variety changes as well, forests map turn into lava maps with hot terrain,water maps are almost non existent...and so on.Its also worth to note that during the campaign, the enemy faction also research their weapons, just like you, the AI doesn't have advantage over the player, and excluding a few techs, the AI research advancement depends on your playstyle.Turtling usually lets the AI finish all hes availabe research and keep up with the player, sometimes bypass you.Playing aggressively, and attacking research centers or finishing missions early, sets the AI back, not allowing it to finish its research, creating an advantage for the player in future missions.in total, there are around ~30 missions..yes....THIRTEE missions PER faction , and they usually take more then 30-40 min real time to complete.Just to give an exmaple, it took me around ~20 total hours to complete the campaign with one faction.Its insane how much content and variety this game has for something that comes up in 2002, most of those features the RTS games of today doesn't even have, and the content they provide is much more thinner.You are always driven forward to continue, if its by the tech and the new units that come available, the missions, the story and so on.I wish studios today would develop games like earth 2150, and its concepts that completly change the course of how RTS games work. rather then squeeze as much $$$ as possible for its costumers and giving them the minimum content to please them.Its amazing that im enjoying this game even more when i first played it..12 years ago.For a miserable price of 7 bucks which includes the expansion packs as well, its so much worth it.Im playing this game on Win 7 with no problems at all, if its crashes for u its due to resultion, and there are plenty of solutions to that in steamforums/internet.TL:DRPros:-Non-linear campaign-Very long campaign-Multiple ways to approach missions-Unit Costumization and a very large research tree-Air force, Navy Units and Ground Units, its all there-Tunnel digging-Minefields-Terran shaping and manipluation-Very intresting to play factions, all balanced and differ from each other-Hige Replay valueCons-Old controls and lacking mouse options (you canno't invert the mouse controls - right click command, left click select)-Sometimes clunky units behevior (units shooting rockets into mountains etc..)-Not alot of players in mutiplayer these daysOverall 9.5/10			"

												First this is an old game. Second no one has yet to follow where they went.I am not going to give a game review but give a review of why no one has followed its foot prints.The games give 3 factions in that it follows others but where it changes is that each faction has a strong point.  The lurnar group is hover low armor/high shield output, the ED are heavy tanks with high armor/low shields, and the UCS are robot mechs with a med armor/shield output.  This gives a 3 factions that play in their oun way.  The vehical system is where this game blows the rts walls open. Make a vehical tha way you want it not the premade idea some one thought up. Like rockets add that to the tank, like heavy guns change it to heavy guns then build it.  Want a combo? Yea heavy guns with a rocket on top, it dose that(for real!!! best tanks for ED)  The weapon combo system with a med weapon system added on top of a large weapon makes for vehicals that are your liking.Then they put ammo in, you need to reload your vehicals with air drops from cargo choppers linked to supply depo's.  With energy weapons needing time to recharge, lasers, spark cannons, sonic guns(hate that aoe), it makes for a good balance.  Save your crew, this isnt much in the muti player but in any campaign if you keep units alive you can transport them back to a main base and reuse them on the next mission.  This leads to the exp, as you keep units alive they make kills and gain more armor,hp, and damage with each lvl. The quick way to see this is make a unit with a banner, it adds 2 lvl's to units around it, very use full early but wont add past lvl 4 if a remember right.  This will show give an example of the added damage/hp a unit has at higher lvl's.  The next thing is a unit that will let you upgrade units with new tech, better shields ready add it on and upgrade it. Some units you cant, but that up to you to find them the starting unit types.The game was ahead of its time and I dont think any rts has come close to following the way it plays.  The line that describes the game with 150 missions and 9 campaigns is true but thats ED,UCS, and LC X3 games so each game has a campaign for each group.  I would start with ED on ESCAPE FROM THE BLUE PLANET to learn the game, it has the easy start, the UCS and LC through you in.  The bugs are mosly sceen size issue's, the game wasnt made for todays HDtv screens/widesceen issues, search for the fix its out there.			"

												Best of the earth 21 series.Multiplayer and especialy single player demands a focus on resource allocation, too much of focus of 1 aspect and you probably have a hard time catching up. What to expect:- Pretty fun single player campaign.- Great atmosfere, you'll see Earth degrade with each couple of missions and so creating a sense of importance and haste.- Each faction plays differently. - Pretty fun multiplayer, however LC's superweapon is the only weapon that cannot be countered(unless you snipe the    weather control centers), so i would recommend putting superweapons off if any1 decidedes to play LC.- The A.I. could use an overhaul, its very easy to cut its supply and wait until its out of resources.- Units tend to shoot mountains instead of enemy units and they will not adjust fire.What NOT to expect:- precize unit control (i.e. starcraft)- cakeSome advice:Play Earth 2140 and the Earth 2150 addons, but never ever play the abomination that is called Earth 2160.They went with features that was popular at the time instead of focussing what made the previous titles.

												I've been a 2150 fan since release. Like many here on steam I got this release because my old discs had seen too much action over the last 14 years to be able to install the game properly. Everything is as I remember it: awesome unit customization system, epic unit numbers, lasers and rockets and EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE!! I would recommend the game to anyone with only 2 reservations:1.) These games are OLD and the graphics have not held up well. If you can't handle that, you have been warned.2.) These games do not support widescreen HD resolutions. The included resolution testing program will clear them and you can get into the game menu but upon launching into a game you will crash to desktop. USE 4:3 RESOLUTIONS ONLY.			"

												Very good game for its time.Bought a copy when I was 10. Quite impressed about unit customization and graphic. Soundtrack is good too, especially compard to Earth 2160 (In Earth 2150, each faction has its own tracks; In Earth 2160, all factions share same set of BGM). Plot is not as boring as it seems.However, it is quite unbalanced. You can rush with basic tank of LC at the start of a skirmish... And even in singleplayer campaign, LC gets their own overpowered hero unit. The tech tree is comprehensive, and many techs are useless.Still, it is a decent game even by current standard. If you see this game on discount, you can buy it and have a try.			"

												This game is pretty frickin' awesome, a real strategy classic from the golden age. The graphics may not have aged well but it handles really well, it's deep and immersive, and strikes a good balance between being easy to get into and hard to master. The setting is one of the most dystopic you can find; it'll always keep you coming back for more, and since the campaigns are so long there's always more to come back to.			"

												Underrated story and gameplay, a lot of overhanging plot-points and a pretty good meta-aspect to the gameplay bu using a ""main base"". The resource system works brilliantly and forces the player to chose between finishing the game sooner and researching/building more units to help with future missions. This combined with the timed story, as in you only have a limited time to reach your goal, puts the pressure on the player troughout the game and forces the player to make quick decitions and not spend ages planning. Without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												Highly recommended. Especially if you still have got older PC/laptop. Quite addictive. I really love that option that you can save your tanks/vehicles for next missions or just transport your army between missions from main base. If you like RTS old school - you will enjoy this game.

 ""Leadership comes in small acts as well as bold strokes.” Earth 2150 is fine example of a classic real-time strategy game with three unique factions and a broad spectrum of tactical opportunities, including an extreme grade of unit customization. Especially the customization of the loadouts of individual units upon construction contributes greatly to the gameplay, while progressing through the impressive research tree.Compared with its largely unknown predecessor the combat mechanics were greatly improved. In addition the differences and specific characteristics of the various factions were further developed. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												Earth 2150 is an old 3D Real-Time Strategy which has expected core gameplay with some few unique features. Trilogy consist of original Earth 2150: Escape From Blue Planet and it's two stand-alone expansion packs: Moon Project and Lost Souls.So, let's see how Steam rerelease fares. Well, it was released on Steam in ""as is"" state, which is never a good idea for early Windows games.Unless you configured it properly, it will crash when you try to open research or unit construction windows by pressing F2 or F1. Which are very important to gameplay, you will not even get military units without it. Thus you have to open up configuration and then set resolution to 4:3 ratio. Also set driver to OpenGL. This should fix it all.Also, you will not be able to multitask or chat while playing this game. It does not allow alt-tab. After fixing the game the steam overlay will not work. Windowed mode steals mouse and is just clunky.Movies don't work in Expansion Packs. Only in original E2150. No idea if that's because they weren't included or because of bugs.Multiplayer is known not to work there. I didn't look past registartion, to be honest. Now, looking over forums, some people suggested some ways to get it working. Fan patches and tools. But I don't feel that it's worth it, to be honest. Doubt that anybody plays it regulary nowdays. And then some people still couldn't get it to work, so eh.The plot as follows is that ED, Eurasian Dynasty, devastated UCS, United Civilized States, base on north pole with nuclear weapon, in order to win the war that was started by UCS main computer due to some error. The huge explosion altered trajectory of Earth and soon it's going to get closer to the sun, burning everything alive. LC, Lunar Corporation, which previously was sitting on a moon cut off from Earth's war, realized that they will burn up as well and joins the fray. All of them need Earth's recources to build huge space shuttle in order to evacuate to Mars.The plot itself in a game isn't anything to talk about, it doesn't have any big storytelling. Though, it does have some here and there, but it's all text at the beggining of a mission, no big cuttscenes. I msotly enjoyed reading them because they show the unique relation inside each faction, giving them more personality.Now, basis of a game itself is a fairly standard RTS game. You build base, you build power stations, you extract money from sparce recource fields and you build army to crush another player.Interface quite old. A bit awkward, with big windows and having to use left mouse button to both select and send command. Still better than in Earth 2140.The scale is old-schoolishly spammy. You know, where you build 5 Mines over single field and 8 Weapon Productions Centers and then make them all produce your varied army. Whoever doesn't agree will get crushed by AI. Then again, it's much needed, since game's pacing is a bit slower. You don't build a single unit in few seconds, it may take a whole minute to get a tank rolling out, so you will not get overwhelmed.There is a fair amount of usual micromanagement too. Usual stuff of having to send transport that carries resources to mines as soon as they spawn. And putting all 3 of mines of a tiny field. And such. At least units don't have special abilities to manually use, it probably wouldn't fit there. It matters more during battle. You see, most of units can attack while moving around, even without command to do so. And if your enemy uses projectile weapons, like grenades or plasma, then it's sometimes better to just use cheaper variant of speedier machine with less HP and then circle around, delivering fire while not getting hit.And then there are few features that Earth 2150 tried to do. First, you actually have to assemble unit before mass-producing it, allowing you to be creative. Well, actually, not exactly creative, you are limited by few selection and by what you researched, but Single-Player people will still enjoy this aspect. You just pick a chassis and equipment. Sometimes you get to put second equipment as well.You can also build bridges and tunnel. Bridge building is quite simple and does as you expect. For tunneling there is a serapate underground map under the main map. You build tunnel entrance and then get inside it, where you can also build tunnels in these caves and forgotten labs, to build tunnel exit leading to another place. Like backyard of enemy. Or to get ground forces behind mountains. Yes, you can fight underground if you meet somebody there, just not build anything. Oh and you can also affect surface anymore, by either creating trench or by flattening terrain to remove it. No, you can't flatten mountain.And then there are smaller things, like changing weapons on top of some buildings, researching slowly whatever new stuff you want or building headquarter building, which will handle some things. Like, auto-upgrading all defences. And whatever gadgeds that msot players would find not worth bothering with.And yea, compared to E2140 they removed infantry and automatic research. Which is good, more focus.And three factions look differently and play differently in some ways. ED and UCS are quite standard RTS factions, being different in nuances. ED uses tanks, UCS uses mechs. ED has to build fwe power sources, while UCS get enough from a single station which can be upgraded. ED needs mines, refinery and machines to deliver crates, while UCS needs only harvesters and refinery.LC playes much more differently there. All units can hover over the water and it doesn't have economic units. You just place buildings where you want, they slowly descent from the space. You just put mines over recource fields and complete forget of them. This all makes them possibly more powerful at times than they should be, as you can pretty much scout and then grab up all the recources on the map for yourself. They just lack a bit of main base focus, maybe.Main differences between Earth 2150 games is campaign. Original is very pleasent, starting off easy and slowly teaching you of new researches and units by making them available one by one. It's also great that you maange both main base and mission map at same time, sometimes sending reinforcement. Sadly, your mission is to send certain amount of recources on each level to main base and seeing how you can't know much of recources fields on each level is, how strong is enemy and since you can't sell any building or unit, only auto-destroy here, well, you can get stuck. So, often you will have to restart mission.Moon Project is proper expansion, introducing new units for everybody. It also has more normal campaign. Still with main base. But without recources requirements in each mission. So it's a good one, just isn't good as introduction to the game.Lost Souls only adds campaign and it wants to wreck you.You can also play Skirmish. Sadly, you can't preset AI into each team. And they seem to always refuse to be allies with you during the game. I wouldn't be surprised if they only want to target player base. Just expect duels. It's not so cheating, outside of knowing where exactly your base is and such. It's quite nice AI, can counter whatever you send.Actually, the only way I won most battles is by grabbing all recources on the map and surviving long enough for AI to run out of it's recource field. And then denying AI's attempts to get more, until it can't even produce units anymore. Yep, it's the main weakness of this AI. Pretty hard otherwise, it sure knows how to go big and spammy.There early graphics of 3D were great for it's time. They now look outdated. Until night comes in and you see everything activating lights. Always digged dark/light playes. Soundtrack is also nice, each faction has it's own set.It's a good RTS. Sadly you can't alt-tab and that game is slow-paced at times, so I will not be playing it much. Has nice ideas otherwise.			"

												Absolutely one of the BEST RTS games out there. I've bought this game three times already... In any case, the gameplay is just as innovative now as it was back in... Well, I don't remember. I was literally a kid then. Games are only just now starting to pick up on the complexity and customization that this game brought to the table, and its graphics honestly still look pretty damn good, especially considering its age.On the note of graphics, on both my hard copy and GOG.com copy, there is widescreen incompatibilities that will crash the game. This is simply because widescreen didn't actually exist when the VooDoo APIs (remember those beasts?) were written. Fixing it is fairly simple though. Look up nGlide, download the driver package and executable, configure and enjoy. Basically what it does is trick that old VooDoo software into thinking it is still in 4:3 while you're running 16:9 or 16:10 formats, plus it'll work with any game that was programed for those old VooDoo GPUs. Mechwarrior 3, here I come!Gameplay wise, this game is both forgiving and unforgiving. The campaigns are long, and its amongst the few games that allows you to continue the campaign even after losing missions and battles. That's the forgiving part... The unforgiving part is that the game is basically a resource rush, battling relentless and challenging AIs over resources and trying to mine them out and send them back to your main base. While the game gives you plenty of opportunity to achieve your goals, the AI is very intelligent, and will stop at nothing to end you. Failing and/or fumbling battles too much will result in watching your people die in a firey apocalypse, and there won't be jack♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do about it. That being said, there is a huge number of missions for each campaign, some of which are only available under certain circumstances such as ""Lose here..."" or ""Win there..."" or the like.The game provides a huge variety and complexity in units, weapons, and research, all of which makes for customizable units to a degree unseen in RTS with the exception of maybe Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. Throughout the game, whether in single or multiplay, you're have to balance cost, quality, quantity, and power for your units, weapons, and research, and rushing tech is much more complex than you'd see in other RTS like StarCraft or Dawn of War. Overall, each faction has a huge variety of units and lacks the over-simplified ""this unit counters this"" dynamic that seems to be so prevalent in RTS these days.If this game has shortcoming at all, and obviously I don't think it does, it would be in its story. The game runs on a simple premise, described in the manual, box, and on the Steam page, of ""The world was nuked to death by UCS Robots, and its orbit was disrupted enough that it's orbit has started to destabalize and move ever closer to the sun... So GTFO of dodge."" Granted, a little bit more story is conveyed through mission briefings which are simple emails that you can read, but they can be generally skipped and are rather dull outside of the odd running joke. You make your own story in where you choose to go in the capaigns, and how you choose to handle each battle. Personally, I prefer this method, as games like Homeworld 2 get obnoxious with their incessant in-game cutscenes and endless hand-holding. I'd rather play my game, not watch it.Overall, I'd say that Earth 2150 is the most innovative RTS out there, and certainly amongst my favorites along with Dawn of War, Homeworld, and the first StarCraft. It surpassed its predecessor ""Earth 2140,"" and set a high bar that its sequel, ""Earth 2160,"" sadly fell just short of. If you're a hardcore RTS player, I highly recommend this game.I forgot to mention a couple things... The controls are quite unfamiliar. Being amongst the first 3D RTS games out there, they messed with the controls quite a bit. Being that this game lacks a tutorial, I strongly suggest downloading the manual, or finding a quick reference guide for the controls. Also, the prerendered cutscenes in this game are pretty damn awesome. Sadly, they are compressed to hell because they use the old bink codecs, but the quality really is top notch. Think about what CG looked like in 2000, then compare it to this... Really, the only places you'll find better is in studios like Blizzard.			"

												WARNING: Game doesn't work on modern AMD CPUs, it runs too fast and there is no way to slow it downIt runs fine on Intel and it is a great game with 3 very different races/sides. I love the research and production feature of the game where you can design your own units by building them from different components. It has a day/night cycle and dynamic weather which is a really cool for such an old RTS game. Units and buildings auto turn on lights at night and it looks awesome especially in a heavy night snowstorm. It's definitely worth it's low price as of now.			"

												A game from around the same time as C&C Tiberian Sun.

												An absolute Classic. One of the best RTS ever, particularly Lost Souls, allows a satisfying management of resources aswell as creating your own units. The soundtrack, sound effects and graphics still impress. Earth games are known for its difficulty and unforgiveness but it can be very gratifying.			"

												Memories of the good old times poping up. This was my very first self-purchased PC game ever and I was addicted to it, played it day and night (rarely played the campains tho) the skirmish mode is probably the best part of the game :D (only my oppinion). Coose your party, build power plants to get energy, build your own army,  research weaponry to increase the firepower of your units, supply them with ammo and attack your enemies! This game will always be one of my favorites! :D Good Work TopWare!  \(^o^)/			"

 Important!16:19 resolution causes the game to crash, use 16:12Some facts why I love these games, and why you may buy them:- ~20h per campaign * 3 factions * 3 games = about 180h game time- Very good campaigns encouraging you to save every unit and use them in later missions- 3 different factions with their strengths and weaknesses you have to master- Lots of available tech for every faction you have to chose from- Customizable units regarding their shield and weapon combinations- Shapable environment. Trenches, walls, bridges to build and use- Tunnel area below the surface. Good for getting behind defenses or attacking with earthquake generators- Unit voices giving them real characters just by reporting- Unique music for each faction- Day/night cycle influencing the sight range (lights too)- Weather, going from wind and rain over thunderstorms to meteor showers- Some very nice cheats if you cant get it done- Cool mods giving you even more units, weapons, maps and modes (I love Operation X)and more...Two downsides:- The pathfinding is quite annoying sometimes, especially with large groups. (Alt+G shows grid ;)- ""Destroy the base"" means destroy every one building, including the small tower 5km away in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes the remaining enemy units should be taken care of too. For these few cases you should use the cheats to proceedRegarding the engine, you may want to play The Moon Project first, as it and Lost Souls use an upgraded engine and have some improvements in UI, unit management and so on. Since it has a side story you won't get spoilers, instead some things are better explained than in Escape from the blue planet. Lost Souls plays directly after this, so you should play it last. Also, in Lost Souls the campaigns are linear, so you should first go for ED, then LC and UCS as last.Also, Multiplayer via MoonNet server is working most times, if you are interested contact me :)			"

												Pros-non-linear campaign with a global time limit and ability to keep your units/research between missions-ability to design your own units-day/night cycle-terrain modification ability (even though I still can't seem to get it to work without getting my builders stuck)Cons-factions have some balance issues (which in my opinion become even more prominent in The Moon Project)-campaign is far too easy to complete within the time limitOverall, I would recommend buying this game although apparently there are technical issues with modern computers.

												The Earth 2150 Trilogy is an excellent game series that remained true to real-time strategy conventions but still offered many interesting features, such as the ability to construct original units from component parts.Those of you who haven't experienced the science fiction of Earth 2150 have missed some good gameplay, highly realistic environments, and an exciting plot. All of these features satisfied even the most demanding RTS fans. What we can say for sure is that the outstanding atmosphere presents the most appealing aspect of Earth 2150. Changes of night and day, weather conditions, and highly detailed landscapes proved that the guys at TopWare really take their work serious.Each of the three organizations features more than 50 units, weapons, and structures in its arsenal, many with upgrade components, prerequisites,and specific properties. Weapons and technology range in power from simple chain guns and cannons to earthquake generators, weather control centers and shields. Structures run the gamut from energy supply facilities and mines to research centers and base defenses.Single-player campaigns include a carryover resource system from mission to mission, so maintenance of a home base is mandatory and requires transportation of units and resources to and from specific mission areas. Skirmish mode offers access to campaigns and battles created with the built in map editor, and serves as a practice field for multiplayer training.The Earth 2150 Trilogy  is one of those games series  that make you wonder why others in the genre don't have the same features. Then again, a RTS game with good graphics, good artificial intelligence, and good unit balance is quite uncommon. But the Earth 2150 Trilogy meets all these demands: The graphics are distinctive, the computer opponent is good enough to give even experienced players a tough time, and each side plays differently and has its own advantages.

												I am glad to have a chanse to play this again after so very long, but truly the biggest part that I feel is missing is the old community, it was integral to the game. All the custom maps and over the top matches are something I'm going to miss. Other than that, the game really impressed me again with its cool dynamic trasitions from day to night, light effects from buildings and units, the variety of locations and enironments... also I forgot how brutally hard the campaign was, but its the charm of a very old game, that somehow looks and plays better than some modern takes at a RTS.Solid recommendations, though the online community is really a necessity for this game to bloom.

												Played this for hundreds of hours when I was young, but there's plenty reviews that already state how this game is cool or not for it's game mechanics.Therefore I'll just say the following for the people that nuke this game into oblivion without showing ANY form of Google-fu1. The game is 16 years old, ofcourse the pathfinding sucks in comparison of today's games.2. Crashes caused by you using a 16:10 resolution are just 1 Google Search away from being fixed -> Use a 5:4 resolution (1600x1200 is the largest in the list). Reason? When this game was made 16:10 did not exist, and the programmers made the screens for a 5:4 resolution.3. This game is legendary :-)			"

												Topware Interactive has made a solid real-time strategy title with some interesting gameplay elements, but buyers should research a little and know what they are buying into before the final purchase.The most important thing to do before setting out to play Earth 2150 is to remember to synchronize your watch, because it does not count to be slow in this game, or things will burn up.Cool, complex, and full of action, Earth 2150 extends the tradition of classic sci-fi RTS warfare with a few new twists. If you can get past the brick-handed interface and get into the game itself, odds are you'll enjoy it.			"

They put a lot of effort into making this, even in the whole story of what's happening in the game, of what is happening to the planet, you'll get the occasional cenematic weather reaport of what is going on around the world before it (spoilers, kinda) dies.3 different campaigns with 3 races to have fun!

												Earth 2150 redefined the notion of having mixed feelings from a game on Steam.Beeing a trilogy,it has the original game and the two standalones.To review this game, as a whole package ill use a list of Pros and Cons,and I’ll leave you to figure out if its worth it or not.PROS:-	You can “create” your own type of units by combining chasis with addons-	Structures can be updated with turret defenses-	The three factions are very unqiue and attractive to try out-	Story has an interesting premise that keeps you engaged initially-	You can reshape the terrain and build tunnels/bridges as part of your strategy-	You always have a main base and a mission base-	Music is better than in Earth 2140-	360 degrees rotation and zooming on the game screen-	Feels like a “deeper” Command&Conquer initially-	Game mechanics are really well done (probably the best part of the game)-	Each unit has a depleteable ammo stack and needs to be supplied with more ammo-	The research tree is quite impressive-	Game can be played with air ,ground and tunnel fights-	There is a transport vehicle that moves units from main base to mission base-	Day/Night cycle and weather system-	Each faction has unique superweapons-	You can queue unlimited units/research and resources will be consumed gradually for them-	Units can be assigned scripts-	Lost souls has an actual chronological story-	The concepts were unique and breathtaking for its genre and quite ahead of their time-	The news reports,build up slowly but they give a sense of danger regarding Earth’s fate-	Buildings leave debris after you destroy them-	Earth progressively decays with the advancement of the campaign-	Weather affects units and buildingsCONS:-	It has not aged well at all, the graphics being really washed down-	Tutorials are very tedious and not straightforward-	The path finding is horrible-	The voice overs are annoying and too cheesy-	The story becomes forgetful because too many pointless gather x minerals missions-	Learning curve is too steep-	Missions seem too hard even on Easy difficulty-	Music is too repetitive-	Too many missions are gather missions (especially with ED)-	The unit limit seemed small-	Figuring what to do is too hard. I had no idea what to do half of the time I played-	Game play feels too slow and sluggish-	The ammo sluppying while interesting,it gets boring really fast-	To me the AI seemed too hard because of the steep learning curve.-	No real sense of achievement after completing several missions-	Each mission is a big time sink and becomes boring-	Your army can be immediately killed if it is facing some type of enemies-	The fighting targeting is horrible because of the path finding-	Your units will keep being hit and move around to position themselves before attacking-	There is a lights on/off on buildings and units which seems completely pointless-	The maps are too big and annoying to navigate through-	The minimap layout is extremly horrible,rotation makes even more confusing-	The minimap is basically uselss,as it doesn’t help you at all during missions-	The multiplayer is obviously dead and its  game modes are severely outdated-	The story fails to deliver in the end-	The cinematics are pointless and too cheesy. They don’t add any value to the story-	Game feeling bounces from really like it or really hate it too frequently-	The expansion moon project  worse than the original game in most aspects : especially story -	The terrain and movement on the terrain is agonizing to look at and wait upon-	Unit selection is faulty when you have a lot of units on screen-	The game feels too often like a chore than actual fun-	Missions rarely vary from gather resource/destroy enemy base/escort transporters-	The fighting music is too irritating and repetitive-       The ending for each faction felt anticlimactic and non emotional.-	Last impression was that game missions take too long and don’t have enough to keep you wanting to come back	Overall,I cannot say that I would recommend this trilogy. It has its PROS but it also has too many CONS for me to really like it. You can make your own decision, but I for one,really forced myself to play and experience as much as possible from this game.

												Not a game for my taste. I love strategy games but this is just something i don not like. Probably because I come from more modern strategy games.			"

												Couldn't get the game to load properaly.   When I finaly got it to load it kept freezing up, perhaps my computer is simply to new to play this game or perhaps there is some small setting still not correct but reguardless it is bad programming.   Disapointing becouse I used to like the game I had from the series on disk way back when.			"

												Biggest issue – the game barley runs on windows 7 unless alot of effort is put into getting it to work, so don’t bother buying it. If you can get it working there’s no options, no tutorial and it gives you no idea what you’re doing or anything. The graphics setting are out of the game but are exceptionally buggy (I have two monitors and it defaulted me to 640x864 (not a typo) when one is 1360x760 and the other is 1920x1080, by turning the 1360x760 one off, it defaulted to 640x864 as well) After messing in config files for 30 mins I got it to work at 1080p (which is one of the settings, it just doesn’t save it when u start the game) and starting the game showed me a 360p video (stretched so looked ugly as hell) an a menu that looked just as bad, with no options for mouse settings, key bindings or anything, the game barley works and should not be bought.Finally getting it working to a reasonable standard and find that there’s no tutorial, and the game gives me no idea what to do, the UI is clunky and the mouse sensitivity is WAY too high with no way to change it, brilliant start...So far I've managed to start a game with a bot but with no instructions and only 5 buildings to choose from, I have to question the other reviews, as there is no way that this can be an 'amazing rts' to quote one of them.If I’m missing something, please tell me, as I have no idea what I'm doing and a tutorial or guide would be nice. so would a graphics setting where the ground has a higher resolution that minecraft.

												I was hoping for a slightly more intelligent game than the Command & Conquer series.  They captured the look but that is all.  Earth 2150 is a game that took me an hour plus Google searching in order to even figure out how to mine and make money for my base.  Let's be honest.. building♥♥♥♥♥♥is what your going to do the most in an RTS and this game makes it 100% NOT FUN.Don't get me wrong I can see where there was a lot of good potential in here.  A lot of things from my RTS wish list in theory were here but in practice it just wasnt' fun.  It was confusing and frustrating.			"

												I thought I found a great deal. Wish I'd read the reviews. This game keeps crashing. I've tried several fixes, but nothing works. After two hours of frustrating troubleshooting, I'm giving up. Also the game looks like it was make for the Commodore 64. Very disapointing. How do I get a refund? I want to play an RTS, but now I'm apprehencious to make any more purchases. My computer isn't that great, but it runs LoL and Path of Exile just fine. I strongly reccomend you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Even if you do get it to run, it wouldn't be worth it. I'll be reading the reviews more carefully from now on. Right after I uninstall this buggy peice of ancient garbage from my hard drive. Seriously though, how do I get a refund?			"

												I got sucked into this game by some comments I read ages ago.... I am glad this game costed only $2 at the time, I would have been very disappointed.... i didn't play it long enough to test the combat system and whatnot as the sound and graphics didn't pass my expectations.... 0/10 I'm sorry guys.... I should probably have endured and played it anyway....but if it doesn't look and feel good, I can't play it!!			"

												An amazing game that has lasted generations. Watch the Earth 2160 video and see how spot on the developers were at guestimating Syria and Iraq wars. The video was made far before the wars existed. A nuclear war has occured between the Machine Run United Civilized States, and the Eurasian Dynasty in the Arctic of Earth. Thus, the axis of the planet is knocked off balance, and ten years go by as the planet goes from nuclear ice age to volcanicmolten magma as it falls into the sun.Try UCS first, easy and quick to build bases, build a headquarters and set weapons to auto upgrade. num lock pauses the game, and num pad enter rotates buildings. Build a harvester and left click on a shining light resource, then left click on your refinery. Don't try destroy structures with weather too soon, the weather is highly destructive. One of my favourites, Earth 2150 is by far amazing, nuclear explosions impressive, and the editor is rather easy to use after an hour of exploring its' functions.Excellent work steam for brining back a classic.-MardonisMKII-			"

												I am on mac osx. wine crashes when loading the very first level on the moon project...I was able to play the other earth 2150, i think was the moon or something. it starts out underground then you move up to the surface.i find it annoying that i am unable to click on the mini map to move the camera to that location. another annoying thing is that i select a unit through the selector menu, but i am not able to double click its avator to move the camera to that selected unit. pressing space bar will move the camera to a battle, but will not move to that selected unit.i am not going to email support about my problem because i am lazy right now and playing one handed with a triple patty burger in my other hand.
