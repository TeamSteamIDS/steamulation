												When I bought the deluxe edition for AS-2, I was paying more not only because I loved the previous games in the franchise, but because I loved what potential AS-1 had presented us with, especially considering the many great mods avalible for the original.  But more than that, I was buying the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.Needless to say, I haven't been impressed.  In fact, my experience with AS2 has been beyond disappointment.  Given the time from the early beta stage to now, and including the push-back of the release date multiple times, I've found that this game has not only been a waste in terms of what potential it had, but you are literally paying for a $34.00 overhaul patch by buying this game.The biggest improvements since AS-1 have been:1.  Multiplayer, which lags often, and depends on who is better at storming a place with infantry and light vehicles.  Tanks are, very rarely fielded.  The gameplay is repetitive, and balance issues come and go.2.  The Super-Pershing and a few tank models.  Yeah, they look a little more ""smooth,"" but then you can take a peek at everything else.  Everything else is literally recycled from the previous game.3.  Multi-core support.  I haven't noticed a difference.The things I'd thought I was going to see:1.  A little bit of variety in the infantry.  Yeah, they don't even have new models or textures.  It's the exact same thing from the previous title, rehashed a bit for a few more ""Breeds,"" which you can make by simply opening the editor and reassigning a few traits, weapons, and items.  There are a few more voices thrown in for the American and English soldiers, but there is still plentiful cut-and-paste from the previous game.  Oh, and the voice acting is horrific for the most-part.2.  Better textures.  The dirt looks beautiful.  A few tanks look better.  But, for everything else, it all is recycled from the last game.  The buildings aren't different.  The uniforms aren't different.  The mass majority of vehicles aren't different.3.  Better gameplay.  Yeah, no.  In fact, they took away the feature where you could unload your guns.  The AI is a little more ""Cover-seeking,"" so they are no longer inherently stupid.  However, you still have to pack up millions of bullets so they can fend for themselves without running dry.4.  Differences between faction weapons.  I'll admit, I was expecting more realistic performance out of the guns for each faction.  But, all rifles are pretty much the same, the Thompson isn't much different from an MP-40, the Grease-Gun is treated like a 9-mm, and overall, you're just going to go for an MG-42 if you want rate of fire; the browning if you want less reloading; or the BAR/FG-42 if you want less unloading.  There isn't much of an accuracy or damage difference.  Line up soldiers with every faction's rifle; they fire and reload at the exact, same times, with the exception of the enfield rifleman.  There should be a difference.  The action on a Mosin is completely different from a 98' or a Springfield.5.  Models and textures.  Yeah, about 10 vehicles look better.  But the mass majority of the others still look copy/paste.  If I wanted to copy/paste vehicles, I'd make a mod for that.Can I say I recommend this game?  No.  For $34.00, hell no.  It's nowhere near being worth that kind of money, and I'm losing to faith to tell myself that ""yeah, it'll improve as they get closer to the full release.""  It's been in Early Access for quite some time now.  Before that, there was beta.  They have had the time to improve the game.  Yet, I have only seen them trying to get it into a playable state every few weeks, while leaving us high and dry in every other aspect.  Maybe if it were $10.00 DLC for AS1, it'd be worth it.  But as a standalone game, let alone a Sequel, it's not just a cheap re-release with nothing new to offer, but it's a complete waste of money.I've already learned from one other game that pulled the same ""Beta limited-content"" trick.  ArmA 3.  Overall, that game was a complete disappointment.  There was very little content added into the beta, there was very little content added into the main game, and countless patches treated the post-final release like it was (and still is) in the early-access stage.  AS2 is mirroring this tactic, and foreshadows disappointment.I have a feeling they're going to just decide to ""leave it to the modders,"" as ArmA 3 did, and while mods are often well done, they are not only far from uniform in quality and not designed by a common party, but that's a cheap way of copping-out of extensive work.  Work that this game seriously needs if it is to hold the number ""2"" after Assault Squad.A better name for this would be ""Assault Squad: MEGAPATCH.""  If you feel like disagreeing, then pull up the AS1 editor and the AS2 editor.  Put down one of every model.  Test the game, see what happens; you'll learn that I'm right, because this is exactly how I tested it.  I'm not making these claims without evidence.  There is no difference between these games except for the mulitplayer.Do keep in mind; this review is for a $34.00 product.  It is intended to reflect and aid you, the viewer, in determining whether or not you will ""get what you pay for.""  The answer to that is no, ""No, you won't.""I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE FINAL RELEASE PROVES MY FEARS TO BE WRONG, AND RENDERS THIS REVIEW TO BE OUTDATED.  SHOULD THAT BE THE CASE, I WILL GLADLY CHANGE MY REVIEW AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE GAME.  SHOULD MY FEAR THAT THIS GAME OFFERS NO ""CHANGE"" WORTHY OF A SEQUEL BE CONFIRMED AT FINAL RELEASE, I WILL NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH DIGITAL-MIND-SOFT.Do know; I won't be alone in that regard.[July 19, 2014] UPDATE!Ok; so since the game's release, there has been little to nothing improved upon since I had written this review.  The ""priority"" for the team has only been multiplayer.  There has been no increase in content.  There has been no more bang for the buck.  Digital-Mind-Soft has charged their community for a mere patch, and has done nothing to back the quality of the game except tamper with multiplayer mechanics, and not even to the extent that significantly alters gameplay in any way.Do you have money to waste, and want to support a dishonest development project?  Then don't spend money.  Please.Stop giving companies the motivation to screw over their customers and to default on their promises.  It's been months, and there aren't even any new ""Humanskins"" in the game.  Let me say right now:  It takes 10 MINUTES OR LESS TO CREATE A NEW ""SKIN"" USING PAINT.NET.With the time they've taken to add ""boards"" to Multiplayer, I could have created the entire Italian Army with a modeling program; sadly, that's 3DS-MAX, a program that the 2014 edition of, costs upwards of $3,400 to own.[August 26 2014] UPDATE!Playing through the editor a bit, one of the first things I checked were the models.  What can I say about them?  Three new models; all Crusader Tanks.  The model has been significantly improved, with the Crusader looking more streamlined and smooth than before.  It looks good.  Not only that, but there are 2 more Crusaders; a 40mm Anti-Air crusader, and a 20mm Anti-Air crusader.  These, too, look good.  But nonetheless, Japanese vehicles still look as though they are made out of cardboard, and there haven't been any other model updates added.Most importantly, the soldiers still have the same skins as in the previous title; the lack of effort in this category is appaling.  Do bare in mind; Assault Squad was a 2009 game.  This means that the soldier's skins are 5 Years old.  You can learn to create professional 3D models in half that time.  Given that this much time has progressed, one would and should expect more from a company charging full-price for a ""patchwork"" game.			"

												Men of war Assault squad 2 is the sequel to the well received Assault Squad. Even with this being a sequel there are still major and blatant problems with this game.  1st. Lack of new content.  The 1st problem with this game is that there isn't very much new content. For being a sequel you would think there would be. It's more of an over all update to the 1st game. The only thing that the 2nd game added is an updated a game with better optimization, better UI, graphics, sound, and Steam features. There is 15 ""New"" single player ""skirmishes"", plus 25 reworked old ones from the original Assault Squad. Making 40 single player missions. Which isn't very much, especially being 25 old one. Which let me remind you that is ""3"", ""3"" new Missions for each Nations.   Most of the new content that is been added as been added in patches. That were a lot of its coming from. Like health bar, skins, models, sounds, Units and new voices.  2nd. AI  One of the thing you will ran across it the Stupid AI both on the enemies side and your Units. You will be doing a lot of micromanagement, do to the stupidity of your units. A good example would be your medics not picking up your dead men unless told to do so! It's not uncommon to get focus on one part of the battlefield only to come back and see 4-5 men on the ground and your medic sitting there. Making you to manually to him to get each one.   Amour showing their♥♥♥♥♥and side to the enemy or just refusing to turn their front to the enemy. If you know anything about tanks or amour, you would know that the thickest amour is in the front. Well someone didn't tell your troops. Because 1 too many time have I had to take over control of a tank or Amour car and position it the right way.  Sniper will sit there a lot even though they have clear shot on enemy troops. So many times I've had to click on enemy troops to get my snipers to pick off targets. AT (Anti Tank) troops will ran across an open battlefield to shot a tank point blank range. When  I've be able to take control and do from half of the Range. I've literally watch Panzerschreck troops ran straight to a tank and get killed, and if that is no enough a lot of the times, they will just stare at it from a far while it kills all his comrades! Even better is when they're right next to it, get killed, and didn't even fire a shot.   With this Friendly and enemy troops won't even fire at one another even when theres a tank troop right on the other side of the dead tank. They will both sit there.   Enemy troops will hide and sit there when to many casualties are taken, instead of running, and regrouping. You are now force to ran to the 1 or 2 enemy solders and completely annihilate them with a full squad. If not? You can ignore them and continue your advance to the next objective!  So let me set this up for you. The enemy is pushing on one side of the map hard, with Infantry, Tanks, and an armored car. You get caught up in this side of the map tiring to stop this advance. You are slugging it out knocking out tanks and shooting down Infantry, making sure your troops are fighting right, and micromanagement them so do not lose this side of the battlefield. Making sure your Panzerschreck troops are firing (Or even just taking control your self...) medics are get the dying up, and that your troops are picking the right targets.   Only to win that fight, go to look at the other side of the battlefield and see that your man have been annihilate because your medic didn't pick up the dead, your AT troops sat there, etc... This is a very small list of some the stupid this that the AI does. I could go on picking out all the stupid drown right unbelievable things the AI will do. You literally need to micromanagement most if not all your troops.  3rd. A lack of total content.  Lest be honest here. It is not skirmish, these are single player Missions/campaigns. If you played a RTS before you most likely played one with a skirmish mode which is AI vs you and Ally AI on a map with some object or just to kill the other side. This is a major problem do to the fact that those 40 missions get old fast. Since 1st 25 of then are old one from AS1, 2nd after you complete them there isn't any thing to do after but to replay them over and over again. And most of the missions are just a Assault on key objective over and over again just on a different map. Some of the New missions are defensive mission or Sniper missions.   If you wanted new content you're ♥♥♥♥ed. There is 2 way to go. Go to the work shop and download user made missions or learn to use the Editor. Which is ridiculous!  1st The editor isn't easy enough for the average player to make new content for themselves. It isn't easy enough to even to make simple battles, let a lone missions. There isn't any Tutorials to help you except for one guy on YouTube, but he doesn't tell enough for how to make a mission or even a good battle. All these Epic battles on YouTube are just some guy placing random Units on each side, and having then ball up in  an orgy in middle of the map and just kill. As if they weren't even train as soldiers. Taking no cover, nothing just kill, kill, kill. I hear from the New patch that just came out, that DLC is on the way which in true is another sad joke, because now they're going to sell you new content that should of been in the game in the 1st place. IMHO they need to make a FREE DLC, that adds 10 new missions for each faction, then I can walk a way content. Because even with that, that still wouldn't be enough for a game that $35. Do to the fact that it has very low replay value. In my honest opinion they really should of been 25- 30 new mission and the 25 old ones as Thank you to the fans. Then I could of walk away happy, but still disappointed in no Real skirmish mode.  When it comes to the DLC, most likely it will be a couple of new missions, and a Couple of new multiplayer maps. Which should of been in the in the 1st place. 5 missions for $5 which is a such a bad joke it's unbelievable. What they need to do is Add new Nations, with Missions and New units equipment, etc. Like Italy, which was talked about on the Steam Community Hub forums, and is a great Idea. Why not do a Axis minors pack with Hungary and Romania , or even a Allies Minor pack? Poland would be a Great one too, or even France. With this then you can do Missions pack with 20-30 or so missions. Or even just expansion to the already existing nations, with New units, equipment, missions, etc.  With all of this, It seems like this game was made for multiplayer, yet the multiplayer is dead. Yet It was the same way with AS1. The most I've seen is about 8-10 lobbies at prime times. Even if you were to play multiplayer, you would most likely get your♥♥♥♥♥kick by a veteran of the games Anyway.   4th. The verdict  The problem is that they made this really great RTS, (one of the best I've played) but doesn't have any content in it. Out of all the RTS games I've played, this one has the lest amount of content. And I've played them all, I've played Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, Empire Earth, Total War, Star Wars Empire At War, Dawn of War, World In Conflict, StarCraft, and many more I can't think of right now. The Biggest problem is that I feel that they just made the tools for you make your own content. As if they made AI, the Units, UI, etc, and just sold you the tools to make your own game, and made a some missions as examples. Would I recommend this game? I would say No. Because even though it's a great game, with the lack of content and the Good but over just an update to the 1st AS there isn't much here. It being 6 month since release, they could still save this game, with a FREE DLC Mission pack, ( With more then just 1 missions for each Nations!!!!) and some new Nations DLCs. But the big problem will still be the replay value, do to no real skirmish mode. "

Early Access Review
								Since I have been lucky enough to acquire early acess to the Beta of it and have logged over 200 hours on the 1st Assault Squad I figure ive earned some right to comment on this upcoming release. I have to say that I am having very few graphical issues, only one instance where i can remember a serious shader error but it was easily fixed by minimizing the game and re opening it. The graphics do look very nice and there are several small details i appreciate like the ejecting shell and the smoke from the breech of the cannon and other small things that added to the whole. The gameplay is just as good as the first Assault Squad and ive played 3 matches so far and 2 of them had good frame rates and all while one was bad but hey 2:3 isnt to bad especially for pre-release. There is still the fun 3rd person mode and all the other things that make men of war the amazing RTS it is. I would certinly reccomend this game to any fan of the men of war series and really to anyone who enjoys RTS's or stratagy games in general.			"

												While the difference in this game compared to The previous assault squad is minimal, there are a few key differences that does improve the game. The graphics and animations have been slightly improved along with a few minor unit improvements.The one big reason I purchased this game is due to the fact that there is now the steam workshop added for the game, there are a lot of decent mods and maps/missions that make the game enjoyable if you dont fancy multiplayer. I cant comment too much on multiplayer as I never got into it.Overall though the game can be enjoyable if you liked previous verisons of the game or are a fan of RTS WW2 games.			"

												Edit, while the out of sync error has been corrected, I still feel the game is too lacking to deserve a positive review. I'm an avid fan of the Men of War series, Assault Squad 1 being my most played, I feel I've gotten my worth of single player content out of it but when it comes to multiplayer, it simply does not cut it, the ""Out of Sync"" error has been going on for far too long and for this, I cannot recommend it until it is fixed. Unless you plan of doing single player only. (Trust me, there's plenty of mods and missions to make it worth it in at least that regard.)Another thing that should be mentioned is the missions are pretty much copies of each other, for the most part, the mission concept is the same for all nations.

												It is only when you watch one GI in a jeep stare at another, it's metalwork pinging from the sounds of .50 cals, the engine block busted and on fire, the jeep itself totally surrounded by German soldiers, only for seconds later both of them to casually get out of the jeep, on fire, and run screaming from it into the street only to fall dead on the sidewalk that you will realize that this game is possibly the most insane piece of programming ever put to sale.You will also realize however that its god damn brillant.

												pros:-very good infantry combat-the best tank combat in an rts game ever-rewards your strategic planning/flanks with letting your enemy be demolished by said strategic actions-overall quite active playerbase. (don't except 100k people it's a ww2 rts)-exceptional graphics. especially buildings/nature/vehicles-good guides/tutorials (they are in the main menu)-all infantry have their own names and inventory. so do tanks. infantry can run out of ammo as well as tanks can run out of fuel-live out your fantasies as a ww2 major-up to 8v8. a total of 16 players. prepare for ultimate lag while playing with 15 other people.-LOTS of mods-very very fun with friends-very well optimized. can run on a potatocons:-1/4 of the playerbase actually plays on potatos-when someone has bad performance, ping/bad computer, everyone suffers with a VERY laggy game-♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting that i always turn off-infantry animations are not as polished as games like CoH2-sort of steep learning curve. if you're not new to rts games and are coming from something like coh, you will get used to it within 10~ hours of playtime-if you are completely new to rts games prepare to hate the game for your first 30 hours-LAGGGGG(i recommend to kick people with ping higher than an average of 300 and have less than two performance bars. If they have full red bars boot them immediatelybut besides all of that, it's The best WW2 RTS one could ever play Men of War: Assault Squad 2 (specifically RobZ mod) does things most other rts games don't do.It throws balance out the ♥♥♥♥ing window and makes it historically accurate.  Tank combat is the best I've seen in any RTS games. (IT EVEN FACTORS IN ANGLING WOWWWW). Things like supporting your tanks with infantry and flanking play very important roles. Moreso than games like CoH2. Infantry firefights can be over in an instant, or take a looong while till anyone starts dying. It depends on how you use cover.Everything also feels right.MG-42s cut down infantry.Jumbo Shermans take 88mm no problem.KV-2 blows off enemy turrets like a boss.This game requires a lot of micro, however with common sense you'll be just fine. Before you make a risky move, ask yourself this:If I do this in real life, will myself, my vehicle, or my men be blown to bits?If yes, take another aproach to your conundrum.Anyway, if you like hardcore RTS games then this will be amazing for you. tl;dr best ww2 rts ever.

												After a year I think it's time for me to write a review about this game, what to say really? how the mighty have fallen one could say from the excellent Assault Squad 1 in 2011 to this. I'm just gonna list the changes that weren't in AS1 and the things left unresolved.Pros:-Steam integration and Steam workshop-New player logs and info tracking-New skirmishes and new types of skirmish-Camo changes according to the season of the battle is taking place in-8-10 new online maps-Auto ammo resupply Cons and this is gonna be a long list:-Horrible optimization and performance issues-Bollocked up netcode-If there's one player with a bad PC everyone lags-AI still bollocked up-New multiplayer maps are half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥unfit for competitive play-Terrible voice acting-Paid for replay and bots DLC-No actual gameplay improvement or changes from AS1-One new unit for UK and Germany-Rehashed maps from AS1-No R6 map pack integration-Suffered from a prolonged period of OOS that made the game broken and unplayable online and still don't know if it's truly resolved?-Extreme Assault Zones-Needless ""units locked by level""-Decreased gun ranges-Did I say lag? well it should be here twice -Balancing issues-Some units are useless-Infantry models still look the same The developers actions against the community in the past few days were the last straw for me, banning on the forums for speaking or complaining against the game, censoring my friend strat's preview videos of Call to Arms.I had faith and patience in this studio but I lost both, and no longer looking forward for any new releases by them, Assault Squad 1 was the big dog's biscuit, I had over 1k hours of gameplay on steam and over 1.5k on gameranger.Truly breaks my heart to see its sequel in this state like there were no love or effort put into its creation.

												Edit #2: Review update: 05/29/2015Sadly no improvment for this game: OOS (out of sync) since the last major update alongside with constant freezes in MP which DMS can not fix resulted in a more or less complet dead game. Most players have already shelfved it or moved over to BoE although it has the old MoW look but at leas ti runs smooth. Edit: Review update: 11/19/2014More than half a year later DMS managed somehow to improve the performance marginally. 2vs2 is now possible but with more players you still face lag and drops. 4vs4 is still unplayable and the long time ago promised 8vs8 has never been delivered. Gameplaywise it is the still the same arcadish spam and clickfest on tiny maps  although the dedicated community has made a lot of suggestions how to improve it at least a bit. So far DMS decided not to listen to the community and treat the rest of its loyal fan base with ignorance. Slightest critisism result in bans and locked threads. Rumors say DMS treats its employees in a similar way, would at least explain why they fail to fix their game. DMS also has decided to sell the replay feature as paied DLC as it is ""new"" for them while it is for  other games an included  basic feature. So far  all arguments form the old review are sadly still vaild.If you really look for a WW 2 themed game, grap CoH. It runs better , it looks better and it is just a bit more arcadish than AS 2. If you look for a realistic WW 2 go for Graviteam Tactics or the good old Blitzkrieg. In the end AS 2 is not even worth the 5 bugs when it is on sale especially with DMS's questionable behaviour._______________________________________________________________________________-Review 6/11/2014As a long time player and supporter of DMS and the Mow series, I sadly have to say that  AS 2 is a big fail at its current state. The game has a lots of serious issues and it looks like  that DMS is not willing to fix their game or they  just can not.It seems AS 2 is more  a desperate attempt by DMS to grap some players form its rivial COH  and milk a bit the small loyal players with the result that the series was dumped down pretty hard.AS 2 is in general a  copie of AS 1(same units same models) with  the diffrence that AS 1 works. The game engine has been updated so the game looks a bit more polished than AS 1 but now  it tends to lag as hell. Currently it is not even  possible to play 2vs2 lag free or without freezes. Matches with higher playercount (4vs4 max!) are more or less impossible as the players drop like flies due to heavy lag caused by the poor net code and/or engine. Besides the technical issues the gameplay suffers also a lot from some designe decisions. In AS 1 it was possible to have a nice tank fight or the chance to flank your enemy. This does not work in AS 2 due to tiny maps and ridiculus ranges for tanks. The current gameplay is only focused on spamming wave after wave of infantry. Tanks or emplacements like at guns are not really needed. The entire gameplay feels artificially  pressed in tiny maps  to create a CoH feeling. In additon DMS has also forgotten or did not want to fix existing problems like the strange pathfinding of  the units or the overcomplicated resupply system.DMS has also introduced an unlock system for new players to getting them used to the units . Sadly this creates more fustration as locked units for all factions seem to have been picked randomly and creates very unfair games especially in matchmaking. But in general this  does not matter as the Matchmaking system does not work properly as well. Tutorials, or a real Skirmish (not the repetitiv SP Missions which they call Skirmish) would have been more helpful for newcomers as the game still explains nothing. It is even hard to say how many people play the game as there is no lobby anymore, only the steamchat which is pretty empty. Also the server browser is bugged as it only shows max 50 servers, most of them skirmish servers so not sure how many try to play MP.DMS had a lot of time to get their act together. Closed beta for CtA backers (what i did), open beta, delay of the release as the game did not run but was surprisingly  ready for preordering, another dealy of the release and the unannouced move to Early Access without any compensation and several post release patches  should have been enough time to create a game  which offers a kind of enjoyment. The only good thing is the steamworkshop where really dedicated and talented modders can present their creations.As for now the game can not be recommanded, even it would be on a steam sale.			"

More than 1000 hours! That should be enough as a proof of Love.Pro: very many ways in the editor. Yes builds itself your own small or large Scenario.With the right mods you have a huge selection of Units: for example: Hungary, Romania, Italy, etc.Plays orginal faithful models of Tanks. Uniforms, Faces, Names, Weapons , Sounds, Textures  and Inventory and more can be adapted to your own choice.Make your own maps / mods and upload them.The community is great and nice.

												Would be one of the best WW2 RTS games ever created. BUT... ..there is a known, unfixable (so far) fault, a fault since release last year, a fault that has taken nearly 12 months to still not fix, a fault that the dev/devs claim to be working on, a fault that crashes multiplayer games, a fault that they did not bother to fix as they were busy creating DLC to get more money, About 50% of games (or more) will crash after a random amount of time.  They say to switch off Steam Overlay, we did, it makes no difference. Plus why should we switch off Steam Overlay, I thought it was a requirement for a Steam game to be compatible with Steam overlay. They said not to play with any mods, We did, we removed all mods, it still crashes.This is not just me, please google 'Men of War Assault Squad 2 Out of Sync errors' and see the rage for yourself. Do not bother buying unless you like wasting 2 hours of your life at a time just to get a frozen screen or error and crash. Game in it's current state is not worth playing even if it was free.			"

												I have been a Assualt Squad junkie since the day the newborn child was bought from you. I cannot guess how many hours I have played as well as my older son who kicks my butt every time.However, I have the Modern AS, but Men of War is by far my favorite and most peoples from what I see in the forum. Wouldnt it be prudent to constanly release updated missions for this game, like every quarter or something? I know I would buy them all and am sure most of your dedicated followers would too. However I again cannot thank you for this unbelievable experience you created that has thrilled me all these many years.Cheers, Tom.			"

												Men of War Out of Sync Squad 2I honestly never thought I would be giving a men of war game a bad review, but the state of this game is absolutely pathetic. I have been following this series since the original MoW. I have poured over 1200 hours in the orginal game, MoW assault squad1, and this game as well. I have played almost every mission, fought on every multiplayer mode, and have enjoyed both multiplayer and singleplayer modifications. However I can honestly say that this game in the series is a disgrace. It's been over a year since release and yet in every single game I have played in the past few days online I have or had one of my teammates/enemies drop because of out of sync issues. This game should have never been released and instead the already built upon multiplayer system of AS1 should have been expanded into steam instead of milking out money from the followers of this series by releasing this garbage. I hope that the developers find it in their time to salvage whats left of this broken game and it's disheartened community instead of releasing more DLC's or call to arms. However looking back at the past year and seeing the lack of stability I highly doubt that the multiplayer will be in any working condition anytime soon. If you are interested in this game do not buy it, wait until you hear word about the multiplayer being in a stable condition or try out the original MoW as it has a lot of fun singleplayer content through mods and its orginal missions.

												Good game, but poor development team.Another one of those games that seems to fall behind the category of potential ruined by a developer. These guys are very loose in their communication, and their responses on their forums tend to be unprofessional and hostile towards criticism. There appears to be no plan, and they just sort of wing whatever they want into the game. Which is unfortunate, because this is actually an entertaining RTS game.The straw that broke the camel's back for me was they put AI (bots) for multiplayer skirmishes behind a paywall DLC. That is absolutely absurd, and I believe goes on record as the first RTS game to EVER do that in the history of RTS games. AI skirmishes is something that practically every RTS game offers, I mean Starcraft 1 and the first Command & Conquer had AI skirmishes in the base game. This game did not, and then they finally add it, BEHIND a paywall. Absolutely absurd.An official developer's response on the matter:""if you do not want it don't buy it.""Well firstly Mr Smarty Pants, I do want it; good job reading the OP's post, because we are ticked because we do want it, and you decided to paywall a basic feature. However I won't buy it with that unprofessional attitude. Since my money isn't something you seem to want, then I will keep it to invest in a better product. I am going to say that I am pretty appalled by this move, this is honestly the first RTS I seen put AI skirmishes behind a paywall. You should really be ashamed of yourselves.What is gaming coming to when basic features are put behind paywalls? What next, will I have to pay for access to graphics options too? If they decide to rectify this then I will flop this review, otherwise no. Sorry MoW, I like this series, but this just blew your standing with me and a lot of others.			"

I waited more than one year before reviewing this game, as a sign of respect for its developers and to try write a complete and honest review.  Now I think I gave them enough time to fix their game and to prove they care about their costumers, and I'am sorry but they failed...What to say ?  AS2 and its developers for me in 3 words ?  .. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !On AS1 I had lot of hours of fun, even if to be sincere 95% of my hours on AS1 were spent with the German Soldiers Mod, a realism mod, so I give credits to DMS for making the basic game (wich is a modified version of the originall MoW by Best Way) but if was not for Blubork's GSM and all the MoW modders, I'am not sure about how many hours I could have on AS1.So in general from MOW to AS1 for me nothing big changed (not that other MOW titles brought bigger changes) if not improved graphic and other little details, main improvements arrived thanks to the evolving of the German Soldiers Mod and other mods, but all in all I was happy with the AS1 platform, they even released free updates with new models, and from time to time I could have fun with the vanilla game too, even if nothing serious.Main problems of AS1 vanilla for me were the artificial weapon datas and in general the lack of realism, not that MoW was realistic, for example regarding ranges AS1 was a step forward, but with AS1 in my opinion the gameplay went even more fast paced and more CoH oriented. I always disagreed with the payback mechanic introduced by DMS, I find that rewarding a player for wasting units doesn't fit the Real-Time-STRATEGY genre, to help new players you need to make in game tutorials (still absent in AS2).So when AS2 was announced I went on AS2 forum and asked personally to devs if AS2 was going to be a more realism oriented game, not a sim, just more realistic, and they put there the fact that they were going to implement realistic weapon datas, I also asked them if they were planning to implement a territory mode like I suggested in the past and again they answered me that something was coming to satisfy this suggestion too.So as I'am a positive person and I like to help who deserve it, I was super happy and I decided to help in the funding of their future CTA title too, even if I was not really interested in a post WWII era MoW.Then the big day to try AS2 arrived......and this sadly was my first reaction after trying it (was obviously in italian but I'll try to translate it:) )""What the ♥♥♥♥ ?? are you kidding me ?!""Yes, it can sound rude but this sincerely was my reaction when trying AS2 for the first time.Performances were terrible (but it was beta so at that time I still had hope here), improvements compared to AS1 ? little to nothing , and it not ends here....Ranges were reduced and the gameplay was damn fast paced, maps had a terrible artificial arena look and were damn small, nothing  like my suggested territory mode,  instead an extreme battle zone mode that had nothing to do with what I suggested, even the realistic weapon datas were not that realistic as the Tiger tank could ""360 non scope"" in one second with its famously and historically known SLOW turret traverse.Regarding the vanilla game a total disappointment, however the full steam implementation was a nice thing and my thought was that performances could improve as promised and once GSM was released then I could just play that and avoid the CoH like vanilla gameplay, even if having to always rely on mods to enjoy a game to be sincere is quite annoying.No less I even created an AS2 thread on the most famous Italian tech forum, I was still supporting the devs despite the problems and failed expectations.After months of waiting I realized I passed more time on the AS2 hub than in game as the game performances were terrible and the vanilla game gameplay a total rush and grenade spam that I was unable to enjoy.Again, I tried to stay positive and give my best to stay present on the AS2 hub and give suggestions, I invested my precious time there but what I discovered was just that, even with their community the Devs were doing a terrible job, threads locked, people banned, not a sign of listening to player suggestions, even Devs replying to suggestions in a quite arrogant way or over-defending their product and ""vision"" at all costs, making you feel like a♥♥♥♥♥♥and totally impotent toward the series future.I was speechless, I was no more able to recognize the devs I used to like and I helped by being backer and always preordering their products.At same time of this hard blow by AS2 devs, on the other hand, I had Arma 3 devs with their feedback tracker and a forum that is more like a virtual office, where players and devs collaborate to make a better game.And Arma series too started small and niche, for A3 they kept on the realism way so one can think they sold less compared to the more arcade AS2 that tried to follow the mainstream arcade way, but no, this is an outdated way of thinking IMO, now in 2015 you sell more if you make a quality product and you stay HONEST and HELP/ LISTEN to PEOPLE, that's what matter to make an healthy game and business, we are no more in the 20th century, I like to think that people evolved and started punishing the soulless greedy business. look at the paid mod for Skyrim, people must be heard or they revolt.Back to AS2, last but not least disappointment, that ultimately made me quit with the game in December 2014, was that basically if the AS2 vanilla game already had problems in MP, Big mods then were totally unplayable, just crashes, desync and horrible performances, mods that were able to run fine on MoW, now on AS2 years later were unplayable.The OOS issue made us crash 75% of the times in games bigger than 2v2.Basically the only thing that right now work in AS2 is the SP or MP below 2v2 (if both players have a great PC).But if you want to play SP then what's the point of getting AS2 ? yes thanks to workshop you find mods easily but for SP AS1/MOW are good enough and still have SP mods putting there new stuff for free, right now I can't find any good reason to suggest you AS2, specially with this dev behaviour toward their customers.Positive things yes, the auto resupply, veterancy and like I said workshop, but is it enough ? I let you judge on this.Luckily the MOW series is not dead, now we have Battle of Empires that is very promising and where Devs really listen to their community as well as the future Best Way game ""outfront"" on the new engine, in the hope they will not commit same DMS mistakes, like developing two games at the same time as an indie company with low budget ?! I would say maybe better to concentrate your effort to one game per time and listening to your community, or not ? AS2 in the end proved to be a mere way to fund CTA.This MoW series has an huge potential to become the best RTS ever and an awesome sandbox platform, for now to be sincere all MoW developers failed to unleash its full potential and make it a really successful game that, like Arma III in the Tactical-FPS genre, can become a milestone of its genre and make PC gamers proud of it.Let's see what the future will reserve to us MoW players. I know some things are going behind the scene that may surprise us in the future of this series,I'am not going to talk about them right now, but I'am positive :) godspeedPS: my 400+ hours are mostly beta testing GSM, all time wasted as GSM is a MP mod and it wont work on AS2 : )  (even if according to Devs and workshop there is mod support)So I even went ""light"" on this review, I could write worst, but unlike DMS I'am a gentleman.cheersHaZZarD			"

Men of War: Assauld Squad 2 Review - Rating: 8.5/10General ImpressionMen of War: Assault Squad 2 is a nice strategy game. The graphics are nice, everything looks more realistic, compared to the older Men of War games, and also the textures have been improved. The graphics have also been slightly improved from Men of War: Assault Squad. The atmosphere mostly happens in open fields, villages, cities, forests, and even other environments. The audio is pretty nice. I like the sound of the guns, tanks, etc. The music is nice, the ambient music turns into combat music well-synchronized, and it’s overall sounding nice. It sounds less patriotic than the older Men of War titles, but I guess times have changed. The voice acting is also pretty nice. The gameplay is complex, in each mission you have to accomplish some tasks, alike killing certain enemies, cleaning fields off enemies, destroying some units, reaching a point, capturing a point, holding off certain positions, etc. The story focuses on the Soviet, German, American, British and Japan forces during World War 2. The game has 6 campaign, the 6th one of them being the bonus missions. Compared to Men of War: Assault Squad, this game has brought us several types of new missions. That’s a thing I like. But a thing which I don’t like, which is pretty bad: most of the missions have been reposted from Men of War: Assault Squad. This proves that the developers might have worked more on other features, instead of new missions, which disappoints me, because new missions are always an important feature. The mission which have been reposted are also pretty repetitive. The cut scenes of the missions are also pretty nice. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. I also like the overall design of it. The controls are pretty good, except with 1 thing: the rotations’ controls of the cameras. I highly recommend you to reset them with the arrow buttons. The engines, just like in every Men of War game, are not perfect. The game has rarely crashes, and when it crashes, you obviously lose the progress of your mission. Try and save the game as often as you can, in order to avoid too much progress lose. You don't want to waste your time by restarting the mission from zero, right? The mechanics are sophisticated, being pretty nice and everything moves well-optimized. Now, I’m going to talk a little about the G.E.M. editor. Just like in every Men of War game, you have a G.E.M. editor. You can create your own battles in it. It is complex and with a various number of functions. This game has brought it more forces from the Earth, more units per each country and overall you will have more diversified fun. I can’t talk about the DLCs of this game, but a friend of mine told me that they contain missions. If you are looking for more content, I’d highly recommend you to purchase the DLCs as well. He also said they are better than the vanilla ones. This game also brings in a new implemented Steam feature, the Steam Workshop. At the workshop, you will find a lot of community-made content, including maps, missions, mods and replays. You can upload your content there, making the community happier, and you can also download content made by other users, to add more content to the game. I have tried the multiplayer, it is still alive and you should try it. There are 5 types of gameplays, a bunch of maps to choose from, and many servers/players. Overall, this is a nice strategy game which simulates the battles of the Soviet, German, American, British and Japan forces during World War 2, but however, has many reposted missions from the original Men of War: Assault Squad, which is a disappointment. Even with this disappointment, I still recommend this game if you are looking for slightly improved graphics, slightly improved AI, and the new missions available.Positive PointsNice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and nice musicFun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the 6 campaigns availableInfantry, heavy guns, batteries, cannons, vehicles, tanks, airplanes, and many other units available4 difficulties available (the heroic difficulty is new into the Men of War series)A pretty nice designed user interface, and some well-designed cut scenesSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNice DLCs, very rich Steam Workshop and a well-made multiplayer, which is still aliveNeutral PointsThe heroic difficulty should be easier, it is almost unplayableNegative PointsThe new types of missions are repetitiveThis game literally copies most of the Men of War: Assault Squad’s 1 missions, which is a big disadvantageThere are some rare crashes, like in all the Men of War games "

												This is the king of WWII RTS. The way the weapons work, the ability to take command of your troops and the attention to the details for the weapon characteristics blow games like Company of Heros out of the water. The only real failure was the early optimization (fixed since) and the graphics. The textures of the troops leaves something to be desired. I love this game and I think you will too. 9/10			"

												This is my review of Men of War: Assault Squad. I mean Assault Squad 2. Same game, really.I bought the same f**king game twice. The same missions, the same troops, the same skins, even the same animations between troops.(all riflemen have the same animation no matter the weapon, all smg, ect ect.) What little HAS been changed, isn't worth $35. Not by a long shot. Some say that what was added couldn't simply be patched into the first game. Well fine, but offer me a whole new game for that price. They didn't. It's the same f**king game. Some say that you can download a lot of mods from the Steam Workshop. Fine, but admit that the dev's chose that as the easy way out, instead of actually taking the time to make a Single. New. Mission. They expect you to pay thirty f**king five f**king dollars for an hour's worth of work done to the same f**king game. F**k you.This concludes my review of Men of War: Assault Squad. I mean Assault Squad 2.Let me amend this to also state that I am not ""Not Recommending"" this game. It is, in and of itself, a remarkable game. If you plan to buy this one, go right ahead. It is still a great game if you're a fan of the genre. But if you already own the first one, you need not bother.			"

												Men of War - Assault Squad 2,Is a bit of a strange release, because the content is almost 100% the same as Men of War - Assault Squad 1. The gameplay is the same and the only thing that changed are some weapon configurations and range settings. Everything else's basically the same.As a plus though, Men of War - Assault Squad 2 has Steam integration, something Men of War - Assault Squad 1 lacks and thus is unplayable in normal multiplayer matches due to the fact that Game Spy shut down. (You can still play multiplayer by using a program like: Hamachi, Tunggle or Game Ranger)The most important changes, however, are not with actual gameplay, but with the engine that's being used and it's probably their engine of choice for the next game: ""Call to Arms"".Final verdict:It's hard to tell if you should buy Men of War - Assault Squad 2 or the prequel Men of War - Assault Squad 1.If money is an issue, then go for Men of War - Assault Squad 1. Otherwise you should go for Men of War - Assault Squad 2, because it features Steam Workshop & match making and runs on a more modern engine tuned towards high end systems.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 suffers from being a small step forwards from the first. If you haven't played the first of the Assualt Squads I have no hesitation recommending this for purchase if you have an interest in a deep WW2 real time strategy. Particularly if you played the earlier MoW and want a bit more then you won't be disappointed.For those that haven't played any of the series MoW is an extremely deep RTS, each of your units has an inventory containing their weapons, ammo and equipment (including hat). Each of these units can also be controlled directly by you at any moment. This makes for glorious moments where you crawl a single man with TNT up behind a enemy Tiger and blow it to kingdom come, or your single tank goes on a rampage causing chaos everywhere. In addition to inventories and direct control there are a bunch of game mechanics to consider, the cover system and terrain is essential to keeping the squishy bits on the inside of your man shaped meat sacks. The ballistics and penetration mechanics are supremely important to tanks, angle your armour and more shots will bounce, shoot through buildings and your rounds will lose kinetic energy. Oh and you can destroy pretty much any structure if you fancy it.The problem arises when contemplating a step up from the first Assault Squad. At first glance it doesn't appear like there is that much of a difference, it looks and plays very much like the first one with a few interface tweaks and improved graphics. Many of the improvements over the first are ""behind the scenes"" such as improved kill count mechanics and multiplayer functionality. The major game changer is the steam integration, massively increasing the availability of content and (most of the time) the ease with which you can play it. Sure the quality of a scenario or map will vary but there are good ones out there and reviews and comments make it reasonably easy to find them. The new content is solid if a bit uninspiring, but new units and fixes are being dripfed into the game and what was a bit of a disappointing release in the beginning is getting nicely rounded out. So if you can get this at a discount then do it and check out the workshop, if you want a first time foray into the series then this is the one to get, the depth of the MoW series can not be oversold and when you get it, it is a thing of beauty. It should probably be mentioned most of my experiences are through co-op to give some kind of perspective. PvP is tense, painful, frustrating and beautifully rewarding in equal measure.Just keep stealing hats and MGs and don't mention the voice acting.			"

Early Access Review
								Assault Squad 2, the true successor to the amazing first title, is the embodiment of a true WW2 RTS. The in depth armour system and weapon mechanics are complimented by fantastic graphics that are pleasing to the eye as well as improved UI from the previous Assault squad title. Although the current beta is a bit chunky i have the utmost faith in the developers at Digital Mindsoft to continue the fantastic legacy brought by the first title. The gameplay is in-depth, the setting and units accurate, the gradual increase to the scale of warfare presented in a skirmish or Multiplayer competitive matchup is a welcome test of one’s foresight and planning as more often than not the crucial moment of victory will not come in one distinct period of the game. The ability of this game to allow a player to exploit an opponent’s flaws in defence or his ability to capitalise on his own armoured or support advantage is astounding. A player may use a series of approaches to try and obtain victory, and the games can end up insanely close as players scramble and crawl their way to victory. Nothing beats the feeling of outwitting your opponents and somehow pulling a victory out of thin air.If you seek a game that compares to company of heroes you must look elsewhere as both titles have their own distinct style of gameplay. If you want an in-depth somewhat realistic WW2 RTS with stunning gameplay, good graphics and a stellar community look no further. All elements of the game compliment your experience to make for one of the best, if not the best WW2 RTS games in today’s market, and i hope that if you choose to purchase this title, that you will enjoy it as much as i have.

								To be quite honest, I'm rather disappointed in this game for one really big reason: it's more or less the same as MoW: Assault Squad (#1).  The compaign can get quite tedius and repetitious (since several maps are repeated with different plants and weather conditions) or it's the same couple of mission sets.  While the game itself is well rounded, the developers failed to address the issues that arose in the first AS.Pros: Multiplayer, though to be honest it's not greatly improved from what I can tell.Cons: Single Player.  Really.  Save your money and just buy MoW Assault Squad.  It's cheeper and has the same maps and abiities (scratch and add a few minor things.)To give you an idea on how much they cheaped out on things, there's no real voice actors.  I first noticed it in the Russian campaign when I realized the ""commanders voice"" sounded like a 15 year old American boy.  All in all I wish I had my money back and stuck to the first AS.			"

												You know, I really tried to get into the series cause of the whole Squad mechanic (AKA the inventory and the division of the squad). And a friend of mine got this when we though Men of war: Assault Squad was a cool game with the direct actions and stuff. Bare in mind, yes I am a Fan of Company of Heroes, I love the games, even the 2nd. But I can't endorse this game because of alot of broken promise. Already this game broke my warning signs:Warning #1: the game looks exacly like the first game with a deeper post processWarning #2: the game dropped into Early Access without any announcement even after the 1 month delay it had from feburary to marchWarning #3: the missions are recycled, as in the US and the Russians first missions.After that, I simply was done with the game. I will still play the game because of mods but I really really can't recommend this game. Go buy the first one.UPDATE!:So the game is now considered v1 with some updates and patches coming, My option still stands the same...... HOWEVER, There is only one thing I will say that this game have good and that's the mods, Espcially the SirHinkels Missions which have a far better level design than the ones that comes with the game.

												As of right now, I fail to see how MOWAS2 is anything more than a full price map pack with a few updated models.I have some issues with this developer so it really doesn't surprise me,  I'll reccomend this game if/when they pull their socks up*Note, I am well aware this game is in Beta/Early Access, it still doesnt change the fact that neither the early access content or what has been advertised looks to be anything more than a few new models, some revamped maps from old games, and a few new sounds.*and for christs sake guys. Update the infantry models from 2007, and stop abusing the rating system by flagging negative reviews as abuse. DMS, you're a joke			"

												This is a re-hash of a re-hash of a re-market of a re-brand of a great game made an eternity ago called Soldiers Heroes of WW2 by a different developer who I believe hail from Ukraine.Digital Mindsoft got hold of the game assets which were in my opinion the foundations and ground work for one of the finest games of all time. They turned it into the original Men of War. Basicly a pollished version of the earlier Faces of War and SOWW2 (games had different names depending on the region/market).The original Men of War was a really really great game, down to the fact it cleaned up a few of the rough edges and packaged it into a good mix of singleplayer and multiplayer content that worked well.The potential was huge! Expansions, new maps endless possiblilties... no not from the devs - but the mod community who passionately created fantastic mods using the powerful yet simple and user-friendly game engine and included editor.Now imagine what a paid dev team working hard could create using that as a foundation. Now imagine what really happened: Assault squad (1) which was as much the same game with the added benefit of the world Assault in it. Don't forget the tweaked graphics. It's all about the screenshot baby. Roll in the dollar signs we have a winner. 90% marketing 5% game and 5% optimism.But wait... there is more!That isn't grand enough, lets widen the scope. Lets be bold and creative (the only way we know how), lets put a ""new"" version on Steam! People will part with cash for a number 2. It's proven science.Behold! MEN OF WAR: ASSAULT (on your wallet) SQUAD 2Just gotta' love a number 2.Letting the modders fix/add and create the content of ""your"" game Digital Mindsoft is all very well but don't give us the line that you don't work for free. As far as anyone can tell - you aren't working at all.			"

												Great game... If you haven't played Men Of War before.It is literally a re-port of the existing game and not worth the $30 price tag. If you have never played one of the men of war games before you will most likely enjoy it, but if you own Men Of War already; do not buy, you are wasting your money.I purchased thinking it would be upgraded with new units, new maps, new singleplayer battles, etc (because, you know, it says ""2"" and is advertised as being new) but it is exactly the same as the first game. Same units, same maps, same campaign battles, same UI, same menus, same modes, same graphics basically except a bit of a shine on it, same gameplay (for example the unit positioning hasnt been improved; its exactly the same) same bugs, etc.Practically fraud to call it ""2"" when what they should have sold it as:Men of war with minor graphic tweaks ($30 please).--------With the popularity of this review I should probably add some further thoughts (I had it refunded since but will expand on my thoughts).In my opinion the Men of War series are one of the best RTS's around for personal enjoyment, as I mostly play them on my own (not much multiplayer) and still managed to rack up a fair few hours on the first Men of War: Assault Squad. The problems with this particular one is more that I see no reason to buy it over Men of War: Assault Squad. Genuinely, there is hardly any difference.As I said, if you have never picked up a Men of War game and you like RTS games you can emerge yourself into, get deeply involved in, micro manage little details (I would even make little stories for my squads and follow them around and get sad if I lost a trooper I gave a nickname), then you will enjoy it, I think it's just not right to keep trying to sell these as new games, but the base game isn't a bad game (just get it on sale, it's not a polished AAA type of game, it has a very... Indie developer trying to go pro feel).Some notes:+ Battles are fun, and you can control each unit and each unit will interact with the map, like taking cover where you point, pick up weapons, ammo, etc.- Half the time the cover doesn't work properly and it glitches or units get stuck, etc. It can be frustrating trying to micro manage a squad to try and get them all behind cover.+Maps are large, expansive, lots of items, destructables, etc.- I've never been a fan of the reinforcement system used, on such large maps making reinforcements walk from 10,000 miles away. You can attach weapons to vehicles to tow and etc but its so much micro management that doing those tedious actions kind of takes away the fun.+ Can micromanage fun things.- Have to micromanage tedious things. Campaign:+ There is a campaign.- The voice overs. My god.- The missions are all the same basically for any faction.- Seriously, those voice overs. Just play some music and read the subtitles, you will have a better experience. NOW, obviously most of what I have mentioned is more single player based stuff. But honestly, this isn't a game I would be using to multiplayer ladder all pro style, it's something to kill some time and mess around with.So at the end of it all would I recommend it?  Yes, if you've never played it and it's on sale cheap. Otherwise, no. If it's full price, or you've played Men of War: Assault Squad before, there are just better games you could buy and spend your time on.Do I think it's a game most people will play, and keep playing continuously? No. I think the average player will probably play this for awhile, get a kick out of it for like 20-60 hours and then find it dropping off over time until it fills one of the 100+ slots occupied by a steam season sale, collect dust, until they bring out Assault Squad 3 and then you see this review all over again.

												dont let the red hand fool you, if your a fan of the first one then you will enjoy the different style missions, but as far as units, sound, and maps go this is the same game, i didnt even notice a difference in graphics, but the steam mod support just makes this game worth while to me, i give it a red hand because i dont like the company just using us for a quick money grab, but atleast the modders can still make a game out of this, if you use the right mods at once it can really just make the game fun, like the realism mod that fixes ranges for tanks and arty, really just makes you re-think everything about how you advance, and cheat mod for someone who just wants to mess around a bit, the company may have ruined the game but the steam community has made a real game out of this and i think if you really liked the first one this game given the right mods can blow you away.

Early Access Review
								I just want to say that this game is fun, but it's completely not worth supporting. The game seems to be in beta stage still even though it's fully released. It has a signficant lack of content and the makers have yet to actually add everything they have promised. It's extremelly hard to find a game, relating to how it feels like it's still a beta. It has a XP System which completely ruined the games experience, the community is way to small for something like an XP System also. There aren't to many missions for all of the factions (Which is currently at 3 factions still), they may be some what long but they are all literally the same missions for each faction showing an extreme lack of effort and laziness. The path finding from the AI can be good at most times but you will constantly find times of your AI acting like idiots (causing them to get kill and completely ruin your strategy) I've never actaully wanted a refund for a game until now, which is saying a lot because I own a good amount of COD games. I'm disapointed in the developers and hope if they ever make a game they don't ♥♥♥♥ up as crappy as they did this time.			"

												Men of War is a great game, and I can only hope the best for its future and for the moderators. This game demonstrates general realism and immersion on the battlefield; but I do have complaints. For example, the game isnt realistic enough. Some people will diagree but this game being in the genre it needs more realsim in the base vanilla game. Maybe make the spotting ranges of the units higher and make infantry's health lower. Another problem is overpowered nations. Germany as a faction dominates the multiplayer battlefield. Spending over 1000 hours in the MOW AS series is proof of these experiences. With minor moding (supported), this game goes from good to god. I must say the editor is well done by the way. I'm also happy to say that the community will support you in any trouble you stumble across. Overall, if your looking to command an army over a vast battlefield with wild possibilities and suprising turns... give this game a try.			"

												First ImpressionsDo not buy this game if you have Assault Squad 1 unless you want steam support/some new UI and some new scenarios.  Oh and some slightly better graphics, units faces still look like they are from 2005 even on max.   The core the game is still good but its exactly the same game as far as i can tell with perhaps a few minor tweaks.Overall it is a glorified update.			"

												Overall gamplay is good but worse than AS1. The lag and the inability to fix it since it's release is mindboggling. See strat29's comments.Edit: The game has been updated since early October however the update has not drastically changed the game to differentiate it enough from Assault Squad 1 (AS1). It has fixed the lag issue for the most part but it seems rather strange that the game was originally launched with such a blatant, arguably unplayable issue in the first place. There are no new factions, very few new maps, inability to play the large maps (8x8 for example) and a game that essentially replicates what AS1 does. Worth a buy? Maybe. Worth the supposed upgrade from AS1? Nope.Edit #2 (Version 3.115.0): In the last few weeks a new update and new features via a DLC were issued through steam. They've ironed out some of the issues that plagued the game since the latest series of updates but the game still has some relatively large issues that continute plague performance and multiplayer gameplay. If you're relatively new to this game and you're looking to experience multiplayer and ultimately test out your strategies, you may not have that great of a time. While many players will experience the following, it is new and casual players who will experience the following in a more frustrating fashion. Multiplayer is not ""smooth"", in fact many have complained it is essentially broken. Crashing (out of sync, random black screens, random dropping) is very common. Second, lag is an issue, period. Whether the lag issue is due to bad PC performance or latency issues, it is a problem for many. Third, multiplayer often requires you to connect with other players and form regular teams which can and is often frustrating for new and casual players (although I'm quite fine :)). A few more notes on the latest series of updates:- No 8v8.... yet?- Replay via the DLC is great but arguably a tad expensive considering what you get. Plus the replay feature does not have any control functions like pause, fast-forward, etc. Further, it is bugged. - Spectator slots are a great addition but it is also bugged and likely causes out-of-syc crashing issues.- Steam overlay is all messed up. The latest updates have rendered it useless which is a step backwards and quite surprising that it was not looked at before the release. - This company seems to think it's cool release release notes several days after an  update. I can definitely understand why new and casual players find the multiplayer aspect of this game frustrating. Not only is there a steep learning curve, it has a number of other issues which I noted. I should also note that the overall gameplay is still not better than AS1.Edit #3 (Version 3.122) as of May 23rd, 2015: This game has been updated several times since I last looked over my review of this game. I would like to note the following:- SOME Out-of-Sync in-game crashing has been fixed but it still occurs enough to delay a 2v2 tournament and was the direct cause of cancelling the 3v3 league (which I assisted in administering).  It is a MAJOR sore spot in the competitive part of the community. - Replays still crash as much as before. - I began a campaign for new maps to be implemented in a future version given this game's focus is primarily on multiplayer. I hope this is done because this game has lacked new, quality maps ever since it's release. I have no idea why this didn't cross their minds before hand... It now appears DMS may very well be including it in a future paid DLC pack, which if true, is a joke given that the maps they're reviewing are available FREE as a MOD (unfortunately too many AS2 players are ignorant of this).- Performance issues still exist (lag, PC performance). Still worse than AS1 in terms of performance. - Steam overlay is still completely broken, about a year since it's release.- Matchmaking, I finally tried it. It's been plagued with issues from day one, no end in sight. It is also not taken seriously, at all, by us in the competitive community.Edit #4 (Latest version as of July 16th, 2015): It's been almost two months since I updated this review to outline the latest version(s) so I'd like to note a few things:- Many people still play this game, albeit the singleplayer part of this game. Unfortunately this game, as all RTS games, is geared towards multiplayer. With that being said, the crashes I've noted early, among a new crash since the end of May and the out-of-sync errors that still occur have really hurt two communities: the more experienced modders and modding community and the competitive community. As of three weeks ago I stopped playing due to the sheer amount of errors in multiplayer and overall instability in the game's performance. - DMS has struggled to provide a smooth, stable multiplayer ever since it's release. I've been cautiously optimistic and hopeful but I've decided to move on generally and wish everyone good luck playing the game. Out-of-sync issues has decimated larger multiplayer games and as I've noted, the competitive side of the community. It's virtually impossibly to play consistent, stable 2v2, 3v3 and up games. With that being said, It's a game that I truly enjoyed but it's become too unstable to continue forwards.			"

Posted: August 4, 2016
												One of the finest games ever made. This is a large review of the game so go to appropriate sections if you do not wish to read the entire thing.***Brief Overview of the Game****Well there are 5 factions. On the Allies side is UK, Soviets and USA whilst on the Axis Japan and Germany.You have staple ""skirmish"" missions for each factions each with a different emphasis for example defense missions, tank only missions, stealth/sniper missions among others. However I won't go into too much detail into Singleplayer because Multiplayer is where the game shines.In Multiplayer there is no grinding to unlock certain powerful units, everything is unlocked from the start from a M20 to a King Tiger. Now you receive a certain amount of set Manpower each game which on competitive settings is 3000 base manpower plus ""payback"" which usually comes to around 800-1000mp. There is no base building or collecting resources it is a set amount per second until it reaches 3000 with extras coming through payback that is dependent upon how much MP you have already lost and how much CP you have on the field.CP (command points) is a value that every unit in the game also receives. You are limited to 100 CP on normal settings which obviously means you cannot completely overwhelm the map with inf or tanks. Heavier tanks cost more CP, so not only are they expensive in MP but they also limit your ability to field infantry to cover LOS and attack flags.***Key Features/Strengths of the Game***The physics mechanics of the game of completely unique. Unlike most RTS games which work on an arcadey system of hitpoints with certain values working well against other other values ""unit X has 10 pierce damage and 5 blunt damage"", Mowas 2 is quasi-realistic. Whilst counters in most RTS are static and predetermined (you know exactly how much damage your unit will do the enemy unit) in Mowas2 that is not necessary the case. It is very possible and does happen that a tier 1 Volkstrum Sqaud can ambush and kill a tier 4 SAS squad if it is ambushed out in the open. This is particularily prevalent in tank combat where even an 240MP Damier amoured car 2 pounder gun can penetrate the side armour of a 1250MP Che Ri or even an KT at 2400MP. Of course this requires the Damier to get to point blank range on those tanks in order destroy them and the KT and Che Ri can ""max range"" penetrate the Damier with ease at 140 range. It is this uncertainity regarding counters that adds a great dynamic to the game as not only does allow players to make comebacks if they are behind on MP by using sneaky inf to destory heavy tanks or using superior tank play yourself and killing a superior tank.Direct Control is the other great strength of this game. The game engine allows you to 3rd person mode control any unit in the game. That is, if you press left Ctrl or E you can manually take the place of the AI and take matters into your own hands. So if you feel like your MG is not doing a good enough job of mowing down an enemy sqaud you can ""DC"" the MG yourself. This is mostly applicable with tanks though (as they are your expensive purchases) as often you will know the weak spots on an enemy tank armour to aim for. ***Weaknesses of the Game***A very steep learning curve. This is not like TW where even relatively newby's can put up a good fight and find other relative newby's quickly. Even 30 hours in this game makes a huge difference in your ability. You will get beaten, and beaten badly in a lot of games. There is a lot to manage and consider in this game and you will be overwhelmed at the start. Bear in mind though the better players you play with, the faster you will improve (even if you might lose a bit more). The rewards for getting good at this game are huge though. Close, tight games on Mowas2 are like nothing else, spoken from a guy who has 1350 hours :pAlthough the game does look great on high settings, it is very poorly optimized and puts a much greater strain on your graphics card that it should do. Also if one player has poor performance in a game it can lag the game for everyone else which is very frustrating.The developers have only limited resources. Digital Mind Soft (DMS) are a limited company at this point in time and are spending much of their time working on Call to Arms Mowas2's Modern Era Sequel. It means they are limited in providing support to Mowas 2. Bugs can take time to be ironed out and balance patches take a bit of time. ***Overall Personal Summary***This series captures that perfect balance between fast paced gameplay and serious strategy. Unlike many more traditional RTS's this succeed in this game you do not need to have absurd twitch reactions (although of course they help) yet it is not a time consuming slug fest or 'grand strategy'. It is the brilliance of the engine the game physics were this game is so unique. The ability to directly control anything you own in a quasi 3rd person mode offers so much more than most RTS's. Especially when given the WW2 focus and the vast variety of tanks you can play with, it is like playing a lite version of WoT or WT except there is incredible amount more depth with combining arms of many different facets of the game - you have to simultaniously manage infantry, tanks, anti-infantry and anti tank assets. It was this game which allowed me to get into competitive gaming. Of course I would never put 1300 hours into a game if I didn't have that extra element of motivation namely competing yet still this a quite superb game and I would thoroughly recommend it to anybody.

												Finally a game about ww2 without one-sided balance. You can die for the Motherland, Fatherland, Churchill, Freedumbs or Emperor without yelling that everything enemy has is OP (japanese tanks will make you raise your eyebrows tho). Everything feels good: how tanks react, how infantry throw grenades or change weapons depending on target on their own, tanks and artillery operate at beliveable range, armor thickness and angle seems to work in realistic fashion too. However some weapons that should penetrate 160mm of armor can't kill pz4 which may be just bad luck, but is irritating for sure. Also it's always a big fanservice to me when each faction speaks on it's own language, instead of ""Kill that faschistsky♥♥♥♥♥♥for stalin comerade boris tovarichs brat comerade"" nonsense.But, and it's a big BUT (Y(__|, there's some things that really SUCK:1) it's basically same as previous game with like 5 new maps, fancier graphics and ♥♥♥♥♥ier netcode, yet costs full price and it seems that AS1 servers are closed.2)If someone in same match as you have PC FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, you will have tremendous lags too.3)Units' pathfinding is probably most infuriating thing i encountered in my life, and believe me, living in Russia you will get thing or two to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at in your lyf. Units will try to go through impassable terrain and get stuck if you wont control them like babies, infantryman, after an order to throw grenade can start doing modern dance moves and catch a bullet instead, SU-122 will agro at infantry and will get shot by Jagtiger in the♥♥♥♥♥when you're not looking, etc.4)INTERFACE. Your first couple of hours will be literally unplayable since you will have to call all the scientists in the world specializing in awful GUI to help you figure out what the hell is going on with this squad control. Also half of your keyboard is some random hotkeys that control everything from towing artillery pieces to manually jacking off your soldiers.5)Units' field of view: you will see for yourself should you decide to play this.6)ELO in a game where 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 modes exist. People just never learn that it only works in 1v1. Now after my♥♥♥♥♥finally chilled, let's get back to good shieeet again.   Unit variety: even tho as a result of applying semi-realistic characteristics to tanks and stuff some units are just too useless to call-in, amount of options is really big for each faction. Even tho, as example, for soviets you will usually get something like some infantry, dshk, zis and then if everything is good you will wait for t34/57 or get that funny howitzer-tin coffin-tank thing that's at lvl 10 or something, or t60, things that you can do with spetznaz with stolen bazooka and flamethrower guy are lewder than most kinky porn. Also when was the last time you saw flamethrowers actually burning everyhing inside of a tank? Games like Company of Jobbers 2 will always shield themselves with some non-existant ""MUH BALANCE"" holy cow, but in reality Relic just dont know how things work and can't code if their life depended on it.Manual aim: this is plain fun, even though it seems tanks ironically actually lose in accuracy if you manually aim them. If you remember Crimsonland - when you control soldier with PTRs and noscope360 enemies through covers it feels just like this. However, while you having fun you will probably lose rest of the army because i didn't find anything resembling CONTROL GROUPS IN THIS GAME AND WORKING WITH THIS MINIMAP REQUIRES 900+ APM.  Little things: A lot of things here are just priceless: manually refilling artillery ammunition with infantry squad by moving shells from a truck through inventory (if you played a lot of Zuma at MLG tournaments you will be good at this), shooting cow and then search it's corpse, kill a guy, stuff his corpse's inventory with artillery shells and then move it near your artillery like some sort of death metal treasure chest, throw grenade into trench and then order machinegun to fire at position so enemy won't ever escape, run your flamethrower tank through building filled with enemies, ram enemy fortifications and then detonate it with grenade to see most useless fireworks ever, roll out IS-3 and lose it to one-shot from enemy AT, etc.I give this game 100 executed war prisoners out of 100. Even though interface and matchmaking are modern means of mental torture, game itself is pure fun. As for singleplayer missions - they don't seem to be as much fun as they were in very first Men of War so i never tried them.Win for the Rodina or die trying!			"

												Pretty much perfect in every way, one of the best RTS games I've ever played. The attention to detail is amazing.Shells can pierce multiple armoured targets...Infantry have multiple hitboxes, able to lose their helmet or even rifle if sent flying by an explosionInfantry can search other infantrys corpses, taking their weapons, helmets and even bandages (or dynamite from a armoured vehicle)...Tanks dont have health bars, they have damage modelling, so a panzer IV wont take out a churchill, unlike CoH...Units are made in favour of realism rather than balance, if it was bad in real life, its bad here...Surprisingly active multiplayer community...Great freedom in what your units can physically do, you can send your men into an allys tank if one of his crew died, for example...You can take control of a single unit/vehicle at any time, controlling how it moves, where it fires, what it does. You can cook a grenade, conduct a charge, take control a single man with a flamethrower, scorching the enemy trenchlines, angle your tank armour so enemy rounds bounce off, aim for weak spots of enemy tanks, etc...Your tank crew can escape a inoperable vehicle, and blow it up with dynamite to prevent it being stolen, (Or even used in a last ditch effort to take your enemy with you)You can decrew and steal enemy vehicles, even towing their anti tank guns against them...If you can think of it, you can probably do it.

												My review is based upon singleplayer only, i havent touched the multiplayer and perhaps that is where the real focus of this game lays, but for anyone out there that is also interested in the singleplayer aspect, this is for you.First off, the game uses the standard men of war style play, in that respect you cant go wrong with the gameplay, its fun to direct control units and blow things up, nothing much has changed here since ""Soldiers:heroes of ww2"", you still cant properly direct control into buildings as infantry. Here is where my real issue with this game comes, the singleplayer maps. Theres no real story like previous men of war games (unlike the first assault squad which also had no story). Their is 6 or 7 missions for each faction, brits, germans, russians etc. Nearly every single map is the same, a long corridor which you must advance up and take control of the flags. There is no room for flanking, no room for any tactical depth, its basically direct control one unit and slowly advance him up taking out everything. Occasionally something different will happen, like you need to defend the flag for X amount of time. Its hardly stimulating tactically for example the start of the first mission it gives you 1 squad of infantry to defend against an attack, you literally do not have to issue a single order, your men will sit in the trench and return fire for 3 minutes until it progress' onto the corridor style level layout. Its pointless, you may aswell just speed up time to get it out of the way.Some of the missions are even dlc missions that were released for the first men of war. So ive paid for the exact same maps twice now.Here is the real stinker though. Youve completed all the missions for the nation that you chose to play as first, time to try out some of the other nations! Wait ... this map looks awfully familiar ....oh thats right, it is! The other nations are all carbon copies of the same maps just reskinned to look different with the units of that nation put in instead. Dont get me wrong they look quite nice the maps but there is only so many times you can advance up the same corridor of a map with the tiniest of differences between them. In essence the only saving grace is the community workshop, which is sad that your relying on user generated content to enjoy a game you paid for. It is truely a sad state of affairs that the game which started this series off ""Soldiers heroes of ww2"" released over 10 years ago had more complex missions, a better story and more varied missions than this. I do not think this title warrants calling itself a sequel to assault squad 1, its pretty much the same game but better graphics.Perhaps the multiplayer is the saving grace of this series, i dont know. But like me if your interested in singleplayer missions, avoid this unless some really good steam workshop stuff comes out. Play the original men of war, faces of war or even soldiers heroes of ww2 instead they are all vastly superior singleplayer experiences.Shame, i was hoping for more after assault squad one, not more of the same.

												If you are a hardcore fan of the franchise then you may be a bit disappointed with this release. In terms of the core game mechanics and gameplay then you will be somewhat satisfied as these remain true as the original. However in terms of graphical fidelity then this is a great letdown. If anything this game is just a slight graphical update upon the original and I would not recommend you buy this game... yet. All that has happened is there has been integration with steam and thats about it. So I wouldn't throw your money at this title quite yet.			"

												This game has been a huge disappointment. My hopes were not high, reading the features that were going to be in this game before release, but I am disappointed, nonetheless.If you enjoyed Assault Squad 1, and want to continue playing that game online, you're practically forced into buying Assault Squad 2, as the imminent demise of Gamespy means that the multiplayer in the previous Men of War titles will soon be defunct. The switch from Gamespy server to Steam server has not been a graceful one either, navigating from menu to menu in the internet menus takes a lot longer than it used to. Previously, joining a server rarely took longer than a second, now on the steam servers, it regularly takes upwards of 10 just to connect. Global chat has been replaced by a steam chat channel that requires you to use the steam overlay, or have it open on a separate window entirely, and you can no longer see another player's game information (games played, won, quit, etc), now the info button just brings you to their steam achievements page. Hopefully the steam servers mean that everyone will stay on the same version number, which was a previous issue.The UI has been changed in a few ways. For vehicles, the icons are more or less the same, just stacked horizontally as well as vertically, but for infantry, the icons have become much smaller. It was hard to tell what units were what at first because there's nothing to explain it, but on my own I learned that a red line above the infantry icon denotes an AT launcher in the squad, and a yellow line above the icon denotes an AT rifle. I suppose this is inoffensive but contrasted with the background, it's hard to see how many infantry units are in a given squad.Unit-wise, almost nothing has changed, except many cannon ranges has been decreased by about 10m. You can order “elite” units of some infantry (Machinegunners, AT teams) which is the same composition plus or minus one squad member with higher weapon skill. All infantry seem to have higher stealth ratings, for better or worse.There are many more maps than there were previously, thankfully, some of which are from the DLC of the previous game, but I believe some of them are new.Now the 3 damning points about this game that make it not worth 30$1. No bugs to my knowledge have been fixed, every glitch you can think of is still in the game, and the game still crashes with no notice.2. The unlock system. This system is so amazingly out of place in Men of War, there's no other word for it but insulting. Units are locked until you reach a specific level. If you're a veteran Men of War player, this means that until you reach the required level, which can take tens of games, you get no artillery, no super heavy tanks, and a handful of other units. This is so baffling as to why they would even think of putting this system in this game. There are only two possibilities in my mind, why a company would put this in a game, either to make the game more like Company of Heroes, the much more popular WWII real time stratege/tactics game, or more cynically, just so that they can sell their deluxe edition of AS2, which increases exp rewards, unlocking things faster. The host can unlock all units on a per-game basis, but locking units based on individual player experience (not skill), is just a waste of time.3. It's 30$ (or more) for the same game, with no fixes, very few unit changes, vague improvements that don't have much of an impact at all, and an unbelievably insulting unlock gimmick.I think everything in this game must have been planned as DLC or update content for AS1, and they decided to slap a new title and a full price (the same price AS1 has been at for years) so that they could charge everybody for DLC instead of just the people who would have bought DLC anyway. A solution for this would have been to offer a much more generous discount to the people who owned it, because if you own AS1 and the DLC for it,  you practically own a better version of AS2, just one that won't be playable online in a few weeks. Thanks DMS.			"

												There's not that many strategy games out there nowadays and those that do come out usually end up as a disappointment because of being either too bad of a game or too simple and generic (A + Click, I win etc) with no strategy or tactic in place.The problem with Men of War Assault Squad 2 does not fall into either of these categories. It falls into a special one Now, when I first heard that they'll be releasing a MoW2 with Steam Intergration I was excited until I saw the price and notice that not many things changed. Paying ~$35 for the same thing is not really a good thing so I decided to buy on sale which I did. And from what I've experienced thus far, thank goodness I bought it from the sale._______________________________________Gameplay--------------------------------------------------------------At it's core, MOWAS 2 is a 'what if' Company Of Heroes 2 had much more micromangement and detail involved without the base building and includes mechanics such as managing an individuals soldier, tank or artillery inventory and even ASSUMING CONTROL of them when needed to fine tune your orders such as timing a cooked grenade toss or aiming a specific part of the target etc.Armoured Warfare in this game puts CoH2's to shame because of how each (and there's a lot) and every Tank has seperate parts which can be neutralized to decommision a tank such as destroying its mobility with a shot to its track or destroying its main gun so that it can no longer fire. Note that they can be repaired should the inventory of the tank or crew have a spare repair kit. The way tanks are destoyed in this game is also amazing as tanks do not have health but instead, rely on their armour thickness and the direction from which the AT fire came from (did it hit from a sloped angle or the rear? etc) so you won't see funny things like a Stuart destroying a King Tiger.The gameplay in this game is solid and rather in-depth which is the main reason why I enjoy this game so much._______________________________________Single Player--------------------------------------------------------------Nothing too interesting here. 7-ish missions for each of the 5 factions which are basically reskins of one another. Luckily, there are mods that add interesting scenarios and SP (or Co-op) missions of their own.However, Single Player Co-Op has this weird mechanic where person A can buy a Tank but the game decides to give said Tank to person B because he has a smaller army count. In addition, buying a 8-man squad can end up becoming a 2-man squad as a result of this mechanic. Though units can be given away to other players, for a game that has players speaking many languges, trying to share these units can be a hard unless playing with a friend in which case it's only a minor annoyance.SP can be fun though doing the same thing over and over again can get boring unless you use mods by individuals such as Sir Hinkel._______________________________________Multiplayer--------------------------------------------------------------Alongside the weird 'sharing units in Single Player campaign' thingy, multiplayer also has a weird mechanic which although can be turned off in an unranked lobby by the host, it cannot be turned off in ranked matches, period.Basically, its a levelling system. If I'm not mistaken, the maximum level that one can achieve is around 20 if not more. At level 20, you can purchase any units during a ranked game. At level 1 which most people start as off, you can only purchase half the units at your disposal. Basically, your low level is preventing you from making any expensive yet powerful purchases such as Elite Infantry Units, Heavier Tanks and Heavy Artillery support including half of your special faction troops being locked.How does 1 increase their level? Two ways. Either they play (and finish) more ranked matches or play through the SP campaign either alone or with a friend.This levelling system is in my opinion, extremely flawed for players attempting to get their feet wet in ranked multiplayer. Aside from some toxic players which most game have, going against a level 20 opponent when you're simply level 1 offers the new player a huge disadvantage for them and removes the fun for him as he will basically get rofl stomped by superior equipment. In addition to this, most players who I've met in a ranked game tend to have double digit levels while I'm still level 3 and I fail to see how this create a valid and fair leaderboard let alone match when high level players are always going up against lower tier players such as myself. To me, this seems downright broken and makes ranked matches unplayable until I've played a countless number of SP missions for a game that emphasizes on Multiplayer. This mechanic is such a major turnoff that I regret buying this game, even though it was during a deal UNLESS players start getting paired against similarly ranked or levelled players.One thing that this game has done to avoid players from dropping is by forcing you to finish a game by removing any form of concede button where only your ELO is affected. Instead, even when outnumbered in a 2v1, 4v2 or any other match where you've lost everything, leaving a game midway will do three things instead. Decrease your ELO, degrades your Ranked Trust Rating and finally, Negates you from earning any EXP you gained from that match neccessary to level up your army. And mind you the levels are factions specific. You can have a level 4 Germany army but a level 1 UK army.So, do players finish a losing game where they get absolutely zero enjoyment because of getting owned hard? No, they don't. They either cut their internet connection, desync the game or simply use Task Manager to close it. Through this,  there would be no changes for their ELO, trust rating or EXP earned._______________________________________Stability--------------------------------------------------------------The stability for this game is poor. Playing with Local friends won't even mitigate the issue as I still get kicked out of a game even if said friend was living around my neighbourhood. The most notorious one of them all is the 'Out-Of-Sync' Error. This error freezes your game and happens at random intervals and can get very frustrating as it will not record down the online game you spent 45-60 minutes playing. Error dc:x are also annoying. From what I've gathered, Error dc:0 = the host kicked you mainly due to your ping which is a joke considering that only PC Performance matters while Error dc:3 which is basically the game being a jerk to you.Keep in mind that this game was in EARLY ACCESS for a couple of months and after its release on April/May 2014, it still gets this kind of problems which is downright unacceptable considering how long of a chance they had to fix this. Heck, the developers are even releasing another EARLY ACCESS game which appears to be MOWAS with a Modern Era reskin somewhere this year which means there goes the technical support for the game.Conclusion--------------------------------------------------------------Good game, great gameplay, great mechanic. Poor Ranked Multiplayer. Horrendous StabilityAnd as MOWAS 2 is a multiplayer orientated game whose only major difference from its predecessor is Steam Intergration with the price of ~$40, I can't recommend this game to anyone unless its on sale.~Edited due to Stability issues			"

												It's sad that the developers of these games gave up so many years ago. The ""Single player missions"" in this game are boring, storyless multiplayer maps with bad AI. Nothing more. They have no objective other than pushing forward and capturing ""flags""The multiplayer community is small, toxic and crippled by horrible engine optimization and network connection errors. You'll be lucky to ever finish a match in this game without someone lagging out or being kicked by players who refuse to communicate.I'm reinstalling Faces of War and playing the single player campaign again (4th time). I will never buy one of these games again, you've ruined it for yourselves.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is an effort to produce a WW2 RTS that feels authentic, vehicles and soldiers have ammunition, weapons have their characteristics modelled accurately and armour penetration chances too. This then leads to wider considerations such as logistics on the battlefield, the careful selection of units and your force composition etc. The singleplayer campaigns for the five playable nations will break you in nicely ready for multiplayer, and multiplayer has a variety of modes such as; co op skirmishes, vicotry point matches and comabt matches. The graphics and effects look really nice but can be a drain if the system is getting on a bit, so be warned before cranking it up to ultra! Other features such as direct control mode allow a single unit, from a lowly rifleman to a 50 ton tank, to contorlled directly by the player - aiming weapons, steering/ movement etc - thus providing a finer degree of control over more specialised vehicles/ situations. Would certainly recommend if you want something inbetween COH 1/2 and more serious games like the Combat Mission series.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a real-time strategy from Digitalmindsoft, a sequel to Men of War: Assault Squad. It's a micromanagement genre but ever since the first Men of War, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 has been reworked for more bigger battles and easier management while still giving the same challenge for tactics.In gameplay terms, while not so much different from previous titles, not to mention the whole missions from the first Assault Squad are actually here as well, It has been improved so much since release and with patches. For example when your squad is out of ammo, you don't have to actually resupply each of them with inventory control anymore, you can simply call a supply drop with smoke grenade if available, or spawn in a supply truck, each has a resupply ability for your units, even vehicles, as long as it is the right type of supplying units of course. The American airborne drops has also been upgraded, no longer you paradrop a single soldier who will die instantly when he reach the ground, but an actual squad of airborne infantry. Coming with Airborne DLC, now you can play with bots in multiplayer! Even though the bots doesn't really give actual challenge, at least you can have something to play with. Though the bots only available on Assault Zones and Capture the Flag mode. You also get some extra skirmish missions from the vanilla and more from DLC. While there are some improvements, Assault Squad 2 still has much potential to get some extras.The graphics, while at release is not that different from the first Assault Squad, after many patches, it has been greatly improved especially when it comes to unit models and textures like vehicle and tanks, infantry skins now has winter and desert version for their corresponding maps. Overall the graphics has been indeed improved a lot. The performances are not bad, but surely can see some improvements and fixes. While most of the time there is no stutter or lags, in multiplayer somehow the performances like to drop like crazy at sometime. But in singleplayer there is no issues. This is strange since singleplayer are the one who used more processing because there is scripts and more AI.Things that Men of War are very great at are modifications! Men of War: Assault Squad 2 now support Steam Workshops for community made content so there's no need to find them on other site, or upload your creation elsewhere. This also makes downloading modifications more easier than before.Overall, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is quite solid for a sequel, I recommend this!Rating 8/10			"

												Forword: Im a bit disappointed. I recently started to play the Men of War Franchise so im not to familiar with the Series but AS2 is basically AS with a bit better graphics, worse performance, some good changes like Squad Resupply (or atleast i think this is new). For the Skirmishes most of them are just the Skirmishes from AS2. Now I know that this Game should be played in MP but Im not to fond of RTS MP Games I rather play SP so I was really disappointed and feel a bit scammed. All my Experience is from the SP. I havent touched the MP yet.The Good:- Graphics and Effects are nice- AI is great and challenging- New Units- Squad Resupply- better Pathfinding- dotted walk/run Line for your Movement- Cover Ghosts are more Accurate. Atleast it feels like it.- some good new Skirmishes- Matchmaking System- Steam Workshop- The Bad:- Lots of reused Skirmishes of the previous AS Game- The Performance got worse- Vehicle behaviour when your not controlling them i.e. shooting HE Rounds and Infantry while beeing bombarded by an enemy Tank and so on-- My Rig:- i7 2600- GTX 670- Game runs on SSD- Everything Maxed and 4x AA- too similar to AS to justify the purchase- The Ugly:- Matchmaking seems to be broken or no one uses it.- MP seems dead. When i looked there were 3 games with 10ppl playing.So for me I would rather say buy AS1, its a better bang for your buck at the moment. "

												My favorite game on WW2Positives:+ Every unit is important, everyone has his own inventory, ammo, grenades and bandages for wounds.+ Manual control of any unit.(Yes, you as the shooter to run on A/W/S/D to shoot and aiming with the mouse!)+ Damage system great equipment, the tank can damage: tracks, engine, turret or gun, and can kill crew - further damaged tank can be repaired and used against the enemy - great!(But nobody cancelled the explosion of the fuel tanks against fire and explosion of the ammo rack)+ On the map can contain a huge number of units.+ The developers did not throw the game out a major update every 3-4 months.+ In multiplayer you still play :3+ You can share with friends to pass the mission.+ Open access to the mod from steam workshop.+ The longer units alive and the more enemies they defeat, the more experienced they become, making them even more important.+ Excellent voice for every nation.+ 414 in-game achievements!!!Negative sides:- OMG 414 in-game achievements.........- The clumsy animation of the infantry, the graphics are not bad, but not the best.- Sometimes there are bugs with the physics (but they are extremely rare, although it may be already fixed)- The average daily online only 1000-1500 people.- With Addons there are 10 missions for each of the 4 Nations, but they're all the same(differ only in maps) and no plot as such.Result: 11 pros vs. 5 cons			"

								First off I am going to write this review assuming you have played the original MoW:AS.1.)  It has stepped up and offers outstanding graphics compared to the original. (The dirt is so beautiful)2.)  The AI is human-like and fluctuates on its reactions as the battelfield changes. (Hiding in impact craters, using tank husks as cover)3.)  It offers a few new maps (as far as the Beta is concerned). It also has a few old ones.4.)  All the sounds, music, and textures are recycled from the original.      That's about it in regards to being different to MoW: ASThe second part of this review will be to describe the MoW experience to those that have yet to play this game.1.)  The game is brutal, and unforgiving. (not your typical RTS) You must use your resources wisely as you only get so much and to recover mistakes mid game is almost impossible.2.)  This game stresses on hardcore realism in regards to bullet penetration and physics. (Tank rounds will bounce off certain tanks and shred others.)3.)  If your infantry is not in cover, they are already dead. (Tactical placement of infantry is the key to victory.)4.)  This game is basically as real as war can get. 5.)  If you press down your Ctrl key you are able to manually control and operate any unit. (This is a big plus to the RTS genre.)All in all it is a decent game, however for the fans of the original, you may be disappointed with this new release as it has little to no changes gameplay-wise. However, if you are new to the series then I suggest you watch a few videos to see if this game is right for you.Update: 3/19/14: 1C has pushed this game back yet again for the second time since they collected for preorders. The game is now available for Early Access, not recommended, although my review above still stands true.			"

												Im a big fan of the MoW series, and Assualt Squad 2 is no exception with its amazing gameplay, but the multiplayer is sadly the downfall of the game itself. The game, just like its predecesors, has a bit of a learning curve with it. The rewards of learning can be of a great benefit and makes the game a whole lot more fun.Now lets talk about the single player aspect first before the multiplayer. The single player portion of the game is pretty good, with four difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard, and you can tell the difference from easy being a cake walk to hard... being just about impossible unless you know every little thing there is to know about the game. But man, can it be incredibly fun. You have five different factions to choose from with several skirmish missions to try for each. Each faction has thier own style making each one very unique to the other. You can play all of these missions by yourself or together on multiplayer. With single player you can pause the game, slow down the speed, or even speed things up. There are a few mods out there that can really spice the game up as well, which can be played by both single or mulitplayer. The multiplayer is possible the only bad thing about this great game. The community is very small and many games that are hosted are either locked by passwords, or your kicked as soon as you enter the lobby. This can make you spend hours just trying to find or create a game instead of playing it. Every blue moon you might actually find a decent group of players who like to play the game for fun and not competitively to the point where they kick you becuase your rank is to low or to high. When you do get a game you may find that it sometimes lags pretty bad. The ping can be horrendous at times even with just 2 people, but then again you can find a game where there is no sign of lag at all, even with a group of 8 people! The games themselves mostly rely on a individual's own internet connection and not a dedicated server.   The multiplayer is actually a lot of fun if you can find a group or have a few friends that like to play, but going in alone with the community thats on right now is terrible. The multiplayer was one of the main factors for me getting this game in the first place, and im sadly disappointed by the outcome. If you don't care for the multiplayer portion or have a group of friends to play with on here, then its a great game that i recommend buying, but if multiplayer is a big deal, then you better pass up on this until something changes with the community thats on right now. It is really a shame.			"

Early Access Review
								In its current form, the multiplayer, which is really the meat of this series, is completely unplayable. Every game someone drops. Every game lags. The ""New"" Engine appears to be responsible, at least to me. It's unstable as Hell, and this is really disappointing. My system specs are exceptional as well, so I doubt its my i7 and GTX 680. Or everyone else's rig.I regret my purchase in the extreme, because this is so unpolished. There is a difference between Early Access and the garbage that this has turned out to be. It's a shame, because the series used to be quite good, and as of right now, after hours of playing, I've successfully had one game that didn't have someone drop.Avoid if you're into Multiplayer. Avoid like the plague.			"

Simply the best. Before this game I used to play Soldiers Heroes of World War 2 (SHOWW2 for short) when I was 9 years old, which was the 1st ever Men of War game! I was pretty sad when I found out that nobody played that MP game and all the units that went into the waste. But then I found out that there was this series called Men of War and now I'm reliving my dream. After playing this game I cannot and I repeat CAN NOT go back to Company of Heroes 2 cause it's unrealistic and I'm so used to damaging the machines that I find it unrealistic how those units suck up damage and the HP bar. All in all If you enjoy realistic games and teamwork then this game is for you.Watch out for my tiger c; "

Early Access Review
								I'm an open minded person, and I love games of all genres. I have a particular love for RTS games, and found the original Men of War Assault Squad to be very fun to play, if a little on the shallow side for graphics, optimization, and a terrible AI system. With AS2 promising to fix all these, it seemed like a good idea at the time.Needless to say, I was very disappointed with it. I haven't logged too much time into this game because not only have the graphics barely improved aside from what seems to be better graphics quite literally MIXED IN with the older, crappy graphics at random (first mission of soviets, nuff said), it's now poorly optimized to the point that my hex-core 3.5 ghz computer with 64 gigs of ram and twin GTX titans will lag and, if it isn't lagging and actually running a solid 60 fps, FREEZE every few seconds for about a second. The UI is exactly the same as before, the AI is still not AI in my opinion as scripts should not count, and I was greeted with a lazy menu that used the same music and style of the previous game! The in-game music is the same too, voice acting has barely improved and only in CERTAIN areas, and on top of that the game pulled a stunt going from beta to early access without more than 1 day's notice. The only area that seems to have improved in a truly useful way is the multiplayer, which now uses steam instead of an external service, as well as steam workshop support for easy access to mods and maps, which I will give it credit for adding - these are much needed to this game and all games in general as Gamespy is going down and workshop just increases replayability of ANY title massively and will likely lead to me playing this game quite a bit more to enjoy workshop content.I am not saying the men of war series of games are bad, because they are very fun to play. I am saying that this game should not be counted as a sequel to the first game - it is at best an expansion (with the majority of its content being from AS1), and does not live up to what I had expected in the slightest from this title as a full on sequel at the full price of a sequel.

												As of right now in beta. It isn't looking good. The game looks like a direct copy of its predecessor in looks and gameplay and i personally definitely hope this is a NEW game not a copy of the old game with some added maps. As far as i see it needs work. Yes, it's in beta. But i see no evidence of any new features of anything significantly impressive about the '2' in the game. You can play the two side by side and hadly be able to tell the difference between them. Except that this second version's maps are broken and the AI can be a lot stupider than before. It looks and plays fine on difficulties easy and normal. But is lacking the realistic aspect this game is going for when you play on expert mode. Bushes do not give you cover and the enemy AI have aim that you can only beat when you take direct control of a unit. As im going through the game this is my initial opinion based on the completion of the first campaign. I have high hopes and i love the first Men of War. But when they released a sequal i was hoping for something better. Like maybe more focus on the Vietnam era? Or the Korean War? As the second world war seems to very extremely overdone. But no matter what i will always buy and play the sequals to any Men of War title as it's an amazing game overall. As of now, if you are interested in the game buy it now while it's on sale and enjoy it when they start shelling some patches. But if you want the buy this game as a newcomer of the Men of War games go for the first game as it's a lot more fun and enjoyable.EDIT: 2:18 PM One hour laterGame ended up crashing on me a few times midway into a mission. sequence error. Ive seen people having this problem constantly as well in the reviews including the one that the developer team deleted themselves. Which out of context, i think that review had been pretty honest and the developers' flagging response did seem pretty petty. But otherwise this game has many more errors now that i see. And it still is the same game as before. Same mission plots as well. Such as Germany Mission 1. A defence mission exactly like MoW 1 US mission 3 where you defend the Phillipines. Which by the way has an INFAMOUS history of crashing. The Phillipines on MoW 1 was unplayable in multiplayer. Which brings me to suggest you may need to readvise how you put together your defending missions, as of right now the reveiw is still for people to wait until buying this game if they want the full experience.EDIT 2/25 8:02 PM 24 Hrs of gameplayI enjoy the game and it's a great game. Still do not recommend to people who are just getting into the men of war games. But one thing i definitely keep in heart is ""If you want to have the best possible Men of War experience we strongly recommend to wait for the full game. Playing the beta is at your own risk and you will very likely encounter issues that are not present in the final version."" From the developers news of the people preordering getting open beta access. I agree 100% and i definitely appreciate the honesty because it basically can sum up my review, being wary that it is a beta, but one thing i would like to reiterate is the fact that they need to make sure it has a significant difference in gameplay or AI rather than something people can claim to be a 'copy and paste' game.EDIT 2/25 12:21 AMGame is finished, Looks good, Plays good, But i still say that you should buy the first one and play through it first. As in my opinion it is better, and or the same exact game. If you already have the first one. Definitely buy this, specially if it goes up for sale.EDIT: 7/16/2015 1:34 AMThey're releasing overly priced DLCs to make up for the fact that the game was an exact copy of the first game even still. Yes i love Assault Squad. But i disagree with the cash grabs that the developers are choosing to go through with. I have to pay $9.99 to have a feature that should have been in the base game. AI players? Third person mode? Base game tanks? MORE singleplayer missions? PLEASE stop trying to take my money and give me a game I will enjoy and continue to play even past it's time. I sure hope the developer comes to their senses and stops charging people for features that belong in the base game. My OVERALL opinion. Don't buy this game. Buy the much mroe completed first version for cheaper, and if you like that version, invest in this second version because this still remains to be a large DLC of the first game.			"

												The Men of war series are great WW2 RTS games, reasonably realistic, balanced and historically accurate when compared to other similar games in the genre.  Overview:	 Assault Squad 2 is more of a standalone expansion, in a sense that it builds on the previous titles and stays true to the format, rather than changing it to the point that it loses what makes it great. The game is both fun and challenging, with an added educational aspect with the inclusion of units, vehicles, and weapons of which may help you gain a better understating of their roles in the second world war. What's new?:	 An entirely  new feature to Assault Squad 2 is the soldiers now gather experience for their actions, increasing their effectiveness on the battle field, whereas previously long standing soldiers would run out of ammo and may become deadweight, or a micro management calamity. Ammo boxes and supply trucks now generate a field to resupply soldiers and weapons in the nearby vicinity, making it easier to manage your units, particularly in heated or drawn-out engagements. Features:	 One feature of the MOW series worth mentioning is the game speed control function, the ability to scale several different speeds during the game is a great feature. It is particularly useful for micro managing things such as soldiers inventory, mine laying, vehicle/weapon repair and the use of medics. It is also very helpful to players new to the game, and also to just observe the action in slow motion close up.Assault Squad 2 has mod support, with an in game menu to activate/de-activate them as you please, as well as a Steam workshop, where you can download mods with the click of a button, no messy installations or file overwrites. What gives the game increased longevity is the modding community, they allow you to expand on your experience and add new scenarios, some of which even exceed the games original campaign. Verdict:	 Although the game is not 100% finished, the graphics and textures are improved, but visually is not especially different to the previous titles, at this point the levels for all factions are quite similar for each campaign, and the stealth missions are a bit redundant.If you are new to the MOW series, or are a fan of them, then I would recommend Assault Squad 2. If you have played early titles such as Assault Squad 1 and it did not leave you wanting more, than this may not be for you, or you may just want to wait for it to go on special to try for yourself.At the end of the day one must remember that this is a game, made for entertainment, and games differ from reality, if you want reality then simply head outside. Have a nice day :)			"

												((EDIT: Now reviewing the RELEASED game:))The MoW games have been some of my favourite RTS ever made - I've been playing them since the original, Soldiers: Heroes of World War II. They have some qualities that I think set them apart from other competing WW2 games. This is to CoH2, for example, what ARMA III is to Metal Slug - except it's fun! The realism does not ruin it.The reason I am NOT recommending it is very simple - nothing has changed! Really, nothing has changed at all! The menu is identical, the sound is identical, almost everything is identical. I actually feel very, very cheated by this - it's actually quite insulting.1) The voice acting is identical, and seeing as it has been used since Faces of War, I'm starting to get a little tired of it. This feels very very lazy.3) The graphics engine does not look anything like the screenshots - in fact, it looks virtually identical to the graphics engine from Men of War AS I. I honestly cannot tell the difference, and I have a computer that can run it on full, easily.4) In order to use units in MP, you have to level up (by playing multiplayer games over a period of time) - meaning, of course, that the best get better and the worst get trashed. You can disable this option, but you have to go into the advanced settings, meaning that many people will overlook this option5) It is still very, very buggy. Frequent crashes to desktop.6) 8v8 games? No. No no, there are 8v8 maps, but you can't actually PLAY with 16 players - you can only put 8 players on. Who wants to play 4v4 on an 8v8 size map?7) The netcode is still atrocious. Good luck finding a large game that runs properly. If a single person in the game has a sluggish computer, it will slow down the entire server for the remaining players. Framerates plummet to the point of unplayability. In fact, I would say that only 25% of the games I have played even play ""playably"".In the end, you have to kick an enormous amount of people with either terrible computers or terrible internet connections. I blame the game for part of this. I'm not sorry I bought this game, especially as I got it reduced, but this feels like a massive cash grab from a lazy company. Which is a shame, because they do know how to make an excellent RTS; or at least, they did once - they've just been re-releasing it for the previous five or so years.Could do better!(P.S. Half the players in this game are apparently Nazis (""S.S. PzDiv"" in their name, pictures of Einsatzgruppen on their steam profile) - the other half seem to want the Soviet Union back.)			"

												If this is your first Assualt Squad, yes it is a fun game.Pros - Decent multiplayer community- Is rather fun for a little while singleplayer-wise- Decent workshop community pumping out plenty of modsCons- Developers seemingly did not and do not listen to customers when we told them what we wanted in this sequel.- A glorified engine upgrade to Assualt Squad 1 that still runs worse and is still not optimized.- Most units and maps are copy/paste from AS1 (Devs even stated not every unit will be remade)- Multiplayer is buggy, laggy, and the MM does not like you.- Missing basic features of nearly every other modern RTS (Non mission skirmish mode for starters)- DLC created to sell you the previously mentioned basic features at insane prices (10$ for Replay ability and 5 small missions!)- DLC apparently prioritized over optimizationAll in all, is it a good game? Yes in its core. But I believe the devs are doing very shoddy work behind it and its a victim of their ineptitude. I may change this review later, based on what the game becomes, but for now I say vote with your wallet, and vote no. "

Being that Assault Squad 2 should not be considered as a new game more like an add-on, expansion or update. if you have Assault Squad 1 play it instead because there's so little that was added only like 5 co-op maps. Now with that out of the way I love WW2 games and the Men of War series as well so the people that do not have Assault Squad 1 I say buy this ""new game"" MOW is one of the best WW2 RTS ever. What was added that i have seen fixes, some maps, steam worckshop, texture updates, (not much of one) audio update, explosions look better, new co-op game play 1 map for each nation (5) and some i can't think of or not worth adding. The reason im not recommending it is because i have Men of War Assault Squad 1.			"

								This  game have  0 improvements over Assul squad. Sure they say that there are major improvements in engine and all.. but you dont see that, those improvements are to the game engine not to the game. its basically Assult Squad 1.2 . Worth spending money on it? Yes if youre hardcore fan of this series or never played before this type of games, no if you're anybody else.I have question to devs.. how this game is different from MOW? couple years passed and you people keep making same game over and over and over.. another dev team that had 1 idea in their lifetime and keep re-doing it until nobody will buy it i guess?You have the graphic engine? how about adding something new to it? strategy level? no? to hard to think about it?Personally i dont see difference between MOW and Assault Squad 2. Quote from dev blog : ""However, please keep in mind this is not Men of War 2, but Assault Squad 2, so do not expect a totally different game. We never promised such, nor will we "" hehe.. meaning its same garbage game like previous one.Like men of war and assult squad are different much lol. Yeah you keep re-doing same game for another 10 years...we see how you gonna end up.			"

												I might recommend this game if the developer/producer of this game had actually worked accountably to provide an updated experience to MoW AS... the first one, which is almost exactly the same as the last one. There is very little new material in AS2 that wasn't already there in the first one. Additionally, The first AS is not much different from the first MoW, which wasn't much different from Faces of War. Admittedly, I never played FoW, but its not much different than Soldiers: Heroes of World War II. Go watch a video on youtube and you'll see what I mean.Aside from the fact that I have bought MoW, Red Tide, MoWAS and MoWAS II. The graphics are the same in each. Only a few gameplay features have changed over time.They just released a DLC for $6. I have had it. That should have gone into the MOWAS2 as a free DLC at the least. The devs are not accountable. You have to try really hard to imagine even a single person developing full time for DMS.			"

The gameplay is still fun, it is still a great strategy game. However, the missions, graphics, and gameplay are very identical. The other frustrating part is that the missions for all practically the same.			"

												This is outdated but the only difference between now and then is more problems with things. ( Also sorry for my bad grammer and other mistakes I wrote this at 11pm : P ) (I SAY THIS WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME IN GAME)  Early on when this game was release it was alot of fun and a good game, but not the game has gotten to a postion were you either pay for stupid pointless DLC or you mod the game.              After one of the newest DLC getting intoduced with the new Bots in multiplayer I finaly gave up on the developers , I can under stand they need money and this is a easy way to make it, but there are many more options that can give the people what some of us have been waiting for for a very long time ( I Have been waiting for bots in muti-player ever sence the first MOW game ).              In conclusion at this moment of writing this I have alot more respect for the Modding community then the dev's of this game, the stupid fast money tactics they are implimenting are normaly lacking in content and paid mods probably would be a cheaper and better option ( Never thought I would say that XD ).              I would suggest only buying this game for the mods now and only put money in to the mod community thro donations.( This is a bit out dated , the only difference is that ALOT ALOT of people cant get mods working any more and the Unmoded game Crashes ALOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT )			"

								I purchased this title under the impression that it would be as the title suggests: a sequal to Digital Mindsoft's Men of War: Assault Squad (MOWAS). I am, however and unfortunately, extremely disappointed to say the least.Having not played MOWAS in a few months, I found it near impossible to actually tell this was supposed to be a different game; graphically, feature-wise and gameplay-wise it is identical to its predecessor, with the same game modes, same copy-pasted maps, same voice acting, same units -- everything is, effectively, the same. Rather than enjoying a new game with fresh new features, some kind of gameplay innovation or even simply new units, I found myself playing the same game I'd played two years ago when the first MOWAS was released.I can not stress enough not to bother purchasing this game. It contains a couple of new maps, but they are bland and follow the same formula as the previous game; everything else is identical, or of a pointless enough nature to be indistinguishable. If you own MOWAS already, you are missing nothing by not playing MOWAS 2.			"

												Have been playing Men of War Assault Squad before, which was awsome... apart from the fact that you couldn't use all different tanks and units in skirmish and I sucked at multiplayer. The previous game would hit easily an 8 out of 10 for me. However, this game doesn't do good. My tanks get shot from several directions and they just sit there doing nothing. You can however manual mark the targets, and they hit them very well, but auto fire seems to be bugged heavily. Also counts for mortars. Multiplayer is under populated at this point. Not the game I was hoping for.			"

								They call this Assault Squard 2, but this game basicly is Assault Squard 1 with updated UI, some new model, and re-worked campaign(which still sucks anyway). You can barely find anything new in this updated version of AS1. this is bullshxt, developer these day lose their faith and passion on game developing but became money vacuumed & blood sucking vampire.Men of War used to be a great strategy game, it points a new way of how to make a realistic WWII strategy game playable and fun. Yes it does lack of great voice acting in singleplayer campaign, but at least present us a actual story line but not this kind of ""general thank goood you have arrrrived"" thing. It's just lame.I suggest anyone who is new to this franchise stick with original Men of war; MoW: Red Tidd; MoW: vietnam. Even Condemned Heroes were better than this. If you interested in multiplayer, Assault Squard 1 was enough for you. Buy this only if you don't even borther to try any of the other Men of War games or while it's 90% off.Im dead fkin serious!Update: After Men of War Assault Squard 2 last update, it seems the game finally got its full release, but you wanna know how lazy they are? they even re-using original assault squard tutorail as bounes mission in AS2! How genius! Not to metion, all campaign mission they add up last update belongs to original Assault squard, too, and of couse with abusolute no change.			"

Posted: July 18, 2016
												For all those who enjoy the plethora of games based on the greatest tale of the Twentieth Century, heres a few things I've picked up from playing this game:Graphics: 6/10; The games getting along in its time since the time of writing this review, but I try to keep things in mind like when the game was made, as it can be quite easy to look at an older game which at the time had outstanding definition but compared to modern games falls by the wayside. MoW:AS2 has rather detailed units that all manage to be unique, from the color of their uniform, to weapons, shadow casting all very solid. The damage of weapons fire against structures and enemy vehicles is realistic and believable, and many are designed to react accordingly when shot with enough large caliber rounds (structures crumble and fall, sandbags break and disintigrate, rocks chip and crack). All of it holds up quite well for its time. Sometimes however excessive particle effects such as fires or multiple launch rocket strikes can slow the game down briefly.Gameplay: 7/10; The sheer fact that the game has some of the most realistic reactions when it comes to combat compared to many (But not all) other RTS games is quite a feat, infantry must be managed carefully, and well-placed machine guns can cut your squad apart if not handled well. The game promotes good command, rewarding units with veternacy and better efficiency if theyre allowed to survive, and requires the player to think like a field commander might, scanning the map and wondering to themselves, ""If I were them, would -I- put an Anti-Tank gun there?"". In another interesting twist, it accomodates for cooperative activity as well, with multiple players all sharing command of units, transferring them between each other allowing you to split tactics evenly on the battlefield. The game makes room for some tactical stealth operations as well, however they are a bit, twitchy, and careful strategy and deployment can make them not require as much stealth as may have been intended. Lastly, combined arms are a must, as well as managing each units supplies, which will be covered in a moment...Sound: 6/10; The volume in the game is well put-together, and weapons sound as they should. Varying levels of bass and procussion depending on what size and caliber of weapon is being fired, as well as explisives. Grenades have a satisfying if short lived -crump-, while large caliber, 203mm B-4's have a crashing explosion as it redecorates the landscape. Sound varies nicely when you zoom in and out. For some of the single player Scenarios, the voice actors are rather sub-par however all sounding as though they were voiced by only one or two different VA's, however the gameplay does make up for this shortcoming, as you don't need to listen to them too often.Addictiveness and Depth: 8/10; Whoo, well if you want depth this is definitely the game for it. To start, the game is intensely realistic, this goes beyond knowing your men will be mowed down if they charge an emplaced machine gun nest, and into the world of logistics. Every man has its own inventory, and its up to the player to ensure that they stay supplied with weapons, medical equipment, ammunition, and special tools for certain tasks. Corpses of fallen enemies (Or comrades) can be looted for ammo and guns, and a smart commander can take full advantage of an enemy's mistake, perhaps the Germans giving up a Panzershreck to a British rifleman section, giving them a powerful anti-tank deterrent and saving the commander from having to deploy his own. Daunting at first, there are shortcuts as while each man can be supplied individually, moving the squad to ammo trucks, or having the squad leader scavenge bodies and vehicles will provide supplies to the whole unit making things easier. Keeping your units well outfitted with a variety of weapons is also important as no one unit is capable of everything, and you must support your tanks with infantry, taking into account enemy positions and equipment. The game can be incredibly fun to play as give and take happens on both sides of the battlefield, and varying game modes (As well as some from mods with a nod to Sir Hinkel's AS missions), which provide plenty to do and attempt.Overall: 7/10; The game is fun, engaging, and provides a great platform for tactical thinking, rewarding skillful maneuvers with that ""Finally!"" feeling when a particularly tough obstacle is removed, especially when the game throws a few surprises in during some of the Scenario missions, which can throw some serious wrenches into the works. A fun game to pick up for both single and multi-player gaming, especially among friends, as some of the sorties you can engage in will offer abundant challenge for all players involved.			"

												Now now, ladies and gentlemen - You are looking at one of the greatest World War 2 strategy games of all times! Why? Let me tell You all about it. Pros:*In this game - Your choices actually matter. Outcome of the battle can change very quickly depending on Your commands - having even twice as much infantry units can mean nothing if they are pushed forward against tanks or HMGs - unlike in CoH (Company of Heroes franchise) there are no heroes here - that means You can't just take a lot of infantry and push them directly to the heart of the battle and suspect them to succeed easily, because if they are away from cover - they are dead. Or likely to become in mere moments. *Balanced armies - You get what You pay. In this game You won't find a cheap unit that is too hard to deal with - all vehicles die quickly against right anti-armour tools, meaning the light units will explode instantly if hit by high caliber weapons. More expensive units mostly have longer range, slightly better armour, but still have to be used carefully.*Partial realism - this game tries to be as realistic as possible and still be fun to play. Now let's get to the ugly part.Cons:* A.I. is horrible. Some units commit suicide if left unchecked - they might flip themselves over some obstacle and explode. Other units will take worst possible route. Others will not obey Your commands the first time they get them.*Graphics are bad. Not very bad, but can be better - now they look like something from 2009.* Hard to learn to play - there are a lot of things to discover in this game. There's so much of them, it's almost impossible, because there are almost no in-game ability descriptions.Conclusion:If You got bored by CoH franchise - give this game a shot. You will probably like it a lot. Some aspects of MoW:AS2 are so good, they beat CoH! But there are many of flaws too, Imperfect, yet fun and very unique.			"

												Men of War Assault squad 2 (or just MOW) is in mine and many other Men Of War fans opinion the best RTS ever made and especially in comparison to games that got much greater acclaim (company of heroes) -criminally underrated. It is very much a realistic RTS in that tactics are very similar to how they were on a real WW2 battlefield.  I have 520 hours on the game and bear in mind I have been playing this game since the first Men of War was released.   MOW is at least compared to games such as company of heroes very realistic.  On tanks  for example there are no silly health bars to pound away at, and if you want to destroy a tank that is too powerful there are a number of options. Get behind him, flank him, or send in a commando with a rocket or grenade. That one man slowly crawling towards your hated online enemy (and in MOW while playing and especially losing you will despise your enemy!) can decide the whole outcome of the battle. Winning a battle especially against a smug but accomplished friend can leave you on a high all day and losing make you feel terribly bitter! Infantry is realistic too each soldier will have his powers and weaknesses but all soldiers caught out in the open will be obliterated if they come up against an enemy who is well dug in. In MOW it pays to be patient and keep calm but as the anger rises when things go wrong people tend to lose their heads and just charge their enemies neck throwing everything they possibly can at their opponent. This is a sure-fire way to lose and although fortune does indeed very often favour the brave and daring initiative you really do have to carefully think about what you are doing and surprise your enemy.  Very much like real war a good commander will have a good temperament and not be irritated or angered by his opponent keep calm and react well to his enemies’ choices.  I on the other had am more prone to raging buffoonery! One of the most important things in MOW is to control the map and have eyes everywhere and therefore know in advance everything your enemy is up too. A good opponent though will know this too and you will probably end up in a bitter struggle for every inch of earth! When you start up a MP game you will know very quickly the sort of opponent you are up against. Noobs will stay in there one precious flag attempting to turn it into their own personal Maginot line but good players will attack everywhere at once. Playing a good player can be soul destroying and you will think back lovingly to the last noob you crushed belatedly realizing how hollow your own sense of omnipotence had been. In MOW there are some seriously good players and a thousand different strategies.    MOW is a game in which you must make choices and react appropriately to your enemies’ choices. There are countless variations of playstyles -aggressive and defensive- and online you will encounter many different people and nationalities who will employ many different styles of play and battle tactics.  For example Chinese players play very well and very defensively. Defensive tactics work terribly for many of us MOW veterans but the Chinese can make it work. They have a system of which each step seems to have been meticulously worked out before hand and they don’t tend to deviate from the plan seeming to have a fastidious understanding of the tank positioning they are using as well as the armour and penetration statistics etc.   Honestly it’s the best RTS ever made in my opinion but online it’s also one of the most white knuckle and tensest gaming experiences I have ever had. A real heart in the mouth experience especially when playing a close friend it can often actually be a little bit too tense, but when you want to relax and have fun you can play 2v2 or 3v3 with other people.If you have never played this game before I highly recommend buying Men Of War Assault Squad origins as you will get the original single player campaign (an excellent campaign btw) as well as all of the MOW AS 2 multiplayer components but upgraded to the modern graphics engine. In short despite the fact it was always ignored by the mainstream media best RTS ever made and many people in the community agree with me. If only more RTS developers would follow its example.  "

								Very disappointing, it's just improved land graphics. Nothing else, two new maps, the rest from the original assault squad. Character models still look crappy, new voices, tanks look too shiny. So disappointed...			"

												If you have played men of war series this game is for you.And if you played Soldiers Heroes of World War 2; Face of war or just very similar game like these you will probably like this.This game is similar to Arma series but everything is in strategy. For example of realism and unreplaylebility once you lose battle in the same load you can load it back and then your squad may survive your enemy attack or maybe even to contra attack after attack. You can win whole game with one soldier if you are ,,very lucky,, (i mean very ... very lucky..)All explosions, flying parts can hurt or kill your units... Blast waves can throw your soldiers away and knock them out too so me careful in this game!!!About soldiers/vehicles/buildings:1.They have inventories (not whole squad i mean all your squad members have their own inventories)2.All dead bodies, cars can be looted if you need something.3.All vehicles can be repaired and used for yourself. (Yes you can steal enemy cars, tanks and ect. )4.All vehicles have their parts, some of them can be very easily destroyable and some of them not. In this game you dont care about health you care about your strategy and luck of avoid enemy shells and bullets...5.All vehicles can be destroyed and lose their parts. (Parts can flew off to difrent locations)6.If you loose part i mean its not broken but you totaly lost it... You can you can't glue it and fix it like this.7.Mostly of buildings can as cover (if its not wooden becouse wood isnt very good protection)8.Yes you can go in buildings. (you can hide in it and you can do ambushes form it)9. Buildings can be destroyed and you can make holes in them too. My verdict about this game:1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play "

												I have been extremely disappointed in the unprofessional and, in my opinion, very underhanded treatment of the purchasers of Digital Mind Soft's (DMS) Assault Squad 2 (AS2). The game had been advertised as a pre-order for a sequel to their first Assault Squad game with a lot of promised features. Myself and many other players purchased this pre-order under the assumption that DMS intended to meet this expectation. In order to be brief, DMS has fallen very short of their advertisement. They even went as far to change their game type from pre-order to ""Early Access"" when they failed to meet their release date twice. Suffice to say, we the customers are very upset and wish to share our disgust. The developers at DMS have chosen to bring on a community manager who makes it his business to completely remove any/all comments posted which even hints at disappointment in their decision to change the game to being ""Early Access"" at the last second. They have even began censoring all comments, reviews, or chat, that expresses any dissatisfaction in their product at all! Please take an administrative interest in the AS2 Steam forum. Like I said, many customers like myself feel that it is completely unethical for DMS to exercise this level of censorship. We are justified in being dissatisfied and have an obligation to voice this dissatisfaction to deter DMS from completely ostracizing the AS2 community.  DMS is clearly showing a complete lack in ability to plan and execute the launch of their new product, including proper risk mitigation.  It's a wonder that 1C can continue to support their fly-by-night software development practices.  This game barely has all the features that the first game had and is extremely glitchy and unplayable.  Stay away, you've been warned.			"

												The game is just like MoW 1 and even has a few of the exact same skirmish missions. Multiplayer takes a while to find a game though like the first game the gameplay is good and easily playable. Dont get the game if you have the first as their is no real difference. =), And their seems to be a lack of attraction to the skirmishes in various nations if youve played the first game.			"

												Well, where to start.....I have every Men of War game, including the lame Red Tide and limited Vietnam. What about MoWAS2?It is actually a very POOR revamp of the original game, you may ask why?I have started the USA campaign, only to find its actually the first game only worse.You can't move the map, the game stutters like its having a fit.The stupid vehicle run into everything going and flip over rendering them useless.The other games had a unload option, this doesn't, the map options appear to be limited.This is not a singeplayer aimed game its actuallly more geared to get everyone online to battle it out.I have nothing against online battles, but they could have actually come up with something new, they haven't.Very disappointed...almost wish I hadn't bought this now, ok there may the odd different mission further in the campaigns, but this isn't enough. Whats happened to the originallity of the other games?Whats with the stupid icons over the top of the units? They only get in the way, so when you click on a unit you end up with a unit you never collected......please !!!So to recap...nothing but a revamp with awful attempts to add things that become unwanted,....I'm going back to the original MoW and MoWAS at least the developers tried to do something...unless things change, its been a waste of money and the game will probably just sit in my library unplayed.DISSAPOINTED MoW fan....

												If you are new and interested in single player and COOP, then for the price of AS2 you can get AS1, MoW and Red Tide.  Just look for sales on the Net. Those games come with highly recommended mods, so make sure you look for them.  AS2 has very limited new content: it has all AS1 missions, plus  3 new missions (3 same scripts copied and pasted 5 times over to make an illusion of 15 new missions). I didn't buy this game for new content, but because I wanted to play MP. If you are into PvP, then I would recommend waiting until they (1.) fix performance because it is very laggy and frustrating; (2)  fix matchmaking, which is easily exploitable, unbalanced due to unfair progression system and played on many unfair maps.  Pls, ask about performace and matchmaking on the forum before buying this game. In terms of gameplay,  I would say it is not bad but it failed to improve upon AS1. Shorter ranges and changed penetration values made lots of units less useful, if not useless, esp. light armoured TDs. What really affects gameplay are maps. Ranked maps lack consistency: intead of reducing player count for each map systematically, they decided to make, for example, Urban Garden playable for 1v1s and 2v2s. Moreover, 2v2 maps range from tiny maps like Tramwayz  or Urban Garden to very big  like Lakeland or Town. Maps badly need more steamlining. We only got  7 new MP maps: one 1x1, two 2x2 and four 3x3 or 8x8 depending on the mode you play. Good news is that they are not bad. Another thing that seems to help with gameplay is new interface.  I find the new interface a bit better and I like the smg, rifle and MG icons for infantry. Double clicking on one unit will select same units within camerea view. But the grenade/TNT timers are aweful.All in all, I recommend patience. We've been waiting for this game to get fixed for 6 months now. So there is no telling when the dream patch will come out. But when it comes out, I hope to see you in the battefield, because well-matched games on  good maps can be really exciting.			"

												Fun game, awesone serries.Wrecked by lag.If you do not have a high performance computer, don't buy this game. You will not enjoy the jerking camera, the non responsive units, delayed commands, mission critical units doing as they please, units destroied not by stupidity or cunning, but buy lag.In short, my comp runs at an average of 1.5x better than the reccomended specs and the game now runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥The updates have made things worse, and support tickets have not resoved any issues when they have been finnally answered.The problem persists across a number of people I play with and should you purchase the game be aware that single player and lan are the only options - internet multiplayer doesn't work consistantly and people drop from games if it takes too long to load/ sync/ place first unit - and I should mention they dont have a choice (the game does it for you, even if you were first to load with highest performance)on the whole, go back to the origional men of war.

												Just bought the game cause the videos und the pics looked good, so I thought... but honestly this game for 30 Euros is just a very bad joke. Graphic sucks (empire earth1), many clipping bugs, mission is always ""conquer the area"", .. if you do so you'll get armored vehicles like tanks, then go on and on and on...without any story.By the way you can order as many units you want ,in case they die. - that is absolutely nonrealistic, you don't need any resources anyway. That makes this game really boring very soon. You don't need tactis also ,cause you have unlimited units.so once you realised that you throw them to the opponent and reorder some new when they died.Other bad thing are the maps.. they always look similar. Your ways to attack the opponent is quite set cause of the tight maps, you haven't much abilitys like to attack the opponents back. Sound is also from very older days, it's hard to seperate gun shots from tank shots. My opinion: the game ain't worth any money.I'm upset cause i wasted so much money. Absolutely not comparable to Company of Heroes, I really never never played such a bad strategic game... I really don't know where all the good reviews come from..			"

												Most of what I saw might not make sense to somebody who has not played the original, but it needs to be said.First off, the optimization is horrible. On the same graphics level as the original MoW: AS, it somehow manages to run worse. In the original MoW: AS, I managed to make 40+ FPS on Medium. In this, I can make perhaps 10-15 on the lowest of all settings, somehow still looking far worse than MoW: AS. It seems to have traded my frames for a /shiny/ interfacy and oh-so-fancy squad icons.Secondly, the AI 'improvements' are actually downgrades. I am serious. I have seen my guys go into battle with no ammo in their weapns despite having an inventory full of it. They don't seem to see the need to reload until they are half a meter from the enemy. There is also no option to reload them for the selected unit, when there used to be. It was valuable.Units seem to have epileptic fits trying to target opjects and move around, whilst vehicle turn in circles whilst trying to pathfind around bushes. 'look into' and 'target' commands for infantry takes seconds to register, while the AI for the enemy launches precision-guided grenades and wields sniper Submachineguns, neither of which you shall ever be able to repeat.Soldiers hop out of cover and stand in the open at the slightest provication, and refuse to lay down on the damned ground when the 'stance' button is pressed.The maps added are tiny, even for the 8v8 ones, and are something that a beginner to the editor could reproduce in an hour of work. They are also incredibly uninspired: Half of the time, they seem copied wholesale from other maps, whilst half a dozen train tracks were moved elsewhere, and some sandbags added.The map view is also seriously wrong. Allies in white? I can't tell where half of them are. And incoming/outgoing fire seems far smaller now, leading to moments of confusion as I try to figure out where any fighting is at.The only good thing I can see in this is Steam Workshop support, and even that is pathetic if I can't even play the game correctly.I feel bad that my friend bought this for me, even if I didn't pay a cent. I also feel bad for every single person who is new to the series who buys this, thinking that 'newer is better'. It's not, and this ain't.Buy the first game. Hell, buy Men of War: Vietnam... THAT train wreck is better than this. Unless this undergoes quite a few updates to improve optimization, add additional content, and actually MAKE it a new game, I will not be recommending this to any of my friend.EDIT:A few months later, I have a few more comments about it.You shouldn't even think of buying this sold-as-a-full-game DLC. Devs are greedy. It's basically the same as Assault Squad one, except you have to unlock units in multiplayer, the AI is more ♥♥♥♥, the game runs terribly, and they have added bots to online... As $10 DLC.They have precisely the same levels as the previous one, with a few more tiny, token maps added, ones that are poorly designed in my opinion.This is garbage, and I would fully recommend the previous Men of War. Even if you can't do regular online because the Devs didn't bother keeping servers online after Gamespy shut down in order to force people into this, you can at least have fun.			"

												The ""game"" is simulation. If you've ever wondered how a King Tiger provoked nothing but terror, what a Bofors cannon would do to a village, or how the MG-42 ambushed it's prey, well this game's for you. It's as graphically stunning as it is enlightening. I've learned more about mid century warfare from this game than any predecessor.  The amount of tools and tanks you get at your disposal leaves nothing to desire. Learn how mortars and MGs compliment each other and utilize single soldiers at the touch of a key. In this game there is ""no god"" or little to no random number generating. If you don't like how a unit is performing hit a key and micromanage it to victory. Hammer windows with high explosive tank rounds and push into crippled landscapes with your wily storm troopers. The games not at fault, the hick-ups lie in the animations and AI. These should not deter your purchase. This game is striving for the moon in realism. It's essentially a WW2 sandbox with a decent campaign and extremely fun multiplayer.When you Play Men of War: Assault Squad 2 you feel as tho you can relate to Rommel. The struggle is real. Those generals had a lot of variables to consider, and now so do you.			"

												Assault Squad 2 is the closest thing to a scam that I have seen on Steam. The whole reason for its existence was to be running on a new engine, with the benefits of better performance and visuals. I was willing to accept this as the only real improvement over the previous MoW games, and that honestly would have been enough for me. However, this game runs just as poorly, if not worse than older games, and hardly looks any better. So not only did the performance never change, everything else has been copy-pasted from the old games. I didn't expect a new game, but I expected a playable game. No matter what kind of hardware you have, it runs horribly. You will be lucky to get a constant 30 fps on a Titan. It actually makes the game unplayable for me, and probably for most people. So without successfully changing anything from Assault Squad 1, these guys re-released it with a number 2 on it actually and have the balls to charge $35 for it! Oh and don't even get me started on the whole early access bait and switch. Products like this are foreshadowing a rather bleak future for Steam in general. I cannot believe Valve are letting companies get away with such fraud.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm so disappointed with this game after a good review I was convince to buy it coz i'm fan of   RTS (simulation, war base) game so I bought it to play and feel like cheated the review seems of scale but the game experience really the opposite.There isn't real skirmish in game everything seems a mission, campaign on  different faction has all similar mission just been modified little bit it's really a  bit annoying no thought giving on it. It's no challenge and not innovative.  it's still buggy and always giving me out of memory  on my game and I have good hardware lol.I can't seems find aswell opponent on multiplayer not sure maybe because im in southeast asia? and few player or it feels like ♥♥♥♥?  The opposite there is a lot of workshop mission and map but right now? I cant recommend it not sure why I bother to bought it without downloading crack version to test it before getting♥♥♥♥♥♥off... haiz.			"

												EDIT: This review was made before the shut down of gamespy so therefore it was obvious that we could just go back and play Assault Squad 1, however we can't do this anymore. So unfortunatly the multiplayer is still quite 'broken' in AS2 compared to predecessors. However they have improved it a lot since launch, for example you can manage to play a least a 2v2 now. I have always been a huge Men of War fan. I own and played every single Men of War released and never got tired of them. Even when people were dissapointed with Men of War Vietnam I still loved it.When I saw a Men of War Assault Squad 2 coming out I was so excited. I already pumped 400+ hours into the first Assault Squad cause I loved playing it so much. When I got AS 2 and started to play, it was a disaster. The game only adds two or three new units and is a horrible remake of the original Assault Squad. Due to random lag spikes the game is barly playable more than a 3v3 in the multiplayer and lets not even mention the de syncs! Getting disconnected mid game is simply unacceptable for a full fledged game in 2016! With the new implemented idea of units needing to be unlocked once you reach a certain level makes the game unbalanced and unrealistic. Also the graphics are a tad better only for mainstream factions. For example, the Japanese vehicals look like they are ports from Assault Squad 1, same with a few other vehicals in the game, not retextued at all. I can guarantee this is not worth it's current price. Getting it on sale for $10 or under sure. Nevertheless, it is an alright game game, it has to be because it's the exact same thing as the first one. But overall, I don't know about you guys, but I wouldn't pay $35 for a reskin. Coming to a conclusion, I realize this game is a step in the wrong direction. The unit lock by levels, the auto resupply, the WAY overpriced DLC... it seems DMS is copying the ways of it's rival, Company of Heroes 2. We are loosing what makes the Men of War franchise unique and this game shows it. At least we are not to far gone and can still make a return of the original feeling of Men of War.			"

												Single player of Assault Squad series are lacking the depth of the original Men of War games and expansions, but can be played with a friend in coop mod. Multiplayer, however, aint working that well.The game carries the same engine since 2006 and the issues of this engine are traveling with it. It seems like that to play this game properly everyone who runs it should have good performance and connection and even if one player got lags or fps drops - everyone will suffer from it. And from my expirience that happens in every game. And even if you assume it runs OK for everybody you have a game where you have to control a lot of units and the game doesnt offer you enough means to do that like other strategy or tactic games.It might be worth it to get it on -75% sale, but pay the full price for that? No.I wish i could give this game a positive review, but until this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ peer-to-peer connection method exist i wont. Even Relic managed to get rid of it.			"

												This game is my absolute favorite speaking of rts games. it comes with all the options someone could ask for.great map/mission editor inclusive.You can have massive battles with tons of tanks and arty,you can also have infantry squad based, storydriven stealhgameplay in which you e.g. need to lead a group of airbornes to infiltrate a german flakbase.You can also have both at the same time.to top it all, the   multiplayer   is great. its possible to launch an 8vs8 battle, though, it can causeserious lags and performance drops - depending on the match's option ofc. 2vs2, 3vs3 or 4vs4 is no problem most of the times. gamemodes are battlezones (in which you need to capture flagzones, if you keep more than the enemy,your team will gain points). combat (in which you get points for destroying enemy units)and some variations of those. you can set the options like how high the pointscap will be, the maximum of how many troops someone can call in or lead at once, etc all yourself.hundrets of different vehicles and units like mortars, mgs, howitzers are awaiting you. the   content   is amazing. mods will deliver you even more, high detailed units or even whole factions.  micromanagment   is a big thing in this game, though you dont need to take care of each soldiers inventory (yes, thats actually possible). every soldier has a name, skills and his job. you would need to control a soldier to throw a nade into a good spot here and then, but most of the times you will find yourself controlling your favorite tank and hunt down others in direct mode.speaking of   direct mode  , its the thing which seperates it from other ww2 rts games most, imo. you can, if you want, control single units in WASD mode, use the weapon or other items (even throwing knives for the fun of it). nothing is more satisfying than hitting an enemy tank into its ammo depot (the game is doing a great job in hitboxes) in direct mode, causing a huge explosion which will destroy the buildings around it, including the snipers in them. mmh. feels gud man. if you want to make a map yourself, do it. the   editor   is a quite easy tool to make super detailed maps, waiting to get released on the workshop. there are plenty tutorials on youtube or on communityhub. i have created a few of them my own, its worth to get the game only for checking out my incredible beautiful maps.the   mods   will let this game staying alive for long long time. star wars, realism mods, a mod in which you play the sp campaing of call of duty mw2, terminator mod schwarzenegger style, mods which will let you explore the modern war or just simple skinpacks or soundpacks - all available here on steamworkshop.easy installation and setup.if you now think   ""meh, all i was asking for is a simple rts game""  , its simple if you want. a simple rts game in which you can call in infantry and tanks to destroy the opposingarmies and conquer some ground. but you can go deeper if you like. alot more deeper. and its always better to go deeper no homo.if you want to learn more, about the details or whatever, feel free to send me a friendsrequest here on steam. o/			"

												I've always loved the MOW series and I've always loved the series. But for some reason, this game looks exactly like the first one. The only thing really special about it is more single player missions, and mods, but trust me, these mods aren't exactly an ""amazing"" thing. I always played with mods on my game, until one day the  ""Sir Hinkels Maps"" mods broke my game. So, typically I haven't been able to play it in over months. Also, multiplayer isn't any different either! It looks exactly like Men of War Assault Squad! Honestly, I see nothing special in this game. For one, the mods can break the game very eaisly (if you have more then 1 mod activated) aswell as it looking EXACTLY like the first title. So no, I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												I bought this game twice, and feel scammed.  It's basically the exact same game as Assault SquadProof.  http://imgur.com/a/OGl1lCan't tell the difference? Good.  You're paying for the 'privilage' to use multiplayer since gamespy shut down Digital Mindsoft stopped supporting the superior first game and used this sad excuse of an 'upgrade'  to make a quick buck.   Multiplayer uses some halfassed steam support which has no inclusive chat lobby and therefore cannot retain a playerbase which was a concern for the first game but a killer for this one.  Design decisions made such as unit locking/leveling and obvious timer displays for grenades were implemented to cater to CoH players and make the transition for them easier but served as an annoyance and dumbing down of the core game for me.  But,  don't dare criticize the game or you will be censored, hard.  Observe ban reason.  http://imgur.com/a/gFufq  Update 06/10/2014 decided to give it a go again for posterity.   During 'early' access the game was laggy, it still is.  There's a reason there's no one online playing it right now. i7-3770K  NVIDIA GTX 670, 8 gigs of ram, no reason for it to run like this other than bad coding.oh, want to save and watch game replays?  cough up another $12 for the DLC that allows you to do that.Update 9/6/2014 - still terrible.Update 10/18/2014 - still terrible.Update 01/11/2015 - still terrible.Update 02/03/2015 - about where it should have been at release			"

												I really want to like this game. It could be way better than company of heroes in that its more realistic, focuses more on actual combat, way more variety of units especially tanks, more countries to play as and so on. Unfortunately everytime I play it doesn't take long until I get annoyed and frustrated with it. If the developers can fix some of these issues with the game it will severely improve the experience. Here are my reasons I dislike this game:1. The vehicle pathfinding is really frustrating. The vehicles will often drive into trees and get stuck, or take the most illogical routes through a village possible.2. Tanks are pratically useless. Forget the terrifying panzers feared by allied infantry during ww2, because in this game almost all infantry can just spam attack them with AT grenades and destroy them instantly.3. There is no notification that your units are under attack. This always happens to my defended positions. The game doesn't tell you anything, I will often look away for 10 seconds and look back and all my squads are dead.4. Smoke grenades are useless. I don't know what their current in game function is but the certainly dont provide cover from enemy machinegunners.5. The infantry ai are really dumb. I don't feel like I'm commanding real soldiers, but instead stiff robotic drones that require me to tell them to duck when under fire or move away when a grenade is right at their feet. Apparently none of these soldiers have instincts or basic training. They often will run straight into enemy fire for no reason and get killed when trying to throw a grenade rather than crawl, and take forever to fire a rocket launcher at a tank, usually just standing there frozen.6. Some of the specialty units suck. When I saw you could get paratroppers I assumed you could drop them in behind enemy lines, but instead the just spawn exactly where everything else does. Kind of a let down.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is extremly fun. Multiplayer is as fun as ever and single player is a lot more branched out......for a whole 3 missions. Then theres a repeat of the old assault squad missions combined wiht the fact that the game randomly crashes for NO REASON i cant recommend this game also there's two missing factions which is inexcusable to me to even be a factor. I understand what Early access is but to not even have all the factions completed is unacceptable. This is a game for fans of the series who know how to tolerate the missing aspect of the game but enjoy the new and fun aspects to the game. As for everyone else i cant recommend this.			"

												It's a very strange game. It's good, but bad at the same time. Well, not bad but it does have it's share of flaws. The gameplay is really good, it's very in-depth and tactical, if you ever learn how to play it. There's almost no tutorial at all, you have to go into the controls settings and learn them yourself. The graphics are great, the sound is amazing, and the gameplay is fluid. What it lacks is a good story, a good tutorial and a good singleplayer. Even though most MoW fans mainly play multiplayer, 1C could have stepped it up more on the singleplayer. The story is really dull. Probably the biggest flaw to this game is how similar it is to MoW:AS1, which was an amazing game. It would seem that a game that is similar to it's predecessor would be equally as good, but somehow this is worse. I reccomend it, but MoW:AS1 is just a whole lot better.			"

												A huge waste of time.Men of War is one of my favorite series but this is just a joke. Instead of having a new solid base for multiplayer they achieved the impossible and made it worse than gamespy. You can litteraly take 2 hours trying to launch a game. And if by miracle you start playing, you only get horrible performance and lag because the game has been patched up to death over the years and this frankenstein of a game is absolutely not fit anymore to run as a client hosted game.Don't buy if you want to play online.

												I've now managed to rack up 136hrs on this game, yet I haven't regreted a minute of it. The extensive detail in the models, landscape and particle effects, enables this game to come to life with its realistic qualites. The game has also a good length campagn with multiple missions for each of the 5 factions. Each of these missions will take up through my experince a minimum of 30min. MoW have also included online gamplay adding more depth to the game if you enjoy the more socail and interactive parts. The multiplayer is similar yet different where the gamplay is more fast paced. I find it is more stratigic as you are competing against another person and relies more on points you earn via holding objectives. It reminds me off other games such as Dawn of War and Company of Heroes, yet I would argue this is a far better game.MoW have also included an Editor section of the game where you are given the power to do what anything you want whith the extense options and diverstiy of viechles and units. This is where I have spent most of my time and probably my favorite part of the game. This 'sandbox' is what I think distinguishies this from any other similar genres. And this alone would be a reason why I would urge you to purchase it. The game was launched in 2014 and boy it could have been launched now and still I would be inpressed by what the creatures have done with this game. Definatly worth £19.99 and as it is the halloween sale whilst I'm reviewing why ould not spend £4.99!?However their are aspects which I do not necessarly agree on, this includes: The fireing range of the figures and their awarness to their surroundings (hopefully this shall be worked upon in future MoW games), the programing and use of planes and boats and the hitpoints the figures have been programed with. - Firing range and awarness. If you find this slightly anoying as I do their are mods such as Robs Realism mod which perfects the game (in my opinion) giving greater firing range and awarness to the units. However I do feel that the MoW need to work on how the units use the environment to flank, hide behing cover and retreat/advance.- Planes and boats.This is another aspect of the game im slightly upset by as this would of been revolutionary if they managed to pull this off. If they made using planes and boats as easy as using tanks and units it would of made this game even better and definatly a must buy (not saying that its not). For example if the ai could controll the planes or boats, and maybe a deeper and more critiqual look to the detail in the sky maybe a view where you can see dog fights happening and another view like the one there is already installed in the game?-Hitpoints and Hitboxes.This is my last criticism of the game, even though this is a minor point I would of prefered if the units had hitboxes for certain parts of their body. e.g. Headshot = double damage and leg = half damage etc... However these are minor things and shouldnt sway your decision for not investing your time and money.I hope this has helped any prospective buyers or anyone just interested or have the game. "

												This game is fantastic. I'll never have enough words to fully describe how much I love it.PROS:- Graphics are incredibly good, tanks look very realistic.- MANY types of vehicles and infantry to spawn and control.- The game is hard,even when you're fighting the AI.- THE GAME IS ACTUALLY HARD (unless you play on easy,buddy)- Maps are many and beautyful. There are maps set in Russia, Mongolia, China, Normandie,the Pacific, Germany,Africa and many other places. Each map is a little interactive masterpiece. I am not even talking about the community maps.- Tired of your soldiers being autistic? You can take direct control of anything from heavy tank destroyers to basic soldiers or even supply trucks( I like to drive them when bored).- The game is easily moddable, there are many wonderful mods.- Do you like a challenge? There are many achievements only 0.3% players have. Try to get'em all!- The game is highly competitive and skill based. You can clutch the battle with a single soldier (done that once myself in a single player scenario). On the other side, it does not forgive mistakes. You can lose your top tank in a matter of seconds if someone manages to throw an AT grenade or dynamite in your engine.- Tired of missions, mods and multiplayer? You can make your maps, and even your missions! Editor is incredibly deep, it gives you unlimited freedom and supports the majority of mods.- The physics and destructability of the game are stunning. The shell can bounce off one enemy tank and explode another. The whole map can be turned into ruins if you have enough artillery.- You are not just 'playing' as a commander. YOU ARE a commander in this game.CONS:- Missions feel copypasted for every nation... Yes, the map changes, but main objectives are constant.This is irritating.- The price is quite high. Yes, this game is a masterpiece, but still,quite expensive. Get it during sales.- DLC's are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but at least you get to add bots into your local game with 'Airborne'.- Some units (even the 'special' ones) prove to be useless. But most games have weapons/units/items decent players never use.All in all, this game is almost perfect. This game is not going to bore you,you can play it for hundreds of hours, especially if you do it with your buddies. I am quite upset that this game is not an e-sport discipline yet.			"

												Digital Mindsoft is one of the most disgusting development companies I have ever experienced. The game has major issues and should not have been released. It is still in beta. Releasing when it did killed the community. I wanted better performance both for multiplayer and just in general, better graphics, more maps, more units, etc. We got like 2 new maps, graphics are the same, and performance is worse than MoWAS1. We also got a lame leveling system to unlock units and lost hundreds if not thousands of players in the process.This should have been a free patch because the only reason it was ""created"" was the old multiplayer hositng was shut down.  There is nothing in this game to make it a sequel or version 2.  It is the same game, but worse in numerous ways. I am extremely disappointed in Digital Mindsoft as I love this game, but it is just so poorly executed and unpolished it ruins playing it.			"

												The game is an unimaginative rehash of first MoW:AS, has no campaign to speak of (there is a single-player mode, but it has no story, instead focusing on tug-of-war style gameplay that gets old after 10 minutes) and in every way the same or inferior to previous Men of War titles. There is no new content at all, and no new functionality, barring Steam Workshop support.Constant crashes and unacceptable performance for an engine that was used half a dozen times already (I have nothing against GEM, but there is no excuse for time-tested engine like GEM to drop to 3 FPS in multiplayer), with braindead tech support team that seems to get their answers from Steam community forums doesn't help either.Hell, the fact that the devs shut down MoW:AS servers so anyone at all would buy AS2 should speak for itself. MoW:AS2 is akin to a mod, there is no way in hell this can be called a new game.TL;DR♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, incompetent devs, buy MoW/FoW instead.			"

I only paid £3.50, and would suggest it is overpriced at that.The fact that it includes a map editor, as did AS1, leaves me wondering why the publisher coudnt have taken the time to build an entire set of new maps at the very least.Dont buy this if you have AS1, and wait for the price to drop again if you dont.

Early Access Review
								Wheres the game I purchased???I pre-ordered this title and got into the ""closed-beta"".  The game was rough, no campaign, just a few single player ""skirmish"" type missions.  I played the game a bit (atleast a few hours, my time played doesnt reflect the scenario skirmish i played for some reason), and I saw no REAL difference from their earlier games in the series, MoW;AS/etc (oh, besides the missing CAMPAIGN!!!!) and put it down to wait for the full release on the 19th. Today, release date rolls around and ............EARLY ACCESS status ???? What ?!!!!!!!!!This is an outright swindle, I pre-purchased with the impression that the title was to be FULLY RELEASED on the release date, and not into an EARLY ACCESS title.... Why 'pre-purchase' an early access title? There was no warning of this, it was not displayed on the store page, and the cost of the title warranted a COMPLETE/FULL (near AAA) release on release date, not a messed up early access, unfinished pile of trash.  The negative reviews are not represented underneath the title properly when they have many helpful 'clicks' from users.Oh yeah, not to mention the title isnt even ready on the 19th, wow. Early Access on the 20th?This purchase is seriously making me re-think ever buying another game on steam, the early access overkill is bad enough, now they have to do NINJA EARLY ACCESSS for $30!!!!. I am definitely never buying nothing from this developer again and probably never buying another non-AAA (and vouched for, released, and reviewed by proper journos) title off steam again.I'm going back to pirating peices of trash like this, good job steam/devs/early access theivery.

												This is one of the games i wish steam had a maybe button for. For starters my type of strat game is a Total War game.This game is decent in its self, but the campagin is the exact same has the first game. That being said you're mainly going to be playing mutliplayer, but thats my main problem. The multiplayer in this game has huge balancing issues, and the fact that there is a gigantic lag issue when playing with people. The lag causes your game to drop to around 15 fps and all your troops animations look super choppy as a result. Not to mention this makes direct controll a pain. Also, there are large amounts of exploits in this game making balance even worse. I.e. enemy tank is out of your range so you direct controll your tank and shoot a tree that is infront of your tank and the enemy.  ( dont believe there is a drop off for shell pen btw.) Single player was pretty fun, but I hate this games multiplayer, its espescially hard for new people because no one will put up with or teach them. Normaly your team either leaves you because of it, or starts greifing, etc.The pros:good armor pen machanicsMovements orders are ok, pretty glitchy a lot of times though.Good modding community(thats going to mean a lot, the base game is super bland)Editor is pretty fun(400 flame throwers vs 20 mg42 machine gunners? Why not!)Again the tanks are really fun to mess with peopleDirect controll is amazingly stupid and funny.(Smg preferably ppsh +at nades= Super Salty enemy)Fairly competetive mp scene(I dont really like that but some do so im listing it)MODS(Yea I know i listed it before)Game is pretty fun to play mp or coop with friends(The only friend I played this game with is a♥♥♥♥♥who hordes all the points to buy troops with btw then complains he has nothing while I cap points with a single guy kek)For me this game isnt really worth anywhere near $30, and the fact that this company puts stupid DLC out that doesnt even work. I'd price the game at around $15 being generous. In other words this is just a more broken MOWAS and mp works.			"

												Thought this was going to be an rts more along the lines of Company of Heroes but more for the realistic. What is this game then? Commandos. Purely and entirely commandos, you control what units they give you for a mission and thats it. Most missions start you off in a base getting assaulted then you have to push out. To be honest the depth of this game is so light that for the discount price of 10$ bucks I could of payed for a friend to have Company of heroes 1 with the mode eastern front instead.			"

												Thinking about purchasing Men of War Assault Squad 2? Let me tell you my thoughts on this historical relic.Pros --* First, this is a Strategy-Based game!* Second, really fun with friends!* Third, has a co-op mode!* Fourth, Workshop Support!Cons --* First, Multiplayer community can be cancerous.* Second, this can be difficult to run on low-end systems.* Third, no actual story, just a campaign to show you the ropes.* Fourth, watch your flank out there! The enemy can sneak around you!Overall --Would I recommend this game? Yes, but I'd recommend playing with a friend. If you don't like it, you can always refund. Just remember,  less than 2 hours, refund within 14 days.  "

												How do you call something robbing itself apart while the nejadná only the copying of intellectual ideas or gaming machine. This is a copy of the game almost 1: 1, which is not trying to sell as a completely new title! It is therefore self-plagiarism. And although we have a similar feats in the world of games and unfortunately almost wont Shooting from different titles in the RTS, it is really new. Welcome to zero innovation, welcome to Men of War: Assault Squad 2!Let's therefore good order. The Men of War Assault Squad 2 is not a campaign in the true sense, but here is instead a system similar skirmish battles as in other RTS games. Thus, one can select from five different parties to the conflict WW2. Namely, these are Germany, the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and finally the Japanese empire. It all sounds very good, the choice is really varied, at least ostensibly, but now back to reality.Men of War Assault Squad MenuMission unfortunately are not only similar, but directly consistent with those for the other fraction. Thus, for example, in the first mission for the US must take part of the map, then show prestrihová animation, which will be destroyed by Allied tank and the game will offer you this tank repair and steal it. Lala him in the first mission for the Germans, which, however, takes place during the battle for North Africa there is the same situation and that is, the player conquers the part of the map, then appears prestrihová animation where the tank of your ally destroyed and you will be offered a repair appropriation of this machine. Really great, so that was not enough, some of these maps are taken already from the previous games Men of War Assault Squad, where the first mission in the US was on the same map as the second mission in the Assault Squad 2, namely in Normandy during the D day . I do not now just the same situation, so check out, but the same map with the same layout of buildings, soldiers, and just to all, that copy 1: 1, even with the same voice in speech, the Commander, which gives you the same commands, as in the previous parts!Men of War Assault SquadSo innovative we point zero and even more below. Let's summarize but also other parts of the game. In principle, the game works on the same basis as its predecessor. Thus, the player starts on the map, which is littered with enemy units and always after the conquest of a certain part of the map was made available to the new unit, which the player can call for support. At the beginning of the map is therefore possible to call you only infantry teams, support teams, such as mortars and machine guns, then it is possible to summon support for light vehicles and, ultimately, tanks, or even aviation and artillery salvos. Depending on the selected difficulty is then derives the procedure on these maps, which will make the enemy attacks to have captured points, or the player that was tormented lightning counterattack, respectively. well coordinated offensive. This whole artificial intelligence and the behavior of units is not completely copied already from the first game.Graphically the game looks almost identical to the previous work and there is no appreciable forward. The only corrections waited icons infantry teams, where orange, or yellow tape over their character sygnalizuje ability to deal with vehicles, so they carry a kind of form of anti-tank weapons, such as. German Panzerschreck or British anti-tank rifle Boys. Yes, this is the only real change from the previous episode! Mowas2 iconAudio is well and where each faction has dubbed voices and various commands directly under the jurisdiction of their nation. This means that the Germans will speak German, Japanese will again use the Japanese language, and the like. This element, however, there is again no longer from the previous part. Nadôvažok, all voices used in this game are recycled as different from the previous work and even music in the opening menu is identical, respectively. copied from Men of War Assault Squad!Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a disappointment and a colossal dimensions. Studio, which stands for the development of this game is no great AAA studio subsidized milionovej huge investments of its multi-million publisher, but this is really unforgivable. Selling the same game, with almost zero innovation, copying all files from previous work and selling de facto the same game, just updated to the new build is such a thing unheard of and be ticked off even before it was seizing other studies and other publishers . If you're a fan of strategies and the Second World War, so I prefer to buy the first episode, because Men of War Assault Squad is definitely worth it. If you have not already played or own previous works, so choose carefully if you want to invest a further circa 30 € to its exact copy.			"

												TL;DR  Lots of fun. Skill required. Totally multiplayer oriented. Recommended.This is definitely the best RTS I have ever played. The game itself is really well balanced. Multiplayer provides you with countless possiblities of destroying other players what appears to be way more entertaining than fighting AI. MoW:AS2 is meant to be played on multiplayer, that's why the skirmishes are so poor in content. What I find to be really interesting about MoWAS: - Stealth, you can generaly hide one of your soldiers in the bushes, waiting for the enemy tanks to approach and immediately destroy at least one of them using AT grenades. The enemy won't be able to spot you without using his own infantry. That's what makes the game feel like a real combat experience. Tanks will always be in need of support, otherwise the enemy will be able to ambush them with ease. - Micromanagement, every unit has a certain amount of ammunition. They can quickly run out of it so you need to make sure that they have got a steady source of ammo. In multiplayer you can simply call a resupply truck which will fully automatically replenish ammunition of your soldiers. Simple, but makes the game way more difficult. - Direct control, you can take control of every single unit that is available in the game. If you feel like you want to do something yourself - do it. It's simple as that. - Destructible environment, not much to say. You can turn every single building into ruin.  - Unit accuracy and damage, I love the way developers programmed that part of the game. Units deal high damage depending on their distance between them and their enemy, so it's really easy to build a line of defence which can't be simply rushed.  - Great vehicle armour mechanics, every vehicle has it's armour. Some are thick, some are not. In MoWAS you need to learn which tanks are going to be destroyed by 76mm gun and which ones require some more firepower. It took my hours to understand what are my tanks capable of.Things that I find annoying or poorly made: - Singleplayer, it basically does not exist. There are skirmishes, but it's nothing interesting in them. - Pathfinding, if you order your troops to run to a certain position then sometimes they might take the longest possible route. - Projectile penetration, sometimes a panzerfaust projectile might get stuck in bale of wheat, you know - standard stuff.

												Being an avid Company of Heroes fan, I figured I'd try this game out as it seems to have many facets of realism most other RTS games do not. Well I was right, it does have that realism. Unfortunatley, it's so realistic that it takes away from the ""fun"" aspect of the game in a sense. Don't get me wrong its a solid game, and I wish I paid $10 or $15, not $35, leaving me kind of wishing I could get that money back. Also I've noticed the game has some stability issues, and an excessive amount of lag on a computer that surpasses the recommended requirements for the game. All in all I would wait for this game to be reduced to atleast $15 before buying it. My score would be a 6.5/10.			"

												Ahh Men of War: Assault Squad 2, very good game.If you like RTS games and WW2 games this is one game for you, MOW:AS 2 is quite an enjoyable game but yet at times it can be a time consuming RTS game also a quick heads up here-->, (please note that this game is a bit CPU intensive). If you are new to the game some missions on the campaign will probably take you hours or even alot of minutes, but do not worry too much, with a reasonable amount of hours of playing the game you will eventually get uset to the game and you will probably be able to get through all the mission easily on the easy difficulty, also I do not recommend going straight into a battle that isn't matchmaking on multiplayer, otherwise it will be frustrating considering all the skilled players out there that play unranked games alot, but anyways this game has a wide variety of units if you looked in the trailer and 5 different countries to play as, (U.S.A,Germany,USSR,Britain and imperialist Japan).With that said I do highly reccomend MOW:AS 2 to anyone out there that loves RTS games.Now go and have fun and destroy whatever country you are going to v.s.

												I have always wanted a game that brings a somewhat real experience when fighting a battle in a major war. A battle isn't easy, you can't just relax and let everything else automatically win for you(unless you're incompetent), especially when you are the commander of the battle. Battles can take more than 1 hour to win and there is non-stop action throughout it. You can get very tired and stressed without pausing. Victories are incredibly rewarding even at normal difficulty. Didn't think WW2 was this fun! ))))Для флага! Вперед, солдаты!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

A great title for a great WW2 game.Now, i've played this game some time, and i'm pretty much speechless of how much work has been put in this particular game.Everything here is good, even better when playing multiplayer, you must be organized with your teammates if you're playing 2 v 2 and viceversa. While playing in a 1 v 1, it's really important to manage your units in a clever way, and positionate them correctly, searching for tactical advantages and etcétera.Now, there is a LOT of modifications to this game, and one that i couldn't avoid was ""RobZ realism mod"", now this one in particular makes your game have an incredible ambient, realism and immersion, some features of this are: New units, improved damage system for tanks, changed sounds, and overall a really good immersion, for being an ""strategy"" game.Counting on, we have an editor, easy to use for me atleast, you can do a lot of things, like gigantic battles or armoured conflicts, this one in particular being really intense.I recommend this game.

Early Access Review
								I have been playing the closed beta since release date and after 3 patches its looking much better...Overall its a big improvement over Assault Squad 1 with the main differences being visual quality and the interface.The use of much newer shaders and multi cpu core support has improvewd the game to a huge degree.. IMHO anyways...The AI seems much smarter and this may be a benefit of multi core support as everyting isnt being computed by just one cpu core ( This is the first game in the series to utilises more than 1 CPU core )Due to the better performance everything seems much quicker and smoother and more realistic....New vehicle models look much cleaner and more detailed with the new 3D models and shaders...I have noticed the following improvements that some might see as trivial but overall they make for a better game... IMHO- Vehicle crews board and unboard vehicles more quickly....- Grenade throws are quicker ( in manual control mode anyway )- Vehicle crews will look for a nearby repair kit if they are told to repair a vehicle and repair kit is not in vehicle...- Ammo out icon for soldiers is great.....- Vehicle damage icon is great...- Vehcile reloading icon on sqaud icon is great..-  New squad icons that show individual soldiers health status is also great.- Inventory exchange bug crash from all previous games is  fixed...- Transferring ammo between vehicles is less likely to result in the two vehicles crashing into each other.- Mortar crews move a bit faster when told to move with the mortar.- Mortar AI seems better, You can now use a sniper or officer with binoculars to spot targets and the mortar will engage more wi;;ingly.- Repairs are quicker.- Grouped soldiers / squads move more smoothly and try to keep the original placement in the squad ( rough formation ) when told to move.- Dying / death animaytions seem more varied and more realistic..- Soldiers loose their helmets less than previous games... ( no more constanty picking up helmets micro managment )- Transferring ammo to a whole squad from a dead soldier or ammo crate is more intelligent,  it gives the correct ammo to the correct soldier ( in most cases ) based on the weapon they are carrying. ( and doesn't crash the game like MOW and AS1 did.. )- Mine laying seems quicker..- Steam workshop support is a great feature because it will make sharing content easy for everyone..All of my observations are from playing single player missions only and don't reflect the Multi player / Cooperative modes of the game....

								Ugly ugly UI, Graphics are way over sold, as the game isn't optimized to run with high graphics settings. No tutorial, except for skirmish mode, but that's not even really a tutorial.

												The singleplayer is interesting, but every nation has the same missions just with different maps. The objectives are the all the same. So that bored me a lot.Multiplayer is super ♥♥♥♥ed up! Matchmaking is not really good matching, because you will face player with level 20 while you are level 1 - therefore you cant get the good units. In addition, they mostly are so much better than you, you get rushed within 3 minutes and then the game is pretty lost. Another point is, that the multiplayergame is very buggy and you suffer a lot from disconnects, the developers still cant fix it and you wont be able to reconnect ....Super fail!			"

												The concept is great. However, the way this game was done is really bad. I played MoWAS a lot. The new game is really disappointing. Lack of new units is ntop the problem. The biggest issue is performance. The game lags a whoel lot. AS one looked at least as good as this one on the same specs, and it ran without issues. Thsi oen lags a lot. Matchmaking: nice new addition. Would be at least, if it was stable. Getting into a match is a major pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Leveling system: why??? Play trough the boring campaing missions, just to be able to play with units like a sniper? The missions are the same as in MowAS, and even back then, the ctrl C cntrl V missions were really boring after the 3rd one. I am really disappointed. Don't buy this, buy MoWAS instead.			"

												I bought this game after having been a long time fan of Men of War. I loved the amazing physics and incredible depth, and it's one of my favourite games of all time.Assault Squad 2 on the other hand is a stinky piece of crap. They somehow managed to regress in the area of gameplay from the first game and the entire thing just feels soulless and rushed. The physics are completely unrealistic and boring to play with, which was the main appeal of the original game to me. I loved burning down entire buildings with molotovs to advance on a fortified position, yet in Assault Squad 2 things as little as sandbags are invincible bulwarks against even tank rounds.i bought this in sale and feel ripped off			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad with a worse interface and NO ♥♥♥♥ING IMPROVEMENTS.Make no mistake. You're paying for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI change and worse performance just to get MP servers that work.Enjoyed frontlines mode? Then ♥♥♥♥ YOU, still no new maps or gamemode updates. In fact they actually REMOVED maps!And to add insult to injury they added a ♥♥♥♥ing worthless level system. Thankfully the host can disable the XP system but if he doesn't you get to 'enjoy' losing because you can't field anything to counter♥♥♥♥♥♥like the Tiger until you level up. I'm not a fan of the special units like the Radio OP either though I can live with them.It's like MoW with all the worst bits of CoH:2 added. Buy it only if, like me, you're desperate for more MoW MP and too weak to go without. If you wish to play SP buy MoW1 instead since it has actual ♥♥♥♥ing campaigns.Also the DLC is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, don't buy it. You've been warned.			"

												As an RTS gamer, I expected this game to be similar to Company of Heroes or StarCraft. I was so very wrong.((I came into this game with no experience of MoW 1))Pros-Excellent selection of units; and when there isn't something there, there's a mod for that.-Large-scale battles-Lots of micro required-Reasonable tutorial level-Level creationCons-Selecting a group of units can be finicky-Lots of micro required (it's a love/hate relationship)-Lag spikes are easily enough to crash a good PC (can be said for most RTS therefore isn't really a complaint)All in all, good game. I won't comment on price because Steam Sale is a thing. 7/10, would recommend.			"

												First of all i just want to say that if you have never played any men of war game then i highly recommend assault squad 21. Its a good looking game2. it has nice features that you don't find in other strategy games E.G you can directly control individual units, each unit has an inventory...3. its basically like company of heroes with a worse story line but better featuresNow as to why i dont recommend this game, if you have assault squad 1 then seriously just save your money, the developers have literally slightly improved the graphics added a couple of extra levels and then slapped a number 2 in the title and said its a second game, you will come across a lot of levels from the first assault squad that are literally carbon copies, same crappy voice acting and all. the only reason i have put any hours into this game is so that i feel as if im getting my moneys worth.So yeah all in all a good game but if you have assault squad 1 just dont bother.

												I hate to say this about one of my favorite RTS series, but, do not buy this game, its fine and all, except that they basically repackaged Assault Squad 1 with a new hud and a few new missions. This new ""update"" of theirs totally trashed my game, I cant even play a game I payed money for. But if this is your first time seeing a game from the massive franchise that this came from, take my advice, buy one of the older games, these games are great fun, but in their current state of money whoring, they arent fun anymore. What is a game that is lacking in the core function of being fun? It's not a game, it's a waste of money.Edit: October 29, 2016Huh, it seems I have fixed it. but, it still does not change my review because that wasn't the reason for it to begin with, but for anyone with this problem, use this;api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missingMSVCR110.dll is missingMake sure you have your windows fully updated.Locate and run vcredist x86 in your commonredist folder located inside of your game install location.C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common			"

												Just my two cents. Not a full review. If you have Men of War Assault Squad 1, don't buy it unless it's on sale for really cheap! Since it's only  around $5 during todays daily sale, give it a shot if you have the cash to spare and enjoy mow in engeral. Anyhow, MOWAS2 doesn't seem to have too many innovative improvements from it's predecessor. However, the integration of steam workshop and the move to direct x10 is a nice improvement. With that said, it's not perfect and seems to only improve on the last title in subtle ways. Definitely worth a play for the right price.			"

												If you've played Men of War: Assault Squad 1, you won't find any surprises here. Some new art assets, but no new gameplay or differing modes.Most of the maps are directly lifted from AS1.So is the interface....i think the maps are even listed in the same order.As with the first, you can individually complete the skirmish maps, but there is no campaign to speak of, and no attempt is made to link the map you just finished with the following one.I really enjoyed the original Assault Squad and happily clicked my way through its map list, it was new and fresh...by the end of the list, however, I was happy it was over. The missions are formulaic and tedious.I'm 4 maps into Assault Squad 2 and I'm already tired of the forumula.(holding out for reinforcements while being able to order as many tanks and troops as I like doesn't even make sense)I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this just seems a stale reinterpretation of Assault Squad 1.Wait for a $5 sale.

												I see all these comments its just men of war 1 repackaged and to that i say. THATS EXACTLY WHY MOST OF US BOUGHT IT you see these trailers you could see what you were getting into if you had half a brain and eyeballs during the trailers while yes new content new game would be nice. If your getting into the franchise then buy this not MOW 1 its dated while it does have little bugs (my experince) and really good gameplay this looks much more appealing to the eye and honestly bugs that happen are usally visual (again my experince) and this also has really good gameplay. and honestly anyone who hasnt bought this after playing MOW 1 for ages should buy this anyway give your eyes something to look at instead of horribly dated graphics.

												Men of War:Assault Squad 2 is the most INDEPTH rts I've seen in my entire life.    For someone looking to experience an authentic World War II RTS, this game is for you. The developers at Digitalmindsoft have been blessed by the PC gods and have managed to bestow us this masterpiece. Why do I like this game so much? I think one of the major selling points was the GARGANTOUS range of options. I am specifically referring to the mouth watering stash of firearms, light tanks, medium tanks, HEAVY tanks, fighter planes, destroyers(big boats) and the diverse types of ammunition that accompany them. Not convinced yet? Then take a look at the cover system in place, allowing the player to cleverly place infantry so that they can take advantage of their surroundings. But forget all that. Who even cares if you can control every freaking infantry, vehicle, and weapon known in this game? Who cares if you can dump 20 hours of playing time just in the editor mode making crazy scenarios and reenacting battles? If you're not convinced by now, then my words haven't done the game justice. Check it out for yourself if you won't take my word. Chances are, you'll be as impresssed as I was and still am.LAST BUT NOT LEASTIf you're going to play multiplayer, bring some lube.			"

												This game is nothing different from the origenal game Men Of War : Assault Squad, The only differences is that All of the missions are unlocked and some of the textures are inproved, they tryed to make it different, i'll give them that, but it's like any assassins creed game, the next game would have the exact same animations and sound effects and also grafics. Please, Do not buy this game, get the origenal insted : Costs less, Has the best effort put into its creation, and lest face it, its LITTERALY the exact same game, look at the trailers of both and you'll see, i think i've said it enough in this review. good luck Soldier			"

												Monetized content by DMS, removal of dissenting comments, not a company worth supporting.  As for the game itself, it's a men of war game which come from a long line of men of war - faces of war - soldiers games which thankfully wasn't managed by DMS.  The skirmish battles are uninspired and reptitive with essentially 3 map templates repeated over across multiple maps.  You have your generic attack missions, your generic defense missions, and lastly your generic 'stealth' assault missions.  They all have the same templates which makes playing a seperate map feel like deja vu all over again.  Generic patrol gets ambushed, go repair and steal the tank before the first enemy wave arrives, etc..  Group of tank in the middle is always present in the ""stealth"" missions which doesn't require stealth at all nor proper extraction of any but one unit.  As there's no real story mode or any sense of progression, you're just left switching from one template to the same exact template with just a scenary change.The only real saving grace is there are mods as there's always been, and modders can actually make decent maps.

												Here is my honest review.I have been playing MOW a long time, and have enjoyed it quiet well. AS2 on the other hand I didn't like. It's trash. Plain and simple. Campaign is litterally the same as MOWAS with the DLC missions included. You have to pay money to get new campaigns and features that they should've implemeted when the game came out. Multiplayer is the same way. No new maps, and you have to pay to get new ones. Out synce errors that they have said they have fixed MULTIPLE times, but never have. The gameplay is garbage compared to MOWAS. Then theres the workshop. It was going really good, until they made some patch, that required mods to update when every minor patch came out, that didn't even affect the mod. The only reason I have so many hours in this game, is due to mods. The mods, made this game good, plain and simple. Honestly, all this game is a money horder.So would I recommend this game?Nope.			"

												I've played MOWAS2 Both ways, with friends, versus, and singleplayer. Therefor, I can tell you the best of both-sides.Singleplayer gameplay: The missions in the second MOWAS are an intresting idea, rather then the classic ""Move up and capture"" system, you are given challenges/difficult side-objectives. Such as, defend the three trench points untill reinforcements, or stealth tasks, or even running out of reinforcements! It's a cool idea, but, it gets old. There are times when you just want to play a classic ""Assault and Secure"" objective mission, and don't feel like the new stuff. Multiplayer Gameplay: I feel the game is centered on multiplayer. It is a blast to mow down your enemies together, and move up in the bloody battlefields together. But, there are SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLAYER. Example, if a player tabs out of the game, everyones framed will drop about 40-50 frames, it's not just me, it's everyone I've played with. And, if you're un-lucky, they won't restore to your normal frame-rate. Plus, if you have a bad ping, it will also reduce frames for everyone else. It's really annoying, and they really need to fix it.Preformance: Men of War: Assualt Squad 2 is so horribly optimized. No-matter what GPU You have, or how many gigs of RAM you have, no matter what you do, you cannot escape the horrible FPS Drops. Singleplayer AND Multiplayer. The explosions of ANYTHING, molotovs, vehicles, or even buildings can freeze/crash your game, or make your frames drop severly. I know it's only a beta, and that's why I'm trying to keep my paitence. But, it sometimes get's unplayable. Something they need to fix PRONTO.Overall outcome: I think MOWAS2 has awesome potential, the awesome new graphics, and relieving bug fixes from the first, really make you get excited for new updates. But, the game is not worth the price it has. For a un-optimized, partially buggy, FPS Dropping beta, $30, $20, or even $15 is WAY Too much. I'd say maybe $10 for the BETA. And I will do a review on the offical release of the full game.Minor/annoying bugs: The bugs in MOWAS2 Are small, but really annoying. Example, your tanks won't always shoot at the targets that are most vital, example, I was playing as the Soviet Union, and a Panther was grinding my Infantry, and my T-34, rather focus on the Panther, focused on infantry. Luckily, you can press ""E"", and take manual control of your units, (Also needs work), you can take out yourself, annoying, but playable. That's really it for the bugs.Final Verdict: I'll give MOWAS2 a 6/10, Great potential, but needs tons of work.Since that was Early Access, it's time for the whole game.MOWAS2 In my opinion is a train-wreck of, BS Tank penetration, re*tarded path finding, awful voice acting, and most of all, LAG LAG LAG AND MORE LAG.Gameplay: MOWAS2's Gameplay is alright. Rather then the traditional ""Unit"" engine, the game runs off of indiviual men in a squad. For example, unlike in other strategy games, you can split off other single men to preform tasks, like, if there is a Tiger coming down the road, you can sneak a guy in the building to the side, and AT 'Nade it, or, if there is a squad, killing yours, sneak an SMG over and wreck the entire squad from one guy behind. This may sound awesome, but it has ALOT of flaws. Example, the faction balance is horrible. Germany and U.K are just stupidly overpowered. While the United Kingdom had♥♥♥♥♥♥takes in WW2, they beat ♥♥♥♥ing EVERYTHING. It's un-realistic. And downright annoying. They have huge armor, and for some reason, the guns devistate anybody. Tiger, to an M20. They will get 1-hitted.Gameplay: Tanks: The tanks in the game can be really fun, or really annoying. Even though you have the ablility to press ""E"" And take control of any man/unit in the game, it still feels very unfinished. The aiming, ecspeically in tanks is really really REALLY hard. The gun never fires at the right thing, but over/under it. And meh, just dosent' feel very nice. The tanks for America are SO underpowered. I know that they had horrible armor, But even the pershing seems UP. Like, a f*ucking 2Pndr AT Gun can 1-Hit a Sherman. A 2 POUNDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry. I get kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at this game cause it has such great potential, but just dosen't go reach it's hight of glory. German tanks are okay. They could be better. But, meh. They're playable. The Soviet Union's tanks are pretty BS OP as-well. A T-34 57 can One-hit anything. A tiger, to a jeep. It's screwed. Japan's tanks are♥♥♥♥♥♥ But, it's how it was.Gameplay: Infantry: Infantry isn't really a problem in MOWAS2, They're pretty balanced. Actually, very balanced. Vehicles seem to ruin the fun play of infantry. Having a fierce fire-fight? It'd be a shame if a tank just ran everyone over. I don't really have much to say about this. Gameplay:Multiplayer: This is what ruins MOWAS2. Though, there are single-player missions in the game, the missions are crap though, as said in my Pt. 1 in my review, but, the multiplayer in MOWAS2 can be really fun, if you don't have the FRAME DROPS AND THE LAG SPIKES ALL THE TIME! I swear, if you dare, DARE tab out, or anybody tabs out, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of FPS drops, timeouts, and frustration. And, the game seems to drop FPS randomly. Not a massive problem. The game is very well optimised. And it's nice to play even on low.I really can't be bothered to make a huge Pt.2, due to the fact that I could go on for days. Final Verdict, of Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a 4/10 Awful Strategy game.			"

								I love the game, and the multiplayer. But I would not bother getting this game if you are a campaign freak like me. The dev's use the same missions over and over again for the different campaigns, the only thing that changes the missions is the slight change of layout of the map, and the factions you play as!

Early Access Review
								I love the game, and the multiplayer. But I would not bother getting this game if you are a campaign freak like me. The dev's use the same missions over and over again for the different campaigns, the only thing that changes the missions is the slight change of layout of the map, and the factions you play as! Developers being really cheap, if you ask me.			"

												The game is basically just Men Of War Assault Squad 1, but there's a few improvements with graphics and AI. The best part of the game, and the main reason to buy it is because of the Steam Workshop. Its so easy to completely change your game, and it's what make's it better than its predecessor. Out of 10 I'd give it a 9.5. There's not really any problems with the game, but I just feel as though Digitalmindsoft could have created a better, and more immersive campaign. All the missions are basically the same.			"

												I know that a lot of people are saying that this game is a copy of the first assault squad. The 2 have some similarities, but there are also some differences.The units and tanks do look the same. They have added a few units but not very many. I know that this game is a sequel, which means that the game should be similar, but this game looks REALLY SIMILAR. Pros:-The game has pretty good gameplay and quite a few levels.-The game is very addictive.-There are many different types of units and countries to play as.-There are probably 50 different tanks, and each one feels very different from the others.Cons: -This game is bascially a reskin of the first one. Some of the maps are nearly identical, and many of the units are the same.-This game has some of the worst voice acting that I have ever heard. Since when did German field commanders have American accents?-This game is too expensive when compared to teh first which is much cheaper and very similar.Summary:Although the game is good, it is basically a copy and paste of the first and seems to be a cash grab. I just picked the first one up and a whole bunch of DLC on sale for $5. Just buy the 1st one and save yourself a lot of money. I give this game a 5/10.			"

												Absolutly fantastic. The level of detail in this game is incredible. Love the complexity and the micro. Lost your tank to the enemy? Evac the crew and rip off the .50 cal from its mount and let god sort them out, terminator style.Enemy hiding in the forest? Let your flame throwers burn the whole forest down and everyone inside it.Great sounds.Great visuals. destructable environment.Great inventory system for all troops.Adjustable game speedIn a day when most RTS's are♥♥♥♥♥♥ this really shines. But you must like complexity. Did you like sudden strike? I think you will like this, the scale is not as grand but the mechanics in this game is much better.RECOMMENDED!  "

												Men of War Assault Squad 2 - in my opinion the current best (and hardest) RTS game with a  WW2 setting.The game features a lot of missions split up between the 5 different nations. Germany, GB, USA, Japan & Sovjet Russia. While the pattern for the missions is the same they do play entirely different due too the different maps & nations. Defend - attack - defend is what the first mission, more like tutorial mission, is like. Every other mission is either attack or defend. You have to capture outposts, reach waymarks and defend hills & important places. Easy, yet challenging.There is no base building involded - you gain new units via reinforcement points or by capturing enemy tanks. Yes, capturing enemy tanks. Each and every one of your units can be split up, managed individually, forged into a new squad, has his own inventory, can be used with manual aim [...]. Including tanks! Tanks can be used with minimum manpower - the driver only. Or you can fully stack up and even place infantry on the back of the tank for faster movements. Its entirely up to you.You units can switch weapons, ammo & special items, you can loot dead enemies to gain new weapons and ammo [...] the possibilitys are endless.What is the challenging part of all this? Sounds rather nice, doesnt it? The challenging part is the micromanagement, map awareness and realism. Tanks who get to close to trenches full of infantery - one AT grenade to his engine and hes busted. Infantery running over an open field - on mg salvo, all dead. The game does everything right that can be done right - a solid 10/10!			"

												This game looks beautiful. But its an unruly beast to control. You are basically controlling a section against companies of enemy, which is OK, but you have your hands full fighting a floating camera, and imbedded menus within a realtime environment where time flows too fast for the micro management involved. Even with pausing and performing actions while paused something seems off. I could buy this game today for $8.97 on a weekend sale, but I wouldn't get much fun out of it having downloaded a 24 hour trial I have determined its not for me. Its a shame they can't  re-vamp this game because it really looks awesome and its a scale of game I typically enjoy.  I've played a few of this series before, like faces of war, men of war 1, in a similar seed but found not much has changed,  too scripted for my liking.			"

												This is a potentially great game.  Currently there is just too much micro-management of squads for me.  I prefer to concentrate on the strategy, not re-supplying my troops.  Too many steps to re-supply.  If the squad could re-supply by being next to the supply truck or downed soldier(s) that would be better all the current steps required to re-supply them.  Reduce the amount of clicks.			"

												Guess this game is nice if you just want to jump into a match. There is no actual campaign though, which is disappointing. The skirmishes just throw you into a conflict without any regards to knowledge. You can watch YouTube clips for the tutorial. Out of 10 I would give this game a 5. It is good to the point that the tactics are solid, the graphics are nice. The UI could use some work as it isn't clear how to quickly switch from one squad to the next without manually doing it. If there was a campaign with an actual story line that lead to a destination then I would totally buy this game. But I don't have the time to watch all the videos in order to teach myself this game just to play against far superior players. This game feels more like an early access than a complete game due to all the key RTS factors that it doesn't have.			"

												The game is basically a worse rip-off of the first game. The devs have banned poeple for speaking the truth about this and dont get me started on the DLC. The game will only give you a couple hours of fun, and multiplayer is done so that you have to unlock units based on your level which is **** because if you are new to the game you will only have a couple of units to choose from and your opponents (which are all high levels) have access to everything, so you will lose pretty much all your games.overall: Devs are bad because they cant take criticism. game is ok There are plenty of other games out there whos devs care about the game AND the community that you should get.

												I've only played a few minutes and i can already respect the people who play this game, but its not my cup of tea.MoW: Assault Squad 2 is a very tecnical game, you need to position troops over a huge map and acomplish multiple objectives in a single stage to achieve victories, the character models are too small and the map is too big, its a dream come true if you have the patience to carefully observe all angles and possible positions for your army, but otherwise its a bit of a nightmare, i dont generally complain about the blessings a game bestows upon us gamers, but this game is a bit too hard to micromanage for normal people.If you love strategy games, this is just like Commando (the old squad strategy game were you had to use only 4 characters to destroy entire german bases), in that winning maps takes minute planning, except in here you get to field an entire army, in much bigger map, which expands as you clear objectives (so you cant plan ahead too much sometimes)Its a great game, its just a bit too much consuming and quite big on micromanaging. I suggest you try it if its still free on steam when you read this review.			"

												I would really like to give this game a 'thumbs up' but I am quite anooyed at how the devs have released DLC after DLC instead of the FREE UPDATES they promised. The most meaningful 'update' I have seen added the ability for units to auto re-supply. Oh, and they added a tank that is pretty terrible. Apart from that I havent noticed any change in the game since launch. Also, the AI in the game is still terrible, sometimes my AT troops will break cover and run up to a tank and get mowed down, instead of firing the launchers they have. I have over 300hrs on AS1 and to be honest this is the same game with a few new SP missions. On the MP side, I have yet to fully experience it as I have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO JOIN A MULTIPLAYER MATCH. Googling for my problem results in millions of results for 'MOW AS2 Out of sync error'. This issue has still not been fixed for 1000s of people since launch. I feel pretty bad that I convinced my friend to buy this so we could play together only to discover none of us can join any MP matches. The editor is very fun and is where I spend most of my time, but it is almost the same as AS1 in most aspects.HOWEVER, This is still a fun game (if you like spending 3 days to make a decent looking map to have fun battles on against the ai you have to script every move and action for) and this is indicated by my high playtime on both titles. I heard the devs recently added AI to MP mathces (Which should have been a free update not DLC) and from what I hear, it is pretty terrible.Would still play this over COH2 though.verdict (without editor): 4/10            (with editor)      : 6/10            (forgetting multiplayer ever existed) : 8/10			"

												I only tried the game when it was playable for free for a few days. Not much of a strategy player, yet I HAVE played some in the past, and the problem for me, with this one, was that I was totally lost right away. The mission objectives are quite clear, the UI isn't too cluttered, yet I still didn't know how to actually control my soldiers. I'd try to get some to throw grenades, marked several at once to take out an enemy shooter, etc, and it only worked like a quarter of the time. I'd try all kinds of combinations (left click, mouse click, function keys), yet never was sure whether I am supposed to manage each soldier individually, command a small group, and how exactly to get them to actually do a certain thing. I looked for a tutorial, and all I found was a bunch of short youtube videos linked in game, which didn't help much either.Call me a total idiot, if you like, and no, I didn't try the first MoW. But I think if the developer is trying to get new players to join in this day and age (call it the idiot age where people do like tutorials to learn the controls instead of watching youtube vids or googling for a guide), they might wanna give newcomers some clue on how to actually control your troops correctly, without them having to try by trial and error how to even make a soldier throw a grenade. ANY indicator would help.			"

Early Access Review
								703 Hours of playing Men of war Assult Squad 1. After playing 2, I noticed right away that theres no reload option for my units. Infact there are less options all around. You can imagine for a player who enjoys absolute control this was quite a let down. I also noticed that the company icons look alot like company of heros unit icons. I played the entire first mission through the Americans and to my suprise after capturing 2 flags i still couldn't recruit a morter team nor could I recruit an mg team and when i recruited a ranger team instead of coming in a half track like they usually do they came on foot. Im greatly frusterated because to me in feels like they have gone backwards and taken away more then improved it. As a devoted fan there are many things already about this game that really make it feel like company of heros 2. If you were to ask me if you should buy this i would definitly wait for it to be finished, im extremely unhappy about what iv'e seen as of now. "

												Micromanaging in this is beautiful. You care about each and every single unit under your command, even the ones that aren't. Whether they are the conscripts, crew, unarmed, injured. Every tank, anti-tank and artillery piece, are all taken care of and are beneficial. Best WWII RTS out there. Play the first installment too.			"

												(New rating system. I'll try to be as merciful as I can. Emphasis on try, because I still don't like it)Let's just skip to the basics, ok?Positives:+ No limit on troops+ Unique supply stuffNegative:- Can only control 12 guys (or 1 tank) at a time? That's not good enough.- Campaigns are mere repeats of each other.- Voice acting (a first for a negative here)- Greedy devs being greedy devs with more dlc.- Some claim it to be reused materials. It's probably true.So, no. Don't support this. Find something else.			"

It's more like extension pack!Campaign - is so short so you can pass it in one evening.And most irritated things are bugs!Crashes arise every hour, when you exit the game it's always a crashIt's impossible to play in multiplayer, connection lost or crashes is what you'll getIf host is out, the game is finished, OMG in 2014 you can't make a game with decentralized host??You think that if you buy an engine and make few missions you can sell it ? No guys, this is scam!!Update!It's year 2015, and you know what? This piece of s..t still crashes!! in multiplayer players are constantly dropping!I don't even understand what comes with those patches, new fonts for UI?			"

												I loved this game, the gameplay and the depth of units and nations was awesome, but this game has performancy issues and crashes and OOS still hasn't been killed off the enitre series.I didn't mind the Crashes the perf problems or the oos, I still loved the game.But now recently, the units themselves got broken. This is where I put my line.All flamethrowers are broken, Isuzu AA is broken. and other units as well.And the developers dont seem to care. When the game has performance problems, I don't really mind them. But when the units, the core of the game are broken? this is where I draw my line folks.When they will fix this game, which they will never will. Then it would be a good game.But right now its to broken for gameplay, do not buy. CHEERS			"

												Game is broken, has been broken and likely will always be broke. Cash grabs like this often have little effort put into them. This is nothing more than AS1 with broken promises, a community Czar, and a defunct online system. Save your money!I gave this game every chance, I have been banned on the forums numerous times for expressing my concern in a civil manner; they simply don't care and don't want the bad press. I am thankful this game was gifted to me, but I am sorry someone wasted their money on it. Don't be fooled by these cons and tricksters. The Store page is a misleading representation of the game, planes are only in the single player and skirmish missions ( which are horrible) Mulitplayer has the SAME EXACT units as AS. Game is crap, company is crap.			"

												This is a great game, after you get passed all of the issues.  The game is still plauged with out of syncs that have been there for over 5 months now.  The performance you get in multiplayer is dictated almost entirely by other people's PCs.  My friend with a gtx 970 is laging on this game but it works fine on singleplayer because there arent other players.  I am also getting a gtx 970 so I will update this and see how it works for me. The Editor:  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this awesome,  you can make your own maps and missions with it, im currently making some myself and it feels just great.  The Graphics:  The game's units are out rageously outdated.  some of the tank models actually havent been updated sense men of war 1 (almsot 6 years ago).  The infantry skins are rather poor, all you need to do is look for some on the steam workshop and they look signifigantly better than the ones in this game.At the current time I cant say I recommend this game, I wish that a bigger team was working on it and had the budget to make this game what it deserves to be.

								I played th Beta, and the second skirmish misson for the U.S. is completely broken. Towards the end, you have to get to an extraction point. Simple enough, except it's guarded by an anti-aircraft gun that can see you for miles, and you can't get close enough to take it out. There are three tanks in the level, but the game won't let you take them. You also, have a fixed amount of points, and when I got to the end of the level, I was only able to call in Officers (They literally can't do anything), a single medic (slightly less useless at the point I was at), and snipers (Very useful normally). Funnily enough, it's impossible to shoot off the gunner from the front, and there's no spot I could get to that was behind it, or to the side of it. On top of that, tanks continued to spawn, making the situation worse. If I'm buying a game from you, I should actually be able to play it, instead of just losing, almost automaticly. I'm serverly dissapointed, especially since when I bought it, there were numerous games on sale, invluding the ENTIRE rockstar collection. I could've bought half of them for the same price of this game, but I liked the first Assualt Squad, and was so excited for this one, I wanted to get a little cheaper, and make sure I got it. To summarize, broken level, automatic failure, frustration, anger.			"

												The Men of War series is one of my favorite PC games ever. This installment is just a polished MoW Assault Squad I, rereleased with a few extra bells and whistles. On sale, it's worth $10-$20, and if you're a fan of the series than it's worth a little more. It's RTS, squad-control, and micro-management to the extreme. I love being able to control a whole squad, or tank, all the way down to a single infantry man who can pick up a dropped grenade, ammo clip, or check a fallen soldiers inventory. I recommend it for fans of Dawn of War II, CoH's, and the Total War series.  "

												This game is perfect for all you war nuts and RTS fans out there. If you looked at this game and thought it would be fun, get it, it is. This game strikes a fantastic balance of macro and micro managing, from telling a group of soldiers to take cover to manually controlling a tank. The detailed visuals and sounds just add so much to an already amazing game. If you have ever played ""Close Combat"" or similar games you will love this game. The feeling you get when you drop a 600mm (23.6 inches to fellow americans) diameter Rocket on several tanks blowing them several meters into the air and then watching the wreckage rain down from the sky is amazing.

Posted: November 8, 2016
												Background: Having just come off of 150 hours on Company of Heroes 2 this game kicked my butt. Like seriously there are not many games that I review that I highly recommend to Follow the Tutorials to the T.  I also never played the First one or the HD Remake of the First One.The Take on Realism: You have to worry about ammo, medkits, and form infantry columns that are able to tackle a variety of situation from assaulting in CQC or disabling Armor. Repairing damaged vehicles actually takes Real Time Minutes to complete. Individual units within your formations can be targeted and taken out. Nothing is safe out there. On easy difficulty I found myself overwhelmed sometimes with Management that a single MG can pin you down and seal the deal.  To add to this each unit has its own manageable inventory. Like a single rifleman will have 250 .30-06 rounds on him, his M1 Garand, Helmet, Shovel, and maybe a grenade. Your Russian officer will have a pistol, 70 rounds, officer hat. Don’t worry equipment can be transferred between units.This realism also extends to Line of Sight Mechanics. Most RTS we are used to our units having to rely on sight lines combo’d with a set Range they can fire. Well with this game, your tank can literally shoot in whatever direction if your mouse lets you. So go nuts, shoot across 3 wheat fields into the dirt if you’d like. (See Armor Mechanics below for your True Ranges)Note: they do give us one freebie with Ammo management and that is a single 8 man unit that you form by mouse dragging Automatically Shares Ammo.  This is great because you can click on one man run him to the ammo truck, load him up with 5000 rounds, run back to the defensive line, rejoin him to a unit and bam, the entire unit is rearmed. The Campaign: There are a nice array of factions to play. Though the campaign is a Copy Paste for each faction, it gives you a great way to learn each Faction’s strengths and weaknesses to ultimately prepare you for Online Matchmaking.  The Campaign Scenarios are actually built well to teach you LOS, Direct Unit Control, Defense of an objective, Flanking, Sniping, Armor Control and Field Guns. Direct Control: There are a few other games I have seen in recent years that allow Direct control over units within an RTS.  There are a couple on Steam but I fail to remember their names.  Direct control happens in a 3rd person Top Down view. Note that this is a Single Unit. A Single Man, a Single Tank, etc. In this mode you control all aspects of the Unit, aiming with mouse and movement that you can modify to be the Arrow keys or WASD. I highly suggest getting used to this mode as it is invaluable at all difficulty levels. Direct control of a tank is superior in all ways and will help you survive online and in the Scenarios.Armor Mechanics: I’m going to distill this down to as simple as I can. Scoring a hit on any Vehicle is factored in by a number of ways. Your unit has armor penetration values applied at 3 different ranges. This is to say how much armor it can penetrate at a given distance. This is then compared against glance values and Armor Values of the Target to determine if the shot glances off with a visual market, or penetrates the Armor and scores a hit. Now in addition to kill hits, there are track hits that cause you to be unable to move and turret hits which cause you to be unable to rotate the turret. To add to this you have ammo types that can modify their target values and properties. HE for Infantry, AP which you have very few of for Armor Busting, and general shells.  Armor values are also generally weaker on the sides and rear.What all this means is that your angle, gun values, and range all factor into your success in Armor vs Armor fights. What this also means is that if you’re going up against some heavy Panzers in light British armor you’re going to have a bad day if you don’t Flank immediately. Infantry Mechanics: Infantry can be given 3 positions, standing, crouching, and prone. They are outfitted for their role on the field as general Riflemen, Snipers, AT crew, Tank Crews, and various Specialty units per each faction. Gun accuracy values are compared to the target’s use of cover and range from your position to determine hit factor. When you direct control a snipe get used to being able to quickly identify enemy AT carriers, it’ll make your life 10 times easier. Final Thoughts: If you can survive the super realism (On the scale of video games) and the micromanagement aspects. Then this is the WWII Simulator for you. However if you are on the fence about RTS in 2016 and want a more straight forward more forgiving game then I highly suggest Company of Heroes 2.As Always watch gameplay videos before buying! "

Example: In the mission Overlord for the americans, when calling in paratroopers a squad of 5 parachutes in, instead of just one trooper, this is a major fix in my mind, logically you would send 1 trooper in at a time and sending in squads would be a more ""rational"" amount. 3: MAJOR FIX: mulitplayer is fixed and you can play online, unlike the other Men of War: Assault Squad that ran off of game spy (an unused and discontinued gaming network). This makes the game so much better, multiplayer, for players who has friends that don't own the game, or those who don't have friends (if you don't have any, make some!)4: This isn't a fix but makes the game so much more fun, Steam Workshop, custom maps easier to get and mods the same! There are some great maps and mods on the workshop and i recommend anyone that has to check it out!This game get a 10/10 for the beautiful and never ending fun that the game gives!			"

												This game makes me hate two specific groups of people.  First: big game developers who prove once again that by throwing heaps of money at promotion (I’m looking at you CoH 2) their game can outperform superior games.  And second, people who aren’t willing to put in the effort to learn a new game because it’s hard.  There is no question that MOWAS II is a thinking man’s game.  To be good you have to know armor values, penetration chances, gun calibers, and much more.  You have to invest your points in the right units, know how to use cover, and give your troops good lines of sight.  One mortar shell will kill and entire squad if you bunch them up behind a sandbag because, well, that’s reality.  Remember that veteran tiger that you saved up all game for?  You didn’t support it with infantry so it died to one AT grenade in less than 2 minutes.   It’s not CoH 2, or rather a glorified game of rock, paper, scissors, you actually have to think.  I already know people will say ‘yeah that’s all well and good but who has the time to learn all that?’ and it’s a weak argument.  If you’re going to invest a day of your life into a game anyway what is another five or six hours to learn how to play it well? The point it this is a fantastic game.  Take the time to learn it and come have some fun.			"

												EDITSo, i just wanna to be honest, this game is not so fun, it's repetitive, you just go defend and defend or attack or attack. Same with other campaign/skirmish mission.I admit, I was very enjoying this game, but all of sudden, i feel like this very repetitive.It's fun at the beggining, but at the middle, you will feel something, at the end of the mission, you will feel bored. Because it's repetitive. Same doing thing over and over.If you wanna try this game, don't buy this full price, wait for sale.			"

												Hard game play, you never win a match in hereos mode without statify at least 100 troops, 30 viechels, not like COH, you can control every single person in a troops for difference task, beward that there is a limited in aim and magazines, also fuel, therefore, you need to have a lot of plans to choice in the battle, because if you keep moving your tanks left to right or right to left of the maps, your tank will be out of fuel and have to stop somewhere....may be get ambush....if you are new to the game and playing Multi-player matchs, Germany is the best option with planty of aim...

I could only recomend to newcomers of the series as the latest iterateration brings nothing to the table except steamworks multiplayer. Very very disappointing to see the series take this unfortunate turn.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is probably the worst gay porn I’ve played. Though it looks exciting and sounds fun, and moves hard and rapidly, it rarely gets me off.People have been saying that THIS entry in the series is supposed to be the multiplayer, coop one. And I (usually) love watching guys tongue each other’s♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with my friends just like everyone else does. But what if I told you that the American scenes in this collection are basically the same as the German ones, which are basically the same as the Japanese ones, which are basically the same as the British ones, and the Russian ones? All five of the nations. What if I told you that the sniper (or optionally commandos) scene for the U.S. is repeated four times with the other nations? And also the same for the defense scenes? And also the advance-across-the-set scenes? What if I told you that instead of the 40, original group sex scenes advertised on this store page, you get, actually, just 8 that are (arguably) original? And now, forget the what ifs; because it’s true.These 15 and 25 scenes are actually just eight. Different actors for each nation? Sure. But the interracial variety isn’t enough. What about the Steam Workshop mods? Well I played two of the top-rated ones, SirHinkel’s AS2 Missions and RobZ’s Base Defense ones. And they do suck♥♥♥♥♥ but not in a good way.SirHinkel’s missions are his interpretations of famous man-on-man actions, including a very well-realized The Alamo orgy, from the epic gay porn film Saving Private Ryan. And though Italian and Hungarian men join the action during SirHinkel’s Stalingrad orgies, they’re almost all just long slogs. You can certainly set the intensity of the boning (Easy, Medium, etc.), but instead of more exciting moments of drama, you usually get merely longer scenes. And sure some people like long, hard sex scenes before the actors get so tired that, finally, they all just exhaustedly come onto each other’s throbbing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ But let’s be real: the best gay porn follows the quality-over-quantity standard. SirHinkel DID put a lot of strategic thought into his scenes, with many good placements for many dangerous toys, but as for the great climactic moments, when you just want to ejaculate while the actors do: well, they rarely happen, and (strangely) they usually do so near the beginning of his scenes. So it’s just hours of repetitive hard ♥♥♥♥ing, until it’s finally, suddenly over.As for RobZ’s base defense scenes, you look at their descriptions and think you’re in for a really good time. You start playing one and lay your initial men in comfy spots, waiting for the other nation’s uniformed-men to creep up and come on them. But it’s all ruined by what must be two bugs. Specifically: when you call in more of your dudes to join the orgy, they (infuriatingly) WALK, and unenthusiastically. And on top of or under that: these men will change their destination to wherever you tell the next boys you call in. So you have to manually look at the troops as they walk onto the scene and jerk them into running to where you actually want them. And on large set pieces, where the defenses are far from where you call in the new boys, it Just Makes Masturbation a Chore, as you move the screen across the map, clicking the walking unit, moving across the map to where you really want them, double right-clicking that spot so they run to THAT SPOT, repeat... No gay porn should soften one's♥♥♥♥♥♥this much...And what about the player-on-player multiplayer? Is it fun to jerk-off with someone across the Internet, or with your friend next to you? Not compared to the Company of Heroes multiplayer it isn't. MoW:♥♥♥♥♥Sqd 2 favors realism too much, and doesn’t understand something important about gay porn (or porn in general): Realistic Sex is not what we want to watch. I mean, for realism just go do the real thing. In pornography you want to see lots of herculean men doing all kinds of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥to each other’s holes. It’s called FANTASY sex. This understanding is shown by Relic in their Company of Heroes (Vanilla edition). Men of War: Assault Squads 1 and 2 go too realistic, and thus make for undramatic man-on-man ""action,"" over and over and over.In conclusion: for gay, WW2-themed cream pies and facials, play Company of Heroes instead. (I haven’t played Company of Heroes 2; feel free to comment if you have an opinion about its♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rubbing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥action)			"

												It might be fun, but I'll never know. There is literally no help learning to play the game. There are some hints that give you strategies or tell you about a specific feature or two, and there is a library of YouTube videos which all explain some of the more complex tasks, but there is no tutorial, introduction, sandbox, or anything like that: you're on your own, and it's trial-and-error. That wouldn't be so bad if the game were a simplistic shooter or a more traditional Age-of-Empires-style RTS: you could guess at the controls and probably get them right enough to play. This, however, is an incredibly in-depth game with a lot of micromanagement that gives you no information about how to find or use its features. It's also a strange combination of realism (various systems on armour which can all be disabled, various weaponry with unique stats and ballistics, etc.) and absurdism (a Thompson with a range of 50 meters, 10+ hits to kill a person, etc.). Like so many others, this game completely ignores the most significant part of a game: teaching the player how to play it. If you have nothing else to do, or if you enjoy spending most of your time reading about your new game rather than playing it, you can probably learn Men of War: Assault Squad 2 in a couple days. Otherwise, skip it and wait till the publisher gets serious.			"

												This one of the best RTS I've ever played, but I can't recommend it, even more I encourage people to NOT buy it until the game developers make this game stable enough to play it without crashes. Right now it is nearly impossible to play it without a crash. Most mods I have played require to save at least every five minutes in order to not lost your progress on the mission.I'm sorry to have to write such a harsh review of one of the games that I like the most but it's really a shame that the developers don't take these issues seriously.

												The game is pretty good if you are into WW2 RTS and micromanaging but there is so much that could be improved.Sadly the devs don't do the game justice. Bug fixes are few and far between for a start. But because I love the game so much I didn't mind. But the DLC are just a ripoof. Adding bots to multiplayer and the ability to save and share replys should NOT ever be paid DLC. It is like buying a car and then being charged extra for the windows. They are such basic features there is no excuse. Other companies give basic features like that as a free addon because they know it hsould be included since release. Hell, some devs even add extra content; weapons, maps, whatever (depending on game)!In vanilla I would have given it a recommend if you want a more realistic and micro managment intensive WW2 RTS than CoH2. With their attitude towards DLCs I have to say avoid.			"

												I love this game it is one of my most favourite world war 2 strategy games and just to tell you i played the whole company of heroes series, I recommend this game because the developers actually listen to their players which can be rare to find people like these guys today, this game deserves even more players then it has right now because this game offers a-lot of content including a full campaign of the Japanese, Germans, Russian, United states of America and even the British, this game also contains a steam workshop to help boost your gameplay if you think that something needs work on, and there is also a level editor where you can remake battles that happened in real life or just make a creative battle, and the multiplayer is a blast with other players, I really think this developer deserves the best and if you don't like the price wait for the steam summer sale so you can buy it for 10 bucks and thats a very good price for a game like this!

												Here's the deal:This game is identical in almost every aspect to the first MoW: AS. The maps are identical, the controls are identical, the UI is (mostly) identical, etc. However, the first AS is very old. If you're like me you put hundreds of hours into it by now and have probably even stopped playing it because you've done everything there was to do. I was at that point with the first one and hadn't opened it up in over three months because I was tired of it, until I saw this go on sale for 60% off. I figured ""Hey, what the hell, I get the full deluxe edition for $15 and I will be able to play Assault Squad again even if it's the same damn game."" As long as you know going into it that this is just an updated version of the first one, you will be fine and enjoy it. Do not expect anything new from the single player aspect other than a couple UI changes and (somewhat) better voice acting. The voice acting in the first one was so terrible though it wasn't hard to improve on. The only real changes are the focus on Steam and multiplayer. Steam Workshop means this game will stay fresh for a very long time with new content from users and it has all the bells and whistles of modern Steam games like cards to collect, XP to earn, in-game achievements to show off, etc. The other noticeable change is the difficulty level. Remember how ridiculously hard the first AS was on Hard mode? I literally rage quit dozens of times because the difficulty level was ABSURD. This game.. not so much. The Hard mode feels like Normal mode from AS. Heroic here is basically Hard mode there. This is a good thing in my opinion because it now allows hardcore fans like me to earn Heroic achievements because they were unattainable in the first. I wouldn't even try Heroic mode in the original one because I figured the AI had pocket nuclear missiles and a time machine to warp stealth fighters and gauss cannons back to beat my♥♥♥♥♥with. If you ever completed the single-player campaign from AS on Heroic mode, you should write a book about your endeavor and send me a copy. TL;DRUpdated version of the first game. Difficulty turned down a few notches. Get this on sale and don't expect a whole new game. "

My 2 Points why I don't like this game:1 This game does crash online, did play today , does 3 times crash.2 For AI/Multiplayer bots in Multiplayer you must buy a 10 Euro DLC.well, LOL, how deep can a company go ? I mean its a basic stuff an RTS must have, well there are sometimes reason not to put in  a game , but demand money for it ?  "

												UPDATE 22/02/2014The game has been transformed in some kind of test ape for DMS future product: Call of Arms. Features, which have little or no benefit for MOW, are rushed in a pre-alpha status and they have completely broken the game. Many people can not start the game, most of the people are suffering frequently crashes. Finishing a 2v2+ game is impossible.After one year from release the game fundamentals, like stability and lag, are still broken and nothing let us think they will be fixed. I waited one year in the hope that items for which the game was sold would be fixed. But this is the status today:- steam integration (to start the game you have to deactivate steam overlay)- improved graphics ( maybe a little on some machine)- steam multiplayer (broken)- matchmaking (broken)- 8v8 on spectacular maps( no 8v8 on sight and maps are the same as 5 years ago also they changed the store page to 4v4)My opinion over the gameplay remains unchanged: when played the game is fun, but currently it just can't be played therefore I don't feel like suggesting to buy it, it has no future.

												I love this game! The only issue that I have had with the game is that every time I tried to run the game it gave me an error and didn't run. My gaming experiance was on my cousin's computer and I loved every second of the game! I could have sat there and played for hours! I have yet to get the game to work on my own computer, but if you get the game working it is wonderful! I would definitly recomend it to my friends!			"

												Great Game. In its current stage, however, it is buggy and clunky. It has potential, but I would currently recommend COH2 over this game simply because of gamplay. For one, the AT guns (on all sides) are not very functional. I was in a game with a friend and the guns literally wouldn't fire at any of the tanks. Furthermore, when I ordered them to fire, they ran outside the house they were in, straight into machine gun fire. All of them were killed. If the creators fixed game mechanics, I would definitely buy into it. Second, the level up system is bullcrap. Just give the players access to all units. It just makes no sense to me why you wouldn't do that --- this is a strategy game, so why throw in random crap that casual players may never get to? Overall the game is just clunky and feels incomplete --- fix those problems, and I'll buy into it. Regardless, this game is still ok. I would recommend most steam users hold off and wait till it's cheaper, however.  "

												I love this game, base game is a good introduction and is fun and helps you understand the different sides with there strengths and weaknessess. Where this game trully shines is in the modding there is a very large amount of skins maps full mods that make the game very replayable. Controls are good as well, takes some time learning the menus , repairing, controlling, etc. There is also an editor where you can make youre own maps and upload them to the steam workshop or keep it for youre self. There is also multiplayer which is fun with friends or randoms which offers a competitive experience on regular or modded maps. pros: -Good gameplay - fun co op online experience  -good amount of content in base game   -modding is amazing and has a great amount of content to offer from the great commuity  -offers a fun and enjoyable experience cons: -takes a srong computer to run high settings  - units get stuck sometimes (mostly in modded maps)Overall this game is fun and enjoyable and can appeal to many people with its large amout of mods and awesome battles Hope this review was helpful!

												Game is very strategic and skill based. The single player is kind of lack luster but it makes up for it in the multiplayer. Some things that are unique are the direct control feature where you can control your units movements and gun. You can do this on any unit in the game and it really dodges any problems you would have with Ai not going exactly where you want them or shoot where you want. Vehicle fighting is fun because they don't just have a health bar, they have components on them that can be damaged and need to be repaired. When fighting a heavy tank that your gun can't pin, if you flank around the side of it you might be able to pin through the weaker side armor, it adds a very fun game mechanic. It does require a lot of micro but that is part of the fun.			"

												After a few patches this game without mods became much better than the first Assault Squad in terms of gameplay and visuals.At first it looked like a generic copy of the first game but with a couple of added missions and extra fancy variables however, this game now looks worth buying at full price, the amount of new missions is incredible, the scripting for the missions have improved greatly.The maps don't look much different to the first Assault Squad however, the new textures for units and new vehicles make the game look so much different. The SS soldiers now wear realistic M44 Peadot Camouflage and British Commandos with proper Pattern 2 Denison Smocks. The skins for the vehicles look much nicer on top of that and the veterancy system for each individual unit is a nice mechanic.The multiplayer is also as enjoyable as the first Assault Squad, even more so with the great modding community behind the game, AS:2 has a workshop which AS did not. Now my mods can automatically update to keep up the game's patches and developer's work without me having to keep going back to websites such as ModDB to see what's new and spend hours reinstalling.Overall I would recommend this game to anyone, new or old comers to the Men of War Franchise as the game offers so much and the rewards and achievements are plenty.

Men of War Assault Squad 2 is an rts game that has touched a part in me that no other games apart from Call to arms that has never really come that close. As a teenager I used to make models using Airfix and once when I was 12/13 years of age I built a model in school from using paper mache. The model representing a typical no mans land of World War 1. I constructed the map on a large oblong wooden board. I used matchsticks for designing the wooden floors inside trenches and very thin wire scrunched up for a barbed wire effect with painted matchsticks that would ideally serve as wooden poles for keeping the barbedwire together creating an appropriate realism. When I would take the model home I would sit there for hours repositioning my plastic soldiers and vehicles that I had bought or made using Airfix. The fun times I had then thinking back now makes me realise much more how grateful I am to own such a wonderful creation in my games library. My imagination then as a teenager is exactly the same now as when I build my maps for the Men of war Assault  Squad 2 Workshop. As I always get that exact same blueprint thrill now as I did when I was much younger. The best part about Men of War Assault Squad 2 is the Steam Community Workshop. The amount of goodies on there is basically a gamers paradise for updating their MOWAS2. Think of it like this.If the games updates suddenly ceased on the developers side, well the Steam Workshop carry on the updating process for many years to come like the new generation of gamers say 20/30 years from now. I always like to think how my workshop maps being still appreciated by the future generation of new gamers to the growing compilation of Men of War. Also the whole point of the Steam Workshop is that the modifications there is a great contribution for keeping Men of War Assault Squad 2 alive & strong for many years to come as they serve as updates for the game anyway. Check out the Steam Workshop here http://steamcommunity.com/app/244450/workshop/Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a game that has saved me so many times when wanting to feel that old feeling again as I did when building my models as a teenager all those years ago. As I said up there no other game has ever really come that close.Thank You so much to Digitalmindsoft for creating a masterpiece that will always serve its place in the priceless treasure trove of classsic rts games.

												This game is both the best ww2 title out there and the worst disaster of a game at the same time.  It holds some great game elements as well as some absolute game design disasters. It is sad to see so much potential getting wasted.First, the good stuff:Let me begin by saying this: After playing this game for a bit, other titles like Company of Heroes really started to look like jokes.Both infantry and armor gameplay are awesome.The multiplayer game experience in itself is awesome. No other words for it. It has a very good tempo. The stakes are always high. So much can change in a split second. The balance between infantry and armor is top notch. The arcade element is there and it rewards good play. The best part is, this game is doing all this while keeping a very good amount of realism and detail.All the factions that the game comes with. Like, really. I see so many people complaining about AI not being free. Ok maybe thats wrong but you guys realize that this is pretty much one of the few ww2 titles that comes with five factions right? Thats gotta mean something.The mod support. There are mods featuring even the tiniest of ww2 factions. Wanna play as french in 1940? you got it. Would you prefer to play as Poland? Sure thing! You want the game to be much more spectacular and realistic? Tired ot the games linear and unimaginative skirmishes? Do you want to play with star wars factions? Hell, do you want a mod of a weeb anime about schoolgirls and tanks? You have it all. With all the mods there are out there, the vanilla game feels like a mere demo of the full experience. And make no mistake, the vanilla game still has a lot of content.Yeah, it sounds awesome right, Now for the bad stuff:Multiplayer matchmaking system. It's not just bad, it practically doesn't exist. You don't have any way to just hop in and play, you have to host a game, wait for people to join in (which takes so much as 20 minutes sometimes) and you have no idea if they are in your level or not. It can be a nice competitive match or just an absolute massacre. This is the result of trying to implement restricted units and having downright unimaginative stupid map designs for current ingame matchmaking system. A game like this shoud have had dedicated matchmaking for individual mods.Too many settings for multiplayer. This is not supposed to be a problem, but when the matchmaking is broken, some people will never learn about the proper balanced settings of the game.The skirmishes are linear and repetitive. If you want good single player content you have to go to the workshop.The difficulty setting of the skirmishes are downright ridiculous. I mean seriously, changing damage infantry takes? I mean how dimwitted you have to be for not realising doing that changes the game's mechanics completely? Being able to run at a mechinegun fire just kills the games experience and gives the beginners wrong expectations about everything. Not to mention that it defeats the whole purpose of having a single player campaign which is primarily educating the player for full multiplayer experience.Infantry animations look cheap. It is the first thing most of the newcomers will notice and it doesn't hold up with the rest of the game.Bugs and out of sync issues. Which is much better by now but having constant out of snyc problems for more than year after the launch is pretty bad. Along with the broken matchmaking, this is the reason why so few people play it today.DLCs are not well thought out. Seriously, mods are better.The developers of this game made a great product but somehow it seems like they don't really understand what makes it so great. And they don't seem to understand some of the most fundamental gamer expectations. All that said, I would still recommend this game. Even with all the dlc's the price is a bloody steal for all the content it provides. BUT keep in mind that its rough around some of the edges that it really shouldn't have been.			"

												After the kind of shaky launch I can now finally recommend the game. Optimization has greatly improved as well as a bunch of new and much requested features such as bots and replay system. These along is enough for most series veteran to get back to the game. Both features will also help new players pick up the game much easier.All in all, AS2 is an excellent iteratation of the Men of War series, please buy it to support the fine folks at DMS who really did a good job of supporting all their games.

												Is this game 10 times better than company of heroes?   YESI am soooo tiered of games that the units engage in combat with auto hit system (al la starcraft) so it turns into a health bar drainage with not to hit or miss possiblity. Basically an rts water balloon fight to see what unit counters what and drains health bars quicker than other units as the main focus. The person who click manages the build system is the one who comes out on top usually. None of that here...each unit is spawned based on objectives like coh but more realistic. Each unit has a personal name, gain experience based on performance, and have attritional statistical values that contribute to a hit or miss attack as well as variable damage. Each section of the map is an all encompassing campain, not a region that loads once you arrive there trigering the ai at that monment to take action. THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC ...HOWEVER....Biggest complaint tho with this game....WHY IN THE HELL Do THE UPDATES KILL THE PREVIOUS SAVES!!!EFFECTIVLY THIS GAME IS BROKEN! you will never get through the campain before they pull a mandatory update again one day and render all of your previous saves unreadable! its the single most rediculous thing ever. In fact I dont know a game that does that. But yeah, You will continually have to start from the beginning with the way its set up. loose all your  hard work and experienced units that carry over to the the next fight becuase they dont know how to code the saves to work with new versions of the game once its updated. so you just loose it all!

												I have been quite the fan of Men of War. I love RTS and I love WWII, so its perfect for me. One thing to note is that this game can be incredibly complex. The amount of micro you CAN put into this game can be quite insane. Every single unit has an inventory, ammunition, tanks/vehicles have fuel that runs out. It can all be resupplied from trucks or dead troops or vehicles. This game is tons of fun and extremely realistic. There really isnt much of a singleplayer campaign/story its more of just challenge skirmishes that you can play by yourself or with friends. Do not get me wrong it can be incredibly fun. This game takes time to learn, but it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiances ever. I love it. Here is the difficult thing, it really isnt much of a step up from the first Men of War Assault Squad. Yes they included all the DLC maps that they sold to people in the first one, and there are new units and it handles slightly better than its predecessor but not by much. The game is in need of a new engine badly, the games engine cannot handle how complex the physics are. Other than that if you are aware that it really isnt a sequel but more of an update/expansion? I guess and you know what your getting into then go for it pick it up. Other than that don't buy it unless its on a sale if you have the first.8.5/10			"

												It's a decent WWII RTS. You can learn the basics in the tutorial provided and eventually start advancing once you begin the singleplayer. However, the mutiplayer is unforgiving in this game. You will be hampered, tossed around, gang banged... every match will literally become nightmare fuel for you and your teammates...I'd recommend staying away from the multiplayer as it has many vets sticking around until the day you eventually master the singleplayer or become a brilliant strategist, then give it a try...With friends for double the fun. If you're concerned about the pricing of the game, I'd suggest waiting until a sale to buy the complete edition as it includes more singleplayer missions, multiplayer bots ( only server hosts need this to enable), and more. Is it worth it you ask? Well uhh...This wasn't in the script..♥♥♥♥♥♥yeah go and buy it. But don't forget to buy it during a sal-			"

												Its the exact same as Assault Squad 1.  All the same skirmish missions with a few extra added in that are new.  It says that in the description and I knew this but I thought they would at least revamp the old missions and add a greater selection of units that they added.  Instead I must trudge through the old missions to get to the new.  The other thing I do not like at all about either game is that each skirmish mission for each country is EXACTLY the same format.  A little variety here and there and perhaps a bit more uniqueness when it comes to the different countries would be fantastic.  Things that feature the strengths and weaknesses of a country perhaps.  I just cannot recommend this game but if you do not have either and absolutely want to buy it then do not get both 1 and 2.  As 2 is all you would need and should have been the only one released.  I knew what I was getting to some point but I still feel robbed of my money.			"

All these new MOW's coming out just seem as big DLC's of basic MOW. Just like Red Tide. Was it really necessary to make a full game about the red army in WW2? That is just a standalone DLC that should cost like 5 dollars. AS2 just looks like AS with more glitches , random crashes , sync errors , editor random crashes etc....

												I think the series is doing really bad with the new small updates that cost 30+ Euro, also if you want to play with AI and have fun you have to buy the DLC, if you can't then you just try to find a lobby which takes several hours due to the horrible community that doesn't want you to play the game and loves kicking people instead of playing the hosts just really love sitting in pre game lobby for several hours. Also ranking up in this game is hard because developers implemented a new feature called Dsync probably the only feature that affects games the most other then the new GUI.What I want from the next Installment is a new Men of War game, maybe Men of War 2 that isn't a copy from 2003 with less features and more problems. I hope Best Way developes the next Men of War instead of the current kids tweaking the past 4 Men of War games they would of been a much better game if they used a new engine or upgraded the current one in a noticible way, the only upgrade I see in AS2 is bad AI and Dsyc. Bestway please listen and make the next MoW i've played played MOW 1 and Faces of War the other ones are just ruined versions of those games.I am just trying to say DMS needs to work harder you take everything out of the old games and just tweak it a little with bad ideas, and sell it as a brand new game.

Early Access Review
								I was in the main, interested in pre 20th Century warfare and played games accordingly.  Having become very disillusioned with a well known companies latest RTS game which I had been waiting for...for many years, I went out looking for a replacement just to keep me occupied until they got their act together and put it right.  Looking through my old games I resurrected MOWAS1, played a few games and really enjoyed myself.  Then noticed that MOWAS2 was being released in Beta during March 2014, read the blurb and signed up and duly paid my monies for the Deluxe edition...  Since then I have never looked back, I have loved every bit of the 140 odd hours played (that equates to less than £0.15p per hour), and it hasnt even been officially released yet.  Sure there are glitches (still Early Access when writing this post), but they will be resolved. the single play and Co-op has been envigorating and have made many new friends to wile away the hours with.  I highly recommend this game to anyone from a single play and Co-op play perspective (Not really played enough Multiplay to comment).  Bye-the-way, I havent even looked back to see if the ancients RTS game I waited for, has improved......			"

												MOWAS2 the great successor of the old soldier heroes of ww2. No RTS or RTT can get even close to this game. It is almost simulation with lot of physics in it. It keeps you stunned in so many ways. It is real, serious, competitive and beautiful. It lacks the use of planes in multiplayer, I wish it has some of order of war features in this regard. This game is the best ww2 themed game ever made and worth every penny. It is one of my favorite games. If you are a fan of arcades, animation with no military knowledge this game is made for soldiers and tacticians avoid it.			"

												This is clearly a highly emmersed and well thought out game. While playing it for free (before I bought it on sale) I had in one skirmish to go fix up a special tank behind enemy lines. While the enemys did crush me time and time again, I then learned I could tell the tank crew fixing the tank with a repair kit to pick up a bazooka and shoot the enemy tanks that were bothering me. The fact that I could pick up any old equiptment dropped by allied/enemy soldiers and blow up buildings just by driving my tank through them was astounding, and I've loved the game ever since.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game for it is a totally unique ww2 rts game with all sorts of fun interaction and destroyable enviroments with a whole bunch of different units.It's still a great joy when your tank gets destroyed and the men inside have to get out, now what do you do? You won't win any fight against an enemy tiger with a pistol. But oh wait! you can look inside your tank and take some dynamite out of it. Now just take direct control of your guy and run like a maniac or sneak behind The enemy tank and just place that dynamite right on there and watch the fireworks happen. There is a lot of value in this game if you can look past a lot of issues which are: bad user interface, horrible micro management of your units, sometimes laggy gameplay, even game breaking bugs. And if you play this game without Robz Realism or GSM mod you are going to have a bad time with damage modeling being just plain awful, artillery range being weak like a potato gun and tanks going slower than a snails pace. I really would not recommend playing without one of those mods.Multiplayer works most of The time quite well if players have good internet connection and pc's. It's easy to get matches happening since there are a small community of dedicated players. You can set up all sorts of custom rules for your games too. Since I like to play with Robz Realism modification The online matches can sometimes end in a game breaking bug if you have lots of units that have broken down and created all sorts of clutter and destroyed buildings and so on. I think it's because the game engine was not meant to be designed for that much stuff on the battlefield at once. Luckily this only happens in really large battles and personally I really don't enjoy the kind of games where there is just too much points available to spend on a thirty tanks and fifteen batallions of troops at once.There are a lot of content available for this game but the developers have made patches to The game that render some of The steam workshop content unplayable with The latest version. There are a lot of custom campaigns that can be played in co-op too. You can even find a total conversion that gives The game a modern military theme. I would not recommend bying at full price since I don't think The developers are going to patch this much further anymore.			"

												Watch the trailer, the game really looks that way, if you have the right hardware.  Use a coupon or wait for a sale, and when you have the chance to get the game for less than 10 bucks, you should probably buy it. As long as you like strategic war games.High detailed battle field, destructible buildings and trees. Fire a mortar shell in a house and crush your enemy with flying debris or a falling tree. Capture an enemy tank and repair it. Most units have an inventory to carry ammo, weapons and repair kits, search fallen soldiers and abandoned vehicles for such items.+ Tooltips and autosave- Interaction with units is sometimes a bit difficult, but you get used to that9.8/10 "

												A pretty challenging but fun to learn strategy game. To win a game against a experienced player you have to be focused, patient and willing to take game changing chances. A biiig downside though is the time it takes to find a perfect match, most games that you join in the pub are either really laggy or unfair.			"

												Played as Nazi Germany, got a 4 - 5 veterancy tank...Saw an achilles.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. What to do what to do...Tried shooting it, but can't due to it being far...It got the first shot and killed most of the tank crew, two survived the whole match...10/10 Never forget the story of the 4 - 5 veteran tank that almost got destroyed by achilles.Real Review:So Men of War: Assault Squad 2, is about WW2, where you command forces of five factions. Nazi Germany, Japan, Brits, Soviets and Americans. I will say that to get use to this game, you have to learn from other players (Like one of my friends who bought the game recently) or you will be beaten really fast. But playing with a friend will give you really epic moments, like rushing in a zone to kill everyone but get yourself killed, then send in a tank to support the last of your men and capture the point.MOW has a lot of bugs, but can be fixed by getting Robz Realism Mod (Which is really popular) which adds more realism, vehicles and much more. The mods that people make are some of the best ones that i played.Score: 9/10			"

												The developers say Men of War 2? I say Men of War...Again. TL;DR - great game, not a new one though. The latest installment of the Men of War series offers...the same as the first. aside from a few graphical fidelity tweaks, some small mechanic improvementsn and a few additions here and there, i would not title this as anything other than a remaster. All the changes i see in this game couldve been updates for the first, I daren't say it warrants a whole new game. I understand that my hours arent in the hundreds, but after playing the first one and budging myself into buying the second, im not really seeing a difference. At all. I'll keep it short and simple. For those who own the first men of war, you don't gain anything from buying this one. Of course, this game allows multiplayer, as the first one had its servers shut down. But if you're looking for a new singleplayer experience, you won't find it here. It is the same game, with the same missions, and the same features. Some are brushed up a little, but still the same. For those who don't. I would definitely recommend this. it's great, don't be disheartened by the developpers lack of change from the first game. Because the first one was and still is a gem. To summarise, if you're new, go for it. Love the depth of this game and really explore it. If you aren't, save the money, reinstall the first one and be done with it. EDIT: for those of you saying 'IT HAS AN EDITOR THOUGH' yes. It does. correct. But back to my original point, does the addition of an editor really need a WHOLE 'new' release?			"

												If you love very in-depth WW2 strategy games then you must buy this game. This game's detail to war goes from the stats of a gun, (which you can pick up or throw away) to the thickness of a tank relative to it's placement, and angle. Winning in this game is a fantastic feeling, because there is quite the learning curve. No maybe not control wise, but forgetting to press a button while your troops are advancing can easily get the whole squad killed. This game is easier to learn, and is very difficult to master. Having said that, even I have raged as at some point. It becomes infuriating as you're well thought out troop placements become obsolete when the enemy has an arty piece that for some reason, bull eye's you  almost every time. Rendering your flag with no defense, and all those troop's MP (manpower) cost down the drain. I would say that starting out, play with a friend to learn the controls, then go to public multiplayer to fine tune yourself.That is another thing too that I should add. DO NOT buy this game if you intend to play singleplayer only. This game has a fantastic community and multiplayer system with kind and patient people who are willing to help out first-timers. So be sure to let them help you out. Overall I easily reccommend this game as one of my all-time favorite war games, as I keep coming back to it, over and over again.			"

Gameplay is exactly like Soldiers- Heroes of World War just as i wanted it to be!. Ever wanted a RTS Game in which you could also take control of individual characters (Direct Control) ?as well as team control, drive all sorts of war vehicles (in Direct Control). Pros RTS Game with Direct Character/Vehicle Control Gameplay similar to Faces of war and Soldiers- Heroes of World War Graphics Gameplay ReplayabilityCons Honestly, None. "

Much more fun can be expected if you have friends to play with but the campain isn't half bad. The AI path finding is horrible some times but still better than the one they in used in MOAW1. Solid 9/10			"

												Amazing game it really is one my all time favourite strategy games with very little bugs although the difference between singleplayer and multiplayer is big as the troop are near invincible in singleplayer and near useless in multiplayer if you dont dig in and make them come to you			"

												I downloaded the first Men of war the demo. Next day I bought this one. It is such a great game. Hours an hours of fun. I always find myself saying Ill only play for an hour. look up and its been 3 hrs. Most the missions can easily take 3 hours to do.  I cant make a list of the things I like, cause youd read forever.  this game is easily 10/10 for me !			"

												Very good real-time strategy. It reflects the realities of World War 2 Moreover, the fate of the game can change even one soldier I can recommend 100%!Of course, as every game has its pros and cons to mention below.+ Strong emphasis on realism extra game is not easy is quite difficult and you have to toil.+ Extensive vehicles with their damage, destruction, fuel, ammo which changes the very gameplay.+ The ability to use the workshop+ Models destruction and good physics+ A large variety of units.+ Unusual multiplayer games.-Very Unfriendly game for beginners, both in playing the game and in the editor.- Frequent crashes.- Poor optimization of even the most powerful computers strong explosion is able to do the problem computer.-Very Poor singleplayer campaign (fortunately, with the help of steam comes workshop)In my opinion 8/10 because you have to remember that the game is in Beta and is still developing.

												One of the best strategy games I have ever played. Being extremely tactical and realistic, it is also quite difficult; even the ammo assigned to each individual soldier is to be kept under control!Tank battles are far more realistic than they are in other similar games; vehicles can be crewed and uncrewed, damages depend on the kind of shell, on the distance from the target and on the hit part. Covers are nice, and it is possible to control the soldiers' stance (standing up, prone and so on) manually. Enemy vehicles, if abandoned and not completely destroyed, can be recovered and stolen. Anti tank guns are really effective against tanks, but there is always a certain amount of randomness which makes everything unpredictable and suspencing. Every action has to be planned accurately, and unreasoned and silly moves are very likely to cause disastrous outcomes; there is a nice reinforcements mechanism which depends on the controlled checkpoints, and new weapons are available on the field after a new checkpoint has been conquered.The only bad thing is that, during multiplayer battles, reinforcements are automatically split among players, causing messy situations (""who called this sniper?"" ""Can I have your Panzer, or you desperately need it?""). It is possible to send units to an ally player, but this takes time and can be pretty annoying.			"

												This game is a bit of a conundrum for me. On the one hand I love playing it, and Co-Op is my thing. Using clever tactics and wits to fight your enemies is very gratifying. Online vs. players is wonderful but honestly I just suck too much at it to have a ton fun. On the other hand the AI is LAME, like they spent about 20 minutes on it and decided that since it went places automatically then it was fine. I miss the cool maps and missions of the old Men of War games. Still, because of the entrenched enemies and the constantly annoying reinforcement of tanks and things it’s still challenging to play with online. This game is a ton of fun and I would suggest this game to anyone.			"

												Great game. Not only is it a tactical rts, but it does it's best to be realistic, with accurate Fog of War and Line of Sight. Allowing you to take personal control of each unit is a bonus as well. If I had to critisize something, it would be the controls, they can be a bit confusing at first, but are pretty easy to learn quickly.			"

												This game is purely amazing. It's realistic RTS is very fun and engaging. I always love to go into this game and control a Panther or a Tiger and do some serious damage on American or Russian lines! The campain is amazing as well, the story isn't that interesting but it's definnatly something to give a try. But what makes this game so amazing is the multiplayer. Fight your friends and foes in some awesome battles on historical maps across europe and russia! I will forever recommend this game to all of my friends that enjoy RTS.			"

												At first I was completely frustrated and thought this game was way too hard to enjoy.  But - once I got the hang of how to use your units together (and keep them stocked with ammo) this became one of the biggest time sucks that's happened at my house in a very long time.  Lots of detail, lots of variety, and the physics system works very well.  As soon as you've taken that victory point, some far-reaching artillery will remind you that what got you here sure as heck won't get you to the next one.  And if you think you'll overpower the enemy with a tank rush, well - just try it.  If Company of Heroes is high school, the MOWAS2 is a graduate degree program. Get it on sale.			"

												I've had this game for a long time and even had some fun with it when I first purchased it but then I drifted back to Company of Heroes 2 as usual. On a whim I fired up MOW AS2 today and had an absolute blast with it. This is a must play for WWII and RTS enthusiasts. It's challenging. Absolute tons of micromanaging to be done here but when you start getting it and making combined arms tactics work it is thrilling. Honestly, it's a difficult game to master and I'm not there yet but if you want a challenge this is your game. The graphics on ultra settings are very very nice and the game's presentation is more ""realistic"" if I can use that word than Company of Heroes. Performance is a little uneven which is understandable with everything that's going on. It's crazy how many moving parts there are here so a respectable processor is recommended. I have what currently is the flagship AMD APU the A10 7850k OC'ed to 4.5ghz paired with an R9 285 and 32gb of ram (design) and when there's a lot of concentrated artillery, infantry and vehicle movement it can run in the low 20's though I wouldn't say it makes the game unplayable. I probably should mess around with the shadows and post processing to see if I can improve that but for the most part the game runs well. Obviously your experience will vary and if you're on a laptop or older desktop then be prepared to make serious sacrifices in the graphics settings. I should probably mention that there's no proper campaign, it's more a series of disconnected battles vs. the CPU but I didn't feel the game suffered because of a lack of narrative. If you like WWII you get the context and you can fill in the blanks yourself without having a character driven story line. Well, that's it. If you're reading this at all it's because you're interested so pull the trigger. It's a great game 9/10.			"

												i literally have to give this a ""Not Recommended""... why? let me explain.... before? i would have said to buy it, even if you own AS1... sort of a waste of money, but at least no third party multi-player. ( AS1 should have been integrated into steam servers after gamespy closed all servers for all games they supported... but hey, screw that, charge the same players for another game if they want online features )EVEN before i'd say buy this even with it being the EXACT same game as AS1, just ... horribly optimized? somehow my computer can play AS1 no problem. but AS2 dominated my computer....? when they're the same game? no, i don't understand either.but then..... they did the WONDERFUL ""Game update 3.112.0"" and this has destroyed the game for me. not only does it run EVEN worse on my computer, to the point that any co-op is impossible even with having very fast internet.... but NOW???NOW... you have NO supplies in trucks. no ammo, no anything. oh wait, grenades...? cool? yeah, not really...i loved preparing for an assault, stocking my soldiers up with ammo then heading out. now? you can just put 5 grenades on each person and ... nothing else. i hope you like grenades, because that's all you'll be getting.before, you could unload shells from trucks and make IED's. now, obviously you can't. your troops get a magical resupply of ammo from trucks. even the officer supply drop was ruined. no rifle ammo, no SMG ammo, no MG ammo. your troops can just fire all day and get resupplied from a small paradrop. it makes NO sense and just kills this game for me. the realism is thrown out the window. sir hinkel, as i'm sure anyone that plays AS1 or AS2 knows of... ( if you don't, he makes missions for the German Soldier's Mod, which is amazing as are his missions ) made scripts that resupply your troops with crates / trucks. you can watch the ammo going from the truck / crate, and going into your soldiers inventory. it only resupplies to a set number. so 100 rifle rounds, 300 SMG, 1000 MG....yet the developers somehow did worse than..... a random person using Gem Editor? are you SERIOUS? someone working for free / fun made resupply amazing yet people making LOTS OF MONEY FAIL!?!?!i've held off on this for a few months now. there's no difference..... i bought AS2 ONLY to support this company for making games that have realism. now? NO. ( stupid me, i even bought the Deluxe Edition to support this company )sure, video games are all fantasy, even simulators........but this just destroyed it. this game is not ""early access"" or alpha, or beta, or ANYTHING else. it's the complete game, and they ruined it for me...yes, yes... i know, huge long rant about one thing, but it offended me this much. i even posted to developers......no response. nothing. this is the only reason i waited for the negative review. in hopes they'd see and fix this horrible thing they've done.because of this, i truly can't recommend that you spend ...any money on this, let alone 29.99$ ( as of this moment )just buy assault squad 1 for a lesser price tag... unless you are REALLY devoted to multi-player and don't want to use third party programs for it.seriously... AS1 is a master-piece and there are a lot of cool scripts and other things you can use to make awesome missions yourself. it's not hard, just need to spend some time on it. i'd be happy to help anyone learn how to use things in Gem Editor, especially for AS1. ( also AS1 will run better on your computer, no matter how good.... or crappy your computer may be )hmmm also, if anyone thinks ""only 21.6 hours?"" or anything... look at my play time for AS1, 358 hours as of today, and it ""may"" be my favorite game...ever. that's why i know AS2 is a huge slap in the face to anyone who has played the men of war games. ( if not going even further back with faces of war and even further back... )IF and ONLY IF developers put ammo into trucks and crates again will i give this a positive review, and i'd even suggest you pay 29.99$. it's really not a bad game, seeing as it's close to a direct copy / paste of AS1... just doesn't run as smoothly.LET ME MAKE IED'S AGAIN!!! >;(			"

												If your a big fan of World War II games, or if you simply enjoy a good real time strategy, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is definitely for you. Providing the player with five single-player campaigns and armies, Men of War is literally full of different units all of which are unique and are more or less historically accurate. The game always keeps you in strategic dicision making, and the direct firing control which was first introduced in Soldiers Heroes of World War II (a very old but awesome predecessor of this here fine title) makes tank duels an unmatched experience which you won't find in any other comparable RTS (like CoH 2 for an example). What really makes this game valuable and gives many hours of gameplay is the multiplayer. There are many different maps and a decent amount of players. Due to the in-game physics, armor penetration chances, infantry maneuvers, gamestyles of the players, every match is never the same, so every single battle always becomes a new, unpredictable challange. The game also has many modes, so you can always play the one which fits your style, with strategic point control, casual combat and even cooperative missions all being present for you to enjoy. While competing in online battles, the player has the opprotunity to choose his own style of play. Tanks, infantry and artillery all fulfil their crucial roles in order to achieve victory, and all types of units require an individual commanding approach. Multiplayer is undoubtedly the most apparent upside of AS2. Since the GEM engine is rather old, the graphics in this multiplayer strategy are a bit below the standards, especially if we start comparing this title to Company of Heroes 2. This, however, is compensated by the scale of the battlefields which are present in this game, with explosions and complete destruction of in-game objects all contributing to an astonishing overall image of war as it is shown in Assault Squad 2. In spite of graphics not being the bestest quality of this RTS, they are nevertheless pleasant to look at. The textures are neat, the models of the vehicles are very detailed, explosions and visual effects are dynamic, thus commiting to credibility. Out of anything more negative, i can only note the models and textures of the infantry, which haven't been updated since 2006 when Faces of War came out. In general, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 can be recommended to anyone who wants to play a good quality WW2 RTS with a well developed multiplayer.  "

												Almost my whole squad was mowed down by a machinegunner.I took control of the last surviving member of the squad, healed him and equipped him with some of it's dead teammates weapons and completed the mission with him.10/10 would Rambo againBut seriously, it's a WWII realtime strategy game with more realistic mechanics than for example Company of Heroes. Each soldier is truly an individual with his own health and inventory (which you can modify). You can squad them up and move them as a squad or send each individual to a specific location.Ammunition and fuel run out and you have to resupply your forces, you can micromanage each individual soldier or do it as a squad.Tank mechanics are a bit different than soldier mechanics. Tanks don't have healthbars. Instead, if you for example destroy the engine or turret, it can't drive or move it's turret respectively. The penetration mechanics are also more realistic. If you play Warthunder, it's a simplified version of the one you're used to in Ground Forces. Tanks, as do all vehicles, must be crewed by soldiers. The crew can be knocked out. If a tank doesn't have a gunner, it can't aim and fire it's gun. The crew will automatically try to fill the most vital spots, so it's possible to have a tank with one crewmember that switches between seats as needed, although this is of course far less efficient than a fully crewed tank. But one of the most interesting features is the ability to 'ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL'of a soldier or vehicle. Making it a sort of top-down 3D shooter..thingamajigger.When I'm playing a singleplayer game I often get the feeling I'm a small part of a large scale battle. You usually get control over a squad or two and sometimes some vehicles. And when you force a breakthrough, your allies will pour through it and take advantage of it.And there is also a powerful map editor that is easy to understand, so there are a lot of maps made available by skilled editors.TL;DR Buy this game or bad things will happen to your pet ostrich named George V.

												I would try to say something positive about this game because I already posted a review [Now Deleted] complaining but what is there positive about this game? The game developers have just basically released Assault Squad but slapped a 2 on the side of it, as well as this they add the original games missions in to make up for the lack of content. Still same game engine, no graphical improvement, if there is I cannot tell. Nothing real exciting as a whole. And to make the game ""better"" they start releasing ""DLCs"" such as Iron Fist [Tank Combat] which ads 2-3 missions in which all it does is lock your camera view, and Airborne [Self Explanitory] in which the almost same thing occurs, a small hand full of missions is released, as well as ""bots"" bearly functional AI which should've been in the base game not labled as DLC and getting people to pay for it just for extra money. The only semi-decent thing this game even has is mod support, some of the mods are better than the base game itself, and are even free.To me this game is unplayable without mods.And do yourself a favour, if you already have Assault Sqaud, don't get this game, but if you don't mind numerous bugs, crashing multiplayer, underwhelming graphics and single player campaigns, DLCs aimed to make you pay MORE money to get features which should've been in the base game and a overall disappointing game for any REAL strategist out there.

												I loved Men of War Assault Squad, it was a great alternative to something like CoH. I've always wanted Men of War Assault Squad 2 and have just recently bought it whilst it is on sale. To be honest, I think that it is a bit rich to call this game a sequal of even a bit stupid to call it Men of War Assault Squad TWO. This just feels like an expansion pack for the first game seeing as they have bought maps back form the previous title to make it look like there are more maps. It just feels a bit cheap for them to do that. The visuals have ever so slightly improved, but there is the same voice acting, menu screen, HUD, death animations, basically look at the last title and everything from that is in this game. I really do fail to see what makes this a new game from the old one. There are some slight differences like the character models and.......actually, I can't really think of anything else that is actually different. So as you can see, I think this game was a bit of a let down, they basically got MoW AS and said ""I can't actaully be bothered to make a new game. We'll just chuck in a few extra maps and bring some back form the previous title"".			"

												If you have played Men of War assualt squad then this will be a very familure game. This is about the same as the first but with improved graphics and with better interface helpers (such as lines showing where your forces will move through). There are no new units in comparison to MoW:AS unless you use mods, but then, that is expected as no new units are being made from WW2 in this time and age. This is one of my favorate games on the market currently that has actual armor charactoristics and not just a ""point and shoot"" like company of heroes or other of that ilk. This game also allows you to manually controll one unit if you so wish (usually they are AI controlled the same as any RTS).With the many different weapons in your arsenal as well as tanks, halftracks 5tons and duce-n-a-halfs this game brings a fast as well as very realistic feel to World War instead of a cookie cutter cut and paste game where everyone is equal. You may not experiance the many small (or large) issues that the allies and axis had in WW2 with things breaking on tanks (from notmal use) but it is still a great game.			"

												i never really played MoW:AS1 this apparently has a lot of the same levels from it but i really love how the levels play so i have no issues with it like others seem to have, it does look alot better graphics wise so i love it. runs ok too sometimes the kills pile up and it will slow down a bit .now i got Soldiers: Heroes of World War II, faces of war and men of war as day one physical copies and they really do bring some awesome things to the table.Direct Control:Direct Control of tanks & Soldiers is what really makes this game shine and it has improved greatly over the many previous titles before it so lots of endless fun there. World War II tanks are just soo awesome .MP:i cant comment on MP because i have not really given it a go yet so ya idk yet.Level Editor:its easy and super fun to play around with or even just add tanks to current levels also improved greatly over previous titles. i remember wanting it soo bad for Soldiers: Heroes of World War II .Mods:cool mods are pouring in too i love the blood mod its a must just know if mods are not installing you may need to briefly turn on steam cloud so it uploads them i dont know why but thats what i had to do.

								I CANNOT UPVOTE THIS ENOUGH. I used to be a COH player through and through, then i became older than 13 and realised what a stupid and failed game that it really is. If you want to see men being cut down and tanks blown up by molotov cocktails the way that god intended it then this game is for you. Seriously. Once you play past the first couple of missions you will not want to return to company of zeroes ever again. I first started with the original Men Of War Assault Squad, this is better than that and with all of the content coming out I am sure that it will be the best in the Men Of Series to date.			"

												Men of War; A quite big Franchise of Real-Time Strategy Games, all made with an awesome engine to support it.My Experience with Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a huge amount of fun, this includes the editor.If you take very small bugs or glitches in account it still is a very playable game.This game is probably for me one of the most realistic or authentic Strategy WW2 Games so far and uses more strategic thinking than ever.

												I enjoyed this game so much for the time I have been playing as evident by the screen shots I have taken, the ability to control the units inventory and how they protect themselves along with facing and many other aspects over their control is very enjoyable. I recently started to try the modded maps and had found great interest in a few the best ones having screen shots. The game is worth buying alone and the additions just ad much more. Here is a example of a modded map I had a interesting time with. Mt Pretty v 1.2 by TjdaggerYou can find screen shots of it on my profile.Stage 1 ""Hard"" I been playing this for several days now on hard, I captured the first base and all the ground to the bridge. I then started to set up mortars and artillery to destroy their base artillery. At this point I was able to destroy two of the mid range ones. After that most of my equipment was target and hit with accuracy I could not achieve with anything I could use or buy. This cycle would repeat thanks to the heavy artillery. I first tried pushing with many units spread out with no prevail, then with a large group of the best tanks I could buy, with no prevail, then made the logical conclusion I needed to do full out assault. I built up my units with the addition now of snipers & medics.   I repaired tanks and added them to my growing tank unit and ordered new mid range Artillery then I did a full on assault. My units were killed off so I kept ordering more and healing the dead. Next I found my tanks getting destroyed and one of my artillery, I moved in more to replace them and the new units arrived, as they pushed up the hills it felt alike to D day as they were swiftly mowed down or blown away. My tanks became damaged and I worked hard to repair what I could but I soon ran out of tanks, the last set of units was spread far to divert the fire of the artillery which works for sometime, but I was unable to make any direct hits on anything with my artillery which became annoying which then they were swiftly hit in order by the heavy artillery. I even had that heavy artillery hit an ammo and it made a domino effect causing the fuel truck to explode the 4 mid range artillery to explode the machine gunner and units nearby to get hit by the explosion, and lastly the tank and other vehicles nearby. As said it was a domino effect so they were spread out with only a few linking each other and I was unsure to be impressed or give up.  This map is the first to give me such a tug of war and neither me nor the Nazis are gaining ground its just a pile of dead bodies and destroyed  vehicles with much blood and holes. You could walk over the water filled with the corpses and tanks. None of disappear for me most likely due to a mod and the carnage can be seen across the map and the game is at the point where the dead are finally now make the game lag it took some time and I can still play but it's clearly slowed. Even know it is fun to have such a challenge I don't think I will beat this anytime soon.Have fun playing this.			"

												WarningThe game is like Men of War: Assault Squad 1. OH wait no you need to buy DLC to make it that game. [A LOT of DLC]The reviewSingle playerGood a lot of fun, difficult and interesting campaigns and you can add more with the workshop. Might be worth buying the core game. Multiplayer [Disastrous] Reason being that you need to rank up to unlock new units aka you have few units to use to fight users that have all the units unlocked. Also to rank up you need to win [see the issue?] because of this you never rank up and you lose all the time unless you find a game with someone who is the same level as you [they probably already gave up on the game though]. However even if you find one of these games there is a bug in the game that will never go away. This bug is a game killer that strikes at almost random times and will just crash the game.  "

								Firstly i own all the men of wars, Vietnam and CH were horrible games, why?, because they were developed by 1C not Digitalmindsoft, Digitalmindsoft made the first MOWAS.This is going to be a great sequal, i really like the idea that the game uses steam instead of gamespy. and ofc Steam workshop, its going to be amazing to see all the mods that will come from the workshop. Yes its much like the first MOWAS in terms of units. BUT its in BETA so not everything is in the game, But there are a lot of new engine improvements that makes the game look amazing in terms of graphics, i have not experience any lag like the first men of war had, there are a few new game modes like day of victory in which you capture the flag that is located in the middle, extreme assault zones which is just a bigger assault zones. I hear a lot of people complaning that its the same game, well in terms of units there isnt a lot you can add that was in world war 2, it isnt like call of duty were you can add a few more weapons, this game is based on world war 2, i do wish they could add everything from the German soldiers mod to MOWAS 2 because that had a lot of great units, and its only 21€ its not a 59.99€ release. if you arent sure that you like what you see right now, then dont buy it, wait until its complete, and remember its in beta a lot of things can still change.

								If you havent played any of the Men of War games, and I would only really recommend Men of War, Men of War Assault Squad and to some extent Men of War Red Tide. Then do so now! Men of War is the successor to Soldiers Heroes of WW2 and Faces of War. In many respects the game remained unchanged for many years and then DMS took the reigns with the Assault Squad frnachise. Assault Squad largely focusses on MP and whilst there are Single Player skirmish, these again are recommended to be played in Co Op. There is no SP campaign like the MoW or Red Tide games.So what about Assault Squad 2? Its in beta atm and so there are performance issues and bugs as to be expected. The major ground work on AS2 is the engine improvements, graphic updates, new models for many vehicles and tanks and lots of new MP maps and SP missions/skirmish.The gameplay is largely the same as AS. The UI has more detailed information now. The UI does look a little bit cluttered for my liking but I am sure a mod will simplify this and it is still in beta so may change for release. AS2, no more Gamespy! yea! Easier installation and file sharing of mods. In game voice chat. Better options in MP. Having played the beta the SP Skirmish is similar to AS, but there arent waves of enemy attacks. It feels more structured and you get extra resources dependent on your actions. In all the SP side and Co OP looks promising and is a bit more creative than the skirmishes in AS. MP the new maps look and play well. Performance is impacting MP atm, but patches are being released every few days. Overall not a huge amount different to AS, although the improvements to the engine have upgraded to Multi Core CPU support and therefore the graphics are really looking top notch. The tank models are outstanding. New MP and SP maps should keep us MoW players happy for some time. The new UI gives more information including unit kills per unit. A complex game which just keeps getting better and better. If you compare AS2 to MoW MP the difference is huge. I wouldnt go back, however the SP portion of MoW is more captivating. "

								It's basically an engine rewrite (multicore, new graphics) of the first MoW:AS, with shiny new models, 2 new(ish) tanks, and new missions made by a great community modder DJSatane (Much love, much respect). I've heard of some gameplay changes but I haven't noticed them.He says DLC support will be greater, and hopefully the final game will be more stable (it crashes extremely often now). Hopefully older content will be easily ported to this.I'd get it only if you're a hardcore MoW fan, otherwise wait until after release. Still, Assault Squad was probably the best multiplayer experience in the series and an improved version of it is probably worth getting in my book (provided stability issues are solved)			"

												WARNING do not buy this piece of crap game, the developers couldnt even release it without hustling money from loyal players. The day it was to be released they changed it to an early acces game, no chance for players to get money refunded, they did that on purporse. The game lost almost all veteran players and thus completely changed the way the game was played, the new playerbase comes from COH and these players try to play the game like it was COH. 40 patches on and the game is still buggy, imagine you buy a pair of jeans and they have to be patched more than 40 times and they are still full of holes. The engine for MOWAS1 worked alot better, MOWAS2 is actually a downgrade of the first game, in this version you cant even play big maps, biggest map is 4vs4 pl and the new maps are unbalanced, one side can reach zones before the other, so in MOWAS2 you play on the same old small maps as you did in MOWAS1. The developers do not listen to any critisism at all, you get sencored or banned, Digitalmindsoft resembles a company out of north Korea or the old DDR. This game has been on sale many many times because Digitalmindsoft do not have the funds to fix/finish the game, they want us the players to fund it as they develop it and the constant sales ruins the game. because everytime there is a sale, new players come and have to learn the game and they do not listen, they just do as they please and the learningcurve is steep, very very hard to get a good game with all the veterans gone and only new players that do not know how to play the game. By the way take a look at this game and you will see that it is outdated, looks and feels like a 15 year old RTS. DO NOT support this hustler company called Digitalmindsoft.			"

												This is a very good strategy game. It is far better than Company of Heroes 2 in every way: realism, depth, unit selection... the list goes on.However, it has a fatal flaw: It crashes.It crashes when you get a Steam notification.It crashes when there's an explosion that's too big.It crashes when you alt-tab.It crashes when you invite a friend.It crashes sometimes when you press the Multiplayer button.It crashes sometimes on the multiplayer loading screen, even when finished loading.It crashes ON THE F#CK|NG TITLE SCREEN if you leave it alone for too long.""Debugging"" was not in the developer's vocabulary.(Please note that this is NOT due to a lack of RAM or hard drive space, I have 8GB RAM and over 100GB of free disk space, and the game never uses more than a few GB of RAM.)

												I love this game would be an understatement, especially once you add the Sir Henkle mod.A hardcore RTS where every soldier has his own inventory, and tough but fair combat on hard mode.The only this that bothers me is when you play online and you order a squad then your friend gets half the forces when he has less, which don't get me wrong kinda makes sense, but when I order a unit I need it in full squad not just 1/4th of the squad. It's fixable by having your friend gift the units back to you but it should be an option not enforced by default.At the time of writing this I have played 101.8 hours and loved every second of it.

												This is the most frustrating game I have ever played, but somehow I keep coming back for more. I love playing RTS games, and this one is on top of my list.  Every unit is important during the game play.  Each one gets their own inventory, with access other units as well.  While they start with limited ammo, you can search the dead for more.Like any game, it has it's down falls.  The biggest peeve I have is with enemy units being able to see mine across the map, while I can't see them.  The more I play this, the more the AI for each unit seems to get dumber.  I had one unit run circles around an enemy as I clicked for it to attack, literally doing circles like a dog around your legs.  It has a lot of little things that make you scream at the game because it's so frustrating.  But it's so addicting, I keep going back for more.Micro managing is crucial with this game, making it very difficult to master.  The enemy AI (Easy, Normal, Hard, Heroic) are all challenging, almost impossible to play without other friends.  Which is one amazing aspect because you can play every mission with up to 7 other players LAN or internet.  Don't expect to beat a good mission in a short amount of time this game takes lots of time.I don't like the personal leveling for this game.  You have to beat an entire mission to get an exp., this counts for first person controlling of a unit as well.  There could be an actual storyline for each campaign, not just the same ten missions for each country.Every unit is extraordinary. The detail, the movements, even the gunfire immerses you.  The sounds and feels of the game are amazing.This game still has quite a few bugs, as I cannot load a saved game right from the main menu.  I once had an invincible enemy unit enter the field, an every unit I had could not take it out. So I had to restart the mission, very frustrating since it was the largest tank at the end of the mission.  Also many times main mission objectives don't activate, making you restart the mission.THE UNIT AI IS HORRENDOUS!! They are always standing up by themselves, which in turn is a death sentence in this game.  Medics do not do anything but create another target for the enemy, same with units that have AT grenades/ rockets. I wish there was tutorial missions to get you into the flow of the combat, that way you can use every aspect of the game.I've downloaded some mods, and they bring this game to a whole new level.  The talent some of these people have makes you think they work for the developers.			"

												For a truly fantastic revitalisation of an already amazing game, assault squad 2 has the perfect blend of realism and that little amount of 'physics wtf' to make it truly special. For those new to the Genre Men Of War is basically an amazing WW2 RTS which has the capabilities to allow one to alter their unit's inventory, as well as take direct control of that always satisfying Katyusha. Whilst Assault squad 2 bears many similarities to assault squad one, there are a few mission differences (although all different maps are still 'unique' in their own special way) meaning one can never truly be bored playing this game.Though the major benefits of owning AS2 rather than regular AS are many:+Decent community modding.+Multiplayer is still up and not running on gamespy: P+New units (I’m sure)+A pleasant variety of maps which surpasses its predecessorOverall a very decent game with good visuals, lovely soundtrack and an amusing amount of medics needed to keep ones army from being ripped to shred... Damn those American machine guns!10/10			"

												This game like all the other Men of War games is a complete master piece!This game isnt to much of a change from Men of War: Assault Squad 1, but there are some small things that make it that much better. 1: Graphics are a bit better and some bug fixes (some)2: Better units. Example: In the mission Overlord for the americans, when calling in paratroopers a squad of 5 parachutes in, instead of just one trooper, this is a major fix in my mind, logically you would send 1 trooper in at a time and sending in squads would be a more ""rational"" amount. 3: MAJOR FIX: mulitplayer is fixed and you can play online, unlike the other Men of War: Assault Squad that ran off of game spy (an unused and discontinued gaming network). This makes the game so much better, multiplayer, for players who has friends that don't own the game, or those who don't have friends (if you don't have any, make some!)4: This isn't a fix but makes the game so much more fun, Steam Workshop, custom maps easier to get and mods the same! There are some great maps and mods on the workshop and i recommend anyone that has to check it out!This game get a 10/10 for the beautiful and never ending fun that the game gives!			"

												            A year ago I was introduced to CNC Red Alert 2 I could not get enough of it. Constant playing all day never wanting to stop. Then I bought CNC 3 Tiberium wars  (through Origin) I thought that that game was the best there ever would be.             Then about 6 months later I was looking around steam and saw Men of War AS2. At first i thought it looked okay and no other thought. Then I looked deeper and wanted to get that game. I thought it would be 19.99 (being used to geting 9.99 games on steam) but then I saw it 29.99! I almost swore at it but someone was in the room with me.              2 months later I got enough cash to get the gameso I bought it. IT WAS AMAZING!! I was discouraged by the bad reviews at first but they, to me, seemed to lie as i played the game.PROS+Great Cover system for your units+Names for all your units (I do occassionally just call one billy)+Direct control! You wanna be a tank? Then be one!+Balanced gameplay+Motion changer+See through the house roofCons-Omaha! Normandy! C'mon! D-Day is one of my favorite battles! MAKE IT FOR SKIRMISH!-Moments when my unit derps out and does not throw the AT grenadeThats it! Overall I give this 92%!			"

												One of THE best rts stratergies out there. If you like the Company of Heroes franchise or the Wargame series then this game is for you. The developeres of this game keep creating better and better games. The only downside is that they have gotten rid of (or not implemented) the ability to pick up weapons off the ground. The micromanagment aspect of the game goes down to the level of ammo managment as per usual for the franchise. They have used a trie and tested formula with new units and a new campaign. I cannot recomend this game enough.			"

												No dobut you will want to buy AS2 rather than AS1 in any aspects.There is many improvment for Assault Squad 2 when you compare with AS1.A lot of contents, many mod etc.They successfully change this game into another *COMMON* RTS. If you're rts fan, you will sure love it. it give many different new aspect for you.As a fan of the previous series game, i don't find any reason to buy this game unless it's on sales.Large scale battle, lots of point and click, many micro. (so AS1 is a completely mess but largely improve in here) Direct control and scavenge become somewhat optional. There isn't much time for you to play like these, since you are always busy microing. (minimize the advantage of this game) I have regretted buying this game w/o a serious consideration. It's a great game but not fit my expectation			"

												One of THE best rts stratergies out there. If you like the Company of Heroes franchise or the Wargame series then this game is for you. The developeres of this game keep creating better and better games. The only downside is that they have gotten rid of (or not implemented) the ability to pick up weapons off the ground. The micromanagment aspect of the game goes down to the level of ammo managment as per usual for the franchise. They have used a trie and tested formula with new units and a new campaign. I cannot recomend this game enough.			"

												This is the most frustrating game I have ever played, but somehow I keep coming back for more. I love playing RTS games, and this one is on top of my list.  Every unit is important during the game play.  Each one gets their own inventory, with access other units as well.  While they start with limited ammo, you can search the dead for more.Like any game, it has it's down falls.  The biggest peeve I have is with enemy units being able to see mine across the map, while I can't see them.  The more I play this, the more the AI for each unit seems to get dumber.  I had one unit run circles around an enemy as I clicked for it to attack, literally doing circles like a dog around your legs.  It has a lot of little things that make you scream at the game because it's so frustrating.  But it's so addicting, I keep going back for more.Micro managing is crucial with this game, making it very difficult to master.  The enemy AI (Easy, Normal, Hard, Heroic) are all challenging, almost impossible to play without other friends.  Which is one amazing aspect because you can play every mission with up to 7 other players LAN or internet.  Don't expect to beat a good mission in a short amount of time this game takes lots of time.I don't like the personal leveling for this game.  You have to beat an entire mission to get an exp., this counts for first person controlling of a unit as well.  There could be an actual storyline for each campaign, not just the same ten missions for each country.Every unit is extraordinary. The detail, the movements, even the gunfire immerses you.  The sounds and feels of the game are amazing.This game still has quite a few bugs, as I cannot load a saved game right from the main menu.  I once had an invincible enemy unit enter the field, an every unit I had could not take it out. So I had to restart the mission, very frustrating since it was the largest tank at the end of the mission.  Also many times main mission objectives don't activate, making you restart the mission.THE UNIT AI IS HORRENDOUS!! They are always standing up by themselves, which in turn is a death sentence in this game.  Medics do not do anything but create another target for the enemy, same with units that have AT grenades/ rockets. I wish there was tutorial missions to get you into the flow of the combat, that way you can use every aspect of the game.I've downloaded some mods, and they bring this game to a whole new level.  The talent some of these people have makes you think they work for the developers.			"

												This review is for the men of war orgins DLC as of writing this review, reviews on the orgins page are broken so people can't post reviews So this DLC, It does not contain any of the 'bonus' missions from men of war, which i think is about 4 missions lacking because of it. It has none of the multiplayer vs modes, like conquest and such. It is just the COOP modes and that is all. It uses the same voice acting for all the cut scenes from the orginal. The maps are basically the same, but since they made all the guns the same how they have it in assualt squad this makes the maps feel very small, it makes the defence maps much easier as now all your defending units shoot across the map. armour in men of war defence missions were hard to deal with, with your guns having low pen at range. now armour just melts to the stationary guns. Maps also seem to have increased amount of units on the map. with arsenal having 8 units instead of the 4 or 5 like men of war. some maps have increased player caps where you can play with 8 players in coop. over all $20 for not even the full men of war remake. doesn't have the multiplayer maps, doesn't have all the single player maps, i don't think the voice acting has been updated, but it might have a few extra lines mostly orginal voice acting still. Just seems like a ripoff, i'm a BIG fan of men of war, and this has done a bad job of making a reborn, hell if you are gonna be this lazy and charge so much at least add all the maps, or add some soldiers of war maps or something. but yea for MAYBE under $10, i would say under $5 okay.

												Played this for the free weekend. A World War 2 taking command of whatever faction fits your fancy. ( USA, Japan, Germany, Common wealth or Soviet). In controll of the army using what units be it, infantry or tanks, you replay the factions famous battle from the war and using whatever means nessasary to win the war or battle. A stratagy game by using the right equipment and tactics for your units, their is some thinking involved in this game. A lot of equip options and units it takes a while to get up to speed of what does what and where, when and etc. etc. The main solo mode is called skirmish and each faction has 9 missions that rely on you mastering your units and skills. All the missions are around the same for each faction. There is a multiplayer option, but I was not able to try this part of the game. I can see where this game could be fun and challanging especailly against real people, not AI's. But the game had some cons.  Their is no tuturial or learn to play mode and this hit me as a bummer, because me for one, love to know what is going on before I jump in. ( I guess that is why the acheivment for first mission is called baptism of fire). There is though a tuturial video(s) that you can play to learn somewhat of what is going on, but no hands on learning. Also the games graphics are very good and the destrucation by artillery and tanks and such is really good. Snow, like in real life fighting I imagine is annoying. The enviroment also does provide cover for you and the enemy and if your not looking just right, you can be snuck up on.  A good game if your a WWII fan and like stratagy games like DoW. There seems to be lots of DLC you can by new skirmishes and skins it looks like. But after the short 9 missions for whatever faction you choose. I would move on to another game unless beating children and making them cry in multiplayer is your thing.			"

												Destructive as hell. Heavy ordinance blasting everything to♥♥♥♥♥♥is great. Lots of detail and controlability.Is more or less a rerelease of MoW AS1 but with steam servers and steamworks.There's a moderate difficulty curve, due how much you can control. PvP is a blast whether playing casually or competitively. If you want coop, grab a coop map pack, the default coop maps are kind of linear and simple and there are some really fantastic user created maps out there.The coop spawning system can be a little irritating with more than two people. It'll spawn units to random players on your team and you have to manually send units to each other if you don't get what you want.			"

												The devs of this company have taken RTS to a whole new level with it's franchise ""Men of War"". It lets you control individual units in a squad and also make them run around anywhere around the map.Pros:-Decent graphics (I recommend the terminator mod to make the game look better)-Many units to choose from-Soldiers can pick up grenades or pick up fallen weapons-You can make a soldier loot a dead body for ammo-Realistic tank damage (hull damage, tracks hit, ammunition rack on fire, etc)-Fun multiplayer if you play with friends-Workshop is full of maps, missions and mods to further improve your gameplay-Theres a editor where you can create your own maps, missions and battlesCons:-AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥especially close quarters infantry combat-Pointless DLCs with units that should be in the gameGrab this game at sale when it's around 5$ or pay full price which is around 20$			"

								I used to play Company of Heroes 1 and 2. I used to enjoy doing so. But then one day I discovered Men of War Assault squad. A game that balances realism and gameplay. Infantry out in the open will die in two seconds under mg fire. Flamethrowers kill whoever they shoot at. Flanking, retreating, feinting. This game is far more tactical and strategic than Company of heroes can ever hope to be. Armored battles are both thrilling and nerve racking. A single shell in the right place can end a one on one armor battle. Medium tanks have the same armor stats as their in real life counterparts. Medium tanks will bounce almost every shell off their strong upper glacis armor, but lower glacis is weak like irl. Its outstanding. I am in love with this series and hope to see its player base grow. I am sad that games with far more limited mechanics than this are seen as outstanding, I used to be such a person my self. Please try this game. It is so beautiful. Gameplay over graphics.			"

												This is a very good strategy game. It is far better than Company of Heroes 2 in every way: realism, depth, unit selection... the list goes on.However, it has a fatal flaw: It crashes.It crashes when you get a Steam notification.It crashes when there's an explosion that's too big.It crashes when you alt-tab.It crashes when you invite a friend.It crashes sometimes when you press the Multiplayer button.It crashes sometimes on the multiplayer loading screen, even when finished loading.It crashes ON THE F#CK|NG TITLE SCREEN if you leave it alone for too long.""Debugging"" was not in the developer's vocabulary.(Please note that this is NOT due to a lack of RAM or hard drive space, I have 8GB RAM and over 100GB of free disk space, and the game never uses more than a few GB of RAM.)

Early Access Review
								As a veteran of 450+ hours on Men of War: Assault Squad and a closed beta tester of this game, I feel inclined to give a review. Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a both a step forward that just has a little way to go before it is a success. It features some fantastic new features, namely the UI, steam support, and graphical enhancements. New missions give the single player more life than the challenging, yet monotonous skirmishes of its predecessor. The new vehicle textures are spectacular, including unique camoflage based on environment. Although the infantry textures are somewhat outdated, they don't detract from the game, same with the foliage and shaders. Once again, a relatively steep learning curve is displayed, requiring refined skills that can only be achieved through dedicated online play. You CANNOT just jump in and expect to win like other RTS games. You have to be patient and learn from your mistakes. Furthermore, you must dedicate yourself to learning the wider variety of control features the game displays, including the glorious direct control mode that allows for the most epic tank maneuvers you'll experience within the genre, the intuitive unit equiping system that allows you to loot and recover lost weapons and ammo, and finally the vehicle damage/penetration/component damage system, repairing vehicles based on where they were hit. Each of these features are what seperate the Men of War games from the rest of the genre, and mastering them is the key to success in multiplayer and getting over that curve. The only qualm I have so far with the game is the multiplayer connection glitches. 1 in every 2 games I have played so far have poor framerates, disconnects, or straight up crashes. This makes multiplayer somewhat unplayable for me right now, whereas Assault Squad 1 had very few online issues. I'm confident, however, that the developers will have the multiplayer optimized by the full release, and as I understand, very few other players have had these issues. Overall, I definatly reccommend this game to both veterans of the series and new players who want a massive tactical challenge. So long as you don't give up, this series can become one of the most rewarding and intuitive experiences you'll ever find. PS: To those who would compare this to Company of Heroes, they are different on fundamental levels. COH is an arcade style fast paced base builder with nowhere near as much thought to detail and realism on the level that MOW displays, but is a very fun game for what it is. Don't compare them, just enjoy them both based on what you find to be most satifying.			"

												I came into this game with the interesting experience of someone who wasn't a men of war fan already,was more of the COH type.I do like this game quite a bit tho the playerbase is small and the game is EXACTLY the same as MOWAS 1 except the multiplayer is hosted on servers that actually work(good riddance,gamespy).The game has quite a bit of ""wtf just happened"" potential due to it's many units and funny physics,both making you rage and laugh a lot.Single player is just the same missions over and over and gets boring,the only things that change are the maps and the factions,multi player is quite fun tho it's plagued by the ""neo nazi kid who masturbates at german tanks"" syndrome that seems to be so popular in strategy these days,thankfully the game itself is quite balanced unlike some other games which encourage that behaviour with its game balance(totally not looking at COH2 here).If you haven't played MOW ever then I suggest getting it,but first you should trythe original MOW and play it to see if you like the style,it's quite different from most games			"

												10/10 One of the best RTS games I've ever played, up there with battles in Rome Total War. Although this game requires a learning curve, once you learn it, it can be a hell of a lot of fun. The amount of units give you a wide variety of ways to deal with the enemy, this goes for both the campaign and the multiplayer. However this game does have its bugs and glitches and does require pretty good internet and decent PC/Laptop to run, the awesome clutch moments and hilarious moments you can have completely outwiegh all of that. The mods are alos really good, making realism even better although a little bit harder, I suggest you rack up a few hours of the vanilla game before taking mods on because they really change gameplay. If you love the World War 2 time period and love RTS games, this should be your dream to play, however if you play War Thunder, a few things are different so keep that in mind. Little side note before I stop, the game has  a LOT OF EXPLOSIONS, LIKE A SH*T TON. THERE ARE EXPLOSIONS THAT MAKE VEHICLES DO 360 SPINS 100 FEET IN THE AIR, IT IS F*CKING AWESOME! BUY THIS GAME!

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is everything Assault Squad 1 was, but improved. More mission, a tutorial for each nation, and  Steam mod support makes the game easily customisable. Men of War: AS2 is a game of your own experience. There are no heroes to follow, no stories to be told. Unless you say otherwise. You can watch as your US Paratroopers land, commanded by Alan Smith or whoever make there way to a German MG post that's been slaughtering elements of your frontal unit. You create the story in the mission of your choice. Plus, everything is usable. Every individual soldier has ammo, a gun and a helmet, alongside maybe a fieldworks or repair kit, and all these can be taken. You have no more ammo for your rifle? ""Soldier, grab some SMG ammo and that MP 40 from Jerry"". Require a tank, but can't afford it? ""Jackson, see that panzer? Repair it and get it back here"". Every single firearm, every mortar, every AT and howitzer gun, every armoured fighting vehicle, is capable of spewing death upon it's previous masters. Provided you keep them stocked with fuel, ammo, and keeping them intact, of course. Another addition to the game is the veterency system. Individual soldiers, once they kill someone, will gain some veterency, and gain better stats, more HP, more stamina, better weapon handling, better tank control, everything. If you're a sucker for WW2 RTS games, then I'd recommend this one. There might be a lot to learn, but it's all compressed neatly onto the screen, while also allowing you to seen what's happening. And soldier, don't expect everyone under your command to make it out of there alive. War is hell. "

												I want to like this game. I really do. I love the possibilities. In fact, I grew an interest for this game after I became disillusioned with War Thunder; and the video of the Ratte mod that was posted to YouTube by the RakcroyBrosGaming channel sold me on buying this game. I really wish I did my ♥♥♥♥ing homework. Game play mechanics are solid. So far, all that I have been able to play bits and pieces of the single player campaign/""skirmishes"", no mods. The gameplay itself is all combat; with little to no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t concerning economics in terms of building factories, barracks,  *MUST ACQUIRE MORE VESPENE GAS*  etc, save for the occasional supply truck run to give ammo and/or fuel to single units that have run low. Very straightforward. No need to break out an excel sheet to figure out 'optimal output' paces or anything, that's what I like to see in an RTS. The game play is fairly driven by 'stats' too, especially on the subject of vehicle combat. Armor thickness, type, slope, all taken into account as to whether a vehicle will survive or not, and not one vehicle is truly 100% safe from the other due to this level of detail. I love it.The game play also allows for plenty of organic ""whoops"" moments on both sides. AT infantry attacks an OPFOR tank, kills the driver. Tank keeps rolling like nothings happened, you the player become hesitant that the attack was effective; until you notice it's going to roll straight into (and through) 3-4 houses filled with OPFOR. Said houses collapse on tank, which also blows up from the drop. Absolutely horrifying and breathtakingly awesome at the same time. That being said, the fun stops there.This game is an absolute nightmare to run. Bugs that are laughably persistent, and affect the most basic of functions. I'm not talking about hardware optimization, as this thing (while still looking dated, graphically) looks fine, not much in terms of framerate drops or anything of that nature. No, I'm talking about an over-abundance of file crashes. No other problems with any other games. I haven't had any files mysteriously disappear, and my drives seem healthy as can be.But every single ♥♥♥♥ing time I know autosave is about to occur, I hold my breath like a person playing russian roulette. Manual save feels even worse to me, because it's 100% self inflicted. Why? Because every time a save occurs, there is an unnacceptably high chance that the save will fail; and I will be greated with a string of text/code telling me things like ""NOT SDL FILE"", or ""Failed to save thumbnail/screenshot"". It is also likely that when these errors occur, the game will fail to load unless you manually delete the (now corrupted) save. You will also (likely) need to delete some combo of files, like keys.set, options.set, settings.set, etc. Otherwise, the game will not run. Now, these are solutions that are posted on the game's FAQ, written by the developers. The only problem is that it's only a cure for the symptom, and it never solves the actual *problem.* It only brings the game back into ""can now run/execute/playable"" status, but sooner or later, after another half-hour/40 minutes of gameplay; you will have another save failure that will crash the game, and you will not be able to play it again unless you delete some combination of files mentioned above. Steam-cloud sync is turned off. No mods installed. No interference from an Antivirus. This is all from the game, latest update and all. Running Windows 7, 64 bit. i5 2500k. Asus Sabertooth P67 (rev 3) mobo. 8 gigs of Corsair Vengeance RAM. ASUS GTX 570ti.  2 Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm 1TB drives. Can't be the hardware causing trouble.With these errors, the longest gameplay session I've ever had was somewhere between an hour and an hour-thirty minutes. The game is lost. The files deleted. Progress gone. Back to square one. I can't even begin to *fathom* what the ♥♥♥♥ kind of errors will pop up if I attempt a multiplayer match.			"

												I enjoyed this game (although the first mowas is basically the same as mowas 2) the concept is great and the multiplayer fun. HOWEVER this game rly needs to be reworked upon or for the mistakes made to be improved upon in the next game (if there is ever one!) i.e. the atricious pathfinding, germany's goliaths spam. ALSO HERO UNITS although give the game more variety but having two currencies is annoying and at times very boring, because just when you think that your opponent is finshed his ""MP points"", he then falls back upon his hero units which act as reserves. Having said that, the game's wide choice of maps and units make this game very enjoyable. LASTLY SORT OUT THE LINE OF SIGHTS- TANK HAVE THE NARROWEST VISION EVEN WITH A MAN ON TOP OF THE TURRET.			"

												First time loading it up i was blown away by how you can control a group of infantry to just controlling a single person. and to really injoy this game you need to have good stratery to win a battle. this game goes into my top 5 World War 2 games along with Brothers in Arms Hells Highway and many more and not to mention you can manually control your men or Vehicles really impressed by that. But i wish they had more plane action or better controls to flying the aircraft or you could call in a bomber to bomb a target. Defffintley recomend to the people who are interested in World War 2 or like playing games about World War 2.			"

												I would like to revise my review now...As you can see I play this game a lot, especially right now recently but there were......complicationsI don't know what happen. One day I'm the game happily and the next day it says it can't run because of some errors. Needlessly to say. I was angry. Especially after attepting to fix it in 3 days. I'm still going to recommend it but be warned. There will be a bunch of bugs, errors, and very annoying challenges.			"

												This game isnt  the best Men of war but the mods make it special. You have a skirmish mission list that has every major power during the second world war in it with several missions but i cant help but notice that the modders have made the game so much better,and it just seems to be as1 with new graphics and missions.  And dont forget multiplayer which is also nice and the editor for some creative scenario making.8/10			"

												i absolutley love this game. firstly the huge wars you get to control are over insane. the strategy and level editor makes this game no questions asked. you need to play the game and learn to use the editor to start liking it, apart from the editor the game okay. the game puts limitations and pop cap ( the thing that only lets you have a certain amount of units) really pulls this game do it why cant the game "

												This is one of the best games in the world it needs more attention and support, its very detailed and miles better then Company of Heros As you can control Every single soilder and even what weapons or Ammo you use, Imagine that your whole Sqaud as been wiped out and there is a whole team of tanks rolling down the street and your last tank was destroyed well in this game you can even Command the tank driver to leave his destroyed tank then search dead bodys for an Anti tank Granade and hide inside a building until a tank passes by, the satisfaction of destroying a tank with nothing but pure skill and stratergy is unreal.

												Like the first game, and the Viet Nam game (that I wanted to love), this game has the same issues that make gameplay and arduous experience, when it should be intuitive and seemless; considering this is an RTS.  The control of troops is not refined enough.  It is either too slow or complex when ordering your units to attack, take cover, pick up weapons, etc.  You have to micro manage every unit.			"

												Welcome to the war pipsqueak!You're given command of this soldier squad, now go on! Win the war!(but you can call in reinforcements if you want)Watch out for OP German tanks and random hits from AT cannons. (also AT+AA cannons are much more deadly to infantry than HMGs.. pffffft)But you can always just take control of your little soldier and go take down that guy in the MG nest that you can't shoot. And you may have to do it quite often.And don't forget! Always make sure that the German tank is dead and not just disabled. ALWAYS. They wait for the perfect chance to strike and destroy your expensive 1000 MP tank you just called in. Whoops!TL:DRIt has less bugs than AS1 and better UI. Buy it.			"

												*Updated 2/17/2015 with the release of the latest large scale patch*Hated by casuals, loved by the hardcore enthusiasts, MoW continues it's time-tested formula of unrelenting combat in a realistic light. If this is your first foray, be forewarned: This ain't your Daddy's Company of Heroes. The learning curve is steep, but the basics are easy to learn. If 'micro' is a term that makes you shudder, look elsewhere. If base building is a deal breaker, look elsewhere. If you want to rush techs and move large blobs at your enemy, look elsewhere.This is a 'thinking man's' RTT. Units have their own stamina, inventory, and complex hitboxes. Though infantry are summoned on-map in squads, they can and often are broken up into small groups or as individuals. Cover AND concealment are fully functional in game, and the environment is fully destructable. Enemies held up in a fortified house? Why not bring the roof down on them with an AT grenade? Or light the building next to it on fire and let it spread to them? Heck, you can even get ridiculous and drive a tank through it and crush them alive, which brings up the major feature of this game: Direct control.Units can be taken control of on a deeper level, played much like a third person shooter, where you can crawl about as infantry, cook grenades, handle a sniper rifle, hold the line with a machine gun, or clear out a trench with a flamethrower. Or perhaps you prefer to man the controls of a tank, and enjoy the best penetration and hitbox system for tanks in the RTS genre, where it's important to choose proper ammo types and hit specific parts of a vehicle to damage systems, kill crew, or even get lucky and send a turret flying off.The weak will be punished, but those that stick with it(Or better yet, find friends to enjoy the game with in either Co-op or PvP) while find one of the most satisfying and truly dynamic games in the RTS genre.Pros:-unrivaled dynamic play. there is no real 'meta' or build orders to adhere to, playstyles adjust to tactical situations, not the other way around. No two games play the same!-Satisfying realism, if it would work in real life, it would probably work in-game.-US, UK, Germany, Soviet Union, and Japan all come with their own campaigns, and robust armories.-Beautiful levels of detail, especially in vehicles.-Unique gameplay-Great modding community, and steam workshop support.-Dedicated developers, always getting new patches and features. Just recieved a major update patch that adds new gameplay features and refines older ones.-Unique style of play that forgoes base construction and economy farming in favor of persistent combat and steady income for unit call ins.Teching is based on time, rather than construction and research.Cons:-Steep learning curve. Recently, the latest patch included tutorials, however, and this issue is largely resolved if you invest the time to learn.-inconsistant AI behaviour. Sometimes it's really brilliant, sometimes it's supremely dumb.-inventory management can be cumbersome at times.-If you played the first game, the sequel is barely a sequel at all. It's almost 99% identical, but on steamworks instead of gamespy. The latest patch has added some new features, however, that have some bigger changes in gameplay. Namely, the new supply system, and unit veterancy.-Though it's optional in lobby matches, matchmaking forces a 'unit locking' system where you must grind through unlock progression to unlock basic tools on the battlefield, leading to terrible balance situations.Despite it's 'rough around the edges' package, this is a solid game in a genre that is rife with imitation of games from 15 years ago. Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a breath of fresh air in a realm of 'C&C' and 'Starcraft' copy-cats and games that try to do what Men of War does, but with terrible controls like Theatre of War and Graviteam tactics and a turtles pace. MoW is a fast-paced, tactical, unforgiving conquest with good controls and a good presentation, with ever evolving features and support that steadily address it's shortcomings.2/16/2015: Patch added unit veterancy, automatic resupply for infantry and vehicles near supply trucks/crates, reworked stamina system, graphical improvements, and greater server stability. Balance changes were also included.4/5			"

												This game is absolute.... Awesomeness, but. Some things aren't so good. :PAs an example, the Graphics are worse then Assault Squad 1 and I barely play that game, the voices and weapon system in this game is aswell, garbage. The tank and vehicle's are lacking realism and there are so many vehicles and tanks of WW2 which aren't in this game. :LAswell as the people and AI in this game, for an example, a guy is holding a rifle, the rifle is floating in the air with the hands inside of the rifle. And the AI in this game is worse than Call to Arms, sometimes the AI just looks you in the face and tries to stab you from 400ft away.And the Editor might be good but how hard it is to actually spawn hostile vehicles.All in all, I barely reccomend this game. Even though I have 1000 hours on it!			"

												First time loading it up i was blown away by how you can control a group of infantry to just controlling a single person. and to really injoy this game you need to have good stratery to win a battle. this game goes into my top 5 World War 2 games along with Brothers in Arms Hells Highway and many more and not to mention you can manually control your men or Vehicles really impressed by that. But i wish they had more plane action or better controls to flying the aircraft or you could call in a bomber to bomb a target. Defffintley recomend to the people who are interested in World War 2 or like playing games about World War 2.			"

You will still rank up ;)I would rate the game 7 of 10Gfx, music and sfx is awesome.  The maps ingame just looks awesome. Almost everything can be blown away.

Early Access Review
								This strong ww2 based RTS comes from a company trusted for wanting historical accuracy, and establishing realisitic games to an excellent extent (IL-2: Sturmovik line). Accurate models of tanks and the capabilities of their weapons and armour sketch the outline of this game, with solid infantry combat at its core. One of the key features of the game series is the ability to directly control a unit. Keeping your top overview, you can thusly control an infantryman or tank using the wasd-keys and mouse to give you the edge of the standard unit ai. Whether you use it to take out a tank's track before finishing it off, or to grab a grenade and whipe out a clutch of infantry, the result is usually critical in a match. Another feature is that vehicles and heavy weapons (AT-guns, MGs) which are critically damaged and abandoned can be recrewed, repaired and added to your army. Maybe not unique in the RTS world, it is done excellently in this game.Veterans of the original Assault Squad will mainly see graphical and engine improvements and a few new units and maps wrapped in a fresh package at a low price as far as new games go. Do not, however, expect a brand new game, which it has never claimed to be.  "

								I used to play Company of Heroes 1 and 2. I used to enjoy doing so. But then one day I discovered Men of War Assault squad. A game that balances realism and gameplay. Infantry out in the open will die in two seconds under mg fire. Flamethrowers kill whoever they shoot at. Flanking, retreating, feinting. This game is far more tactical and strategic than Company of heroes can ever hope to be. Armored battles are both thrilling and nerve racking. A single shell in the right place can end a one on one armor battle. Medium tanks have the same armor stats as their in real life counterparts. Medium tanks will bounce almost every shell off their strong upper glacis armor, but lower glacis is weak like irl. Its outstanding. I am in love with this series and hope to see its player base grow. I am sad that games with far more limited mechanics than this are seen as outstanding, I used to be such a person my self. Please try this game. It is so beautiful. Gameplay over graphics.			"

The new engine does very little mostly prettier textures but same old bad performance. Several maps is reuset instead of usa is attacking, it's germany now. There are two different kinds of missions attack and take over flags and protect a flag. The harder the difficulty  more enemies is indefinitely respawnd it starts to get a little too excessively about 50 tanks and hundreds of soldiers at the same time and you only have about 5 tanks and a couple of squads of men and it can be up to 40 minutes before the time runs out and you win on def missions. If you have assualt squad 1 dont buy it or wait for a sale not more the 9.99			"

								Terrible. Getting refund... (I have decided to keep the game even tho steam offered me a refund. JUST for the mods unless the devs do a 180 degree turn with their plans and make it more like AS1 when it comes to ranges etc)Totaler krieg will fix everything!TL;DR All the ranges have been shortened, tanks shoot like pistols ranges now. the HUD has been made into a confusing cluster fug. The levels are still the SAME (with a few imported from previous games which weren't in AS1... I don't think there are many TOTALLY new maps), there aren't many new units, at all. (a few tanks, yay) The AI is still CRAP. The pathfinding is still basicly the same, horrible mess that it was.The only thing they seem to have spent their time alot on is the new lobby system which is fine.. (Oh and camouflages Hoo-fudging-ray!) I would have been happy to pay 20€ for lobby & performance fixes on AS1 but no, they had to change the game mechanics which didnt need to be changed at allOh and i like the addittion of steam workshop.. This would have been such a great game if they had just focused on adding new content, and fixing flaws in the old game.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have played Assault squad 1 for a whopping 1300 hours, and i am (was) a real fan of the assault squad series. I do realize this game is still in beta, and it runs really really bad on most computers, but i have not taken that into account, only the flaws in the game design and gameplay. This would have been a great game if they hadn't tried to make it like CoH3 or something.It still has the unique Men of war feel, but the ranges man, the ranges.. so godawful... in addittion to everything else they messed up. Unit icons on the left are a really hard-to-see and confusing mess, the HUD generally is very very confusing and theres alot of unneeded stuff on your screen, what limits your field of view. I honestly don't see any improvements on the AI or the pathfinding (except that neat path that shows where they will go)The tank Ranges used to be fun and challenging, except a maybe little too short, but now your tanks have no choice but to get into the frontline with your infantry and get bazooka'd. This might rise up the importance of infantry but for all the wrong reasons. In assault squad 1 you could easily take out a tank with infantry if you had any tactics and perhaps some stealth too.The infantry seem to be really tough now, which is unrealistic and totally lame. There used to be a time when you had to crawl your men through the battlefield to not make them die from a Buzzsaw (mg42) but now you can just throw them out to the field with only minor damage to them by bullets. And infantry behind cover... I like the suppression thing they added... but the way infantry only takes cover when they are hit is silly, As an infantryman you take cover when you are being shot at and you get supressed, The current system is like you can keep an enemy infantryman behind cover as long as you hit him once every 5 seconds or so...

												I'm going to be honest and harsh here, the game feels unpolished. It feels like an Early Access RTS game that still needs everything (really, everything, from sounds to animations) to be redone but on a professional level instead.I have an extremely expensive audio setup at home including two studio monitor speakers and an audio interface; the sounds in this game are horrible, it's like the sounds belong to a game created back in 2006. Optimisation is also a huge issue in this game, I have an i7 7700k and a gtx 1080, yet I cant keep this game at 60 fps in 1440p while much better looking games allow me to run them in 4K at a consistent 60 fps. This game uses more resources than the Witcher 3.Not to mention, even if your pc can run this game in 4K, the UI becomes extremely small and the game doesn't allow you to scale the UI anywhere; useless.If you're looking for a polished WW2 RTS game I recommend Company of Heroes 2, this game is definitely not worth the 25 euros it's asking on the Steam store. 5 euros would be more like it.

												Minimal changes to the predecessor.For my review i will list the features this game got:-recycled mission from the predecessor-so much bloom that it will make your eyes hurt and absolutely no option to reduce the gamma-some new models, next to the other 98.74% of the models that are 1 to 1 ripped from the predecessor-the new models got textures that the modding community of the predecessor did allready better(i am serious, the old models look with the community's textures better than the new ones)At all 25€ for bloom that will cause your eyes permanent damage, and new content (in comparison to the predecessor) that is less than any call of duty dlc ever offered.This game is a standalone patch thats contents were before announced as patch for the predecessor.They just added more bloom and added a 25€ pricetag.This game is a joke compared to the ones before in the series. An expensive joke.			"

												Not Recommended-Low FPS during big fights on beefy systems-Overall pretty dated graphics-Small maps-Low unit capThe ability to take direct control over each of your units is fun for a while, but in the end it's completely overrun by everything that's just plain bad about the game.There's a decent tactical edge to the singleplayer campaigns (within the confines of the map and how they designed it for each specific engagement), but multiplayer is just a rush based slug fest for the most part.Overall it comes together to make a pretty badly optimized, mundane and underwhelming WW2 RTS game. It aims for more realism than the Company of Heroes series but fails, adding ontop of it a bunch of issues that CoH simply doesn't suffer from.With that being said, the models in MoW:AS2 are well made and the ability to take control of your units adds a new level of playability that some may find more appealing than similar games in the genre, but I can't recommend it based on my experience.Overall rating: 6/10TL:DR:""Underwhelming"" "

												Same as the last one. But new HD graphics.... Still same factions no Italy, France, and or Poland. Pretty much what the community wanted in GSM was compleatly ignored. So you know it's cool its fine. Just take your sweet♥♥♥♥♥time and make a new game with everything the same. Only reason why I'm recommending it is because Men of War: Assasult Squad (1) multiplayer will probably die soon so might as well pay $30 for HD texture pack and new maps.			"

												9/10, best strategy game released in years. easily equals eugen's wargame for strategic depth and complexity. it's micro intensive, but very satisfying. the factions are diverse and there are many, many maps. to boot, it's half the price of a normal game with at least 10x the content. if you're an RTS fan, you won't be disappointed; if you're new, stick with it: the learning cliff is tall, sure. but the summit is worth the climb.

I'm sifting through forum threads from 3-4 years ago trying to find fixes to my crashes. And for the life of me I can't find any new content I have not seen in Assault Squad 1. AS2 uses the same voices, maps, assets, AI as Assualt Squad, but with a 2 slapped ont here. What gives?			"

								Единственная игра в своем роде, аналогии которой пока не найти. Полюбилась с самой первой части и не дает повода усомниться в превосходстве и широкомаштабных зрелищных боях. Много писать не имеет смысла.... Но те, кто с самого раннего момента играет в ВТВ, данное продолжение обязательно понравится! Единственное было некомфортно из-за нехватки русского языка, но теперь после обновления он появился! Благодарю разработчиков!!!!			"

												This is a really good game. The game is very 'customizable' in a way to say that you can control each individual unit and edit their inventory and stuff like that. The game is also quite realistic. However, I feel that there should be some improvements to the realism aspect as your tank can nudge an unarmored vehicle and blow it up. Overall, its a good game and I reccomend it.			"

												The re-design of the GEM2 engine in AS2 has been a huge step forward - DMS is taking the steps in the right direction.Assault Squad 2 has reached nearly 10,000 simultaneous players. That is a great achievement that has brought a lot of popularity for this RTS saga, and let's hope it carries on. Despite the current glitches and issues, AS2 has great potential, and i'm sure a competent developer like DMS will surely finish off with a great game.			"

												I don't see how this game got as many positive reviews as it did. I assume because the people who played it did not get the first one. Because that's all this game really is. it is literally just like the first one, all the same campaign mission, most of the same units. Also this game runs like Sh*t. This game is, as I said before, almost exactly the same as the first one only 4X the price. I'm just glad i bought this for $7.49 and not the $29.99 that they were asking for a few weeks ago. $7.49 for this game is still way too high. so all in all, DO NOT buy this game, just go buy the first one if you want a game like this that bad.

								There is a common misunderstanding that sequels usually suck. NOT true with this iteration of Men of War!  This takes everything awsome about the first and builds upon it.  But it does it in such a way that it doesn't take away from the expierience.  It provides a first of all FAR more engaging AI within the game now.  My biggest gripe about the first game was the fact that the AI seemed scared to go on the offensive.  Now the AI is extremely aggressive and can actually be quite difficult to beat at times.  The graphical changes seem to be pretty minor compared to the first game but they do put some nice touches to the vehicles.  What I am most excited for however is the integration of a massive amount of Skirmish coop battles.  According to the devs, there will be a total of 40 skirmish battles when the game is released.  In addition to that, the steam support for the game is an EXTREEEEMELY welcome addition compared to the last game which allows easy sharing of missions and mods in the community.  Another nice addition is the usage of your steam account for in-game leveling.  If you are fan of the Men Of War series...THIS...IS...A MUST HAVE!!!!  Get it while its on sale for $25.  See you all on the battlefield...			"

												What im about to say is difficult for me to articulate without sounding like a noob who cant play or someone who's computer is a potatoe. I am a master league sc2 player and my pc has a radeon 6850, just for clarification. I have also tested this on a friends pc  and everything is the same.  I have noticed that if you issue commands very quickly they do not register and its as if you never issued them. e.g. If you select 5 groups of men and move them all by rapidly pressing the correct # keys then clicking with your mouse, often only the first group or two will have received the command despite you pressing each group key then clicking. This also happens when trying to rapidly click and drag over units and grouping them, jumping between several vehicles to change ammo, telling multiple artillery to fire on ground, telling a squad to throw several gernades, ect.This will happen in offline skirmish with graphics as low as they go.This just seems to be how the game is programmed, its like the game can only process APMs so fast and if you go beyond that it doesn't work. I suppose this could be a hardware problem on my and my friends end, perhaps our Cpus are too weak or something like that. But i dont know, in sc2/planetary annihilation i can issue commands as fast as my body will let me, i can rapidly hit group keys and issue move orders and everyone of those commands works and they all start moving. In Sc2 i can click and drag and make up 5 groups in about 2 seconds, in MOWAS2 this is just impossible.I asked my friend if he noticed this and he said he didn't, i went over to his home and reproduced it, clearly noobs cannot see this problem; you have to be able to micro. I am an armchair historian and i enjoy this game because of that and also i suspect eveyone has this APM cap to deal with so its not like anyone has an unfair edge But still if you are a high ranked RTS player and you know how to micro, sometimes this game will make you want to stick a fork in your eye.

												I am truly on the fence with MoW: AS II. On one hand, the game is quite solid and does not fail where its predecessor succeeded, but at the same time I see few improvements. The modding seems comprehensive and the multiplayer system is far more streamlined (In my opinion), yet, I find it hard to reccomend this title. There is simply too little built upon from the original by what I've seen. If this were on sale for a good price (which it typically is) I can reccomend picking it up. However, I bought this game at the current price ($29.99) and quickly refunded it, but I do intend to pick it back up later at a cheaper price. As it stands, I can not suggest buying Men of War: Assault Squad II at full price. Just wait for the next big sale.			"

												I have over 600 hours on AS1. I have to say, I am majorly disappointed in this game. Like everyone else is saying, this feels like a worse version of AS1. The grenade timer feels very nooby and unnecessary. The performance is even worse, and the game has dissolved into 3+ assault squads at the beginning of every game. Just watch the good players play and you'll see this. It gets boring and repetitive. Whoever gets the lucky grenade pretty much wins the whole game, as it is near-impossible to recover from a beginning loss. AS1 was better because you could call in vehicles earlier to stop yourself from being swarmed and mgs were more effective in holding off waves.  Wah Wah! I let people gain an advantage over me early on and I don't deserve to be punished with people dug in on a point! DMS make it so I can charge head on into MGs and people in cover and actually win.The balancing also needs some work even after 6 months of continuous analysis by the best players on the game.I would go back to AS1 immediately if gamespy wasn't down.

I have been anticipating this game due to the few that can get it to work regularly and am glad I only spent the discounted price for such a failure.  I hope this company gets it together, but by the looks of it they are not very concerned.  I will be asking for a refund if they cannot get their act together shortly.  One should not have to walk around the world to fix what they pay money for.  I only got to play the game for an hour so I cannot truly comment as to if this game is any good or not.			"

Early Access Review
								Great fun so far. I haven't played anything from the MoW series up until now, and having played a few hours it reminds me of one of my favourite games of all time, Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2. So I'm pretty amazed how this series has escaped me for all these years.I love the diverse tactical approach to different situations, and I also love the inventory system. Also, for an RTS, it looks pretty good, and it's not at all stressful on a decent video card or processor.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is very fun! It has a smoother interface than the First Assault Squad and other games previuosly. It has a higher to detail than Company of Heroes does, and the game takes more in depth to what an RTS truely is. I am a BIG Fan of RTS games and I had choosen this game over WarGame Red Dragon, I think it is really good game. Buy it, but it still has many crashing and freezing frames every now and then, but overall the game has more of a fun and more thinkable way to play this game. It offers more and is more Diverse.

												If you are a fan of the Men of War series you will love Assault Squad 2. There is not a MAJOR difference from the first MoW:AS. There are various bugs and issues that have been fixed from the original. Also if you enjoy playing MoW online I recommend buying this game. Since this is currently the newest and most polished MoW there are more players to play with on AS2. If you are new to this series but enjoy ww2 RTS games I highly recommend this game. It is in between some of the more hardcore games such as Theatre of War and the more arcade casual Company of Heroes series. I feel it is the perfect balance of realism and fun. It has historically acurate units and armor penetration values. For added realism there are many mods that can enhance this aspect of the game. For players new to the series it will not seem as user friendly in the way Company of Heroes is. I have spent hours playing this series and still go back for more. I have yet to be bored with this game. I would personally give this game an 8/10.			"

												Really fun game, when it works. Atrocious amounts of glitches and bugs. Be prepared to fight the unresponsive soldiers, inability to resupply some units, your commands not being obeyed, and soldiers being stuck on their way to designated position, i.e. unable to go around obstacles, and stepping in place. AI seems infinetely stupid, and a bit overpowered, i.e. constant suppply of them is a bit overdone. Micromanagement is ridiculous, i.e. you need to re-supply all squads under fire,  but supply units are first to be fired upon. Snipers are useless, as they can't see any further than other units, and can't shoot very quickly, so they will do a kill every now and then, and that's all. Waves of incoming units are ridiculous, as there's no time to re-supply properly, or actually fight the resupply system, as soldiers just don't want to re-supply in most cases. There's no control over how and when vehicles like tanks fire from their main gun and when from the MG. Don't get me wrong, it's really nice game, but ridden with bugs. Btw... when you get angry and frustrated due to such issues, ALT-F4 doesn't work.			"

												I loved Company of Heroes 1, and was interested in getting CoH2 with the new Western Front expansion comming out. My research in CoH2 led me to the Men of War series, and after watching a few videos I jumped into Men of War: Assault Squad 2.I do not regret my decision. The game has a fairly steep learning curve, and yes - each unit has their own inventory... but, after playing the game for a few hours and watching some Youtube tutorials it is no longer an overwhelming experince. For an RTS it does not require as much micro-management as other RTS games, also it's a bit slower paced then most; this is great because the game become more of strategy than Starcraft style ""who can click things faster"".One of the most unique features of the game is ""Direct Command"" where you can grab any single unit and begin to control it via WASD/Arrow Keys. This is easy to use, and a great way to get the upper hand in a tank battle. The downside, being the indie game that it is, some of the models, and gameplay is not as polished as it could be, but 1C  and Digitalmindsoft seem to have a true passion for the games their making, and I anticipate bug fixes and meaningful expansions to be on the way.65/100 - Get a friend to play through the entire campaign co-op.

												This should've probably been released as an expansion. In terms of gameplay, it's virtually identical to Assault Squad 1. However, the engine has been revamped, so the game runs WAY better in singleplayer (at the moment, multiplayer is bogged down by bugs and lag, unfortunately.)Ultimately I'm glad I bought it, but it's weird to see a developer so blatantly re-sell a ""sequel"" that is almost a carbon copy of the original on the surface.

												The singleplayer is freaking annoying and frustrating, the more forces you have under control the worse the game becomes. AI is stupid as hell, soldiers lie down near grenade to be blown into pieces, tanks are being driven by lobotomized monkeys who after being order to attack enemy's tanks can't take appropriate position for firing and either stand still or take ridiculos routes to be vaporised by some AT gun they decided to pass by. Being under sniper fire any troops just doing nothing, being popped one by one, not trying to hide or drop down, nothing. If you overlooked a sniper kiss your troops he is after a goodbuy, they will just obidiently die one by one. Not a freaking mesasage ""you're under sniper fire"". In order to make your soldiers fight properly you have to slow down time and take control manually in the zones where♥♥♥♥♥♥is happening. The more forces you have the more annoying it becomes, while you babysitting your tank on the left flank, you stupid morons of soldiers are getting slaughtered on the right flank. If you want to win and minimize casualties you have to micromanage EVERYTHING. I got the game for the weakend, and NO WAY IN HELL I'm buying this piece of crap afterwards. The game is only playable when you have couple of platoons and 2-3 tanks, more than that - and the game becomes a freaking mess and a micromanagement fair. F this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm back to Company of Heroes, that game doesn't have the inventory, different types of ammo, fuel for tanks, the vehicles looks a bit more cartoonish - yes, but at least CoH is PLAYABLE. I can play it for hour or more without suicidal thoughts. Oh my god, I'm so furious at the MoW now... The singleplayer in this game is awful, this mechanics are not suited for big maps and big armies, since there is too much happening around and the AI is stupid as hell. Also too much random - tanks miss in most cases, and if the shot does connect you never know what will happen, enemy's PZ4 can survive dozen shots from T34, and in the next skirmish T34 oneshots your PZ4 with it's first shot. Or other way around, it only matter of luck, the higher caliber the more chances you get, but it's anyway too random. Ok, I let some steam out. Resume - if you are into singleplayer - this game has a very annoyning one, full of micromanagement and direct control of units, while playing on the slowest time setting available. I regret investing time in it... MoW was a nice series until this assault squad crap corrupted it.			"

												Single player campaign seems to be simillar for all the different factions (at least for the first mission). I only bought this game for the multiplayer and I can report there wasn't much of an experience there. The fps somehow is linked to the other players internet connection and results in getting very low fps (13ish) sometimes. The main problem I have is that there simply isn't much people playing mp. There was only one non-passworded room and it was running a mod that I didn't have downloaded. When I joined a different game to play I got kicked by the host because I'm a noob. I tried making my own room and no wanted to play me after 5 minutes of waiting. Even in the one 1v1 game I did get to play, there was visible lag on the units at times.Some of the graphics and animations in the game seem to be low quailty.I think there is a lot more value in the campaign of company of heroes 1 compared to this game.

												This game is quite a diamond in the rough. It has a steep learning curve, but is a must-have for major RTS and WWII fans. The game truly shines when playing cooperatively with friends, especially with the wealth of custom game modes and historical battles such as D-Day, Okinawa, Kursk and many others, which can all be found on the Steam Workshop or on related websites. This game really doesn't have that many players, so it would be nice to see more, as it is again, a absoultly fabulous game.			"

												Bought this DLC for the AI, been waiting forever for AI for this game! and to support the DEVS and might i say they did not dissapoint! The added on AI is amazing and fun! they play strictly with assault zones so far and even with the Modded Map packs that i have downloaded! There are some stuff the AI does pretty stupidly from time to time like charging in artillary peices as tanks, or using tanks as infantry to cap assault points. But what AI doesnt have problems? can always be patched up! although any difficultly besides heroic can be pretty easy. heroic is just right for me i feel since theres a lot of stuff to deal with and counter! perfect for practicing with! I havent tried the airborne missions though but knowing their singleplayer tendencies its most likely great! Id say if your tired of facing complaining humans in the MP or being kicked all the time for stupid reasons BUY THIS DLC!! its worth every penny! and its fun facing the AI when it doesnt mess up! always fun to comp stomp or if your at work to kill a little time! Great job Devs hats off to ya! keep up the great work!			"

												Loads of fun, tactical strategy game mixed with a slight RPG element in which you can equip your guys with ammo, helms and bullets. There are micromanagement aspects to it that help you take control of an individual unit.This game is especially fun with friends (what game isn't?). Have your friend (or yourself) call out strats, while you can micromanage your units. Then dish out an insane amount of hurt with whatever shared resource funding is allotted to your team.My most favorite (albeit annoyingly stereotypical) aspect of this game is its call in units, specifically, the Soviet's ""For the Motherland!"" ability.  Would Order No. 227 the fascists while blaring the soviet anthem or worker's marseillaise anyday of the week.			"

												This game is quite a diamond in the rough. It has a steep learning curve, but is a must-have for major RTS and WWII fans. The game truly shines when playing cooperatively with friends, especially with the wealth of custom game modes and historical battles such as D-Day, Okinawa, Kursk and many others, which can all be found on the Steam Workshop or on related websites. This game really doesn't have that many players, so it would be nice to see more, as it is again, a absoultly fabulous game.			"

												This game is definitely underrated and highly enjoyable to even the most non rts type players once you work out the kinks.Though not without issues, this game is a master piece.Gameplay- 10/10Without a doubt, this game caters to a more precise crowd of people. The level of control over your units alone is enough to salivate the most hardcore of fans in the RTS genre. The actual battles themselves? Pure unadulturated goodness. Your troops actually matter. Their positions actually matter. The different types of units actually matter. In other games things like AA guns and some MG placements just get killed early and barely make any difference in the fight. COH2 being one such example. However in this game, each and every unit can have a massive affect on the battle. Very unique playstyles can be done in this game. Content - 10/10The fact that it has 5 fully fleshed out factions is amazing in itself. Other such games in this genre could learn from this. The amount of units within these factions is awesome as well. Yeah some of them are copy and paste but it definitely is enjoyable to be to have diversity. Graphics -6/10 Somewhat lacking given the year this came out in. Though I understand it's difficult to do RTS games with amazing graphics and still have everything running correctly. Still, aesthetically pleasing for the most part.Story - 5/10Not played too much of the story. But pretty similar to other such games in this genre. Typical WW2 scenarios and plot driven kill the enemy type scenarios. Cinematics - 2/10 One of the only things I find annoying about this game is the little cut scenes in some of the missions, especially during a skirmish when playing with a friend and you lose track of your units when it comes on. Music - 3/10 The music gets extremely repetitive. Controls - 9/10The controls takes a lot of getting used to if you want to be good. However, they are there for a purpose and once you figure it all out you are a master of the battlefield.Multiplayer - 9/10One of my only cons about this game is that during the Multiplayer if someone has a terrible connection or a not so good graphics card, everyone tends to suffer from lag. I've yet to play a game where the MP was extremely stable and there wasn't some weird frame skipping when you moved players.  Other than that, it's addicting. You willl never feel so satisfied as you do when you win multiplayer matches. It is absolutely addicting. It's been a long time since a game has made me feel like this.  Overall, this game is absolutely worth the price, especially on sale! "

												Good game that could be better.I recommend this game to wwii fans out there wanting to play this type of game but have never tried the previous titles like the assault squad 1. However if you played it before, don't bother with this title unless it's on a huge sale because the developers did not pay enough effort into making this a better game.I would say that this is the best wwii rts game out there right now, but the problem remains as there is a large room for possible improvments in terms of the types of skirmish missions available to the players.They're all basically the same type of missions and most of them are carried over from the assault squad 1.

												In the field of military theory, the operational level of war (also called the operational art, as derived from Russian: оперативное искусство, or the operational warfare) represents the level of command that connects the details of tactics with the goals of strategy.Operational art comprises four essential elements: time, space, means and purpose. Each element is found in greater complexity at the operational level than at the tactical or strategic level. This is true, in part, because operational art must consider and incorporate more of the strategic and tactical levels than those levels must absorb from the operational level. Although much can be gained by examining the four elements independently, it is only when they are viewed together that operational art reveals its intricate fabric.The challenge of operational art is to establish a four-element equilibrium that permits the optimal generation and application of military power in achieving the political goal. Viewing time, space, means and purpose as a whole requires great skill in organizing, weighing and envisioning masses of complex, often contradictory factors. These factors often exist for extended periods, over great distances and with shifting mixes of players, systems and beliefs, pursuing political goals which may or may not be clear, cogent or settled. Compounding factors, such as the opponent's actions, create further ambiguity.Operational-level strategy must continually inventory and weigh time, space, means and purpose, extrapolating from them outcomes and probabilities. To accomplish this, practitioners need both skill and theory, experience and knowledge. At the operational level, skills and experience must usually be developed indirectly, through formal training, military history and wargaming.Success at the tactical level is no guarantee of success at the operational level: mastery of operational art demands strategic skills. Without a strong grounding in the theory and application of operational art, a successful tactician has little hope of making the demanding leap from tactics. The operational level strategist must see clearly and expansively from the foxhole into the corridors of national or coalition authority. They must be aware of the plausibility and coherence of strategic aims, national will and the players who decide them. Successful operational art charts a clear, unbroken path from the individual soldier's efforts to the state or coalition's goals.While the emerging corpus of operational art and the establishment of an operational level of war are relatively new, operational art has existed throughout recorded history. Nations have long pursued political goals through military actions, and campaigns of any period can be examined from the existential perspective of operational art. Current schools of thought on the operational art share the fundamental view that military success can be measured only in the attainment of political-strategic aims, and thus any war can be analyzed in the terms of operational art.

												What can I say that hasn't already been said in every other review. The A.I is cancer. Community can be cool sometimes, most of the time they suck. But the game itself is something. I probably should have reviewed this earlier but eh. Now the if you're not directly controlling your units they get themselves killed...Now I know this is starting to sound like a bad review but, the one thing that makes this game sooooo worth it are the mods. Find friends make them get the mods and ♥♥♥♥ing wreck each other. Without mods this game would be mediocre at best but with them Jesus ducking Christ. Modding community is amazing for this game. If a mod is popular it shouldn't be too hard to set up a public game might need to wait a little. If you're like me and don't have friends, well the modding community covers that too. They add new missions, campaigns and even wave defense. Like I said with mods this game is pretty awesome.			"

												AwesomeThis game is about micromanagement in a ww2 battlefield what it does very well. It is just a thrill to capture a whole base with just a few soldiers. But when not acting corectly you can lose a lot of soldiers. The game is build around realism, it is posible to repair tanks when they are knocked out but not destroyed completely.Tanks in the game do not have a hit bar it is a chance that a bulit hits on the vulnerable places, because of this your tank can be destroyed when the first bullit hits (taking to accaunt the armor thickness) or can be completely functional after loads of hits.Men of War as2 does not give much improvement over men of war as1. But it is better than as1, runs better and has new units and other small improvements.If you have as1 and you like it a lot buy as2, but keep in mind that it is't a whole new game.As a conclution the game is a very good world war 2 strategy game with micromanagement.I like to play it with frends.I also think this game is a lot better than company of heroes (2).

												I want to like the game. Its innovative, and 10 times better than Company of Heroes. But the missions are exactly the same format almost every time, and half the maps are pulled from the original Assault Squad.Edit: AI balance issues seem to have been fixed a little maybe, or maybe its because i hold my tanks in reserve more.Balance Issues exist. AI tanks are OP as hell. I faced an AI with 4 tanks vs his one. 2 of them were recovered tanks that were the same type as the medium tank i was facing. He wiped out all of my tanks, while my units (and an AT gun) blasted away at his weaker side armor from a stopped and stabilized position. There is realism. And then there is absolute lunacy.Easy mode, your tanks are invincible which isnt fun. Normal, the enemy tanks are invincible but the troops are realistic and challenging. Cmon. There shouldnt be such a jump. Easy is TOO easy. and Normal you might as well just use troops exclusively without your useless tanks.			"

												This game is somewhat a two sided dice.It's quite ok at lower difficulty setting. However at heroic setting the game ditches all and any realism. Enemy units see through foliage, lack any and all recoil mechanisms and friendly armored units become completely useless because they just cant see/detect/hit or penetrate the enemy armor (up to 40 hits to take down a medium tank, right, realism).All in all, i recommend a playthrough on the easy settings but stay away from hard or hardcore. The coding errors and blatantly broken ai make it a save/load torture. I mean where is the common sense that an enemy infantry runs infront of a 2x10 squads and nobody shoots/hits. Seriously.Verdict: Not recommended due to broken mechanism which are not apparent on lower difficulty settings.			"

												I consider MOWAS2 to be one of the finest RTS games ever made.1) All the MOW games are pretty similar, and all good.  There are many complaints about how MOWAS2 is the same game as MOWAS, and this is largely true, but not a reason to rate the game down.2) If you've played Company of Heroes, then MOWAS is similar but much more realistic - more like a WW2 simulation.  This makes it a harder game harder to learn, and harder to master but ultimately makes it feel more like you are playing WW2, rather than playing a video game (as with CoH)3) Unfortunately DMS (the devs) are a little sketchy.  For us, the gamers, this means a) the multiplayer is sometimes unreliable and dropped games, lag and connection faliures are too frequent.  It also means you get shady things like MOWAS2 being bacisly the same as MOWAS (see above), and DLC's that are rather obviously designed just to make money and have minimal content.Overall: an outstanding game that is an absolute MUST for any WW2 RTS lover.

												I honestly love this game. Not to sound like a hipster, but it truly is underrated in the sense that it is a fantastic WWII strategy game. The modding community is strong, with them ranging from unlimited points in campaign, high detailed co-op and multiplayer maps. WARNING: this game can and will get very dull without mods. For (high quality) mods, I recommend DJSatane, Vashyo, and SirHinkel for extra missions ranging from the beaches of Normandy to the three stages of Stalingrad. 15.786/9.9 would sacrifice 200 Russian Conscripts for one objective like a true Comrade again			"

												For some strange reason I found out about this game just a couple months ago, didn't even know it existed. So a friend suggested it to me, and since I love strategy games I dived into it. Well all I can say is that coming from Company of Heroes (the original one, not the sequel which is plain bad) and having spend thousands of hours over the years there, I'll just say that Men of War is a diamond. Excellent in all and every aspect, with depth, requires real thinking and strategy and it's also pleasing to the eye.The only downside I see and which for me is quite something, is the lack of a proper campaign, one that advances through and your units carry over, and what and how you did it matters in the long run.Either than that a very highly suggested game for anyone into strategy gaming.

												MoW:AS2 continues to amaze me months after purchasing the game.  As a historian, I love the accuracy of the research to properly craft units.  Obviously, some adjustments have been made to allow gameplay within a reasonable area.  You will have to employ solid combat tactics to succeed, but when a catastrophic explosion flips your opponent's turret through the air, you'll feel like Patton reincarnated.  The map and scenario editor allows for endless mods for a very large and loyal fan base.  After you finish the 46 scenarios built into the game, there are hundreds if not thousands of other scenarios to try out.  Some are painstakingly researched historical battles, while others may be a HALO fight.  It's up to you.			"

												A fan of WWII, and strategy games? Then the MOW:AS series is for you! Of course, with only 2 games in the Assualt Sqaud series, they are nontheless fun to play. Of course, its a strategy game, but you can control your units, plus, you have access to the Steam Workshop! This game has things from the P-51 to the Ju-87, to flamethrower units to your regular infantry, to the Black Prince to the Flamethrower Sherman and Super Pershing! Of course, I didn't buy this game, it was gifted to me, but does that change my opinion, no! Buy this game and give it a whirl! And DON'T forget the Fields of Honor (German Soldiers) mod!			"

If your looking for a RTS that you can fully submerged into this is it. the game is astounding an not even that exspensive Im not much of a multiplayer kind of guy so I cant speak on its behalf but... the coop is amazing. It honestly feels like you are in the war, Every detail of this game is acccurate I have zero complaints so Im going to say 10/10 BUY THIS GAME :)			"

												This is a really good WWII game but it suffers from random crashes, graphical glitches, random connection loss ect. but dont let that discourage you from getting this game if its on sale buy it you wont be disapointed if you do. But be aware that if you play multiplayer it is VERY VERY punishing to new players of the men of war series and generally the high ranks will destroy you a lot but if you learn from them by loseing you can end up being better than them (mabey) check those corners and good luck commander, and remember ""we, will be watching""			"

												Very good game, at least that is how I remember it, it is enjoyable as long as you like the series as a whole.This particular game brings a lot of engine improvements so things look more pretty-a small downside tough, is that infantry models dont look as good as Condemned Heroes but you get seasonal camo instead so I guess it kinda balances it out.There is 1 rather obvious flaw, that is the multiplayer aspect of the game, from time to time, you or players from the match can and will get OOS(Out of sinc), at the moment there is somewhat of a hotfix implemented which maxes the game playable but does not remove OOS completly, something which I think will happen in the future as the game still gets updates.Nice game if you kow what you are doing and can resist some of it's quirks till they get fixed.

												Apart from the clunky as hell UI, this game really seems to be decent quality.  Unfortunately, let me describe the first level of this game to you.You walk a group of people up a corridor.  You gradually encounter slightly heavier enemies.  You disable but repair every enemy vehicle you see so that you can use it yourself.  You walk to the end of the corridor, it is now your ""field HQ"".  You will at this point have 1 Sherman, 3 Matildas, 1 daimler armoured car, 1 Pz I, 1 Stug, 1 Ostwind, and about 40 assorted infantry.You get assaulted by at least 2 Marder III, 2 PzII, 4 PzIII, 2 Stug III, 3 Pz V, 2 Tiger Is, assorted halftracks and maybe 100+ assorted infantry.Everything you have dies prettymuch as soon as it is shot at (Tigers so no surprise really).  Basically the game at that point comes down to crossing your fingers and hoping the bizzare damage system lets your tanks survive a shot.I take it from this that the campaign mode isnt the reason why you should buy this game, but I am not much of a modder type so.  Ah well.			"

												Ok, There are planes in this game. You can use them in gem editor. There was a big problem called ""Out Of Sync"" In the multiplayer, but its now fixed. I suggest you to download GSM Fields of honor XII for more units, realism, maps and countries. For the GSM, take a look at the Sirhinkels GSM missions. Sirhinkel also has other missions that do not require GSM. Bittereinder said these smart words to me: ""Tanks dont win battles"". Assault zones are easier than combat, but combat is little more realistic. Frontlines is like skirmish battles (you should play some skirmish battles to learn basic things before going to multiplayer) except its against other players. Day of victory is just A-zones except with 1 flag that takes long to cap. And trust me, you do not want to let enemy infantry close to your Brand new, shiny Tiger. This rewiev has no logical order and possibly some spelling mistakes but i dont give a f***. 9/10			"

												Realism - 10The gameplay is much better and realistic than CoH (Tanks can shoot several hundred meters while CoH it's like 25)Graphics - 5CoH 1 looks better than this game. However, you can have much more large scale battles in this than CoH.Sound - 7 Everything kinda sounds the same but the quality is goodLearning Curve - 9 (high)This game is very specific. You can control each individual member or the whole squad at a time. The individual men have a huge array of options. For instance, my Sherman Firefly got destroyed but the .50 cal was intact so once the tank crew abandonded the tank, i told one of the crewmen to grab the .50 cal and then proped it on a wall and began raining hell upon enemy infantry.Overall - 7It's a nice realistic game that's very in depth. If you take the time to learn (3+ hours) you will really enjoy this game. It's not one of those that you can master right after installing.			"

												Got this game not too long ago, but I must say it is one of the most impressive RTS games I have ever played. Graphics are superb, realism to the max, combat interaction incredibly accurate. If your looking for a RTS that you can fully submerged into this is it. the game is astounding an not even that exspensive Im not much of a multiplayer kind of guy so I cant speak on its behalf but... the coop is amazing. It honestly feels like you are in the war, Every detail of this game is acccurate I have zero complaints so Im going to say 10/10 BUY THIS GAME :)			"

												I consider MOWAS2 to be one of the finest RTS games ever made.1) All the MOW games are pretty similar, and all good.  There are many complaints about how MOWAS2 is the same game as MOWAS, and this is largely true, but not a reason to rate the game down.2) If you've played Company of Heroes, then MOWAS is similar but much more realistic - more like a WW2 simulation.  This makes it a harder game harder to learn, and harder to master but ultimately makes it feel more like you are playing WW2, rather than playing a video game (as with CoH)3) Unfortunately DMS (the devs) are a little sketchy.  For us, the gamers, this means a) the multiplayer is sometimes unreliable and dropped games, lag and connection faliures are too frequent.  It also means you get shady things like MOWAS2 being bacisly the same as MOWAS (see above), and DLC's that are rather obviously designed just to make money and have minimal content.Overall: an outstanding game that is an absolute MUST for any WW2 RTS lover.

												Super in-depth, super detailed, super good. Not only can you steal enemy vehicles and guns, you can steal those vehicles' supplies and use them yourself, and then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL with E and turn the game into a third-person shooter. You can control the inventory of individual infantry down to their damn hats and the bullets in their gun. The environments are almost entirely destructable to a striking degree of detail, which leads to awesome moments like when the bomber you call in for an airstrike is shot down by enemy forces (Yes, you can do that too) and it crashes into a house and knocks it to pieces.The only two complaints that I have about this game are that you can't commandeer everything on the field (Battleships, a German artillery piece in one or two missions, some boats, etc), and that it's far too similar to the original MOWAS - most of the missions are just ported from the older game, and there are very few engine differences - it makes buying the older game feel like a waste of money. I suppose this could stem from the fact that they're all taken from real battles that faction actually won, but I think the base game could stand to have a little more replay value. Still, though, given how much fun it is to play the missions that are there, it doesn't hurt the game much.			"

												Amazing game. As someone who grew up with AoE II, this game brings me back.However, instead of worrying about collecting resources, this game is about highly advanced combat tactics and strategies. I would recommend this to anyone who has a RTS background, and I guarentee you will have a good time playing.MOW:AS2 has also taught me a lot about WWII, and each individual factionOnce again. I highly recommend this game. See you on the battlefield.			"

												Good game, great graphix and game play, on easy setting. Anything over that and the game becomes unrealisticaly hard and nothing but frustrating. YOur units sit and don't fight back. Tanks will target infantry and let enemy armor blow them to pieces. AI has range that half the time you never even see what is shooting at you. Any time you advance with armor, good chance you are going to get blown away before they get off a shot.			"

												I bought this when it was a free weekend.  If you liked the first one, and I did, then this is almost the same game.  As far as I can tell, the graphics are better, and the UI had some updates.  There are a few more maps to play too.The editor has had some updates too, but the main reason I got it was because you how have steam support.  It was worth a few dollars to me to have multi player games available in steam and have the steam workshop.I'm having fun with the game editor all over again, but wait until it's on sale.Would I recomend the game?  Yes, it's still a great game.			"

												Loving this game a must buy for any strategy gamer. Only a few changes I wish it would make. Company of Heroes 2 has a skirmish mode where you can fight against AI on or offline and not just computer players. If they would implement that and character animations to where the soldiers do more than just stand still when idle and have your soldiers suffer from hypothermia when in freezing conditions or severe fatigue when in tropical enviornments it would be the best WWII strategy game in my opinion.

												First off, I love the mow series, the first game, assault squad, vietnam, all of them.     Alot of people say this is the exact same game as as1, and really, it is pretty much the same, but many game mechanics were changed, which is good.  They took some really important features out of this game, but they added good mod support, to correct these problems.  I like this game, but it is really similar to as1 with not enough differences, which I dont like, I really only recommend this game if you havent played as1, or are new to the series.       And with the maps, there are VERY good new maps which I absolutely adore, but in some of them, I realized there is no versatility, no game-changing things, and it gets almost robotic, for example, im USA facing Japan, the enemy player sends a kamikazi, sneaks through all of my lines, and then takes out my sherman jumbo.  Im spooked, and then reinforce my lines and everything, but within that few seconds of attempting to strengthen my lines, the enemy player attacks with elite infantry and light tanks, which I cant counter because of my jumbo gone, and I lose the game because of one kamikazi.  I just dont see that anymore in as2, atleast, not often enough, and that a major flaw in this game for me, making me at times really frustrated.			"

Terrain can sometimes glitch and throw your vechiles in the air, you have to baby sit all units cause they will run into fire for no apparent reason. Also it can be very annoying when you enemy cna direct control a unit and go rambo from a distance with a cannon.  I play mostly well thought out RTS's like total war and company/warhammer so these problems can really ruin the experience for me plus dont get starting with desyn errors in the middle of a game.   but overall the game can be fun just depends on what games you like.

												Really the game mechanics are amazing but lack of content is a HUGE hinderence. What this game really needs is a skirmish mode. A REAL skirmish mode because at the moment it only has a few campaign missions disguised as skirmishes on the main menu. Besides that it only has multiplayer and extras. Multiplayer was meh at best for me and I didn't look too throughly into the extras but from what I saw it wasn't worth mentioning.The AI is dreadfully stupid on many occasions from refusing to fire on enemies right in their face to bandaging their own wounds when given the chance to running straight up to a tank to fire a rocket launcher.  You'll spend more time fixing mistakes by a bad AI than actual strategic planning and more often than not losing a few games over AI screw ups. Not once but 5 times have I had my own artillery fire on my soldiers. It's a good game mechanic wise and can give you hours worth of fun but wouldn't recommend buying it at full price as the lack of content is obvious. If there's ever a new Men of War that fixes all these problems and has at least double the content I'll be sure to check it out.			"

												Very fun, played during the free weekend. Will soon buy.Pretty much, your in control of a small miltary force, you then must fight to take control of capture points and such.Really fun when your moving your small squad in a flanking manuver and they get slaughtered by the machine gun you didnt notice.One time, in a epic battle, i had my 2 of the most powerfull tanks (and some of the best in the game i think) charge the enemy, and there tracks were both destroyed.No other reinforcements could reach them, so alone, they took out over 20 enemy tanks. Eventually i got a squad to them, the squad managed to repair one but the other was destroyed, killing all but one solider, I then had the last man help man the tank, and drove to base. Only to have that tank finally get detroyedEnd battle:I had 1 man left, no reinforcements(all dead), the enemy had 1 tank. My soldier had no Anti-Tank genades, and the nearest body was in the open, where the tank would shoot me, I ran for cover in a building, where there was a dead solider, i looted him and got a gernade.I then charged the tank and threw it, right as the tank opened fire.My solider managed to survive :)10/10 Most epic battle ever 2015			"

Posted: October 19, 2015
												Alright, so, I'm going to revise my Men Of War: Assault Squad 2 review, and I'm going to make it right. When I originally bought the game, I was clueless of the whole Men Of War series and was excited as hell that I had found such a unique RTS to play, and at the time, it was somewhat about £20.00 say about that. When I began to play the game, I had originally hoped that could find my way around the game pretty easily. Indeed, the guides that come with the game really help you, in the long run on getting a grip of the game functions, but over time, I just began to realise why the game got boring. So, enough talk, let's get down to business.The Reasons:1. From what I've begun to see from other Men Of War games, primarily Assault Squad 1, if you will, there is a MASSIVE LACK OF NEW CONTENT. The game feels like a damned Copy-Paste, and by no means does it feel improved. The GUIs don't seem to have been changed too much, with some minor changes, and the admittably better sorting out. The Vehicles appear to be mostly copy-pasted from the first MOWAS to the new MOWAS2, with probably a few new vehicles being added in between, but nothing special at all. The vehicle skins are mostly the same, and very, very, very few have been reskinned. The soldier skins basically are the same ones, and trust me, unless you can make the better skins yourself, they look horribly outdated. The weaponry diversity doesn't seem to exist either, I was hoping for a wider range of firearms, but this was disappointing after a while of seeing this wasn't possible.2. The utter disgrace of an AI. The Unit AI is horrible. Horrible... HORRIBLE! The AI is 100% unable to fend for itself, it does not seek cover, even when free movement is given to it, and if it does, it is a VERY RARE occurrence. AI will also on most terms not fire back at all if an enemy begins to shoot at it, unless you get within some bloody SMG range of the enemy unit for it to involuntarily fire at the enemy attacking it. Infantry will most of the time sit around on their♥♥♥♥♥♥ doing absolutely nothing at all, regardless of the threats around them. They will RARELY EVER throw back an enemy grenade as soon as they see one, but whenever they do, it is probably the only good thing this AI can do, as after throwing it, it decides to jump away from the grenade to avoid getting killed, at least that's smart... somewhat, unless it doesn't throw the grenade at YOUR OWN units.AT Infantry units will probably sit around and do absolutely nothing when they see a tank, and even if they are close enough to engage it, they would rather stare at the tank till it goes by, and then maybe actually consider shooting at it, but most of the time, by the time this would probably happen, they'd be mauled and laying on the floor, squashed by a tank's tracks or MGs.Whenever your SMG Infantry attempt to attack a tank, they will literally run up to the mother-trucker and get themselves squashed, killed, blow up, or even blow themselves up with their own AT Grenade. Your units will on rare occasions decide to use their frag grenades at enemy positions, which is probably another of the actually few smart things the AI does. When told to stay in cover, the AI will NOT switch cover to avoid an incoming vehicle, even if free movement is set on.The tanks probably have the worst AI to date, without a doubt. They will not rotate their armour to hide their weak spots, and they will never attempt to engage an enemy tank properly unless it is in direct sight of the gun. Tanks will never choose to keep their distance against infantry, and will most of the time just approach them, getting within range of their AT Grenades and getting themselves blown up, anyway. AT Guns, Mortars and Artillery Pieces probably don't suffer the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI features, and are actually a bit more intelligent in their operation.Medics do not automatically revive your units, and always require you to do it manually, so this becomes a major bloody headache since you can't pry your eyes off your one squad, while you make a charge on the other side of the map, only to turn back and find all your squad obliterated, lying on the ground like a burnt pancake in the bin.Snipers probably will do something useful, if they're put in the right spot, but can't even attempt to spot enemies for themselves, and when they do, they will most likely just stare and stare till the enemy comes close enough for a standard unscoped rifle kill, which removes the actual bloody use for snipers in the first place.3. The Developers are a big issue with this game. They are lazy, they are money-grabbers and they look down on the whole Community as a bunch of cash-grabs. The DLCs, according the many other players, are barely worth it, and even force you to pay for even more multiplayer features in themselves. They rarely ever fix any issues as regards to Multiplayer Connectivity, as it remains laggy and buggy as hell, shooting players Out Of Sync within the first two minutes of battle. The overall textures they made feel cluttered and the skins of the vehicles are simply copy-paste, showing the utter laziness of the Developers themselves. They never answer the questions of the Community, and never listen to the major bugs or connectivity or AI issues the game has. I'm going to be frank, the Developers can either get off their arses, listen to the Community and fix the game, and make it actually worth playing, or they can overall shut down altogether and not bother making another game, because MOW Origins is just another MOWAS2 Reskin, and MOWAS2 is just a reskin of MOWAS, and making it even worse, Call To Arms (CTA) is just another bloody Modern Warfare Reskin of MOWAS2, with NO improvements in GUI, EVEN MORE bugs, and TWICE AS MANY gameplay issues as MOWAS or MOWAS2 combined. All in all, they never pay attention to their biggest successes, and drown them in a bunch of bugs, failures and deaf ears to the Community.4. You all pretty much can tell that from the past points listed, you'll then look at my play time and say, ""Why have you played this game so long then?"" Well, I'll cut it simple. The only thing keeping this screw-up of a ""game"" is the Community with its Workshop and massive amounts of Mods that actually make MOWAS2 better than the way the Developers actually designed it, modifiying the gameplay, units, reskinning them properly, actually making them look aesthetically attractive, making them look badass, and at the same time, improving the qualty of gameplay. Yet MOWAS2 still manages to screw this up by shooting players Out Of Sync, which makes it disappointing to have a great time, on some cases.5. The Multiplayer is a huge recurring vague array of the same simple annoying stuff. It all depends on who is the best at actually storming a position and then continuing to storm it on and on and on and on, and rendering his opponent unable to spawn in any units properly to counter the threat, such that it makes the game ever more boring for the losing side because the winning side will have already spammed about tens of squads and anti-infantry and anti-tank vehicles to make sure you can't even get the slightest edge of hopping back into the fight, forcing you to stare at all you've been playing for during that match, as the countdown timer drops to zero.6. The Singleplayer Missions, whereas some are actually challenging, are very rare in this case. The Singleplayer Missions are a mess, a screw-up, and a huge vague waste of time, especially if they're the typical Skirmish with 11 Strategic Points to capture and having you start from the very beginning, only that after you capture one point, the AI SPAMS THE LIVING HELL OUT OF HIS RESERVES TO TAKE BACK JUST ONE POINT YOU CAPTURED, which makes the Singleplayer a living hell to play, and the fact that you can't pitch in as many units as the AI can sucks.Not worth the money until the game improves. Period. Not worth it at all.			"

												I loded up a match where i was the germans and my enemy was some slaavaboo who kept telling me i was a ""filthy facist"". we then proceded to lay down in some mud while trying to shoot eachother with direct fire. i was already trying to suggest the treaty of versailles when he got a mortar and proceded to bomb everything exept my soldiers. i dont know why he did this, i mean, how hard can it be to hit a 10m x 10m area with a mortar from 75m away. at some point he also got a tank and killed two of my guys with it, but as soon as he tried to move forward, one of the guys he had just shot in the forehead, woke up and threw a granade at the front plate of the tank. somehow this made the tank explode just like my new mix tape. the match ended when i got a tank and butt♥♥♥♥ed them with the cannon so deep, you could see the muzzle peaking out of their mouths. he kept screaming in the chat something about ""nazi tanks"" and ""op"" while i was doing this. overall i would give this game a 4/5. just dont expect to play the singleplayer like at all.

												As a fan of strategy games, particularly Total War, this was exceptionally fun. It's a good change from fighting with hundreds of soldiers in Total war. You get units of like 10 guys, with tanks and artillery, and you can even control the individual men in 3rd person if you want. Super detailed. Like, it gets down to looking in a guy's inventory and using a repair kit on a damaged track on a tank, or even more specific. I recommend it if you like being able to play a game for countless hours and still find new details and strategies.			"

												This game may not be noob friendly, but it sure is fun! Especially with the editor.Any veteran of RTS games is going to find himself just fine, at least in terms of controls and main gameplay features. Diffrences between MoW and its more arcade counterpart *cough* CoH *cough* are quite huge, but the biggest two are realism level and gamemode types. To be fair they are two completly diffrent games. You shouldn't just rush with a T-34 and expect to stay alive thanks to your high healthbar, you have to be carefull at all time, because even an Panzer II can wreck your tank in matters of seconds, if it gets you from the rear.Infantry dies at least 10 times faster and easier than in CoH, it also is 10 times more effective and dangerous. Arty is OP.As far as gameplay goes, there is no base building and unit production, most of the time you have limited resources or you can call units from out of the map, it depends from a gamemode.Graphics are mostly good, there is not much to talk about. Physic engine is great and destruction is top tier.  Optimisation is just brilliant.I strongly recommend this game to any fan of WW2 games and RTS fans. There is also a huge database of mods to choose from, extra nations, even more increased realism, and you can even turn it into a modern RTS with just one mod. 9/10 - Still not perfect.			"

												This is my review of the Men of War: Assault Squad 2.I bought the game twice (for me and for a friend) and my mind just can't understand how an engine from 2006 could run so bad. The game is barely playable in Multiplayer. For those who have not been playing it before I will say this - imagine a constant lag with micro freezing screens ALL the time. Excuse me, but I run Skyrim much better than this. It lags for 80% of people in multiplayer no matter what your PC configuration is. May be if I take some of NASA's supercomputers I will be able to play a normal game. And the lag is just the beginning - yesteday I won a 1v1 battle only because the the guy against me had several game costing bugs (he can't repair his tank, his crew won't enter the second damaged tank which he managed somehow to repair, and his units got completely stuck several times). Today as always I experienced same thing again and that was the end. I decided to write that and to say don't buy that thing unless they fix it. And believe me I will write here again when the game is playabe again I promise.			"

After playing it for a bit I realized that the single player missions are the same ones that were in Assault Squad, there really doesn't seem to be any difference between the two games single player campaigns.If you've never played Assault Squad it's pretty good but without new single player missions I don't think this game deserves to be called ""Assault Squad 2"". Perhaps ""Assault Squad Remastered"" or something else would have been more fitting because it seems to be the exact same game as Assault Squad as far as I can tell.			"

												Overall, I think Men of War:AS2 is a great game, even if it does have some shortcomings. Looking solely at physics, it is probably one of the most realistic RTS games out there. This isn't Company of Heroes where you can destroy a Tiger by shooting at it enough. Armor is incredibly diverse and I feel fairly accurately portrays the hundreds of vehicles that made WWII interesting. The game does have a lot of vehicles to offer as well as weapons and abilities. It is probably the most immersive RTS game franchise I know. Unfortunately the ""realistic"" armor does make some countries, like Germany, a little OP, but this is only really an issue in multiplayer when people autolock Germany.A major criticism for this game (which is entirely justified) is how it reused a lot of content from Assault Squad 1 without really adding much. The devs have added a few ""free updates"" to fix some issues and have improved the graphics. If this is your first time in the Men of War series, this is the definitive version and the one you should get - for those who have already played previous titles, some of the maps are going to feel more than familiar. It is somewhat of a ""1.5"" sequel rather than ""2"".The game is challenging but very rewarding. There are so many things you can do that make it stand out from other titles in the genre. You can manage individual soldiers, control their inventories and the weapons they have, and you also have to worry about ammo. You can deman an enemy AT gun or even a tank, and after some quick repairs, use it agains them! There is no more satisfying feeling than seeing ""Hull damaged"" over an enemy Jagdpanther. All of these features make the game very fun but very difficult when you first start out. The game doesn't hold your hand even though there are (un)helpful tips they give you here and there.The AI, both enemy and friendly is pretty bad, but it is compensated by the manual control feature which allows you to aim and mobilize any solider or vehicle with the arrowkeys and mouse. It is very fun and I can't think of many RTS games that offer that type of engagement. You can even use it to exploit the maximum range by simply aiming at something in front of your target!One final caviat is that the game does crash sometimes in skirmish every so often; it is rare, but when you play 4 hour games with your friends, they are very frustrating when you are halfway to victory. Despite all the issues I listed, this game is still one of my favorites and massively fun to play. Get some friends and play multiplayer skirmish where you can strategically work together to win. With so many vehicles and playability for the Americans, British, Germans, Russians, and Japanese, there are literally hundreds of hours of battles to be had in this game. The steam workshop offers many new maps and modifications that can be added in seconds to enhance your game experience.			"

												This is my review of the Men of War: Assault Squad 2.I bought the game twice (for me and for a friend) and my mind just can't understand how an engine from 2006 could run so bad. The game is barely playable in Multiplayer. For those who have not been playing it before I will say this - imagine a constant lag with micro freezing screens ALL the time. Excuse me, but I run Skyrim much better than this. It lags for 80% of people in multiplayer no matter what your PC configuration is. May be if I take some of NASA's supercomputers I will be able to play a normal game. And the lag is just the beginning - yesteday I won a 1v1 battle only because the the guy against me had several game costing bugs (he can't repair his tank, his crew won't enter the second damaged tank which he managed somehow to repair, and his units got completely stuck several times). Today as always I experienced same thing again and that was the end. I decided to write that and to say don't buy that thing unless they fix it. And believe me I will write here again when the game is playabe again I promise.			"

												To be fair I haven't played much of this game and I'm geting ready to give it another chance. I happened to catch this game on sale and after reading the rave reviews I bought it. Straight into the game the reviewers were right, it was visually stunning. The problems came with managing the troops, I'll admit I'm more used to Command and Conquer and Age of Empires style RTS games that involve sending units to fight and focusing on grand stragegy. This game offers an incredable (or absurd, depending on perspective) level of micromanaging. It would be a good idea to maybe take notes on hotkeys and instructions before hand, I had a AWFUL time trying to get my guys to use toolkits to repair a damaged vehicle because the controls are so ""complex"". In all I had to give up on the game because I couldn't get my guys to do what I wanted them to do but I suspect someone with more patience could have a blast with this game.			"

												Great game, facinating scenarios (both in vanilla, dlc, and workshop content), more gritty and realistic than Company of Heroes. Scavenge for weapons, ammo and grenades, sneak up on enemy troops and drop them with throwing knives or silenced weapons, snipe the commander off of a tank's cupola mounted MG, direct artillery to pound entrenched enemies or hidden field guns, track a deadly tank destroyer so you can flank it, repair your own tanks damaged main gun so you can bring it back into the fight. syphon fuel out of derelict vehicles to keep your machines running, detect mines, lay down barbed wire, chuck a bundle of dynamite into a building the enemy has dug into to level it, cover your squads and vehicles advances and retreats with smoke grenades.... there is SO much you can do, it will keep you coming back for more. Every replay is different.			"

Product received for free
												This game is fun and all and i would recommend buying it if it did'nt have so many godamn glitches. This is my experiencen, i buy the game works perfectly for 20 hours after that i had trouble starting the game, i could not play the game for months and when i did get it finally working the numpad stop working, the screen for the campaign was to far down and worst of all it ♥♥♥♥ing happend again and again and again. There are soultions to fix these problems but rest ashore, you are never safe from crashes and glitches in the game.			"

												Men of War is an amazing game. While not terribly similar to a conventional rts, this is what makes the game unique and interesting. Instead of researching technologies or building barracks, Men of War allows you to get reinforcements through ""mp"", which is steadily gained no moatter what. The rate can be improved by capturing ""strategic points"" which are usually marked by a flag. This will show the controlling team's flag as well. Soldiers then run from outside the battlefield into a team's spawn, and then you have reinforcements. Likewise, actual gameplay mechanics diverge from standard rts. The focus moves away from the types of units used and towards what you actually do with them. For example, you can move units into cover and buildings, allowing them to gain protection in certain directions respective to where you put them. Medics can also revive fallen units for a certain time, although (and correct me if I'm wrong) I believe there is a certain number of times a medic can revive a soldier before the soldier stays dead. The game plays like a shooter, except that instead of controlling one soldier you control an army, if that makes sense. I love it, and it is a refreshing break from the standard rts model and its various spinoffs.			"

												This Is one of the newer rts's ive had the most fun with playing coop and multiplayer with my brother. Its really intense one shot can take out your tiger and make you rage in chat if your not carefull. You need skill to be good at this game diffrent to most other games these days. But as many other mentions it crashes unocassionally it really suck when ur into a match and u found some good opponents Me myself tho havent got so much of these drops as my brother idk ithink a bit of it is depending on the computer aswell (not sure) conclusion: i love this game the best rts ive played in a long time the bad things is that theyr not really much people playing around 10k only if there were more it would help alot for me to like it even more i will give this game 8/10 i really recommend buying it on sale like i did!

												I loded up a match where i was the germans and my enemy was some slaavaboo who kept telling me i was a ""filthy facist"". we then proceded to lay down in some mud while trying to shoot eachother with direct fire. i was already trying to suggest the treaty of versailles when he got a mortar and proceded to bomb everything exept my soldiers. i dont know why he did this, i mean, how hard can it be to hit a 10m x 10m area with a mortar from 75m away. at some point he also got a tank and killed two of my guys with it, but as soon as he tried to move forward, one of the guys he had just shot in the forehead, woke up and threw a granade at the front plate of the tank. somehow this made the tank explode just like my new mix tape. the match ended when i got a tank and butt♥♥♥♥ed them with the cannon so deep, you could see the muzzle peaking out of their mouths. he kept screaming in the chat something about ""nazi tanks"" and ""op"" while i was doing this. overall i would give this game a 4/5. just dont expect to play the singleplayer like at all.

												This game may not be noob friendly, but it sure is fun! Especially with the editor.Any veteran of RTS games is going to find himself just fine, at least in terms of controls and main gameplay features. Diffrences between MoW and its more arcade counterpart *cough* CoH *cough* are quite huge, but the biggest two are realism level and gamemode types. To be fair they are two completly diffrent games. You shouldn't just rush with a T-34 and expect to stay alive thanks to your high healthbar, you have to be carefull at all time, because even an Panzer II can wreck your tank in matters of seconds, if it gets you from the rear.Infantry dies at least 10 times faster and easier than in CoH, it also is 10 times more effective and dangerous. Arty is OP.As far as gameplay goes, there is no base building and unit production, most of the time you have limited resources or you can call units from out of the map, it depends from a gamemode.Graphics are mostly good, there is not much to talk about. Physic engine is great and destruction is top tier.  Optimisation is just brilliant.I strongly recommend this game to any fan of WW2 games and RTS fans. There is also a huge database of mods to choose from, extra nations, even more increased realism, and you can even turn it into a modern RTS with just one mod. 9/10 - Still not perfect.			"

												I think most people will like this game if it is their first, second, or even third time playing Men of War. I'm just bored with the format: how tanks blow up, how infantry move, the sound, just it all. The thing that makes Men of War such a great series is what I don't like about it. I'd like it if the devs made a new game. Something with a new feel.			"

												The game is very fun.  The graphics are pretty decent and you can see substantially further on the map as compared to Company of Heroes 2.  It takes awhile to learn the game and get proficient at it, but it is worth the time.Items that could be improved include:-The AT grenades are far too overpowered.  They tend to do more damage to tanks than AT guns and other tanks.  An AT grenade in this game can destroy a heavy tank after the tank has taken numerous shots from AT guns or other tanks.  It is frustrating to lose a tank to an AT grenade in this game.  Not to mention that it is very unrealistic that standard infantry carry around heavy AT grenades and are able to run through fields and throw them onto a tank without getting mowed down first.  It is one thing to have a special unit that carries AT grenades but this game puts them on standard infantry.  That part is pretty ridiculous but the rest of the game is quite good.-Wish there were more players playing multiplayer.  Sometimes it takes awhile to get a game going.-The AT guns appear to be quite underpowered.  A tank can generally shoot accross the field and take out the AT gun while the AT gun is shooting the tank.  This is a minor issue as you can avoid it by ordering tanks and other items rather than AT guns. "

												Listen, I saw people playing this game on youtube, so being the young child I am, I downloaded it.  However once the download finished, and I lanched the game.  What happened after made me regret ever buying the game.  I got a black screen....but I could hear the game music in the back round, and I saw the custom curser, and I could even move it.  The game was not crashing and it was responding.  After word I had to kill the task to close the screen.  I tried changing the version, unistaling then reinstaling the game, and even looked at the forms for help, but nothing is working.  My computer is farily new, so it should not have a problem taking care of the game.  Please some one help me because I like how the game looked on youtube, and want to play it my self, or is tere a way to get my money back.  Thanks for reading my really long Message.:steamsad:			"

												I bought this game after really enjoying the original Assault Squad. After playing it for a bit I realized that the single player missions are the same ones that were in Assault Squad, there really doesn't seem to be any difference between the two games single player campaigns.If you've never played Assault Squad it's pretty good but without new single player missions I don't think this game deserves to be called ""Assault Squad 2"". Perhaps ""Assault Squad Remastered"" or something else would have been more fitting because it seems to be the exact same game as Assault Squad as far as I can tell.			"

												If you bought this just because of the workshop mods that you can install and play it. Don't bother buying this game. Get the first one, this one basically is just a scam and a waste of time..when i tried to install some mods it keep on giving me errors and other then that downloading mods is the only thing you can do in this game, just download and play mods if not this game is just a scam..they just want your money to make more scam games,all this missons are same fron the first one and i cant even play the mods that i want to...srs freaking wasted $29.00 sgd on this game.plus this game is not even worth $29 its suppose to be free its just a add-on no changes accept for the graphics and the controlls other then that every thing is just add-on. i give this game a thumbs down...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. GET THE FIRST ON INSTEAD AND REMEMBER THEY     JUST      WANT      YOUR       MONEY!!!!			"

												This game has now become funner in the world of mutilpayer with all that you can do in it due to the update, but in a sense i wish there were more single player missions to do instead of the same maps as before in AS 1. Another thing is that it allows you to record video while playing but i have yet been able to figure out how to wtch them after playing. All in all this game is alot better and funner to play now all we need now is more single player maps to play with friends. One more thing there is a bug that comes up every now and then that will crash the game but its still fun. Thumbs up for this game! enjoy!			"

Note, however, that the singleplayer in this game is not the greatest, but with the steam workshop compatibility that can and will quickly change.

												This game is great. It give a more realistic view of the war than other games and is really fun to play. Having the different types of infantry, tanks, planes, landing craft and much other support weapons is great in a game like this one. RTS games are one of my favourite so throwing in action and WW2 made this game 10 times better in my eyes. Well done on the game. The people who create MODs for this game a big well done to you aswell because if we didn't have you the game would eventually get repetitive and boring. Overall this is a great game and it's worth the £20 I spent for it			"

 Men of War: Assault Squad 2 REVIEW Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is the near identical sequel to Men of War: Assault Squad with many minor changes.If you have played a Men of War game before then you would know how it plays out. Lots of micromanagement. Can get annoying and frustrating at times with placement of units, supplying units with ammunition, etc. Typical Men of War fun. There are lots of tanks, cars, artillery, weapons and other stuff. The game also has realistic armour penetration (don't trust me on this - I am no expert!) for vehicles. The games graphics are identical to the previous titles apart from a few new minor graphical options. The A.I. is still also the same which is running around the battlefield in a endless search & destroy of you. Kinda mindless A.I. but they can pull a few tricks from it's sleeve sometimes. They are better at suicide charges or static defences.There are four factions just like the previous games: Japan, Commonwealth, Germany and USA.Still has the absolutely beautiful destruction physics from the previous games - So satisfying to see buildings crumble in so many different ways. Comes with a level editor. Overall I don't recommend this game if you own previous titles because I just feel like this is the same game with only minor changes. Get it when it's like 50% off or something.Score: 5/10 - Not worth the $30 I spent.			"

												To be honest, the game was indeed very well crafted. Graphics, gameplay, historical accuracy you named it. However, the viewing angles and camera movement were so annoying and that ruins the whole game. I saw potential in this one, but to pay for a DLC that contains third-person mode(that should be in the base game)just doesn't make sense for me.			"

												First off I'm just going to say that I love this game! It's very fun. I've mainly just played the editor which comes with the game for free! The editor is extremly fun, from making maps to just creating huge battles. Also you can download mods from the ""steam workshop"" or ""moddb"". There are loads of great mods either coming out or already out. There is a Star Wars mod coming out hopefuly soon and there is a Born in the Fire mod out now but the mod is made by russians so it's not in english yet. It's on the steam workshop to play once the game is installed! Definetly buy this game if you're into RTS games, this is one of the best!			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 (although quite fun and challenging) is an unfurbished experience. First of all, I'll start with my main gripe with this game, which is the terrible A.I. My soldiers would make the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing mistakes regularly, they would stop running to cover to shoot at a tank (thus getting blown up), randomly drop to the ground in danger (making them get killed), not fire from buildings when the target is clear from the window (making them get shot and killed) and they would always stop at a certain distance from the spawn once they enter the fray (letting their comrades in the front get killed). The only thing that I like in this game is the immense scale. Unlike the other rts ww2 game I have in my library (something company?) this lacks any sort of unit cap, letting you control hundreds of units at once. In short, this game is a flawed mess. Buyer beware.			"

												I played this game for hours even days but most of that time was spent on community made maps which are hard to find and annoying to search for. The Developers bascly made the same game as men of war assault squad 1 but this one has work shop. but frankly i think the devs are lazy its there job to make a intresting game but in the campaighn for all the different countrys its basicly the same layout and or the same sense of the map and the same layout seriously you made to games with basicly the same mission over and over and the defense missions are the same they stink you didnt even add anything to the bonus mission you could have made a d- day map or something. No offense to the devs but stop making the same thing you are also doing the samething with men of war orgins. This game has great potential and can be awsome if the devs put more work into the missions I you see the community workshop there are a ton of missions which are awsome and if the devs tryed to make a actuall mission it could be amazing. personal note to the devs im a huge fan of your games and you could do amazing things with men of war but you need to put in the effort			"

												In general use, herbs are any plants used for food, flavoring, medicine, or fragrances for their savory or aromatic properties. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. Herbs refer to the leafy green or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while spices are produced from other parts of the plant (usually dried), including seeds, berries, bark, roots and fruits.In botanical English, the word ""herb"" is also used as a synonym of ""herbaceous plant"".

												My favourite RTS game.The micromanagement, the ability  to control every single soldier individually, being able to repair and capture enemy vehicles.You can for example switch the MG42 on the motorcycle with a .50 cal machine gun.Leveling a city with the ground using tanks, artillery and explosives is fun. (and interesting to see how the battlefield changes)Equipping a rifleman with a big machine gun from a destroyed tank and individually controlling him in 3rd person and killing squad after squad of counter attacking enemy forces is really satisfying!The freedom and things you can do in this game is amazing!This game is not like the rest, and worlds apart from the unhistorical and dull Company of heroes.

												Men of War Assault Squad 2 has some interesting concepts compaired to something like, Company of heroes 1 or 2. That tanks healthbars have been replaced with a armor penetration system. Soldiers can't run in the open in front of a machine gun without dying. The game has a direct control feature for soldiers and vehicles that allows you to aim and move that person or vehicle.The games UI and Pathmaking has some problems. This shines the most in close quarter combat with infantry. The game also has a strong modsupport to spice up the game even more.All in all this game is a bit advanced for the new player, but besides that and a few minor issues, it's great			"

												My favourite RTS game.The micromanagement, the ability  to control every single soldier individually, being able to repair and capture enemy vehicles.You can for example switch the MG42 on the motorcycle with a .50 cal machine gun.Leveling a city with the ground using tanks, artillery and explosives is fun. (and interesting to see how the battlefield changes)Equipping a rifleman with a big machine gun from a destroyed tank and individually controlling him in 3rd person and killing squad after squad of counter attacking enemy forces is really satisfying!The freedom and things you can do in this game is amazing!This game is not like the rest, and worlds apart from the unhistorical and dull Company of heroes.

												Words cant explain how fun this game is! I find it really funny how all the bad reviews made is from people who has less than 2 hours of playtime and since they dont put the time in to get better they have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ experiance. (this game is like punching a brick wall, at first its very frustrating and hard but once you get through the layer of brick its very enjoyable) So my advice is to not listen to anyone's review who has less than 60 hours on record.

												I greatly enjoy playing MOWAS2! I love these kinds of games, and even the small features are game changing to me! I feel I'm the only one who actually pays attention to the names, but it's a cool little feature. I own all of the MOW games, and by far, this and MOWAS1 are my favourites. The battles, the mods, which add cool new skins/models/etc are amazing. I defininetly recommend this game to anyone who likes modding, WW2, and RTS.			"

												ProsI have about 20 hours, on/offline playing MoWAS2. There's a learning curve equal to the number of individual players you control, however, am thinking this may be the best game yet, for me. I did not have first game so no disappointments over refreshed previous games. My machine is getting on in years but MoWAS2 plays great - even if I am defeated a great deal. Very challenging and No Thanks to cheat codes (so far).Former best games for me since created were Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Prypriat (after years playing still have hard time spelling it but loved playing it on all levels to master) soso about Clear Sky.  Love MoWAS2 ... very challenging and very intense, alikened to herding 60 cats through a fish factory. Let your guard down for an instant, even at 90% accomplished and truly massive enemy counterattacks can overwhelm and defeat you, so remain focused on the V for Victory symbol and Objectives. Also great idea others wrote, (Thanks) PAUSE game at beginning to scan all terrain - this intel usually makes a difference to outcomes.ConsOnly con is finding a gaming manual or online written heirachy explaining various armor and soldiers features.

												Great game, facinating scenarios (both in vanilla, dlc, and workshop content), more gritty and realistic than Company of Heroes. Scavenge for weapons, ammo and grenades, sneak up on enemy troops and drop them with throwing knives or silenced weapons, snipe the commander off of a tank's cupola mounted MG, direct artillery to pound entrenched enemies or hidden field guns, track a deadly tank destroyer so you can flank it, repair your own tanks damaged main gun so you can bring it back into the fight. syphon fuel out of derelict vehicles to keep your machines running, detect mines, lay down barbed wire, chuck a bundle of dynamite into a building the enemy has dug into to level it, cover your squads and vehicles advances and retreats with smoke grenades.... there is SO much you can do, it will keep you coming back for more. Every replay is different.			"

												I have played Men Of War since the first release and Faces Of War alongside heroes of world war 2 and to be honest this is a complete disappointing remake of old crap they didn't include in other games. They basically spent the time adding more units which should of been in the first games. Same missions for each faction and same objectives and map layout just different skins and poor voiceovers. The devs really are pushing money on this series to make other games by promising new exciting additions which are pointless and should be part of the game initially anyways. Multiplayer.... full of people who spend all day hiding tanks in the corner of the map to gain brownie points to look good on the rankking system, a bit like call of duty boosting to be quite frank. I wonder when Men Of War 3 will be out, another assault squad remake of the first game which is technically the second but will be the third???I actually managed to work my way up in emails through the company of the creators person by person I got to the top....who didnt reply....This game was good until after the first one....maybe they should of stopped there?

The constant barrage of bugs is simply too much, from units somehow dying on their own to them getting stuck and constantly needing to issue new orders or very often even having to take the controls yourself to guide them out, the campaign is a joke, its just the same missions for each faction packaged a little different, without mods the game would die, and sometimes it does, when useless updates are issued, making you have to wait for the mods to also be updated.

												Even though I haven't played much, I think I have seen enough of the game to give an honest review. The graphics are pretty good, the destructibility can be impressive, there are a ton of missions and maps and they seem to be well designed, all of the major factions from WW2 are available to play with, and there is a vast range of vehicles and equipment available to the player. The only problems I would say is the controls, AI, and bugs. There are a ton of controls, some of which are a little wonky like the unit movement function, but I guess it comes with the fact that there are so many functions to use in game. The more serious problem is the AI. The AI don't even respond to your commands half the time, and they sometimes won't respond to an enemy that is shooting at you from literally 5 ft away. And sometimes one of your men will move to a different position without your command. This is particularly a problem in trenches, where sometimes one of your men will jump out of your trench without your command. And the bugs can be irritating at times, like the occasional crashing and framerate problems. Overall, I don't think it's worth the full price just because of the AI and bugs I mentioned above, but on a sale I would recommend getting the complete edition.			"

												Multiplayer needs a lot of work. Disconnections, nost games do not work at all, much functionality in the menus is broken, if someone leaves someone else can't join and take their place (not in the mode I was in anyway), and overall a confusing and fustrating multiplayer experience. As multiplayer sucks and I will only use singleplayer, I think I'll skip out on ""legitimately"" paying/playing now the free weeekend is over.May I add that the lack of documentation is also bad, and a ""tutorial"" (it isn't but it suggests it is) is hidden away under the last mission in the list; you'd expect it to be the first.

												The core concept of the game is really good, but it is executed poorly. The constant barrage of bugs is simply too much, from units somehow dying on their own to them getting stuck and constantly needing to issue new orders or very often even having to take the controls yourself to guide them out, the campaign is a joke, its just the same missions for each faction packaged a little different, without mods the game would die, and sometimes it does, when useless updates are issued, making you have to wait for the mods to also be updated.

												Well, I played Men of War about 4 years ago. During a free weekend I decided to try out this to see how game was developed. And sadly I found it hard to spot a lot of differences. It was fun some time ago, but in 2014 it becomes a bit obsolete =DWill play Company of Heroes 2 instead :P			"

												Serious improvement in single-player land if you use Windows 10 64bit.You might want to turn down shadows and special effects (shadows still give your system a beating and effects (explosion and such) give me hiccups).But all in all, I'm playing @ maxed settings (exept those 2).If you are a fan of squad level RTS, without basebuilding in a WW2 settings, I can surely recommend this.Best in it's genreToday, 22-6-2016 (06/22/2016), another 1GB patch was delivered.That is some support!

												So i bought the first game, and as much as i wanted to like it, it was a frustrating game to play. It seemed unbalanced, reloading of weapons was a pain, ai was very stupid. The idea was there but execution was poor.So i have been hovering for an age looking into this title, seeing if they fixed the problems i found so annoying in the first. The other day i couldnt resist so i bought it. For me its changed this game into a fun addictive ww2 strategy sim. I absolutly love it now. All those issues above seemed to be fixed, i can play on normal ai without getting squads of tanks sent at me. I had agreat round with the AI at ""overlord"" the battle, back n forth waged for hours. Relaoding is miles easier,, Ai squad, while not 100% perfect behave much better, now they will toss back grenades, or even use them efficiently. Its a great game, although what at a glance doesnt seem much different for me is a better polished version of the first. Maybe it doesnt deserve its own title but more of an upgrade. Find it cheaper than a tenner then go for itMay favorite ww2  tactical rts without the base building.COH who?8/10			"
