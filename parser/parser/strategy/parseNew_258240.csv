												Lots of potential, but it was rushed out the door pre-beta to get it on the virtual shelves by Christmas. So we got to beta test it, only to find the devs stopped fixing bugs around February. Some are real show stoppers, some are just annoying; visit the forums if you want to see a few pages' worth. I should point out there is absolutely no realism here; it's a toy, nothing more. Modding might be able to breathe some life into it, but at this point it's obvious they've washed their hands of it.			"

												The game is pretty good, but has some issues. Looks like it was rushed into release with all that it brings. Technical issues (seems like the game suffers from a memory leaks, as it started to lag/freeze and act unresponsive after an hour or so into playthrough) and poor AI being the most critical. Some gameplay mechanics and GUI are also not thought through well enough. On the bright side - game looks really well, nice GUI and unit textures, maps look great, game is really appealing visually. It also has some interesting gameplay mechanics, like carriers, naval warfare, supplies.The game is certainly good, but it could use some additional 3-4 months of polishing and debugging.			"

												The concept is excellent. reminds me of panzer general. But the implementation is horrible. The game play is not smooth. The map, tooltips and unit info are more irritating than useful. The map scrolling leaves much to be desired. When I end my trun the game some times refuses to let me issue any orders to my units. The mission objectives and tutorials are not clear (possibably a bad translation). Several images are still in german. The number of unit types available and the unit balance is very poor. Come on people made a better version of this game in 1994! seriously do not waste your money, download panzer general (its abandonware) and run it off dosbox. You will find all that this game has to offer there and more.			"

												I rarely play titles like these, i have dabbled with XCOM and i was pleased with that.Of course Tank Operations is not in the same league as XCOM and any other high budget Turn Based Strategy, the strategic style of play is certainly there, and with an addictive nature indeed.Once you start playing the game you forget the retro art style and the old school nostalgia this title gives you, and suddenly find yourself thinking ""did that really take that long?"" resulting in ""DAMN i burnt the Chicken!"" Suffice to say, I’m happy being hooked to an addictive game, not many games have such a simple and essential ability to be addictive "

												In the days of WW2 the combined allied forces faced off against a ruthless foe. A force which sent dozen of allied units to the gates of Hades with little effort. Battalions of tanks, squadrons of aircraft, sqauds of infantry and fleets of ships were all reduced to rubble. An enemy created by the gods to leave nothing but chaos, madness and destruction behind. A force which knew no mercy, showed no mercy and expected none in return. What is this force you ask? Game Balance...On the surface, Tank Operations: European Campaign may seem like a decent turn base RTS game set in WW2. It is not until you actually start playing the game that you find that things are wrong.. very wrong.Plot is cliche and nothing you haven't seen before. You play as the American forces during World War 2, sent to the European front to defeat the Nazi occupied Europe.Gameplay is unbalanced. In the campaign, you start of with a few starting units. You can build new units such as infantry, tanks, aircraft which will become useable next turn. As a turn base game, your units have limited 'moves' each turn. You can create new units like infantry, tanks, aircraft etc via buildings or ships. Some units also have special abilities (which need recharging afterwards) such as improving sight or damge. One of the my biggest gripes (as mentioned previously) is balance, which is shown by the fact that your units do pittiful damage, compared to enemy forces. To demonstrate this, in the first mission I had a two fleets of ships. I sent my landing force composed of tanks and infantry into the beach head. I immediately targeted the coastal guns to help defend my navy. My units did abissmal damage to the gun, but I thought it would be ok after I shot at it with my ships. After doing the later and ending my turn, the coastal gun (which somehow managed to survive 3 tank shots, 1 infantry attack and shots from 3 of my battleships) regained most of it's health (WHY!@!) and it along with a handful of tanks and infantry managed to decimate my force. By mid way I had lost most my ground forces, my aircraft badly needed repairs and my navy were being blown up to smitherines. Yet, I still was unable to eliminate a SINGLE coastal gun. This was honestly quite frustrating and made playing a chore rather than being fun.Sound is decent, if mediocre. Weapons (ie. tank, ships, aircraft fire) sound decent, but nothing special. Music is forgettable. Voice acting is quite poor.Graphics arent that great. I personally don't mind the artstyle in these kind of games. However, the lack of animations (while moving) is quite cheap.If you are looking for a fun, challenging and FAIR game, look elsewhere.  "

												This is deep strategy with an eye for detail. In a lot of ways it's like a turn-based RUSE, but with much more realism and time to think. I have read a lot of negative reviews that say the game is too hard. Oh, poor babies! You think invading Axis Europe was easy? Hell no! So you can't take out the shore batteriess with ships or artillery? Maybe that's exactly what they were desiogned to resist! Oh no! What ever will we do? How about you use your dive bombers? Now there's an idea! This is exactly what makes the game great! You absolutely HAVE to rule the skies before even attempting a land-based advance. My only real criticisms are:  management of your aircraft squadrons is a bit messy, and generally a warning needs to be displayed if aircraft are low on fuel. Also, There needs to be a warning that tells you if you have forgotton to move and fire with any unit when you press 'next turn'.There has been a lot of talk about the following exploit: You can send in one unit followed by a group of ten, attack the enem,y with the lone unit and lose it to their counter attack. Then you can defeat the enemy unit with your ten and recieve no counter-attack. This is not a massive problem, but it xcould be fixed by allowing units infinite counter-attacks (ammo permitting), with exponentially decreasing effectiveness.Peoiple that are having trouble with operation Torch should think themselves lucky they are not trying to invade mainland Italy. Wow. Once you crack it, though, it's very reqarding. This game is a 'just one more turn' epic that will devour weeks of your life. Well worth every cent!			"

												I have played this offline so it will not show right amount of time played.The game itself is not bad but it is hard and unfair. For example: You must keep your veichles with fuel and ammo and to do that you must have fuel and ammo trucks wich is easy picking for the enemy. This  idea was most certain good on paper but in game its just painfull anoying. And one more thing your bombers must return to base after each bombing run but germans can bomb 2-3 times, how is this fairplay?In some turns you cant see what hit your tanks? They just explode maybe hit from a tank far away? An animation showing wich tank who hit you would be most welcome feature.GFx 6-10 (The gfx is not bad but some animation wouldnt hurt for the eyes.)SFx 6-10 (The sound is ok but some more ambient music would make it more enjoyable)Gameplay 5-10 (The game starts out way to hard. There is no option for easy, medium gameplay wich is sad)The game is Is not bad just plain HARD.To developer. Add EASY MODE for us casual players who want to enjoy a turnbased ww2 strategy game now and then. The game is not bad but way to HARD to be enjoyable in the longterm. Easy could be drop out the need to re-fuel or resuply ammo. And if possible make enemy a little bit less deadly?			"

												I like the concept. It's an exciting, challenging strategy game, really able to tie the fans of the genre. But is not yet finished!!! Gets slow and/or freezes all the time. I can't get through the 4th mission, because it freezes every time when about only 2 rounds for me to win. So i'm really looking forward to some patches and updates, but till then it's not worth to pay for it. Unless you want to annoy yourself beyond all limits.. And additionally, big black dot for the lack of multiplayer possibilities! I don't even understand, what they thought to publish this game in this state. Finish it!!!			"

												I will play pretty much any WW2 game on the market.  This...is not one of the better ones.There are a lot of reviewers saying that the game is unbalanced, and a couple saying ""oh, you're just using the wrong units!""  Having spent two hours and plenty of experimentation on the first mission thus far, I can tell you - it's not the units, it's the balance.  My biggest issue with the game is actually the extreme lethality - you're annihilating the enemy's units every turn, but they're also annihilating yours, and it's mostly a matter of who can spawn more fresh units onto the field faster.  So it gets very grindy, very quickly, as you build a mess of new stacks, hurl them at the enemy's airbase (which is apparently located in a bunker, as opposed to the nice neat (and more accurate) mechanic of Panzer Corps where you roll a tank in and capture it), do a little damage, wipe out the enemy nearby, get wiped out by their counter-attack, lather, rinse, repeat.Because of this, you have no real incentive to preserve your own units - knowing that the next force to come over the hill is likely to blow them away anyway - so you just sort of fling them around mindlessly.  Manage supply lines?  No need, no one's lasting that long anyway!  Which sort of defeats the purpose of a strategy game.Maybe if it were getting more polish, or if there weren't so many better options on the market.  But it's sitting in a genre that's already saturated with good titles.  No reason to pick this one up.			"

												Skip it folks. Seriously, stay away.Tank Operations: European Campaign had potential but the developers never followed through. It looks like Panzer General and I love PG. It plays like a piece of junk and I don't love it. Why? There are a host of poor game mechanics that just are mind bogglingly dumb like ships that don't move and a lousy supply system. German units are overpowered because they'll keep spawning forever. Pathing is really poor. Crash bugs. You only play as the Allies. The List Of Bad Things goes on and on. Not to mention that it was essentially dumped on Steam and the devs vanished. There is truly nothing redeeming about this game and that's a strong statement. It's not the worst game in my 200+ Steam library, but it's one of the bottom 20. There are a host of games that do the ole' Panzer General thing much better than this one. If you want one, go spend the money on Order of Battle: Pacific which is the best wargame in years. Yes, it's a lot more money than this but you're going to get what you pay for. In this game, you're more likely to find frustration than fun, boredom than brilliance. Keep your money in your pocket and don't reward developers who throw buggy, unbalanced games on Steam and then don't update them.			"

They are the strongest land unit.But its still a good Game, had no crashes or bugs at any time.If you are new in this kind of games, its ok.

												A simple turned based strategy game. The game play is rather addictive and is fun. If you are looking for complex micromanagement and real time strategy then this is not the game for you. In the missions you recieve a monetary income per turn which you use to buy land and air units at your bases. You overcome your enemies, who also reinforce, and knock out their command points and bases. Ammo and fuel is limited, so you will need to use supply trucks and return your planes to airstrips in order to refuel and rearm your units.Gametime is not reflective of offline play - 8 hours at time of review.

I have spent hours trying to get past Operation Torch but all I end up doing is losing the battle ships and crusiers.  You cannot move the naval units so they are sitting ducks for powerful artillary bunkers that are nearly impossible to destroy.  In the first scenario if you land an artillary unit or fuel or ammo truck the Axis bunkers with extreme range immedialtey kill it.  The infanty are very weak and die quickly.  And to top that off the game runs so slow.  I don't have trouble with speed of any other steam game I own but this one moves like molasses.SAve your money and buy something else.  I may come back to it if they ever tone it down so you actually have a shot of winning. "

All those critical hits on the bunkers hardly did any damage, but they sure do sink your ships fast and you can't move those. And once the money is gone that's it, you don't get anymore. Game crashed on the third tutorial mission, that's never a good sign.Games are supposed to be fun, this game is anything but fun.Glad I got this POS game in a bundle and didn't waste that much money on it.

If one reads the history of this operation, there was some resistance put up by the Vichy forces but nothing like what I have seen in the scenario.  Also, why can't the ships be moved?  They are too vulnerable to the shore batteries and should be able to be moved farther away for protection.   Another thing that has me concerned is that the description of the Mark III tank is ""heavy"" which is not true.  The Grant tank had a larger gun than the MK III in 1942, especially in this theater of war.  Overall, the gameplay seems interesting and I'll continue to play.  Afterall, it was less than $10.			"

												Decent turned based strategy game.  Needs a bit of fine tunning, but still good.If you ever played Panzer General way back it's kind of like that.			"

												Tank Operations: European Command is one of the greatest strategy tank games I've played in the last 5 years or so. Keep in mind, the title is a bit of a lier, it isn't just tanks, it's planes. ships, infantry, tank destroyers, fuelers, etc. etc. etc. It has great effects and feels really clean and nice. For the love of god, buy it.			"

												A solid game depending on your style.   Very Panzer General like but stands out with it's own gameplay elements.   Movement and Resupply are elements I felt detracted from gameplay, but others may like the extra planning considerations when it comes to protecting and keeping ammo and fuel nearby.  Killer was the resloution.  I couldn't read dialogue boxes without 1.5x magnifier.  Nearsighted folks will have no problem though.I liked it, and add a little for the nostalgic feel, but didn't love it.  A touch clunky for me in the end.			"

												An interesting take on WW2 Combat, music is atrocious ""Sounds like Elevator Music"" and we have M1 combat cars in Tunisia on the front lines, wtf?  Also apparently tanks can shoot over mountains, who knew. Sad because the animation, landscape and A.I is quite good, and the game is even entertaining to a degree. Sorry, there are just far too many superiorturn based ""WW2"" strategy games on the market right now. If you've already played Panzer Corps, Order of Battle Pacific, Panzer General and others than perhaps pick this one up for a cute playthrough. 6/10 I recommend buying the game on sale. Its not the greatest WW2 TBS, but it can be entertaining.

												The game looks in the beging not that much fun and quite hard, but when you learn a little about it, you discover that you have to use a lot of strategie to defeact the game and have a lot of fun planning your next moves and best actions. Unfortanely, there are some bugs quite annoying, but when you get used to then you learn how to avoid them and make the best of the game.I really recommend it if you really are looking for some good straregy game.

												A real bad clone of Panzer General with some lacking mechanics (infantry does REALLY ridiculous amount of damages against fortifications even by attacking in the back, meaning that a close assault is not count by the game). The developpers need to open a history book, the main enemy forces in the first mission of this game (Operation Torch) are germans with marders and so on... The fact is that in this historic operation the enemy forces was essientially Vichy's french army with puny fortifications, quite falters to fight back against the Allies. Pity...I delete the game after several minutes of play...  Not worth the time.			"

												Not sure why this one's getting such a lot of negative reviews. I've just spent 10 very engaging, nail-biting hours on the first scenario and am enjoying the game. Just bear in mind that it's not Combat Mission. If you can overlook inaccuracies relating to history and equipment, there's an absorbing experience to be had. The need for supplying units - both with fuel and ammo - does force you into taking a thoughtful approach (assuming you want to win) and the combined use of air and ground forces is essential as well as satisfying. On a technical note, it works fine on my Windows 8 machine.			"

												i never thought a game could be as bad as this stinker is, never thought it could be pulled off but these developers managed to do this, you have to actually TRY HARD to make a game so awful this game is unplayable nothing works this game is garbage and not worth a single penny don't even waste your time with this piece of junk of a game i tried the tutorial but i could not do anything i was supposed to. how are you supposed to play a game when the TUTORIAL doesn't even work, that is how BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD this game is.  i have played some pretty awful games in my time but this one takes the cake absolutely hands down			"

												After a few hours and playing to the 3rd sinrio it was all fun and chalanging until the saved file consistantly crashes every time you try to fire it up. You have to save at the end of every turn because it crashes a LOT when ending your turn! Half way through the 3rd level when you reload the game after saving and ending the turn It crashes. The game loads fine again. You can  make moves but as soon as you end your turn it crashes every time. It's a fun game when it desides to work but these are game killing bugs. I can't recomend it.i5 gtx980 32Gb			"
