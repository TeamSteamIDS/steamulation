												It's a 2D Worms game but with a 3D engine, unlike previous Worm games in the past ,objects you see sticking out of the terrain in a map now have physics properties, they can bounc around,crush other worms,explodes,emit poison gas or even throw water around and there's now a seperate water in the game that also has some very nice looking physics to it when it moves around, this water doesn't instant kill your worms like the regular water at the bottom of the map but instead drains 1-3 HP per turn if a worm is submerged in it and everything in it moves slower (both worms and projectiles).There's also now classes in the game, Scout,Heavy and Scientists (+ the normal worm).Heavy is the slowest but can take the most abuseScout is the fastest,has the highest jumps and can perform some crazy maneuvers while walking thru terrain buuut has the lowest HP and dies the fastestThe Scientist is pretty much a healer, each turn he heals  5hp and that's about it.However if you don't wanna play with these new classes you can just simply play the Classic mode where every worm is a regular worm like in the older games.That's pretty much it, everything else is the same, It's the Worms game we all know and love since the 90's.Only major complaint i have, there's a big lack of enviroments, all you have is Beach,Sewers,Horror and a 4th one which i can't remember the name of atm, while in older Worms games you usully had at least 6 to 10 (sometimes more) enviroments for a map to keep things abit more esteticly different each time.Bottom line, it's still Worms but with a new makeover and some new fun things added it. Totally worth picking up during a nice sale and playing a few matches with your friends either via the internet or on a single computer.			"

												I need to start from history to figure out if its a good game or not.Im a big fun of worms since WORMS 1- WORMS 1 & 2The first and Armageddon was crazy fun! You never can predict what will going on. Those tiny little worms , stuck in pixels and dies like a water drops. With a dozen fun weapons. ps: there was also a upgraded version of Armageddon ITS FUN!- WORMS 3D (all other versions)Its was something new, still fun but not in the same way. (if it was in 2015 , it would be a good game after years of polishing). For me it was special, not like before... but i played it cause i like worms. I loved a big big high platforms and unpredictable shooting.- WORMS RevolutionThey tried to restore a Armageddon fun and they kinda made it! Thanks TEAM17Pros:- Cool polished graphics- If you pass a single mode, you are the master.- Fun- Challenges- Every time i play worms with friend, even with skills you never know who will win.Cons- THE TIME of calculation of a AI is too LONG!- THE AI is too predictable and really mathematically aiming (that is not fun)- The water is not a water; its gelatin- Many weapons are gone- Not a full destructible area (in old worms it was something that i loved to do , hit a Aliluia grenade and it will blow a half of the level with several mini impacts, but here is not the same)- No one never is online, poor multi player.- Cant play single player maps with my friends..VERDICT: If you need a challenge try WORMSif you love UNPREDICTABLE moments, try WORMS.If you never played WORMS, you must try WORMS.

												After a string of rehashes, Team17 has done a fantastic job updating the series while keeping the core gameplay the same. With a polished presentation, attractive visuals and improved level design, we finally have a Worms game that doesn't feel like it emerged from a '90s time-capsule. The series remains as polarizing as ever, but those who enjoy the zany antics of the series will dig Worms Revolution.There's no revolution in this new installment of Team 17's beloved franchise, but tons of fun and crazy gadgets. New features need a good improvement if they are meant to stick around, but single and multiplayer contents will make fans happy for a bit.Worms Revolution is as good as the franchise has ever been.

Definitely yes. As a long term Worms fan , I waited so long for a 2D release. ( 3D version were fun too, especially Mayhem and Forts ).Fantastic game to play with a friends , be it local or online. Graphic is amazing. I love background map effects, where everything moves and feels more alive. Addition of a narrator is damn sweet too. I really like him, makes the singleplayer campaign a lot more enjoyable.Also I liked the new Worms class system ( normal worm,heavy,scientist and scout ). Each one provides a different boosts/bonuses so you can customize your team as much as you like or you preffer. Add to this Worm customization stuff like cosmetics, voice,grave or dance.There is also a in-game shop so you can buy new weapons or supplies when you run out of ammo in your match. Of course first you need to find a coins on the map.About weapons. You will find the old ones but there are few new weapons , like protection shield , ufo , flamethrower etc. and newest addition of the ""Watery"" weapons. Yes Worms Revolution has a water physics , that means you can shoot a water from your water pistol, call a water bomb airstrike and drown your enemies. A perfect weapon to get rid of bunkering worms. It really adds some freshness to the game.Just too bad AI is kinda meh, they still stand like a artillery and noscope you with a bazookas and grenades 24/7. Despite having a inventory full of weapons.I haven't found any premade maps? Are there none? Only random maps are available? Thats sad too.			"

												This game is great to have four people sitting around one computer passing the controller. The game works well online aswell however I have not spent much time doing that. I found the single player campain to be boring and I have never finished it. I would not suggest getting this game if you are only planning on playing alone. As a multiplayer game I love it. I have spent way more than 21 hours (as the time played suggest) playing this game. Steam just dosen't track time played offline. One complaint I have is that the expansion packs should have really just come with the game to begin with. They add little to the game except fill out the weapon variety a bit. I do have all the expansions though. Fortunatly it is all resonably priced though. Despite those small complaints this is a great game to play with some friends. Well worth the price.			"

Each of them have their special abillity. Heavy are powerful but they move slowly. Scout are fast and jump high and long but are very weak. Scientist can heal but are weak too. Soldier are just Soldier. Epic 2D game with a lot of stuff.  A lot of weapons such as uzi, petrol bomb, water pistol(it splash you and if you too deep you lose 5 lifes every new turn) and of course Epic Holy  Hand Grenade there are too many items to count.  There are also some items that are not in Worms Mayhem. Such us Flamethrower you can use it for dig in or to attack enemie... Rate: 9.9/10.			"

												Worms Revolution is one of the best Worms games available today.I have been playing the Worms series since 1996, starting with Worms 1 on the Sega Saturn, so I am no stranger to this series.If YOU are new to this series, or curious about the new additions, you are basically controlling a team of 1-8 worms (depending on game settings) in a battle to the death with some of the craziest weapons ever.Weapons such as the Old Lady, Holy Hand Grenade, Super Sheep, Concrete Donkey, Bazooka,etc will be used as your team fights to the death in a turn-based battle with a time limit per turn and round.You also get to use a variety of utilities to move around the map such as a Ninja Rope, Jetpack, Teleport, etc.You have the option of making your own gamestyles with extensive customization settings, and this game also offers you the ability to make your own maps and play them online.Some new features for this version from other Worms series include dynamic water, new interactive physics objects, and new weapons and utilities. Yes, the rope behaves differently, (think bungee cord) but once you get used to this change you will not want to go back to the stiff rope of past worms versions. Now let's talk about system performance. Worms Revolution as you may of noticed, wants at least a dual core processor and a good video card. I have used a Pentium 4 3.60 Ghz in the past, and I was getting very playable framrates. A slow dual core seems to run this game very well paired with a good video card.Yes, there are bugs in this game involving the new physics objects, and possibly annoying aspects relating to controls, but they are mostly minor. Voice Chat works well.There is an active community online to this day, and adding friends to your friends list who play the game can help ensure full four player games often.There is A Solo Campaign you need to play to earn coins to buy new classes of Worms. Your scores will also be recorded on Steam Leaderboards. This game has classes for your worms that helps them specialize in certain situations, such as stronger attacks from a Heavy, quicker movements with a Scout, or stronger tools with Scientists.If you like the Worms series, or if this style of gameplay sounds even slightly interesting, I highly recommend you give this a look.

												If you like the good worms games of the past (the good 2-d ones, Armageddon, World Party, those DS ones), you'll like this too. People who have never played Worms games will find this a good place to jump in. It's the same old Worms 2-d turn based ""armor"" fighting game, but T17 have tried to add some new elements to a franchise which has been reusing mostly the same gameplay since the 90s, and you know what, it works. The games never felt like they needed more added, but it really had to be done to make a new worms game that felt fresh. And you know what, the new additions feel right and go along great with the classic worms gameplay. And that gameplay feels right this time. Reloaded didn't really have that right feel, but this one successfully combines new and old to make something great. The campaign even is the best that its been, still unnecessary, but entertaining. Everyone knows that the old fashioned skirmish is the best way to enjoy Worms.Overall, this game is a great way to spend a half hour in a explosive, strategic (I know, I know, but I'm a darksider), and now, very wet affair.

												I've been a big fan of Worms since Armageddon, and I was disappointed to discover that this game has almost none of the charm that I've come to love about the Worms series. This game feels like it's been given a big injection of Botox: bloated and shiny, but unnatural and excessive. The best part about Worms, in my opinion, was that you were free tomake it as fair or unfair as you wanted. The old school games had the perfect mix of control and chaos, making each game an unpredictable but fun mess. This game, with it's addition of worm ""classes"", needless excuses for DLC, and phoned-in humor makes it a chore to play. Gone is the zaniness and difficulty that makes me love Armageddon and World Party so much. Do yourself a favor and skip this game and go get Armageddon. You'll have a better time, trust me			"

												I remember playing Worms at a friend's place when it had just came out, and I had a lot of fun playing versus friends locally on just one PC.Playing Worms Revolution brought back some of those memories, however I ended up playing Worms Revolution mainly as a single player game. Some people say that Worms is a multiplayer game, and you're supposed to play it with other players, but I see nothing wrong with playing Worms solely for the single player campaign. If you do, just think of Worms as a sort of puzzle game, and you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Some of the missions were frustatingly difficult thanks to the incredibly accurate AI, but that just made completing them feel that much more rewarding.I played this game at the same time as I was playing Worms Clan Wars, and in my opinion Worms Revolution is by far the superior game. You can read my review of Worms Clan Wars here. I gave that game a negative review, not because I think it is a very bad game, but because this one is, in my opinion, so much better - and quite a bit cheaper as well.Here's a few of the pros of Worms Revolution:- The narrator (which is actually funny in this game, unlike that annoying woman in Worms Clan Wars)- Plenty of challenging missions- Interesting weapons (the only weapon that I missed was the Teleportation Gun from Clan Wars)- Water physicsI can't really think of any big cons. The new worm-classes (Soldier, Scientist, Scout, Heavy) were a nice addition, although not really necessary in my opinion. It can also be a bit hard to find people online, especially if you want to play  a ranked match.Still, I definitely recommend this game.→　If you are the type of person who cares about achievements, note that there are several multiplayer achievements in this game, which can be a bit troublesome to get.

												Well, it's worms. It's pretty much the same formula as worms back on the PS1 but with better graphics... I say better, it's just cartoony. Anyway, it's fine, the smack is kicking in and my flatmate and magical owl, Tim, is getting impatient because our Dominos is ready to be picked up. Long story short, it's an allegory for war and the existential crisis of human insignificance on a backdrop of clowny landscape with oddly satisfying water physics. Oh, and don't use the platform skill. It's war, not Sim city.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Whils this game for me has more flaws than benefits, here are the good things about Worms Revolution:New weapons, making the game even more interesting.New worm types, (although by far the best is scientist)Dynamic water, which adds a whole new concept to the game.Finally, it retains the good 2d look, but with 3d features which is great.Better physics.Better Graphics (although i dont really care about graphics)And here are the pitfalls:I'm still baffled as to why Team 17 have not made it so that you can use Antialiasing in this game on AMD graphics cards. (WTF???????).The game's 'random shooting into walls' concept that was rare in previous editions is very common now. I can work out whether the enemy worm is about to hit me using this:Grenade: Direct hitBazooka: Hit, but if a wall is in the way, it will hit the wallThe worms almost never use any other weapon.Whilst terrain editor is back (finally), it is a very simplified version of the old worms games.The ninja rope (whilst more realistic), is now almost useless for proper ninja-like stunts.It is quite expensive (although luckily i got it along with the Humble Bundle).Worm customization is not as varied as it was before. In particular, the voices of worms sound very similar, almost indistinguishable.Plus, instead of WORKING OUT how to do the puzzles and missions and thinking of tactics ON YOUR OWN, when you start the mission it SHOWS YOU HOW TO COMPLETE IT. WHY??!!!!?!??!??!?!?!!?Worms will always avoid crates.Verdict: a ok game, but many people who want a challenge would prefer older games like Worms Armageddon and Worms Open warfare 2.Rating: 5/10			"

Worms Revolution			* 8/10The battle Worms are back in shape... In 3d shape :)Worms Revolution Follows perfectly the classic gameplay from the canonicals Worms 2/Worms Armageddon, so you always have your worms team, side view, players actions are turn based and the purpose is always the same: annihilate the adversary's team XDOne of the most typical aspects of the game is obviously the arsenal for your worms, and together with the classic weapons from previous games there are some clever innovations involving physics, such as attracting-repelling magnets, jetpacks, sentry guns, Telekinesis and my favorites: water-based weapons!... Because worms DO drown... XDI've mentioned telekinesis because now there are various Giant items around the map you can interact with, by moving them or destroying them. You can imagine what happens by blowing up a huge bottle of water, or a stinky fish?Another good innovation is the new worm class system: beside the standard average worms you can choose 3 more classes, Heavy, Scout and Scientist, each one with their own advantages and disadvantages. Creating your own team with a setup involving a number of classes that suits your gameplay can improve your results in battle.And finally you can customize your soldiers with dumb props. There are hats, and items for every taste, and if they're not there it's simply because they must be unlocked by playing the single player missions.There's a single player campaign of course, split into simple battles and puzzles with ""objectives"". Nothing amazing, but at least they can improve the life of the game with some challenges.The worms AI is quite the same, they keep on using bazookas and grenades (the very basic weapons) with millimetric precision even from the very edge of the terrain. So... yes the real fun and challeng is in PvP modes, both online or local.The engine isn't the most impressive and relistic engine you can see but it does its job, and sometimes with some nice results (as with the water weapons behaviors). Sometimes the engine looks a bit demanding on resources, but I can't be sure, usually I'm too focused with my team battles XD+++PROS+++ GAMEPLAY. This chapter is based on the great Worms 2 and Armageddon, representing their best reincarnation, and it goes beyond improving past their limits, both in the weaponry, stage props, interaction and custmization. CLASSES. Honestly I didn't appreciate the class system at the beginning, but by practicing more with the game I've learnt to make good use of each class in different situations. CUSTOMIZATION. Now you can give your worms some dumb and unique look. This way becomes even more simple to distinguish your own team.---CONS--- ROPE. THEY RUINED IT!!!! No more ninja extreme missions... It works totally different and really awfully... AI. Well, the AI is quite the usual, so it kind of flattens the Single payer experience. Even though this game is almost meant to be played with friends "

												If you are a general fan of the Worms series, this game could possibly be of interest to you.- Super customisable. Dress your worms up, give them totems, arrange their funerals, let them speak. Design your own maps and terrain.- Online competitive modes and a large campaign which tests your skills is always appreciated.- New breeds of worms have been included, a feature that I particularly enjoyed! Your team now offers more in terms of specific roles for your Worms and requires a little more strategic organisation.- Continuous commentary throughout engages you, though personally I found this irritating, a little too 'dumbed-down' for my liking. Luckily this mainly exists through Adventure Mode, so not too bad otherwise.I can see the appeal to bring the series forward into the 3D era, unfortunately, this kills it a bit for me as a player of the original 2D side-scroller. Perhaps a little too reminiscent?In this case, the original Worms Armageddon feels to be the best, still, you can expect to get a lot of enjoyment from Worms Revolution.			"

												This isn't a perfect game by any means but it is still a lot of fun. I personally think that Worms: Armageddon is the best of all the Worms titles, and I think that Clan Wars is better than this one, but this is still good nonetheless. In Revolution, things are a bit different because there's 4 worm classes to pick from (which are unbalanced IMO) AND there is dynamic water that can move worms and slowly do damage over time. It really adds something to the traditional Worms formula. Clan Wars and Revolution are essentially the same game, only Clan Wars has less bugs, more content, larger maps, better UI and menus, a Clan System (that sucks and nobody uses anyway), etc. The thing that Revolution has over CW is overall aesthetic appeal. I find the terrain themes/backgrounds/music of Revolution much more interesting. If you're into turn-based strategy mixed with artillery games, Worms is where it's at. All of them are good in their own way, but I would definitely recommend W:A or CW over Rev. These games go on sale all of the time... you can also often find bundle sales where you can get everything for a cheap price. One thing that I will note is that the online multiplayer is kinda dead. You can still find games but you need to go to the game's hub and forums and add people there.  "

												One of my favorite weapons in previous Worms games, rope, is absolutely usless in this new sequel. This makes moving around terrain very difficult. Bot's aim's is perfect. They use bazooka and granate, and they make incredible shoots. When you play campaign, you have limited (25 sec) to move around and aim. While bot's are so good at sniping you that they don't need to move around. Multiple bomb bounces that bot's make is something human mind could not calculate in most cases, at all, even if you had 5 minutes of time. Or shooting straight in the air, getting bazooka rocked to fall down through 2 narrow holes that were drilled by bunker buster boomb. It's simply insane. This lead to a lot of quitting in rage on my behalf. For me fun has been taken out of this game in campaign part of game. Multiplayer is good as always. Playing with friends, there is only few games that can match this level of fun.Puzzles... some are insanely difficult.Of course when you play your custom settings where you can allow yourself more time for turn that can still be fun. Water bombs and water damage is new to me, i find it interesting. Overall, I'm not not that happy with the game. If you are player who played W.Armaggedon, consider trying demo before buying. I would not buy simply for the fact that they ruined use of rope.Positive is new type of worms, and some fun new weapons and utilities. Get to know all weapons and utilities first, then play this game. Play puzzles after tutorial, you will discover some interesting use of utility faster than if you go straight to multiplayer or campaign.			"

												I will try to be productive with my issues, here are a breakdown of what made me dislike this game:- The backgrounds are more detailed than the foreground, it is distracting and seems odd that the actual level is really low quality and rough looking, where the chickens in the background are blooming and softened.- The frame rate is poor, I am sure for people with good PCs it will be ok, but it should be more than OK... - The water is pointless, it serves no real point other than to add some gimicy items and weapons which just get in the way and offer very little to improve the game..- The rope physics are not as much fun as previous games, they are more realistic, but realism does not mean fun... when was the last time you saw worms with rocket launchers in real life?- The worms team mechanics are completely different and no longer allow you to customize as much as previous gamesUltimately it seems to be a step back for Worms games, all they need to do is get a 2d worms game with higher rez sprites/textures.

												See this game more like Worms Evolution, good gameplay but not awesome or revolutionary. Worms Revolution delivers the core Worms feeling with a great dose of humour, further introducing you to some new elements like water physics and 2.5D graphics. To me the weapon arsenal didn't feel that satisfying, compared to Worms 3D (which is the game I have played the most) which had the Homing Pigeon and Super Cow for example. To me the lack of this kind of weaponry is a major con, together with the ""meh"" level design, the kind of superfluous class feature, and the thin campaign. Revolution is a game I still can recommend though since the core Worms feeling is definitely there, even better if you have good company to enjoy the game with!If you are unsure whether to get this game or not, I would personally wait for Worms W.M.D. to come out, hopefully it will be a real beast when it comes out, keep the fingers crossedIf you have some good friends to play Worms Revolution with and the new features seem like something for you definitely get this game on sale. I feel it's quite overpriced at 14,99€ which is the price right now.All in all I give Worms Revolution a 6/10 + extra points if you have some buddies to battle			"

												While a few of the other reviews do not recommend this due to it's lack of improvement over previous titles, I would certainly recommend Worms Revolution to players who're new to the series. Advantages it has over older games are that it's better at tutoring you how to play the game, it's compatiable with gamepads which I personally feel are much better for playing a game of this nature, and of course it has more modern graphics and sound, and though I agree that very little has changed in gameplay, there are a few small enhancements which have kept me hooked. :)			"

												There just is not enough to do in this.  Campaign is short and unrewarding (meaning no reward but the coins for each timed lvl)  MP is good, but can get boring after a while, and one thing is that every freak'n worm has to have a British accent.  Why?  Would be nice to be able to play on extra large scenarios\maps, so hope there will be DLC for this but doubt it.  I am only recommending this because if you just want to have fun for a bit and destroy your friends or customize your own levels and weapons and throw concrete donkeys around then do it.  After a short time, and you have figured things out you might start to get bored of it and want to go to a game that is a FPS.			"

												Review in Full (tl;dr version at the end):The classic 2D Worms formula returns in Worms Revolution with a few significant changes. The new additions to the gameplay experience include four different classes, dynamic water, and physics objects, but none of the changes radically alter the familiar Worms experience.The Worms Formula: For those who don't know, the meat of any Worms game is a turn-based strategy / shooter experience where you control a team of worms and move around a map (or utilize your worms' positions) in order to use weapons such as the explosive Sheep and the famous Holy Hand Grenade to eliminate enemy worms. All Worms games have no small measure of humor, as you'd expect upon hearing the premise, and the worms themselves contribute to the humor with their own gibberish vocalizations as they taunt enemy worms and panic if a stick of dynamite is set next to them. The weapons are of course part of the humor, and the Sheep and the Holy Hand Grenade aren't even the wackiest among them. At the core, however, the gameplay experience would make for a good time in multiplayer play even without the abundant humor.New Additions (Classes, Dynamic Water, and Physics Objects):Classes: The four classes of Worms include the basic soldier, the weaker but more nimble scout, the scientist, who provides a health bonus in turn for being weaker, and the slower but stronger and more resillient heavy.Dynamic Water: The new dynamic water is an option utilized as a stage hazard and fired by three new weapons. Any worm who is knocked into dynamic water will take steady damage over time, instead of instantly drowning upon contact with normal water. Dynamic water utilizes real-world physics, sinking to the lowest area possible given its location and trajectory.Physics Objects: Physics Objects are relatively normal objects scattered around every map. The twist, however, is that each object explodes when sufficiently damaged. In the process, they unleash fires, poison gas, or even dynamic water into the immediate vicinity.Verdict and Recommendation: The wacky action of the Worms franchise is spruced up a bit by the new enhancements. None of the features radically alter the core experience, however, meaning that those who tried another Worms game but found it to be only interesting as a novelty or altogether unappealing need not apply. Worms Revolution is as good of a starting point as any for series newcomers, though, and those who enjoyed previous installments should find plenty to like here. If you are undecided, keep in mind that Worms Revolution is first-and-foremost a multiplayer experience, and the singleplayer campaign is decent, but it presents nothing to sway your decision.tl;dr version: Worms 'Revolution' is no revolution, but the perennial Worms formula didn't need to be signficantly altered anyways.

												Worms Revolution is great - for losing friends while having a lot of fun.For the folks who don't Worms: it's a turn-based strategy game where you control a group of worms on a 2D map. Slice, shoot, hit, drown, crush, burn, blow up or throw grandmas at the enemy worms until every single one is dead and you win. It's the perfect game for every PETA activist, trust me.PRO+ game mechanics: It requires skill (controlling grenades/rockets) AND luck (e.g. wind) to win a game. Skill wins but beginners have a chance.+ Graphics+ custom teams+ Concrete Donkey and Banana BombsCON- sometimes, there are tiny invisible particles left after an explosion destroying rockets on their way "

Great improvements in graphics, cared the single player version with funny stuff, and I think that it was high time for innovations (water, worms with different skills, etc.)!It is true that with the old Wormnet it is easier to find online games nowadays (I bought Armageddon as well), but Worms Revolution owns a vivid community to add friends (however in the last few days I found some games with ease). I hope that with the sales many people buy this game so that there will be more and more online games. For those who have never played Worms, I must say that it is considered the modern and hilarius alternative to chess for all ages! See you at the battleground!			"

												A friend bought me this game and I am glad he did. Even though I have been a gamer since the 80s, I never really played any of the earlier Worms games other than a demo for one of the earliest ones (can't remember which one). Here, I'll try to do one of those ""bullet point pros-and-cons"" reviews:Pros good artwork - cartoonish worm characters as well as the animated backgrounds for the various levels single player campaign with varied levels and challenges multiplayer humor - the narrator is funny in that Stanley Parable sort of way; the worms have their own attitudes based on what they say customization of your worms and your formationsCons single player campaign gets difficult and frustrating - I swear the AI cheats not much elseAbout the single player campaign difficulty--the 5th map of the Farm level is SOOOOO ridiculously hard. I have tried over and over again to complete that level and I still haven't been able to do it. Once I felt I was really close; things were going well for me and it looked like it was going to happen. Guess what happened? The game CRASHED on me! It's like the game new I was going to win and killed itself rather than let that happen. I wonder if I am ever going to finish the single player campaign. UPDATE: I did end up finally getting through that level and completing the single-player campaign.This game is a lot of fun to play, period.			"

												This is a tricky one to recommend.. Apparently Worms Clan Wars is an updated, fixed, fully functioning version of this game with better attention to detail, so for those who haven't purchased this game yet, DO NOT.I however have had this game since it came out, and I love it. It obviously is not the GOLDMINE OF FUN that Worms World Party and Armageddon is, but it is a good challenge.If you are like me and can ignore the negative aspects of a game to appreciate the better parts, then you will completely ignore the terrible narration, long wait-times inbetween turns and 90% flawed, broken and abandoned multiplayer mode.Play it for it's single player campaign or to play with friends, but do not expect something genuinely worth it's price unless you are a Worms fan and simply need to play it.6.5/10			"

												This is a very fun game to play with your friends, even with random people, but you know, with the people you know in real life, it's always better! The worms are as silly as ever, and it's this 2.5D style, 3D in looks, 2D in gameplay. The gunplay is really fun as well. The artstyle is pretty neat. The only huge problem I've got with this game is that the animations are for whatever reason made at 30 FPS. Even though the game itself runs at 60, except for the camera movement, the game feels like it runs at _30_, sadly it takes out a lot from the game for me. Otherwise, it's really great, go get it, if you don't mind the clunky PC port!			"

												Haven't been able to get the game to run for more than 30 minutes without crashing. I contacted Customer Support and it literally took them 3 months to respond to my e-mail, after which they never helped solve the issue. There's no reason my computer can't run this game and yet it can't. Apparently the game isn't optimized for ATI cards and they haven't figured out how to fix it. With no sign of Team 17 actually patching the problem anytime soon, I can't recommend anyone supporting them.			"

HILARIOUSLY FUNNY GOOD TIMES!Worms Revolution is a great game that is sure to have friendships on edge as players battle it out with crazy weaponry such as Cluster Bombs, Moles, Super Sheep, and the infamous Holy Hand Grenade. Players can choose between single player campaign, offline skirmishes, or online games with friends so there is never a shortage of carnage.The campaign isn't very long, with around 32 missions (not including missions added from DLC) but you'll be laughing through-out the entire length of it. The AI isn't a push over either, if you're as bad as I am at least, and will definitely have you hiding in the caves if you're not careful. The narrator of the campaign is a bit...annoying to say the least, but the voices from the worms make up for it in the end.Worms Revolution brings a new style of gameplay into the mix by adding classes to the classic worms game. Each class has it's own benefits to offer and can be the deciding factor on a major victory....or a horrible loss. The four classes available are Scout, Heavy, Soldier, and Scientist. Some of the benefits the classes offer are increased movement speed, increase jump height/distance, team-wide health regeneration, etc.Physics objects are also a big game changer in Worms Revolution, adding objects that are highly volatile (more so than the common oil drum), or that contain dynamic liquid that you could use to literally wash away the competition. Unfortunately it seems that some of the classic weapons have been removed from the base game but others are offered in the available DLC.All in all the game is loads of fun and it never seems to be the same game twice. I definitely recommend this game to anything looking for some casual fun offline, or for those who wish to duke it out with their friends in an epic online war and truly test friendships.			"

I suppose if you really like the narrator you could get through singleplayer but honestly I just felt like skipping through it all to get to the tougher missions. You do unlock some items and new worms by playing the campaign so that's a plus. Still Worms is a multiplayer game and you should treat it as such.

												This review is from the perspective of one who has not played a previous game in the Worms franchise.Worms, a simple concept- Groups of worms fight to the death in enviornments ranging from simple to complex,  littered with explosive barrels, guns, toxic gas, testing tubes with eyeballs inside, and many other borderline ridiculous items.Rather simple, yes? Now add some nice physics to it, and add some items, for example perhaps..Bazookas, grenades, dynamite, flamethrowers, sentry guns, water pistols, air strikes, as well as your own grandmother. That last one is a stinker.Imagine a worm gracefully flying through the air after getting hit by dynamite, followed by said worm landing on a landmine, flying into a small pit with a sentry gun and being shot into the air moments after. Seconds later, the worm has fallen into the water and met his demise. How unfortunate.Unlikely, yes? Mostly, but not entirely. Now imagine hitting worms off of an edge with a baseball bat, or simply prodding the worm the minimum distance to make him fall to his death, an insult to injury. Throwing an angry buffalo at a group of worms as it literally explodes them 6 feet into the ground. Throwing the holy hand grenade to launch a worm into the sky, dropping dynamite from your jetpack as you fly away from your helpless foes, poisioning multiple worms from a distance to cause damage over time, and even beginning the event that put an end to the dinosaurs. Meteors, explosions, the map becomes swiss cheese. Many casualties ensue-if not becoming a mass-homocide-suicide mix that turns into a draw.Only one problem, chances are that you're only going to experience this sweet action if you've got some buddies to play the game with, so you're going to have to convince your friends to buy the game if they don't have it already. The single player in this game isn't bad but it can be rather unfair and overall is only for unlocking additional worms, which isn't 100% neccessary.So forget about the single player and just focus on the multiplayer. Get some friends and cause some explosions, because this game is a lot of fun.			"

												You can tell this is a whole different product. They've done a great job on some things, not so much on others. I absolutely hate the new worm editor, team editor and map editor. That, and the menu is so console oriented it hurts.Thankfully, though, the gameplay is still very good. My only gripe are scientist worms, which are noticabely more powerful than everyone else, especially the sentry guns. Apart from that, the game is surprisingly balanced. Whilst Worms Reloaded is garbage in my opinion, Worms Revolution is a good idea for any worms fan. Definitely worth a shot			"

												I've played Worms, mainly multiplayer, since the original game. Many awesome memories of worms games, but all from the original, Worms 2, Worms Armageddon & WWP. I've not been impressed with the last few releases. Worms Reloaded was a terrible port of a console game, but I had high hopes for this. I'm sorry to say I wish I hadn't bought this. Controls are glitchy, the menu is cumbersome, the game itself is plain dull. I was looking forward to trying out the different worm classes to see what it brought to the game, but after about 30mins I can say I won't be playing this game again. What happened Team17? I wanted this to be good. So dissapointed. :( I should add. The ninja rope in this game is the worst thing EVER!			"

												If you don't compare the game to the good old Worms 2 , 3 then this game is quite nice. Its quite fun and playable. But why oh why did you have to add a ""story"" element to the game like you have with this one. The narrator is really really really annoying and awful to the fullest... its a disaster. At least you can skip those cheesy and really bad dialogues and just play the game. Compared tho the old teams masterbeases this game is not that good.			"

												NOTE: THIS GOES FOR ANY GAME IN THE SERIES.While technically a brilliant series and quite possibly the greatest multiplayer games of all time the PC editions are ghost towns.THERE IS NEVER ANYONE PLAYING ANY PC EDITION OF THESE GAMES.For whatever reason, the console editions of these games have a large, active and  vibrant community.On PC? Not so much. It doesn't matter which game in the series you pick either.In fact, Clan Wars (the newest, best and most expensive game in the series) has the fewest number of players.A little support from Team 17 could easily fix this by unifying the lobby system but that requires effort.Don't wait for a Santa that will never come.

												Wow, I am new to the Worms franchise and it is absolutely amazing. Make sure you play with real humans because that is how the game is suppose to be played. You will laugh, cry, and swear at eachother as your perfect plan does not go as planned or is excuted with supreme command.The dynamic water is a little 'gelly' at times, but being able to drown your opponet makes for great fun.This is must for friends to play with eachother. You will have a good time.			"

												Armageddon was the benchmark of what every worms game should be like. Unfortunatly that benchmark was so high that nothing else can compare to it. Only people who can really get in to these new ones are people who never played armageddon. Shame, if only the mechanics and physics were like armageddon... we could get on with it.			"

												While others have maligned Revolution for straying from the 2D roots of Worms while also simultaneously somewhat sticking to the popularly disliked 3D period of the franchise (in graphics, if no longer in gameplay), I personally found it fresh enough to be a tentatively recommended experience for Worms fans (though note I also have less of a grudge against the 3D Worms games than many other people). It's far from perfect (e.g. I personally found the single-player level narration from ""Don Keystone"" to be repetitious and unfunny probably 80 - 90% of the time), but I felt it was still decent enough if you can pick up the game for a reasonable price (I got my copy plus DLC from the Team 17 Humble Weekly Sale, for instance).Water is perhaps the most notable new feature of Revolution, and it appropriately features prominently in the logo for the game. Now, many previous Worms games featured instant kill water at the bottom of the level, but Revolution mixes things up by additionally allowing ""dynamic water"" to be present on regular terrain. Dynamic water isn't immediately deadly and instead works similar to a slow-acting poison (with more traditional poison weapons and effects also present in this game and other Worms games), slowly damaging any worms that are submerged and helping to win the war of attrition against worms that are not quite killed within a single turn. That's far from the only strategic use of water though, as it can be invaluable for putting out fires, washing worms into the instant kill water, and even functioning as a ""soft landing"" for any worms jumping or falling from high above. I feel it takes a while to fully appreciate the utility of water, especially because it tends to be far less direct than the more classic weapons like bazookas and grenades, but ultimately I feel it was a worthwhile addition to the game and not just some gimmick.Speaking of gimmicks, I'm less sold on the need for ""specialist"" worms. Revolution, unlike various other Worms games, features four different types or classes of worms: the Soldier, the Heavy, the Scout, and the Scientist. The Soldier is your classic worm, all around decent at everything but not particularly great at any one thing. The Heavy is a brute, dealing the most damage (sometimes impressively so with the more powerful weapons) but suffering dramatically in terms of navigation (though repeated jumps can alleviate this somewhat). The Scout is exactly the opposite, featuring the best movement and navigation abilities but some of the worst damage output. Finally, the Scientist is a bit of an odd duck, granting a small health boost every time it's their turn and with the ability to deploy some utilities better than the other worms, but otherwise is not particularly special in terms of damage output or navigation. Perhaps the differences are more stark in high level multiplayer play, but within the single-player levels I really felt like the regular Soldiers and Heavies were the most useful. Scouts were handy whenever you needed to cross long distances quickly (such as to get an out-of-the-way but quite valuable fixed spawn weapons crate), but their damage output is so pitiful that often the enemy can negate the navigation advantage by outright killing or displacing Scouts easily. I personally almost never saw the need to use Scientists in single-player play, as their slight healing powers are far outweighed by the benefits that a Soldier or Heavy can provide in terms of damage and thinning enemy ranks.So, all in all, I found it to be a decent (albeit sometimes frustrating) game, though you might personally enjoy other Worms games more.

												This is one of the best games in the ""Worms"" franchise that I have played.  My wife and I play this game together on PC.  It's very similar to the classic ""Worms Armageddon"" I played on the original Playstation back in the day, but with improved visuals and a much more user friendly menu.For those who have never played a Worms game, this would make a good first one.  In Worms you have a team of worms, and you face off against your opponents' worms in field of battle.  The last man standing wins.It's got everything you would expect from a Worms game; super sheep, banana bombs, holy hand grenades, customizeable worms, and more corny one liners than you can shake a stick at.  There are however, a few additions besides just prettier graphics.This game actually adds a few different types of worms with some special abilities of their own that make it worth while to build your own custom team instead of just picking a default one, but even if you pick a default team you won't feel like you're completely outmatched when playing with somebody who has one or two of the other worms types on their team.  The abilities are useful, but not unbalancing.This game also adds water to the levels, in addition to the water at the bottom that kills you.  There's ""dynamic fluids"" in each map that can be added randomly, so if you notice a small pond of water on a piece of land over your opponent's head, you can blow a hole in it with your bazooka and the fluid will actually drain through the hole and wash your opponent's worm away.The game is great for kids and adults alike.  There's no real storyline, just pure, wormy mayhem.  If you're looking for a game to play with your friends or even your kids on PC, I highly recommend this one.  It fully supports use of a controller OR a keyboard and mouse, and supports local or online multiplayer, so you have lots of options for how you play.			"

												Worms Revolution is one of the best party games. If you have friends with this game, it's one of the best games to pull out and start playing. It's just crazy, weird fun. Along with that, even if you don't have friends with the game, the campaign will last you a while. While basic at first, it can get a bit challenging. However, the game's real selling point is the multiplayer and if you don't have friends to play with, it wont be as fun as you'd expect, so I would only reccomend buying the game if you know other people will buy and play it with you.

												Just how bad can a new Worms game be? Well let's see. After spending an hour trying to rebind jump from controller button 3 to controller button 2 I had to abandon my efforts all together, even after I'd written all the linked controls down on paper to resolve the conflicts. God knows how they managed to derp it up so badly. The minimum spec listed on the Store page is woefully inaccurate. Where it recommends a dual core with a minimum Radeon HD 3000 series, my quad core 4000 series struggles severely. I'd highly recommend a current era top spec machine if you expect to able to play this. Even then, mouse smoothing is perma enabled resulting in sluggish, unresponsive mouse movement and the joypad too experiences some delay. It's probably the worst Worms title I've ever played and I've played Worms Blast! My advice, avoid this like the plague.			"

												This is dire. Utterly dire. How you can manage to mess up something as simple as Worms I am not sure.Avoid like the plague and get either Reloaded, or Armageddon. This is not the PC Worms game you were hoping for. Deeply disappointing.			"

												The worst worms game ever made. Framerate oscillates between 30 and 10 fps, on a PC that runs DOOM4 at over 100fps. Ninja rope sucks in this version, and you can't import images for maps or gravestones like in Armageddon. It's nice that they tried to innovate, but this needed way more polish, and they never fixed it. Just buy Armageddon or wait for WMD.			"

												Not worms Armageddon / World party, nuff said, but I'll elaborate...- Screwed up ropes (using more realistic physics)- Cut down weapons and utilities arsenal, if anything, there should be MORE added, not reduced or replaced!- Worms naming and silly accessories aside, this game have almost none existent customization, meaning: no custom flags, no custom sounds, no custom maps, no REAL custom weapons arsenal + crates and damage adjust.- You can't even name your own team.- No practice maps.- Turns are slow paced (crates take forever to drop, game progress is sluggish in-between turns)Worms for me was all about the freedom they game provided both in gameplay and adjustments.I know I'm not alone in this front, which makes me wonder if the devs ever listened to the community before creating this game?

												A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is defined by how expertly you do it! it's a skill that few people master. Gentle pressure or a slight milking action at the base of his♥♥♥♥♥♥can help to harden him up a bit. Like sword-swollowing, deep-throating takes hours of practice, to relax the gag reflex. For huge ♥♥♥♥♥ it's got to be done in a 69 position so your tongue is right on the helmit, and easily revolves repeatedly around it, in all directions. If you're working upside down on it, the curve of the♥♥♥♥♥♥more comfortably slides all the way down your throat. Your lips should always cover your teeth, unless he likes for you to bite him a bit, down near the pubes. Gentle biting/pulling of only the loose skin behind the head is allowed. if you start to gag, slow down and think how smooth, warm, soft, and tasty his skin is. ♥♥♥♥♥ can be love-ly. The thing that really drives any man wild is pointing your tongue and working it up, around, and into the hole in his♥♥♥♥♥♥ Whether a guy has an almost tongue-sized hole or a very little one, he'll love you tongueing it out. Think of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as a dance routine... you need a quiet, teasing, promising beginning. Then you must use your mouth to 'take possesion' of the whole arena. Raise the energy levels as slowly as possible, as you actually choreograph a long sequence of repititious touches, moves, twists, and shapings, so he never gets bored or loses his climax. But a few rests or slowdowns, at the right times, can prolong and intensify the climax. When he finally can hold it no longer, just let him rip and roar. And of course you want to swallow his gift to you... it's a part of him and full of energy giving protein. if you're lucky, he'll be able to have several more 'go's', as you gently awaken him throughout the night. The very best climaxes come at dawn.			"

												The concept of the game is good and the gameplay also, but there are so many flaws in the game.- It can be laggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥for no apparent reason.- The AI of the worms is very weird. The worms either make really stupid moves (sometimes even killing themselves) or do some kind of impossible trickshot, which almost always hits you dead on. - Sometimes the zoom function doesn't work, so when its the turn of the  computer and for example the worm teleports the screen will zoom in as much as possible and you're stuck in that setting for the rest of the game, which is very annoying. The game was worth it when I bought it on sale, but it definitely isn't worth the normal price.			"

(Rope and jetpack mechanics are way worse)-On Multiplayer, when playing 4 player match, after every turn the game ""waits for other players"" for longer than the turns themselves-While gathering friends to join our multiplayer lobby, the squeaky rats an bats noises drove me crazy, even my friends decided to not play anymore(after a few rounds) for this reason alone. (also when i open up the game, i hear the menu sewer sounds and lose my interest in playing the game, i can hear up to 24k hz so this is way worse for me)(i searched the options and there are no options to mute the menu exclusively)			"

												I bought the game ""Worms Revolution"" during a reduction on steam for my  3 friends and me. The game title was very popular and many friends told me playing ""Worms""  with friends is a lot of fun.I like the kind of gameplay in this game and i can enjoy in graphical cartoon designs. But one big disadvantage in my opinion is the fact that you need 3 other people for playing the multiplyer completely. So it was very hard for me as example to play this game with my friends because everybody have to had time to play this game to the same time.Concluding i would say that you can have a lot of fun with this game but you need friends who have time to play with you.

												I played many hours of Worms Armageddon and Worms Revolution doesn't compare to it. Revolution has one less jump option and the graphics seem a little to catered to aesthetically pleasing a 10 year olds brain. Coming from Armageddon you'll be dissappointed in Revolution if you think it an upgrade, which I thought when I bought it. Revolution is a down-grade from Armageddon in my opinion.			"

												the game starts and u get tossed into a stupid tutorial right away, no going around it...then u get 20 training missions before you can even start the real game.the game has changed alot of its key features, you can no longer edit weapon strength.a large part of the game is puzzles that takes 100x trial and error, before you decide to look up a video of the solution..the only fun is the versus mode, the campaign is quite boring, either the AI is completely and utterly useless or it does trick shots that would make pool masters gasp.

												This game is well...good/bad and at times a bit boring (well this is kinda what i'm like for worms now but i still love this series to DEATH!) This game is a bit more different than ur other 2D worms games. Its a 3D worms game with a 2D camera basically the new weapons were pretty well thought out! But i think its stupid that you have to pay dlc for new weapons like armageddon (which has been incredibly nerfed) bufflo of lies, e.t.c. Now if you like this game thats absoultly fine i love this game too. It's different and i find this game is a breath of fresh air for the series but i would like to see them do this with the reloaded engine. But that engine has been used to death for like 5 years starting with open warfare 1 ¬_¬ and up to battle islands lol! So this game its very nicely done i think the graphics are goregous it is very impressive looking and the worms do have animations from the 3D games mostly. The weapons are good the online is a good way to play with people like always and it has a lot of single player content just to keep that person entertained while his or her friend/s are doing something else! So i give this game abbbbout...a... 8.5 out of 10 Its a very good worms game and i think newbies also might like this but i think reloaded is a good starting point and i find the next game in the series kinda a let down i mean making ur own clans is cool and stuff but its revolution but with a few new weapons and the abilty to make clans and more single player and what i think is a way more annoying announcer than revolution! >:( i know this is a nit pic but still i didnt find the announcer in revolution that funny and this one is just worse i'm sorry to who did the female voice of this announcer but i just dont like it. Well i guess i just review 2 games XD cause i did a short review of clan wars i guess this sorta makes up for it? idk but well i guess i give clan wars a score of 7.5 its good but not amazingas revolution. i reccomend it though! same with revolution i definatly reccomend revolution and i am craving for another one of these in the future of 2015! :D just hope its not a port of clan wars except its on the xbox one and ps4 JESUS JUST AWUH WHY?! well to say one good thing about that is that the frame rate is super smooth compared to clan wars which unless you have a very good pc then it will lag quite a bit. :z well anyways A WEEK TO CHRISTMAS!!!!!1!1!11! and i'll see you guys next time! ;)			"

												I should start off saying that I love Worms games. Armageddon was amazing, and so was the fort one that game after. I even enjoyed the first 3D game once I got used to it.I was pretty disappointed with Revolution. It suddenly felt clunky, heavy, and hard to control. The movement was no longer friendly and precise, but actually felt too ""real"". The 2.5D style I felt really took away from the gameplay, but for reasons I can't put my finger on, other than saying it didn't feel right.Somebody playing this as their first Worms game might enjoy it, but it isn't for me, an oldschool player. I think if something isn't broke, don't fix it, and the format of the Worms games certainly was not broke.			"

												Imagine the successor to a good old Worms classic like Armageddon, or its faithful follow-on Worms World Party. Update the graphics, add a few classes, and add dynamic terrain features and water physics! Oh, but the curvy graphics make it hard to play precisely, classes feel more like a restriction than an exciting array of options, the water feels insignificant and flows like treacle, and when the terrain features aren't exploding, they just bounce around like balloons. Then, take away a bunch of the weapons and options, cut it down to 16 worms in a match, remove the ability to add custom content, simplify the missions into a glorified, tedious, unrewarding tutorial, and slow the whole thing to a snail's pace. Finally, replace the glorious ninja rope with a limp noodle.Now, compared to something like Worms Reloaded, it's fine. Unfortunately, Worms Reloaded was an abortion of a game and fails miserably in comparison to the older titles. While Revolution does add a few features to try to distract from the fact that the last solid Worms game came out in 2001, the core gameplay just isn't good enough. Here's hoping we'll someday see a modern Worms title that actually builds up from the classics, instead of trying to start again.Oh, but I nearly forgot!

												This is the most garbage Worms game I have ever had the displeasure of being in the vicinity of. The gameplay is inscrutable, muted, and limp; the graphical style is appalling, eye-wounding dreck; the user interface is awkward, difficult to navigate, and I'm pretty sure it gave me strep throat. I'm going to be getting a refund as soon as I finish writing this angry review.Both this and Worms: Armageddon are 15 big ones on Steam currently, the difference is, Worms: Armageddon is still worth it after all these years. Buy that instead.			"

												This game reels you in with the usual addictive strategy gameplay that we've come to expect from Worms games, but soon enough, I guarantee it will have you howling with frustration and rage, bitterly cursing the day you bought it. The single player campaign is easy enough to play at first, but it quickly turns one-sided. The AI worms are unforgiving, and can always pull off logic-defying, perfect shots that a human player could never hope to calculate. Oh sure, they may occasionally miss a shot, but it's all part of their endgame. You will lose. It doesn't help that the odds are firmly stacked against you at all times - your worms are often placed in the worst possible locations on the map, and the AI team always has more worms than you, often more than double. The Spooky levels are where it really becomes next to impossible. Looking for respite, I turned to the puzzles, but sorry, no rest there! The majority of the puzzles (involving using only the tools available to kill certain worms) require absolute, nitpicky precision, and I was only able to get through the later ones with online help. You will fail and fail again. I also sometimes encountered ""glitches"" in both modes, varying from random, mine-less explosions under my worms to weapons backfiring. The new ""Worm classes"" also add little to the game, and the much-touted new physics are of little consequence other than with their forced inclusion in the puzzles. I'm convinced that this game was programmed by Satan. Only buy Worms Revolution if you want your blood pressure to skyrocket and your nerves to fray. You have been warned.			"

												You think that Worms games are about tatics and knowing the physics of the game. No, Worms is about how well you can form false alliances with your friends and how well you can hide it ""that bazooka just went the wrong way"" or ""I missclicked"" or ""It was 3 of him for one of you"" before the ganging up ends and the full-on backstabbing happens.

												Today, I was lifting an old carpet, as we have a damp problem. Underneath there were hundreds of slugs and worms. My wife and I picked up about 40 slugs and put them in a pair of my wife's panties. I then put the panties on. The feeling was amazing. I got a huge erection and I could feel them sliding over my glans, and round my balls. Eventually I could feel one going up my bum. I knew I would come soon, so I let my wife tie me up, with my hands and feet speadeagled and attached to some furniture. She then took the panties down and about 15 of the slugs were crawling over my♥♥♥♥♥♥and balls. I came, spurting out loads of♥♥♥♥♥all over the poor things, but still couldn't move. My wife then took the other slugs out of the panties and placed them on my♥♥♥♥♥♥ She was careful to put some of them right on the opening of my♥♥♥♥♥♥ which was now covered in a mixture of sperm and glistening goo from the slugs. She opened up my♥♥♥♥♥♥and tried to put one in there too. I got hard again quite quickly as I thought of these slimy little things crawling over me. I imagined them biting me. One seemed to be trying to enter my uretha and this caused me to come again. That was 4 hurs ago. My♥♥♥♥♥♥is now very itchy, but I am about to give them another ""feed"".			"

												My computer is perfectly capable of running this game. But the developers couldn't be bothered to make it compatable with any graphics card cheaper than $500. So this game, that I could easily run at 60+ FPS, shows nothing but a black screen. I've come to the conclusion that computer manufacturers pay game developers to make their games require more expensive parts than the game actually needs, to force people to buy those parts. ""Your computer can run the game, but we have judged you too poor to play it"". Well you can all kiss my♥♥♥♥♥ I hope you sleep well knowing that the only reason you have a job is because you don't have a problem with deceiving people; forcing people to have higher specs than are needed to render the game.

All of this is on a black screen. if someone could assist with this, i'd be very greatful and i'd like to change this to a possitive review.			"

												So if you are thinking: ""Ah, sweet childhood memories"", think again. There is little of the original worms (or worms 2) to be seen in this game. The worms themselves allow for customization, which would make you believe that you have more control whereas you in fact have less. The quasi 3D enviroment is no match for the old-school bitmap like maps, making it hard to judge where you can stand/walk/jump, and distracting from the game play. The weapons still work in the same way, but the controls are all over the place and judging wind and compensating for new stuff such as water (and whether it will flow or not) is frustrating. The single player campains later on require you to get every shot and movement correct, with little to no margin for error (made more difficult by the graphics). It is not the worst worms-game I have played (worms: a space oddity for the wii takes that spot), but if you want a blast from the past, I'd suggest going for the versions released for android rather than this.

												I haven't played a Worms game sinse Worms 2, so it's been an unfortunate 17 years of not havnig Worms. Let me tell you, this game brough back all the fun and enjoyment of the more classic version that I played. Everyone should have worms. Your mom should have worms, your dad should have worms. Heck, give worms to your sister. Do it now.			"

												This is one of the worst games ever; at least when talking about SP mode, which is sad.. this could have been a small masterpiece of a game, given the fact that the concept surely is funny, and taking into account the title's history, but they surely ruined the mood by setting up that ugly, awful and ridiculous campaign, which is mostly a waste of time. That AI is probably the best in the whole gaming history - 95% of the time, pinpoint precision is what you'll get from 'em (when you are in range), so you really have to have nerves of steel and a ton of patience, in order to get it done. I don't know what difficulty is, because the game is so smart that it won't let you choose some pre-defined difficulty for the campaign, for some reason. Furthermore, the 4th (last) part is quite absurd..Losing about 2 hours to get one mission, pff..some of us don't have that amount of time on our hands.If you want to play this game, just ignore the campaign and do it for the sake of versus mode, maybe..

												I don't know a single soul who plays multiplayer and getting people to do it is hard enough on any of the new Worms games that came out over the past 5 years. Maybe Team 17 should get the ♥♥♥♥ing hint that these games shouldn't be sold at outrageous prices of $15-$20 along with dlc ranging from $5-10. That and a more workable multiplayer matchmaking system would be nice along more flexible modding where one can use voices others can hear without having to make them download it. It's a shame to, these games are really fun if you can get people together.Anyways, game doesn't look all that pretty for a 3D worms. I really enjoy the more vibrant look of Worms Reloaded and Armageddon. The items have also seemed to be lackluster compared to previous titles. I would suggest Armageddon  if anything else over whatever Team 17 keeps attempting to perfecting and missing utterly hard.			"

												Worms Revolution: A game that has of course REVOLUTIONISED how the series is played with its Physics objects, dynamic water, and worm classes. But something feels missing; weapons notably, don't get me wrong there's plenty of variety in the weapons department, but there could have been more to choose from (Worms Clan Wars sorted this problem out). Some thing that all Worms games have is the bounce physics of things such as grenades; they're quite difficult to handle for new timers and require careful presision.Despite that critisism, this game is fun to play and even more enjoyable online.

												What a great game to play with friends, not only due to the variety of weapons and tools available, but because of the amount of permutations that can take place while playing. One second you could be losing, but human error comes into play and voila: a whole new ballgame. If there exists DLC with even more weapons and tools, lead yourself to a financially secure state and purchase this game! Lots of fun!			"

												Worms is a fun game series, this addition on the face of it seems good, but for someone like me, who is relativley new to the Worms series, it is REALLY unforgiving. If you're a beginner at this game then you will get confused about what the f*** everything does and how it works, this means that in matches with other players you will think 'Oh I have a really good opportunity here to do such and such' then you completley and utterly fail to do something due to little quirks in the gameplay that make it a lot less fun. This frustrates me and because of the minimalist tutorial, you don't get a feel for the physics, or what most of the things in the game do. On that basis I do not recommend buying this game, though if you are a seasoned veteran of the Worms series by all means, go ahead. But if not, don't bother.			"

												WORMS....again,the worms are back with a whole new arsenal of OLD weapons and a few new ones. It seems like sports games, worms has to come back too once every one or two years for no  reason. Nobody asked for a sequel and maybe for a reason. Team 17's constant struggle to♥♥♥♥♥♥out a new worms game is uncanny. For me personally, worms 2 was and still is the best worms game. 2D, oldschool turn-based combat and with graphics so low EVERY computer could run it.Now Team17 has to bring us a new gimmic and thus comes the beautiful physics system and the edition of water based combat. why we do not know but playing the game i must say that i feel insulted for the amount of tutorial missions i have play before i get to the first real mission. and even then the game holds my hand as if i'm a toddler. i've played worms before game, make me at least work for my victory.But apart from this flaw the game is solid, plays nice and feels just like any other worms game. the water physics don't feel realistic but unique, giving you more ways to deal with the pink ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The game also has a class system, allowing you to ajust your team to make certain of your units control differently and provides you with another layer of costumization. Even though i this review maybe ♥♥♥♥♥ too much at Team17 for ANOTHER worms game, the game is still true to the franchise so i do recommend this game. If however you own another worms title from only a few years ago i would stick with that as it is mostly the same with a few more weapons and instead of a 2D game you have a 2.5D game.			"

Worms Revolutions is the Best Release YetIf you haven’t played Worms before, the concept is simple – Worms battle each other on 2D landscape. Players take turns launching weapons at the opposing team, blowing up Worms and destroying the landscape. There are several new gameplay elements, including physical objects, Worm Classes, great voice acting, that make this an amazing game. The classes are one of the newer features and I believe it works and if you don't like it, you can just keep your formation of Worms made up of Soldiers. Worms are separated into Soldier, Heavy, Scientist, and Scout. The Soldier is the basic Worm, well rounded and the default starting Worm. Each of the other three classes has their own drawbacks and benefits. The Heavy Worm is heavy – the jetpack doesn’t last as long and he doesn’t move as fast. He also withstands more damage and deals more damage. The Scout Worm is at the opposite end of the spectrum, quick moving and weak. The Scientist Worm provides each Worm on the team with 5 health points every time his turn comes up. I like this update, it adds new strategies and fun. The Single Player missions including both campaign play and puzzles is another area of refinement for the series. The entertaining and often hysterically funny actor, Matt Barry (The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh, and many other film and television credits), is your guide through these well designed missions. The first set of campaign missions includes 8 training missions, to introduce gameplay and the newer features. The landscape editor allows you to create your own landscape for play. This tool is very easy to understand, so you can have your first landscape created within minutes. Worm Revolution includes nicely rendered 2D landscapes on a 3D backdrop with various themes. Choose from three gameplay modes – single player missions with Matt Berry’s voice work, online multiplayer matches, or local versus matches against the computer or your friends. Overall, this is a great game, whether you are a fan of the series of have never played it before, with simple concepts and fun quick action that can often result in hilarious outcomes. There is tons of replay value. This is one of those games that never gets old and the newer features add to the excitement.			"

												Can't believe I wasted money on this asinine game.  It has a terrible control scheme in which, unlike every game ever, spacebar is attack and shift is jump.  The problem is, because they are assigned to multiple commands, when you reset one, it leaves the other commands blank and you have to re-scheme the controls using separate buttons for things like skip dialog, target, and attack, which were previously all assigned to one key.  And as to the skip dialog, you will be wanting to do that because this game has awful writing, unhelpful tutorials that teach you the obvious things in the game while leaving out how to control the actual functions, and the worst voice actor I've ever heard.  Makes my sphincter clench just imagining his voice.That's not to mention all the problems with the 3D, either, including hitbox problems, seemingly random friction coefficent (except when the computer is placing perfect shots with grenades from impossible to reach places on the map).  The physics engine they use goes to complete waste, too, because most of the maps it's still more efficient to pound away with regular attacks than to try to use the water or objects strategically.Just the worst game I've ever spent money on on Steam.  Complete garbage.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  This is not the Worms you know and love.  This is a crappy cheap knockoff.			"

												Do not buy. Team17 still don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ makes Worms fun and their current crew are reaching some new lows.There's a not-quite-Cave-Johnson announcer talking over EVERYTHING THEY COULD FIT IN CLIPS ON. It still has the amazingly bad ""Every T17 game after 2005 must shove in loading screens constantly"" issue. The game begins and forces you into a tutorial that seems useless given that no enemies attack, move, or respond to you, and there's no timer. Cutscenes constantly interrupt said tutorial, explaining nothing.To top it all off even if you were thinking ""maybe it still has the old charm"" the voices are all changed a bit and they've added a new soundbank while killing older ones. Want ""Memes""? Too bad, everyone can make you hear it online now. It's an official scheme, not some fanmade♥♥♥♥♥♥Maybe I'll change this as I give it more time, I've only done tutorial and a puzzle so far, but jesus. Jesus christ.(Reminder: this was the one where they were going to charge you money for the level editor, which is why its banner says ""Includes level editor"". Also, I only own this because at the time, it was the only way to get Armageddon. Which they later recanted on for more cash. Team17 worst company, guys. Please stop funding them.)			"

For me personally, worms 2 was and still is the best worms game. 2D, oldschool turn-based combat and with graphics so low EVERY computer could run it.Now Team17 has to bring us a new gimmic and thus comes the beautiful physics system and the edition of water based combat. why we do not know but playing the game i must say that i feel insulted for the amount of tutorial missions i have play before i get to the first real mission. and even then the game holds my hand as if i'm a toddler. i've played worms before game, make me at least work for my victory.But apart from this flaw the game is solid, plays nice and feels just like any other worms game. the water physics don't feel realistic but unique, giving you more ways to deal with the pink ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The game also has a class system, allowing you to ajust your team to make certain of your units control differently and provides you with another layer of costumization. Even though i this review maybe ♥♥♥♥♥ too much at Team17 for ANOTHER worms game, the game is still true to the franchise so i do recommend this game. If however you own another worms title from only a few years ago i would stick with that as it is mostly the same with a few more weapons and instead of a 2D game you have a 2.5D game.			"

												Worms is a fun game series, this addition on the face of it seems good, but for someone like me, who is relativley new to the Worms series, it is REALLY unforgiving. If you're a beginner at this game then you will get confused about what the f*** everything does and how it works, this means that in matches with other players you will think 'Oh I have a really good opportunity here to do such and such' then you completley and utterly fail to do something due to little quirks in the gameplay that make it a lot less fun. This frustrates me and because of the minimalist tutorial, you don't get a feel for the physics, or what most of the things in the game do. On that basis I do not recommend buying this game, though if you are a seasoned veteran of the Worms series by all means, go ahead. But if not, don't bother.			"

												I do not recommend this game to anyone who has ever played a 'proper' worms game before. Team 17 doesn't understand that by adding newer features from the game but removing  other features that made up the core experience, they were in fact destroying what worms was. More or less every game after Worms Armageddon has been a let down. I am a fan of developers trying to add innovative elements into their games, but it should never be at the cost of what made the games fun for people in the first place. The most recent tragedy occurs with the removal of team customization because the developers decided that customization should be based off profiles. Since unlike xbox live, there can be multiple profiles active on one computer at once, this means that there can only ever be one customizable team. Lame. Another completely mind blowing error that I have seen many forum users complain about over the last few games has been and continues to be the amount of worms on a team during a match.			"

												Any fan of the original Worms games will approve of this box of tricks. It still has the same original gameplay that made it a fan favourite, combined with new weapons, classes, a brand new campaign and PHYSICS. My only real gripe with it though is the graphics engine. It's not bad quality - quite the opposite in fact - but I preferred the original 2D graphics that was present in this game's predecessors, particularly in Open Warfare and Armageddon.Overall, this little beauty gets a 8/10. Keep up the good work, Team17!(EDIT: Placed the other R in Preferred.)			"

												I love this game, the dialogue is witty and fun, the customization is interesting, the gameplay is just as fun as it was back in 1995, a truly wonderful multiplayer game... Just note, the Bots are ridiculously good. As in, they will perform trick-shots almost every turn, and will always hit their target, one even made a shot that I pretty much thought was impossible, where it managed to fit a Grenade through a hole, just as wide as the grenade itself. As in, a single pixel up, or down and it would have bounced. These guys are absolutely insane. The only times they did miss, gave the impression that they were just humouring me, and wanted to try to balance the match more in my favour.But the multiplayer cannot be faulted.			"

												Not a patch on the early Worms games. Lack of weapons, slow gameplay, too many maps in caverns/forts rather than island-based deathzones of older titles, too many menus to get through to start playing. All the audio sounds like it's in an echo chamber too, which is annoying. Just very average. Got the Gold version on Humble Bundle for £3 all in, and it's worth that. Just don't expect the fast-paced Worms Armageddon style and you'll be ok.			"

												I've played other worms games in the past with my friends, it was always a lot of fun and this game does not fail as a worms game. It's crazy and funny and reminds me a lot of Worms Amargedom. The controls answer very well, the weapons viriety is great, the sound is funny and the animations are awesome.I do not recommend this game for a simple reason: it doesn't support anti-aliasing in AMD graphics card. This reason will not keep me away from this game, I'll surely play a lot more of it and I definitely recommend it if you have a Nvidia card or don't care about horrible aliasing, but I've seen lots of people upset about this and hence, cannot recommend it to everyone. And remember the game uses OpenGL, so, there's no way to use a AA injector (you can still use downsampling though).Graphics: 4/10 - The lack of AA doesn't allow me to see the game's full potential here.Sound: 7.9/10  - Although they are not outstanding quality-wise, the dialogue lines are extremely funny as so are the sound effects. The music is a little annoying, but it's a matter of taste.Gameplay: 10/10 - You can blow worms, make them drown, punch them in the face, burn them, etc, all with flawless gameplay, big weapon variety, destructible environment and guaranteed laughs.Environment: 9/10 - The environment is completely destructible, there's a nice map selection available and a map editor. The water available is also very useful and well made. The background animations also make the soldiers really look like worms, in previous worms games I always felt like they were giant mutant worms.Final result: 7.7/10 - As I stated before I cannot recommend this game to everyone due to the lack of AA in AMD cards. There are lots of people who are really engaged into the ""graphics war"" and if one of these people buy this game and have an AMD graphics card they'll be nothing short of frustrated. If you have a Nvidia card or just don't care for heavy aliasing this is an awesome title to get.			"

												Excelente juego!!! Bastante divertido jugando con amigos, tiene misiones single player (por desgracia solo 3 etapas), muchas armas lo cual te garantiza muchas horas de diversion, lo malo es que las armas mas poderosas solo estan disponibles en los DLC (son unos putos). Tiene online, y muchos logros. Es la cabecita			"

												While this game gets harsh reviews from goons who do not actually own it or have not played it, it is the best Worms game since Armageddon. The forced tutorial is pretty weak but it is a solid Worms game once you get past that. The Mars and Funfair DLC are worth it with a few extra weapons in each, but the Medieval DLC seems half-baked. Also, turn off the subtitles.			"

Worms is a long-running, multi-platform comedy-based game, all about having fun and enjoying yourself.  This particular entrant in the series features several worm models, voices, maps, and customization options.  While it is neither the most famous, nor the most advanced, it is certainly worth the price.			"

												This is one of the worst games ever; at least when talking about SP mode, which is sad.. this could have been a small masterpiece of a game, given the fact that the concept surely is funny, and taking into account the title's history, but they surely ruined the mood by setting up that ugly, awful and ridiculous campaign, which is mostly a waste of time. That AI is probably the best in the whole gaming history - 95% of the time, pinpoint precision is what you'll get from 'em (when you are in range), so you really have to have nerves of steel and a ton of patience, in order to get it done. I don't know what difficulty is, because the game is so smart that it won't let you choose some pre-defined difficulty for the campaign, for some reason. Furthermore, the 4th (last) part is quite absurd..Losing about 2 hours to get one mission, pff..some of us don't have that amount of time on our hands.If you want to play this game, just ignore the campaign and do it for the sake of versus mode, maybe..

												With Worms Revolution being the first Worms game I actually sat down and played since the awesome Worms World Party, I was a bit sceptical at first because the little bit I saw from the 3D Worms Games in between didn´t really click with me. This scepsis was enforced when I was greeted with the most clunky menu design I ever had to witness ... so much clicking and so confusing at the same time. Even when you got into it, it´s still a bit of a chore, escpecially in Online Play, wchich would really benefit in a better and more clear system to get games easily going. This, however, is my only big grasp with WR since the remaining game turns out to be quite excellent. I quite enjoyed the new game mechanics as in the water and the physics objects, which give the game a really nice twist. The weapons are awesome as usual with some cool new stuff, especially in the water department. The often critisised ninja rope has been changed a lot but once you got used to it it handles just fine, only different.Also, the new worms classes, while they don´t feel that special at first, actually develop a lot of depth and strategy once you learn their uses. I also enjoyed the single player mode very much. The campaign is pretty challenging and the enemy AI has a near perfect hit rate sometimes, but this can always be overcome with the right strategies. In total with the DLCs there are over 70 missions, which is a lot and should keep busy for a while. So all in all, I´d definately recommend WR. Make the menus better, and therefore have easier access to multiplayer matches and you are nearing the perfect worms experience.			"

												This game is exactly what you would expect if you played Worms 10 years ago. All the great fun from back then, with all the improvements you would also expect for gaming today. Controls are simple and easy to use. You can customise the game maps. You can change pretty much every setting when creating a game.They added different types of worms (Scientist, Heavy and Recon) that adds a lot more flavor and variety when playing. The only bad side I found was how repetitive the campaign felt. But for a multiplayer game, that is a minor issue. Overall, a certain buy for anyone that likes to play co-op games. "

												It is a fun game for what it is especially if you have other friends to play with, however the online multiplayer is dead and nobody plays anymore. I am not sure how I feel about the simplified weapons/items from previous worms games. This game didn't get enough love from the developers in my opinion. The team customization is grossly oversimplified, only a handful of voice packs for your worms. The mouse pointer has smooth scrolling which I don't like, I preferred it when you could move the screen sharply like in Worms World Party or Armagedon.I don't get why modifying your worm roster needs to switch between two windows for selecting the worm you want to swap in and out of your team.The weapon schema customization is waaaaaaay too simplified, I thought it was perfect in Worms World Party. I liked being able to modify the frequency of each item dropping.♥♥♥♥♥♥ rope physics getting caught on terrain can be annoying. Say goodbye to WXW from classic worms.HOWEVER!! The inclusion of water does add an interesting dynamic to the strategy aspect of the game. Movable physics objects also makes the game a lot more interesting. The physics in the game overall is a step forward (except rope). If you liked previous worms games I think you will love this too, just make sure you have a friend who will play with you. Also having Matt Berry voice the narrator  is certainly a sufficient enough reason to buy the game.			"

												Wurms! Despite being more buggy, and having less options that Reloaded (I know, right? Frustrating), this game is classic Worms fun, and the updated visuals are nice.What isn't nice: Poor PC support (works on about half the machines I own, for no apparent reason), smaller stage design, only one tower set for towers (WTH?), and  a weird shop system in-game (during matches) to get extra items. Also, no multiple profiles per game in this one, so you're stuck with one team and one team only. I can't recommend this over Reloaded...			"

												Its Worms. Love 'em or hate 'em.Sadly nothing new in this title of Worms other than 3D rendered levels and characters, and what I believe to be a very simplified version of the core game.Suffers from the same thing every other Worms title offers which is lack of real customization. I'm not interested in putting a police hat and bright purple glasses on my Scottish accented avatars... I want to choose stuff like weapon restriction / availability, ammo of each weapon, health for each worm, handicaps, damage, crate drop frequency, crate drop contents, health drop frequency and quantity of health restored, even mods like one-shot-kill pistols only mode, bazooka only mode or proxy mine only modes etc but unfortunately the functionality is just not there, you have to play it 'out of the box'. Most of the weapons are not available unless you 'unlock' them or if your lucky, find them in a crate - Gives you a constant sense you're missing out on what should be a very fun game.Playing with the AI is a painful process, there is a completely unreasonable 'thinking time' is applied every single turn the AI plays... even on occasion the AI runs out of time because it can't react quickly enough... I'm talking over 60 seconds sat there waiting and watching a worm with a (?) above its head, it is ludicrous to even think that a game tester would think this is acceptable.The level editor gives this title a little more mileage if your feeling creative.In summary, unless your under 10 years old and enjoy dressing up Worms so they look like a member of the YMCA and find the humor in the notion that worms wage a war under your very feet with bazookas and shotguns, then as an adult your going to get bored very quickly.Its not a bad game production-wise, but its lack of fresh ideas really brings it down. Its basically just another Worm: <enter generic title here> game.Fortunately I have two kids under 10 years of age who seem to love the idea of a banana that explodes into mini bananas that also explode as they play/argue this game so I've had 10 hours out of it at least :) "

												Ah, The Worms Franchise- it brings back memories of going over to a friend's house only to push them only and hit their keys when you two are forced to face each other with the same keyboard in a game. Worms Revolution is a Revolution indeed. This game has crafted different styles of combat, from the more evasive to the more strategic. My friends constantly hate my scouts and scientists, seeing as they always bury deep down into an untouchable hole or barrier up and heal in the untouchable fortress of girders! I really dislike the Single Player but I feel that is because this game is simply known for it's multiplayer and it thrives heavily off of that.From BB's to HHG's This games multiplayer is flawless. A ton of different modes and hilarious outcomes every game. Watch as your friend acccidentally kills two of his own worms, as he sulks knowing he's wasted his turn. (Unless he's doing the infamous ""One-Turn Worm!"")This is a destructive fight to the death to outsmart and outlast your opponents, who are probably also your best friends :)I give this game an 8/10Pros:New variety due to class typesI enjoy the map editorNew weaponsCons: I really dislike the new Concrete DonkeyTruly, TwR			"

												This game is called Worms Revolution. In this game, you play as a lone scout worm who has the special ability of shooting ninja ropes out of his eyes. In doing so, he gains the attention of two heavy guards, who quickly start building sentries. I won't ruin the ending for you, but the everyone dies at the end.			"

												Worms Revolution is a newer and fresher version of the Worms games before it. It has new physics that change the game as a whole. Almost all of the new tools and weapons added are very useful; I personally use at least one every game. There also is a new class-like system. This Worms game was the one that got me playing all of the Worms series more, and is a good, updated version. 8.7/10			"

It's fun. But i hope you got some people to play with!In this game you don't need much skill, game sense or tactics, you can use them but in the other hand it is fun to blow up little worms with rockets even if it sounds a little bit strange.But to play this game for over 5h you need friends to play with, because without any people to play with it's just increadible boring to play this game. So if you like this game, then make sure you got friends to play with because without them you just waste money.			"

												While this game gets harsh reviews from goons who do not actually own it or have not played it, it is the best Worms game since Armageddon. The forced tutorial is pretty weak but it is a solid Worms game once you get past that. The Mars and Funfair DLC are worth it with a few extra weapons in each, but the Medieval DLC seems half-baked. Also, turn off the subtitles.			"

												Worm on Worm Action. I would 10/10 reccomend this game, but it only has 4 player multiplayer and small maps. So I give it a 9/10 overall. Amazing game and gameplay, but those two tiny things (Huge from a multiplayer point of view) cause it to be less fun for groups of friends trying to enjoy a worms game. However, still definately worth a pick up if it goes on sale for sure if you just want multiplayer. Good pick up regardless for the singleplayer as well.			"

												BE WARNED. The physics implemented in this version of worms make many of the old projectile style weapons behave quite differently to their earlier versions.  For example, the Grenade (and Cluster Bomb) now bounce like tennis balls.  The Holy Hand Grenade is not round, it's had the pin / crucifix included as part of the model so it wobbles about and catches on things.Opponent worms will still hit you with 100% accuracy across a cluttered map with a shotgun.Zoom in when doing tricky moves in order to see the ledges your worms are perched on.The Ninja rope can't be fired from a fall.  Once your worm is freefalling, that's it as far as the game is concerned, even if you had lined up a Ninja Rope shot to pull you to a nice safe spot.The game is OK, but there's still a few quirks that nead dealing with.  I think T17 is adding stuff via patches anyway.			"

Best with friends, the online multiplayer supports up to four players with customizable gamemodes and characters! Each weapon in the game is specifically designed for optimal carnage and just plain fun. Destroyable landscapes and a 2-D astetic provides a platform like no other (besides previous Worms games), in which you can punch, poke, bomb, shoot, push, hit, and just plain blow up your friends in amazingly addicting ways. Would Recommend. 8/10 Stars.			"

												Worms Revolution: A game that has of course REVOLUTIONISED how the series is played with its Physics objects, dynamic water, and worm classes. But something feels missing; weapons notably, don't get me wrong there's plenty of variety in the weapons department, but there could have been more to choose from (Worms Clan Wars sorted this problem out). Some thing that all Worms games have is the bounce physics of things such as grenades; they're quite difficult to handle for new timers and require careful presision.Despite that critisism, this game is fun to play and even more enjoyable online.

												Do not buy. Team17 still don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ makes Worms fun and their current crew are reaching some new lows.There's a not-quite-Cave-Johnson announcer talking over EVERYTHING THEY COULD FIT IN CLIPS ON. It still has the amazingly bad ""Every T17 game after 2005 must shove in loading screens constantly"" issue. The game begins and forces you into a tutorial that seems useless given that no enemies attack, move, or respond to you, and there's no timer. Cutscenes constantly interrupt said tutorial, explaining nothing.To top it all off even if you were thinking ""maybe it still has the old charm"" the voices are all changed a bit and they've added a new soundbank while killing older ones. Want ""Memes""? Too bad, everyone can make you hear it online now. It's an official scheme, not some fanmade♥♥♥♥♥♥Maybe I'll change this as I give it more time, I've only done tutorial and a puzzle so far, but jesus. Jesus christ.(Reminder: this was the one where they were going to charge you money for the level editor, which is why its banner says ""Includes level editor"". Also, I only own this because at the time, it was the only way to get Armageddon. Which they later recanted on for more cash. Team17 worst company, guys. Please stop funding them.)			"

												Too buggy to recommend at the moment. Also a bit expensive for what you get. This has great concepts though - 2D style gameplay with a 3D take. Only buy this if it's in the sales or if you're a fan of the series.Check out Worms Clan Wars instead, which is basically a massively improved version of this with a bunch of new features. Put it this way, they released Worms Clan Wars soon after this and pretended this never happened. I wonder why?			"

												It's worthy successor of Worms World Party. 2,5D graphics are cool, physics even cooler (the water feels so good...) only thing that sucks is map creator because of lack of more advanced option to create some crazy maps, not just regular, created with strict rules. Another great thing are customizations to your worms and classes (if you dont want to use classes, you can just play with Soldiers, they're just regular worms). Great to play alone (challenges), on-line (PvP) or with friends (Hot-Seat).8/10			"

												Don't let the name of this game fool you, this game has no relation to the Revolutions of 1848, but this is still a pretty great game. It uses great graphics to show a diverse world that can be edited to the way you want it. Also this game has a amazing story line, it depicts a conflict between four families and the struggle they have to best the other sides. However, the families will occasionally form alliances with one another to help beat the other families, but after that they are all back to fighting each other to the death. This one of the few games that makes you feel like you are right as the story unfold. You are there through every death, victory, defeat, formation of alliances, and the end of an alliance. "

												The Worms franchise has been a LAN party staple for all those times at 4AM when you're too tired to play Counter Strike but still too buzzed on Red Bull to sleep. While some may criticize Revolution for being 3D-for-the-sake-of-3D, none of the charm that made the original Worms games entertaining has been lost in the translation. Mechanically, the game plays the same as the originals which is simultaneously a boon (solid controls) and a bust (pressing the wrong button and jumping instead of activating a weapon or vice-versa)If you're new to Worms the intro serves as a decent tutorial to get you into the game although the learning curve is pretty steep when it throws you directly into matches against bots.Overall, unless you're a Worms fan it's not a must buy but it's still a good one.

												Can't believe I wasted money on this asinine game.  It has a terrible control scheme in which, unlike every game ever, spacebar is attack and shift is jump.  The problem is, because they are assigned to multiple commands, when you reset one, it leaves the other commands blank and you have to re-scheme the controls using separate buttons for things like skip dialog, target, and attack, which were previously all assigned to one key.  And as to the skip dialog, you will be wanting to do that because this game has awful writing, unhelpful tutorials that teach you the obvious things in the game while leaving out how to control the actual functions, and the worst voice actor I've ever heard.  Makes my sphincter clench just imagining his voice.That's not to mention all the problems with the 3D, either, including hitbox problems, seemingly random friction coefficent (except when the computer is placing perfect shots with grenades from impossible to reach places on the map).  The physics engine they use goes to complete waste, too, because most of the maps it's still more efficient to pound away with regular attacks than to try to use the water or objects strategically.Just the worst game I've ever spent money on on Steam.  Complete garbage.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  This is not the Worms you know and love.  This is a crappy cheap knockoff.			"

												As with all Worms games, this one can get really frustrating when you are trying to figure out the best strategy to dominate a level and 'go for gold'. Seriously, I played some of the campaign levels 20+ times before I got them. Despite this hereditary feature, this one is pretty good amongst the rest of the series. Perhaps the most interesting additions are the Worm Classes; Soldier, Scout, Heavy and Scientist. Each different Worm Class offers different benefits and carries different weaknesses (i.e. reduced movement speed & agility or lower damage resistance) which makes for more challenging gameplay than a homogenous team (as you might get in Worms Reloaded). That, and the VO acting being done by Matt Berry (Douglas Reynholm from The I.T. Crowd) adds a ridiculous charm to the game. Much happier with this than Worms Clan Wars! ****			"

												Simply put, it's the Worms you know and love.  You control worms using over the top weapons to kill other worms.  For example, grenades have a timer and can be bounced to its target, Bazooka can't.  There are some nice single player missions that go from easy to throwing-things-at-the-wall-AI cheating and never misses hard.  The true value of this game is playing with other people.  It's kind of like a board game that way, the board chatter, banter, and trash talk make the game infinitely more enjoyable.  Also like a board game, if you have people to play with and you like the concept, buy it for yourself and get friends to do the same.  Solo play?  Maybe if you get it very cheap. "

												This game is exactly what you would expect if you played Worms 10 years ago. All the great fun from back then, with all the improvements you would also expect for gaming today. Controls are simple and easy to use. You can customise the game maps. You can change pretty much every setting when creating a game.They added different types of worms (Scientist, Heavy and Recon) that adds a lot more flavor and variety when playing. The only bad side I found was how repetitive the campaign felt. But for a multiplayer game, that is a minor issue. Overall, a certain buy for anyone that likes to play co-op games. "

												With Worms Revolution being the first Worms game I actually sat down and played since the awesome Worms World Party, I was a bit sceptical at first because the little bit I saw from the 3D Worms Games in between didn´t really click with me. This scepsis was enforced when I was greeted with the most clunky menu design I ever had to witness ... so much clicking and so confusing at the same time. Even when you got into it, it´s still a bit of a chore, escpecially in Online Play, wchich would really benefit in a better and more clear system to get games easily going. This, however, is my only big grasp with WR since the remaining game turns out to be quite excellent. I quite enjoyed the new game mechanics as in the water and the physics objects, which give the game a really nice twist. The weapons are awesome as usual with some cool new stuff, especially in the water department. The often critisised ninja rope has been changed a lot but once you got used to it it handles just fine, only different.Also, the new worms classes, while they don´t feel that special at first, actually develop a lot of depth and strategy once you learn their uses. I also enjoyed the single player mode very much. The campaign is pretty challenging and the enemy AI has a near perfect hit rate sometimes, but this can always be overcome with the right strategies. In total with the DLCs there are over 70 missions, which is a lot and should keep busy for a while. So all in all, I´d definately recommend WR. Make the menus better, and therefore have easier access to multiplayer matches and you are nearing the perfect worms experience.			"

												Its Worms. Love 'em or hate 'em.Sadly nothing new in this title of Worms other than 3D rendered levels and characters, and what I believe to be a very simplified version of the core game.Suffers from the same thing every other Worms title offers which is lack of real customization. I'm not interested in putting a police hat and bright purple glasses on my Scottish accented avatars... I want to choose stuff like weapon restriction / availability, ammo of each weapon, health for each worm, handicaps, damage, crate drop frequency, crate drop contents, health drop frequency and quantity of health restored, even mods like one-shot-kill pistols only mode, bazooka only mode or proxy mine only modes etc but unfortunately the functionality is just not there, you have to play it 'out of the box'. Most of the weapons are not available unless you 'unlock' them or if your lucky, find them in a crate - Gives you a constant sense you're missing out on what should be a very fun game.Playing with the AI is a painful process, there is a completely unreasonable 'thinking time' is applied every single turn the AI plays... even on occasion the AI runs out of time because it can't react quickly enough... I'm talking over 60 seconds sat there waiting and watching a worm with a (?) above its head, it is ludicrous to even think that a game tester would think this is acceptable.The level editor gives this title a little more mileage if your feeling creative.In summary, unless your under 10 years old and enjoy dressing up Worms so they look like a member of the YMCA and find the humor in the notion that worms wage a war under your very feet with bazookas and shotguns, then as an adult your going to get bored very quickly.Its not a bad game production-wise, but its lack of fresh ideas really brings it down. Its basically just another Worm: <enter generic title here> game.Fortunately I have two kids under 10 years of age who seem to love the idea of a banana that explodes into mini bananas that also explode as they play/argue this game so I've had 10 hours out of it at least :) "

Fuera de esa cosa Simple, el juego es realmente fabuloso.¿Les dije que es very very Cheap? Si lo compran no duden en agregarme... Me muero de ganas por jugar con amigos el Multijugador :D!!!!			"

												This game is exactly what you would expect if you played Worms 10 years ago. All the great fun from back then, with all the improvements you would also expect for gaming today. Controls are simple and easy to use. You can customise the game maps. You can change pretty much every setting when creating a game.They added different types of worms (Scientist, Heavy and Recon) that adds a lot more flavor and variety when playing. The only bad side I found was how repetitive the campaign felt. But for a multiplayer game, that is a minor issue. Overall, a certain buy for anyone that likes to play co-op games. "

												WORMS....again,the worms are back with a whole new arsenal of OLD weapons and a few new ones. It seems like sports games, worms has to come back too once every one or two years for no  reason. Nobody asked for a sequel and maybe for a reason. Team 17's constant struggle to♥♥♥♥♥♥out a new worms game is uncanny. For me personally, worms 2 was and still is the best worms game. 2D, oldschool turn-based combat and with graphics so low EVERY computer could run it.Now Team17 has to bring us a new gimmic and thus comes the beautiful physics system and the edition of water based combat. why we do not know but playing the game i must say that i feel insulted for the amount of tutorial missions i have play before i get to the first real mission. and even then the game holds my hand as if i'm a toddler. i've played worms before game, make me at least work for my victory.But apart from this flaw the game is solid, plays nice and feels just like any other worms game. the water physics don't feel realistic but unique, giving you more ways to deal with the pink ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The game also has a class system, allowing you to ajust your team to make certain of your units control differently and provides you with another layer of costumization. Even though i this review maybe ♥♥♥♥♥ too much at Team17 for ANOTHER worms game, the game is still true to the franchise so i do recommend this game. If however you own another worms title from only a few years ago i would stick with that as it is mostly the same with a few more weapons and instead of a 2D game you have a 2.5D game.			"

												Wurms! Despite being more buggy, and having less options that Reloaded (I know, right? Frustrating), this game is classic Worms fun, and the updated visuals are nice.What isn't nice: Poor PC support (works on about half the machines I own, for no apparent reason), smaller stage design, only one tower set for towers (WTH?), and  a weird shop system in-game (during matches) to get extra items. Also, no multiple profiles per game in this one, so you're stuck with one team and one team only. I can't recommend this over Reloaded...			"

Amazing game and gameplay, but those two tiny things (Huge from a multiplayer point of view) cause it to be less fun for groups of friends trying to enjoy a worms game. However, still definately worth a pick up if it goes on sale for sure if you just want multiplayer. Good pick up regardless for the singleplayer as well.			"

												The multiplayer in this game is some of the best out there. Customizable game modes, a map creator, and lots of items.However, this game isn't perfect. For one thing, the platforming is terrible. If you fall and take damage, costing you your turn, half the time the controls are to blame.Then there's the single player campaign. The AI is the very definition of perfection, and is some of the most unfair AI I've ever seen, and I've played a lot of Mario Kart in my time. You could be on a tiny floating chunk of land just big enough to stand on and an AI worm can throw a grenade from across the map, ricochet it off walls and celings and get it to land perfectly on that worm's head without bouncing off. Not only are they unfair, but as you progress, they start to outnumber you more and more. I've gotten to the point where I've started with only 4 worms and the AI has 10. Unless you're the kind of person who enjoys games like Dark Souls, where the challenge is based on how unfair the AI is, I wouldn't touch the singleplayer with a 10 foot pole.That aside though, this game is clearly meant to be played with friends anyways, and it's definitly worth the buy just for the multiplayer.

												I have to say... Once Worms goes to 3D, it goes wrong. This game is not THAT bad as previous 3D incarnations of Worms, but it's lacking something. Maybe the fluent gameplay. Dunno.The crazy weapons are still there, also with addition of the water weapons (but they usually sux) and of course there are the new types of worms (only one which I like is the brain one, because he is healing every worms on his turn). But I cannot say that all of the new features are cool. If you liked old Worms games and you would like to play some new one, get the Worms: Reloaded instead.			"

												This game is worth playing just for the multiplayer. It's great to get four friends together, and then ruining that friendship with grenades, or turrets, or water balloons, or air strikes, or mines, or concrete donkeys, or even meteors. The only problem I have with the game is the AI, regardless of what difficulty you set them to, every shot they take is either a complete miss, or an impossible trick shot.			"

Three things were all it took: 2.5D graphics, different classes for even more variety and more humour which is certainly achieved with Matt Berry guiding you throughout the campaign. AI is a stupidly good crack shot but makes it all the more rewarding for winning while all the bad shots online make you point and laugh.			"

												Its Worms. You know it, you love it and this is no different. The different type of worms are an interesting take with the quick/agile scout with less health to the slow/lumbering heavy who does enormous damage. Not my favourite game in the worms series as it tries to do far too much and becomes overly reliant on terrain/water and has a frankly bewildering array of weapons even a fan of the series will baulk at.A fun game as Worms always is, but for the true Worms enthusiast I'd recommend an older game.

												With Worms Revolution being the first Worms game I actually sat down and played since the awesome Worms World Party, I was a bit sceptical at first because the little bit I saw from the 3D Worms Games in between didn´t really click with me. This scepsis was enforced when I was greeted with the most clunky menu design I ever had to witness ... so much clicking and so confusing at the same time. Even when you got into it, it´s still a bit of a chore, escpecially in Online Play, wchich would really benefit in a better and more clear system to get games easily going. This, however, is my only big grasp with WR since the remaining game turns out to be quite excellent. I quite enjoyed the new game mechanics as in the water and the physics objects, which give the game a really nice twist. The weapons are awesome as usual with some cool new stuff, especially in the water department. The often critisised ninja rope has been changed a lot but once you got used to it it handles just fine, only different.Also, the new worms classes, while they don´t feel that special at first, actually develop a lot of depth and strategy once you learn their uses. I also enjoyed the single player mode very much. The campaign is pretty challenging and the enemy AI has a near perfect hit rate sometimes, but this can always be overcome with the right strategies. In total with the DLCs there are over 70 missions, which is a lot and should keep busy for a while. So all in all, I´d definately recommend WR. Make the menus better, and therefore have easier access to multiplayer matches and you are nearing the perfect worms experience.			"

												I was recently gifted worms revolution from a friend because he wanted to play with me. The gift would not send at first, but after a few attempts it finnaly sent. I imediatly started the download on the game whilse me and my friend played another game. The download had completed and my friend told me their was a tutorial i had to complete when the game started. Now this is understandable, however the map to the tutorial did not load along some of the backround and my player itself did NOT load. I thought that it was just the tutorial so i simply started a campain level and the same thing happened. I do not know if the game is buged or files were corrupt or anything. I am dissapointed the game did not worki.			"

												Worms Revolution is an amazingly fun game with a satisfying campaign, but an extremely hilarious online. Best with friends, the online multiplayer supports up to four players with customizable gamemodes and characters! Each weapon in the game is specifically designed for optimal carnage and just plain fun. Destroyable landscapes and a 2-D astetic provides a platform like no other (besides previous Worms games), in which you can punch, poke, bomb, shoot, push, hit, and just plain blow up your friends in amazingly addicting ways. Would Recommend. 8/10 Stars.			"

												This game is hilarious every time I play it with my friends. I don't care for the single player or joining random people, so I can't say anything about those parts. Worm customization and random map generation makes for an interesting match every time. The controls are a bit crazy, but you get used to them (controller recommended). If you are looking for a game to make you and your friends laugh, then you should get this.			"

												I love this game, the dialogue is witty and fun, the customization is interesting, the gameplay is just as fun as it was back in 1995, a truly wonderful multiplayer game... Just note, the Bots are ridiculously good. As in, they will perform trick-shots almost every turn, and will always hit their target, one even made a shot that I pretty much thought was impossible, where it managed to fit a Grenade through a hole, just as wide as the grenade itself. As in, a single pixel up, or down and it would have bounced. These guys are absolutely insane. The only times they did miss, gave the impression that they were just humouring me, and wanted to try to balance the match more in my favour.But the multiplayer cannot be faulted.			"

												It's worms! You know the drill! Good chaotic fun for everyone! (and I do mean everyone. I swear, despite being a more experienced player than my friends, SOMEHOW we never manage to end a game of 16 worms with more than 1 worm left standing. Somehow always gets but-clenchingly close at the end. The game is a roller coaster powered by epic grenade tosses, misscalculations, and spectacular fails)If you're deciding which of many worms games to purchase, I suggest looking up the weapons lists. That's about the only change between the last three worms games (and even then, worms keeps about 80% of weapons between all games the same.) I'm happy because this one includes the Sentry Gun. Big difference from previous worms games are the worm types, which change things up and adds a little extra variety, but not so much that it makes this a difinatively superior or inferior game compared to other worms games.

Worms is a long-running, multi-platform comedy-based game, all about having fun and enjoying yourself.  This particular entrant in the series features several worm models, voices, maps, and customization options.  While it is neither the most famous, nor the most advanced, it is certainly worth the price.			"

												This game is great, but something that infuriates me is the framerates. My computer is old and is not the best, but I should still be able to jump upwards. I will mash the jump button, but only jump upwards a couple times, every other time I just go forwards. So yes, when it doesn't run at 8 FPS on old computers, the game is very fun.Edit: so, if you just change some graphical settings, then the game becomes better. Plus you can barely tell the difference between the defaults. Jumping Vertically is still a bit hard, but if you hold the jump button and put a pause between the presses, you can jump upwards. Then you just need build speed for 12 hours.......			"

												Worms Revolution is a simple game. Using an expanisive arsenal of weapons, you kill worms until your worms are the last ones standing. It's a really nice game to play casually with friends, or to have in the background while you talk about other things over Skype. With 4 friends however, things can get pretty chaotic. With the proper people of course. Don't play with buzzkills. I wouldn't pay full price for this game unless you're the last person that needs to get it for your group  of 4 to play. My only real gripe with this game is the controls. They can be a tad frustrating. I recommend switching or at least checking the rebind menu.			"

												FRICKIN FARMYARD 5 LEVEL !!!Hum hum...Well this game is great for a game of the Worms franchise.I mean not all Worms games are bad, that's not true.I mean it's a fresh Worms game with a cool new engine which mixes 2D graphics and 3D graphics. Indeed the graphisms are good and eye-friendly.The gameplay : like all Worms you have tons of weapons available to kill the enemy in many ways.The A.I : too damn mathematic, its plays are calculated in the pixel near. Also the calculation time is really long...To conclude, this is a good game to play with friends (if you have some) or to spend solo trying TO BEAT THE FRICKIN FARMYARD 5... Oh well have fun ! "

												Classic gameplay and rules, except that the new water dynamics and stages allow you to create pitfalls, lakes and traps. The AI is as competent as ever and any new gun featured has a workaround that reveals a second way it can be used, just like with the older ones. Turn based strategy and its' simplest and funniest. Not to mention utterly ridiculous thanks to the AI being able to hit you from ANYWHERE with a bazooka. If you are not in cover, you die. Simple.			"

												Ностальгии кусок. Как показали Worms Reloaded, возвращение в 2Д не обязательно залог успеха. Не могу объяснить, что было с ними не так, но играть в них было скучно и не было ощущения, что это те самые червячки. Revolution же, напротив, погружает нас в ту самую атмосферу, что была в Armageddon или World Party. Всё то, за что мы любили червяков осталось на месте. Нововведения включены так органично, будто всю жизнь там были, просто их никто не замечал. Новая графика, дающая таки ответ на вопрос о том, а где, собственно, воюют червяки. Фишки с физикой, которая не кажется неуместной. Это всё погружает в детство настолько, что оторваться практически невозможно. 10 из 10, ГОСПАДИ, 10 ИЗ 10!!!!111			"

												Played with a friend and we were both reduced to one brave worm each. A fated 1v1 was about to unfold. It was my turn, and I had a sure victory with the rocket launcher aimed at his worm that would undeniably kill if it gets shot with a direct hit. But the button configuration on the keyboard is a bit challenging to get used to. Space is to used to fire an item and L-Shift is to jump. The exhilaration from the guaranteed victory clouded my mind on the controls. I pressed L-Shift instead of Space to fire my weapon, and jumped to my imminent death straight into the bottomless water pit.10/10 would press the wrong button and jump into water again.			"

												Only get this game to play with friends. It's fun to goof around. The weapons are silly and the worms are funny.BUT there's one glaring flaw. The single player has a forced tutorial that is long, slow, tedious, and painful. There are occassional bugs, like constant jumping or being unable to aim that requires you to restart. I've only ever had this happen during the singleplayer too. This makes the forced tutorial even worse, and I actually haven't gotten to play any of the actual campaign because I'd rather rip my eyes out than finishing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It should be skippable, it isn't, and the devs stand behind making an unskippable terrible tutorial because they must just not want you to enjoy  their game.			"

This is a hillarious game with some wonky physics! So I suggest anyone looking at this game to get it. It needs barely any grapics or RAM to run. You could probably run this game on a 1997 Toshiba and be fine! So get out there and have some fun with your worm friends!!			"

												Worms RevolutionAhh, Worms. The classic war game between friends. Worms is a really fun game to play if you have a small group of friends (2-4 people). It's super fun to go on every once in a while to have some fun, laugh and destroy your friends. There isn't much to say about this game besides its a war game with worms and it's super addicting once you get used to the controls. :) I would rate this game a 7/10 for it's fun times and it's good sense of humor.

												The game is excellent! The thing I liked the most in this version is that developers added water. So now you can literally flush your opponent.Graphics is perfect. Nice single player compaign. No lags! This game runs without lags even on my small 1.6Ghz 2000RAM laptop!But not all the things are perfect. The community in this game is not quite friendly. You may be kicked from lobby 10-20 times before you can play a normal multiplayer game. Looks like most of the players does not speak english, which is definitely bad.Also, the multiplayer features such as ""Quick Match"" does not work on practice. Simply because noone plays them.In addition, players can simply quit or leave the game and spoil the game for other players. Besides all the negative sides of the multiplayer I definitrly recommend this game. It is worth it. If you have friends that already have this game - then the problem with the multiplayer eliminates itself. :)			"

												Okay guys, you know me, I would never lie to you. So when i say this game is amazing, you better believe every word of it. From start to finish, this game had me sobbing. You can clearly see the amount of emotion and effort put into this game by the developers just by looking at the menu screen! Now there is a downside to this game, guys. That downside is that this game may be TOO good. I am absolutely stunned by the amount of work put into the plot of this game. If you crave a tear-jerking story, this game is the game for you, guys.			"

												While this game gets harsh reviews from goons who do not actually own it or have not played it, it is the best Worms game since Armageddon. The forced tutorial is pretty weak but it is a solid Worms game once you get past that. The Mars and Funfair DLC are worth it with a few extra weapons in each, but the Medieval DLC seems half-baked. Also, turn off the subtitles.			"

												This game is worth playing just for the multiplayer. It's great to get four friends together, and then ruining that friendship with grenades, or turrets, or water balloons, or air strikes, or mines, or concrete donkeys, or even meteors. The only problem I have with the game is the AI, regardless of what difficulty you set them to, every shot they take is either a complete miss, or an impossible trick shot.			"

												Worms is Back! It is as fun as always, with a few new mechanics that makes the game feel fresh, but nostalgic. Still one of the best multiplayer games when you are having friends over.			"

												Pros* Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥balls this game is so much fun to play with friends.* Worms Armageddon with new weapons, more game modes and updated graphics.* Very responsive.* Meaty weapons and jumps are amazing.* The ninja rope is marvelous.Cons* No way to modify weapon drop frequency in weapon crates.* No mystery crates.

												Really reminds of Worms: Armagedon in terms of graphics. I liked the new concept of interference with the objects stuck in the ground (lighteners, water glasses, etc.), but I was put off by the ""worm races"" and lack of backrounds. Overall, worth playing.			"

												I don't think they can perfect on the original formula any further. Three things were all it took: 2.5D graphics, different classes for even more variety and more humour which is certainly achieved with Matt Berry guiding you throughout the campaign. AI is a stupidly good crack shot but makes it all the more rewarding for winning while all the bad shots online make you point and laugh.			"

												I love this game, the dialogue is witty and fun, the customization is interesting, the gameplay is just as fun as it was back in 1995, a truly wonderful multiplayer game... Just note, the Bots are ridiculously good. As in, they will perform trick-shots almost every turn, and will always hit their target, one even made a shot that I pretty much thought was impossible, where it managed to fit a Grenade through a hole, just as wide as the grenade itself. As in, a single pixel up, or down and it would have bounced. These guys are absolutely insane. The only times they did miss, gave the impression that they were just humouring me, and wanted to try to balance the match more in my favour.But the multiplayer cannot be faulted.			"

												This is a fun little game to screw your friends over in, the controlls are strange and take some getting used to though. The game is fun in short bursts, but don't expect to go on 6 hour marathons. I would recommend this game if you've got several friends willing to try it out as you might not enjoy it nearly as much solo. For the sale price of $2.99? I think it's worth a shot.			"
