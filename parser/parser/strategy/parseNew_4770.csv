												If there had to be a single groundbreaking game in the genre, it would be Rome: Total War. At the time, it revolutionzed what it meant to be an RTS and remains to this day one of the greats. Despite its age, it is still easy to slip into and play if you're wanting to dive into a Total War binge. The variety of third-party mods also make sure that it never gets boring.Alexander adds a single campaign that's somewhat enjoyable.  While it's not up to the level of Barbarian Invasion, it's still worth the few dollars it costs.			"

												An OKAY expansion, but not at all as good as the base game or Barbarian Invasion. I, as a fan of Alexander, liked this expansion a lot, but it definitely has it's cons; one playable faction in the campaign, 7 factions altogether, a lot of minor bugs, and a hard campaign. However, I feel that the campaign's difficulty is a welcome break from the relatively easy campaigns of the base game. The pros of this DLC: Cool unit designs, good historical accuracy, a break from the Rome-based timeline of the base game and Barbarian Invasion, and an interesting challenge campaign-wise. However, I only recommend this game to seasoned Rome Total War players because of it's difficulty.Overall, 6/10.			"

												I don't really like the campaign, and the multiplayer is non-existant without a friend, but the historical battles are really interesting and teach you a fair amount of the Great Alexander's use of battle location, and how even an army 10 times his size is worthless if you know how to set up a battle. This could actually be used hand-and-hand with the Art of War, a good manual that could give you assistance on battles when it comes to the other Total War games, and commanding in general. This expansion is really what got me into the aspects of battle other than fighting, to read the Art of War, and even to look into the political aspects of war. Truly a good introduction into an amazing commander, this will teach you a lot about more than just killing in war. Give it a try, and if you don't like it, it's just a couple of bucks.			"

												Alexander brings a lot to the table for its price tag. Although for me the battlefield focus makes the game a little bit too fast since I like my virtual empires to stand the test of time, this isn't, however, what Alexander the Great was all about. This expansion isn't about building your own empire, but it's about following Alexander's exploits. This is a must-play addition to the Rome: Total War family, especially if you're looking for a challenge.

												Rome: Total War - Alexander is a short campaign addition to the Rome: Total War game. It's a decent expansion, although the Barbarian Invasion expansion which is included in Rome: Total War Gold Edition is probably the superior of the two. Really, there's not much to say about the expansion other than it's more Rome: Total War - and that's always a good thing. If you liked the main game and want more, get the expansion. You won't be disappointed.			"

												NOTE: If you're good at Rome: Total War, ignore the review recommendation and read on. If not, still read on. This review is driven more towards the general populace of casual gamers. - I'm a history buff. This time period is interesting to me. So, I bought this expansion pack. While it is historically accurate with battles and admirably recreates the scene of Alexander the Great's rise to power, this is DIFFICULT. In order to get joy out of this, you must be a better Rome: Total War player than me, and also dish out $5. Now, I am aware that more gets unlocked once you finished the main campaign. This DLC pack isn't lacking content. 5 factions, and a challenge for elite players. That's what you pay for. That's what you get, period, end of statement. End of review, also.			"

												Rome: Total War™ - Alexander, just like the main game Rome: Total War™, is a legendary and revolutionary game of its time. You will be told a story of Alexander the Great and his shocking conquests. The game is quite old and some of the gameplay basics are outdated, but at the time this game came out, it was revolutionary. However, it is quite hard and challenging - I was unable to identify this trait as a minus or a plus, so you should decide for yourself.+ Good music+ Good historical basis+ Amazing atmosphere+ Outstanding strategy options- THE GAME WILL NOT RUN NORMALLY ON WINDOWS 10! You will have to put ""-ne"" into the launch options of the game in order to launch it.- The resolution is pretty terrible.- The controls are quite uncomfortable in comparison to the games of our days.Still, despite all that, I believe that the game is worth it. I caught my chance to play the game before, which is not recorded on Steam, which is why I will probably wait for the Win10 fix or something like that to come out, because putting the options for a launch every time may be a little frustrating, but if you did not play the game before - that is a very petty price to pay to experience one of the greatest strategies in the history of game development.

												Alexander is a mini-campaign for Rome: Total War that has you controlling Alexander the Great as he more or less destroys the Persian Empire and anyone else foolish enough to be in the vicinity circa 334 BC. It's an interesting challenge, and a nice break from the Roman focus of the game up until this point. Enterprising Alexander-likes need to be able to take on a numerically superior opponent with their own superior tactics and strategy, and a lot of what Alexander actually did is also applicable here. Hammer-and-anvil tactics, mercilessly slaughtering occupied populations, that sort of jolly thing. (It also has Brian Blessed.)Alexander's real value however lies in its serving as a base for many of the best RTW mods out there. Rome Total Realism and Europa Barbarorum are two examples of mods that frankly improve the base RTW far beyond Creative Assembly's initial efforts, as well as they did. That's why some people's Alexander playtime is much higher than it would otherwise be for the mini-campaign. Recommended for all Total Warriors.			"

Posted: February 20, 2014
												Let’s great straight to it because this game is terrible. Rome total war is a huge, stunning game and all of its DLC expansion packs are great....except....arr, I can't say this one is sadly. I can't do a huge review because this game is so small and pointless. The campaign is different, but its difference is completely flawed. Not enough factions and a cradling Alexander mission complex make it a race to defeat everything on the map. It just boils down into one crappy campaign that is not diplomatically strategic and the battles that don't even have all the Ancient Factions. This game could be spared the humiliation due to its low price, but the Barbarian expansion and the full game have set the bar so high it should be jam packed with more content and historical context (as certain reviewers have pointed out, I'm only an Ancient Roman expert sadly). There are some good points within it though, I'll mention them for the sake of it--Price-Different campaign format-UnitsThat’s about it. The other DLC pack is far better and if bought on Steam comes with the full game (Gold Edition). Being a history fan I wouldn't care about the price, but this expansion is so bad I have to complain. This is the difference in the packs-- Campaign map size- Faction selection- Diplomacy- Long campaign time- Historical accuracyAll these favour the other pack so the only reason to get this game is if you care about the Alexandra period greatly. I can't believe they advertised this next to the Barbarian Invasion pack, it’s a joke.I rate this game a low -2/5 or 12/100 or 6% and would never ever recommend it as it’s an offence to the main game and the other expansion pack. As all the randomly generated NPC rumours on Elder Scrolls Oblivion Say- It’s a disgrace!			"

 For Total War Series Enthusiasts I really enjoyed this game since i played the original campaign years ago. Though, It is no more amusing as it used to be when this was the latest total war game/campaign. Therefore, if you are first into total war series, I suggest you to play Medieval 2 or Rome 2 instead of this one. You will enjoy much more. If you already played the previous ones and wanted to finish the collection it is a cherry on top of the cake.In this game, you play as the Alexander the Great (what a bummer ha!) and aim to conquer Persians and other factions along your way to the India. It is a great add to the original campaign and you will never get bored if you are already fond of the Total War series.Graphics are outdated as it is expected but overall enjoyment compensate it. In the end it is an old game.Gameplay: 9/10Story: 8/10Visual: 8/10Total War Enthusiasm: 10/10Overall: 8.5/10			"

												I finally got around to playing this 2006 expansion (11 years old) to a 2004 game (13 years ago) that at the time was a true gamechanger and a ""game of the year"" level historical RTS game.  The age is important to note because from my experience, the lack of recent patches has made the game buggy on, say, Windows 10.  There was a particular bug which sometimes (maybe 33%?) led to game crashes in the transition from the battlefield back to the world map.  What that meant (and because the battlefield can take a while) is that I had to do frequently crazy saves (some 2-3 minutes apart).   And that's because there's nothing quite as annoying as pulling off a brilliant battlefield win (that you easily could have lost)... and then have to do it all over again !  Okay, so how is Alexander besides the bug?  I'm a Total War fan/player, but I have to say... they sort of just didn't try that hard with this expansion, which ostensibly attempts to track the life, conquering, and world building of Alexander the Great.  There are a few things R:TW-A gets really, really, wrong.  First of all, the campaign doesn't include the Indians (and their elephants!), so the end game is really lacking.  The Persians also don't seem as intimidating as they are often portrayed in other games (and movies).  The game also *discourages* the sort of world building and infrastructure type stuff that we know Alexander and the Macedonians brought to Asia, giving all of those peoples a common thread.  Instead, one of the best strategies is to just burn cities down and move on.  That's not what Alexander the Great was about.  Having said all that, I played the expansion to the very end.  It was a long slog.  And unfortunately.... I have had better campaigns from fanmade mods.  My suggestion: C+ - a solid pass for all but the most loyal Total War fans.			"

												Not a bad expansion, but was unable to aquire it before getting it on Steam.Anyway...Let's get down to the important stuff. You're Macedon; you do not get to pick any other faction, and there seems to be no reward for winning that I was able to see. You don't need to worry about diplomats; they've been cut entirely out of the campaign, which means that you cannot make peace with any of the factions. To get someone to stop fighting you, you have to crush them entirely. You have 100 turns to complete the objectives you are given, with a message from the game to hurry popping up every 10 turns. Oh, and you start out with your economy going down in flames.You do get hoplite/pike armies, which are still stellar, though not quite as immune to arrows as I remember them being in vanilla Rome. It's a good thing, too, because your enemies will generally outnumber you. As a cherry on top, if Alexander dies for ANY reason, it's game over (he died once from a plague in a city that I conquered :/). You have to take your advantages and play to your strengths as a Greek/Macedonian faction to win. I eventually did, which began a short lecture on what happened after Alexander conquered Persia IRL), and then dumped me back onto the main menu (without an option to continue playing). Oh, and apparently India, while a faction in multiplayer, did not appear during my campaign, and I was unable to find a way to conquer their lone territory, which I assume has a city but I was never able to see it; due to unpassable terrain) and it was controlled by Rebels for some reason. India may have gotten eliminated due to rebellion, I don't know for sure. But it felt like a let down that I wasn't able to re-enact the Battle of the Hydapses River, which may be considered Alexander's crowning, or at least final, major achievement, in the campaign, though it is featured as a historical battle in singleplayer mode.A very demanding but managable campaign, with threats from multiple directions and having to conquer Asia while also fighting barbarians on the homefront. Ultimately, not a bad game, and I'd recommend it for players who like being challenged and don't mind a 100 turn time crunch.			"

												Honastly, a dissapointing expansion to Rome:total war.  Yes, it has 4 new civilizations, yes, it has an entirely new Campaign Map, but it doesn't.....  vibe with me right.You play as alaxander, but the problem with me is this:  The goal of the campaign is to conqure and hold 10 major cities across the world for 5 turns DURING ALAZANDER'S LIFETIME.  So basically, you have less than 120 turns to do it in.  And the way I personally play Rome: Total war is more of a turtle-style gameplay.  I carefully spend about 10 minutes EACH TURN managing all my town's build queue's and taxes to get the most money possible, and keep everyone happy.  Then I expand out, conquring as i have the troops, or as ROME asks me to, not at this rediculous pace you have to in alaxander.BAsically, i wouldn't call it an ""expansion""  i would call it an ""additional compaign""  because it doesn't ADD the civilizations, it replaces all of them with the 4 that it has, and only has one historical battle.

												A terrific mini expansion. The campaign is hard and the clock is against you. You are fighting the Persian hordes and the Greek rebels. Later on, the nomads are against you in the mountains as you approach Bactria. In my view the AI does better on smaller campaigns (such as in the Italian mini campaign in Napoleon) and as the time passes the tension mounts as you have to decide how to move your troops and get to the towns you need. The battle AI is also better than in the Rome base game, and the maps and settings are very nice. You feel like you are following in Alexander's steps, and the historical introduction and epitaph at the end of the game when you finish all set the tone and atmosphere. I really enjoyed playing this and for 2 pounds in the sale (Rome + Alexander) it was well worth the money. Thumbs up to the developers. 8.5/10.			"

												The grand expansion to the original Rome. A historical pinnacle of strategy and tactical gameplay. I sunk thousands of hours into this before Steam introduced the playtime counter in 2009.Perfection of the past, still a great game today. Replaying it, one can see how far the Total War series has come, and how it never abandoned its roots.			"

												If you're really gonna get this expansion, start looking up mods right away.  After first playin' this game, I stopped until I decided to search for mods.  There were only 4 factions with a map from Greece to India.  You can only play as Alexander's Faction on Campaign			"

												I find Alexander fasinating and was really looking forward to playing his campaign.  I immidately knew I had mad an error with this purchase when I saw that his starting capital was Sparta, the one Greek city state Alexander didn't actually conquer.  It's pretty common to call Alexander Greek, or use Athens as his capital in a game, and that's pretty bad,  but Sparta?  Why not just make him Klingon and have DC be his capital.  The game play was equally disapointing.			"

												Unfortunately, this add on does nothing to increase the popularity of the series as well as enhance my love for it. Its primary problem is that, while playing, it feels unfinished; like medieval total war II: Kingdoms, it does not retain the ability to build from recently captured settlements nor allows any kind of deplomacy to have an effect on the outcome of the game. Alexander strictly plays by the history books, which in one instance is fine, as it does, in a way, make the game realistic, but in the base game the course of history has no leverage. You can decide to destroy Rome if so chosen or take Rome further than it had ever gone. In my opinion that is the whole point of why Rome Total War was and is so fantastic. In addition to not changing history, as it were, the player can only choose Macedonia as a faction. Persia and the various tribes of India, let alone the rest of the conquerable world as was known to Alexander the Great, are non-playable factions. These primary facts, in addition to other complaints, make this title unworthy of the Total War name... there can be no total war if you can only have one war.			"

PROS:+ big campaign map+ various factions available to play+ fun & tactical gameplay+ TONS of cool mods+ ancient times atmosphereCONS:- slightly clunky unit AI- much less content than the base game makes this more a DLC than an expansion- wonky diplomacy system against AI- weak multiplayerComment:This is the expansion for the phenomenal RTW. While not bad it certainly has less content (less units, less nations) and I personally am not that into the Macedonian battle style (meaning I suck at it). Main mechanics from RTW remain although the campaign map is different. I recommend some of the mods like Europa Barbarorum that enhance this expansion and make it really good. My final decision is to recommend it as it is not expensive and playable. But it is up to you if you want the complete RTW package. So even if this expansion is the weakest point of the pack I still think it is worth getting.			"

												Campaign : Only Alexander Campaign. Well, You can play other nations by editing descr.strat.txt on ""Rome Total War Alexander\alexander\data\world\maps\campaign\Alexander"". But It isn't enjoyable. If you play as Macedon, You should aware of Spartan revolt and get rid of barbarians firstly. And Next, Get rid of Persians.Within 100 turn, You are hard to focus on Management. So You should massacre residents after you occpuied the enemy's City. And Perhaps you would hire mecenaries in certain Region.Multiplay :  Most people tend to play Rome:Total War or Barbarian Invasion multiplay rather than Alexander.Custom Battle : Except for Macedon and Persia and Greek, Don't expect anythings on units of Another Faction.

												Without multiplayer this game is not worth paying for, about this game expecting to have a good campaign with more than just one faction. Alexander turned out to be complete disappointment. Though Rome the original had regained its multiplayer have still yet to give this one its multiplayer, the only real factions that are in the game are Macedon and Persia, not even India is in the campaign, though the put a lot of detail into the faction for only Just one historical battle thats for from hard to complete. I personally even found the campaign to be pointless, though the hit Alexander with his tactics the victory condition of single-player are not really inviting to new players, and this is the cheapest total war game around. Macedon's just way to over powered with its troop quality and the only real difficulty to the Persians is that they have more towns and playing macedon you really only just have the issue of keeping your income coming.

												Still great RTW experience, but... it isn't the best addition and thats why thumb down.It's game for once. You can lead only Macedon and it would be okey, if campaign had been changed. Unfortunately, you play as in normal RTW, without any alteration beside lacks of diplomats. Even in heart of Persian Empire you can still train macedonian troops and you don't need mercanaries. It lacks some narrative, special events or cutscenes, there is no intro even. Alexander is central figure of game, you lost when he died, but this is not exploited. Beside, even if start is hard, when you defeat some Persian armies, you are unstoppable. From the other hand, you can end campaign quickly. And steam version isn't the best technically.			"

												rome total war was one of the best total wars yet and the barbarian ivasion expansion was amazing yet this exists it doesent even deserve the name total war there is almost no choice all you do is kill people in the middle east and unless you are american that gets very boring very quickley also the map is small and you can only play as alexandra removing all elements of choice it is worse than that standalone expansion that shall not be named for empire total war something that i didnot consider possible			"

												I do not recommend this game to most people, and few Total War fans. Not becuase the game is unworthy, but this game is quite difficult. Very careful movements and hefty decisions are plentiful in strategy games, however this game multiplies the stress. I very much appreciate the precise historical reference and accuracy. If you are a fan of the Total War franchise, and even more so, Rome: Total War, this DLC will suit you. After all, it is quite cheap. If you master this game, you have mastered Total War. The challenge awaits.8/10, Not for most people...			"

												 As an avid total war fan I have nothing but praise for the original Rome and Barbarian Invasion however for me this third instalment leaves a lot to be desired. Before I criticise Alexander I do understand the premise and having played later total war games I can see that this is an early attempt at creating a ""Historical Campaign"" or rather a campaign with a clear story ark. I therefor view Alexander very much as Total War's fist attempt at this kind of story telling campaign, something that was only realised in Napoleon TW which was, in effect, a large linear campaign story. While Alexander's gameplay is exhalent, in line with the rest of the Rome generation, I feel that to say it is any more than an average game is, I feel, a gross exaduration. The campaign is relatively short; allows little time for you to do as you please in regards to your personal experience of the campaign and is tiresome in parts. I felt that after the initial stages of the campaign (gaining a foothold in Asia) the battles became repetitive and the A.I. predictable. I also felt that the campaign was very short and couldn't hold a candle to Rome or BI's campaigns. Custom battles are also poor with only four available factions it is easy to get bored. Macedon massively over powered, Its pikes make a mockery of most Persian units. Persia its self does have a wide array of unique and new units but they are, in my experience hard to use effectively on the battlefield. India is in my opinion a pointless addition to the game aside from elephants its armies are pitiful and it doesn't appear in the campaign. In summary I see the point of Alexander as an important experiment for total war however for me it is a solid 3 or 4 out of 10 despite some redeeming features such as narration from Brian Blessed. "

												A terrible game that isn't worth anything. The Campaign was such a disappointment for an expansion that was Campaign oriented. The Persian Empire was a vast land with many sub-kingdoms in it that ran there own affairs, government, and armies that would give financial or military assistance to the Empire upon request. Do we deal with multiple kingdoms all allied against Macedon, lead by Persia… not. Instead we get 3 factions, Greeks, Persians, and Barbarians, great job phoning it in and killing my favorite part of History. Just don’t bother buying the game; I could only milk a few hours out of it before I got bored.			"

But it includes alexanders greatest  pains such as the persians. You can travel through the  east as alexander in his quest to conqure. This game will not last long but it wil be fun to play here and there, steam users (like myself) can buy the full RTW pack and get this game for free :). The pack costs 10 u.s.a dollars.			"

												The question is, should you get TW Rome alexander? I say yes.What you get is a fast paced sort of narrated campaign as alexander vs the persians and india. You will have few but elite troops vs ever growing large armies and a short time span to conquer everything. There is also a few challenging historical battles to win and some mods that require alexander. These mods expand upon the somewhat lacking unit roster of the vanilla game. I really reccomend diadochi TW ( successor wars) mod.IF you dont know if you should get it or not, if you are a fan of alexander then get it, if not then get it for the mods.So here are pros/consPros+ play as alexander/macedonians vs large persian armies.+ great music.+ good modding community.+ nice historical battles.+ new units are cool.cons- few factions- only 1 campaign- campaign map is a bit small.- you cant play as philip II of macedon.- few skirmish battle factions.

												The second expansion to Rome: Total War, Alexander is a fairly short mini-campaign and mix of historical battles where you run around beating up Persians and later on Indians. Fun! There are new units befitting the setting (a few decades before the beginning of the main game), and some voiceovers by BRIAN BLESSED. Anyway, if you liked Rome 1 and want a little extra campaign to go with it, then go ahead and grab it. When this was new this might have been a disappointing purchase in comparison to the first expansion Barbarian Invasion (included within the Steam Version of Rome) which added vastly more content.

												This game can be summed up succinctly by the following sentence:Meh.When you play RTW's secondary expansion - Alexander - you can help but think; 'What could have been...' Quite similar to what I personally think on Alexander's untimely demise at still relatively youth stage.The campaign is poor. The map was clearly made without either time or consideration. The factions are limited, whilst the units are even more limited. The best fun to be had is playing custom battles, or perhaps the somewhat disappointing historical battle recreations. As a stand alone game, free of the RTW franchise, Alexander may have been considered pretty decent, but when you consider that TCA made this AFTER Rome and the Barbarian expansion, you can tell they were just quickly milking the cow before moving onto another era. 5 out of 10 - If you're burning cash, get it. Otherwise, save yourself the time and money. Subpar expansion.			"

												If you enjoyed Total War Rome, then you'll enjoy this game.You have 100 turns to take over the majority of the map, it took me about 29 hours, Lacks the replay value of Rome but still worth playing.			"

												I have not played vanilla so I dont know if this review will be helpful for you, but I played it with the fantastic LOTRTW Modification, and it was ALMOST as good as Third Age but not good enough. Overall (again I havent played the vanilla Alexander (but have clocked over a thousand hours into Rome 1 on the disk version)  I would recommend it just for that Mod.			"

												Alexander is, without a doubt, what the later games would consider a ""mini-campaign"". One playable, linear (left edge of map to the right) campaign, but a few new units for others in custom battle, means that you're not going to have much variety with this mod. Why they didn't include  this  as part of the original collection and sell the much more expansion-like Barbarian Invasion for 5$, I'll never understand. But it's still only 5$ for a good six hour campaign, and a few more hours worth of historical battles. Some mods can also use Alexander for the best AI out of the Rome 1 games, as well as night battles, but mods that take advantage of that are few and far between.So, this is a hesitant recommended. If you love the basegame, go ahead, you'll enjoy this too. Or if it's on sale, grab it, up it's worth 2$ or so for sure. But for half the base game's price, it's nowhere near half the content.			"

Rome: Total War - Alexander is a good expansion pack for Rome: Total War. Unlike the original game itself this will take place in a far East, where you are destent to conquer the mighty Persian Empire with your superior: but outnumbered Macedonian elite forces. Using the same engine as the Rome: Total War, battles in this game run very smoothly and the gameplay is simple and fun. The expansion is about Alexanders conquest and that is what the game does: it delivers what it promises. That means only a few factions and a really straightforward campaign. (If you wanna play bigger variation of factions then theres the  Rome: Total War for that.) But unlike the original game, this expansion delivers a different, quite difficult challenge. In Rome: Total War - Alexander, you have to worry about the age of your Faction leader, deal with the lack of reinforsments and face the wrath of the Persian Empire, while trying to defend your cities from the barbarian hordes.All and all this is a expansion, that delivers different gameplay and bigger challenge, with a quality of the Rome: Total War.3/5 who said anything about the legionares? Phalangs are OP!			"

												Love the game-play and the new units but I think the campaign is very static with not many ways to be creative.And I know it's following the actual exploits of Alexander but It's hard to feel attached to your men when the majority of the time your leaving them to rot in Cities while you push forward with mercenaries. But all in all a great game.			"

												This is a good game, but, it is hard. I was about to beat the Persians, then Alexander died... You ony get 100 turns, and Alexander dies around the age of 50? I think? I don't know but, You cannot play as Persia, from what I know. But if you do a custom battle, you can fight as or against India, but so far, I don't know if you can.			"

												This is, like 'Rome: Total War', a very very very great game. Two negative points are that there isn't a possibiltity to play as another faction (Persia for example) and the Indian culture in a Custom Battle is just a dumb copy of an Egyptian city.			"
