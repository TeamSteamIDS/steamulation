												In reference to this weekends new necron overlord last stand character. Well done! Seriously, this new character is refreshingly different from the other classes to make it an interesting play. It will be good to see what it can do when everyone else stops playing necron! Releasing it for free is a nice touch for fans but I fear within a few weeks it will disappear into history and be forgotten by all but the die hard fans. You've (now refencing the creators) made this new character from scratch prooving that it's not that hard. So why not continue to make content for this brilliant game mode? It wouldn't require much effort to copy in some of the campaign weapons, or say add a new character for each race would it? Hell you could even just copy across the multiplayer classes, techmarine, plaguemarine, ravenor, lictor, ork warboss... or make new ones like kroot shaper or eldar aspect warrior (with different sets of armour). I feel it must be pointed out that whoever currently owns and operates this game is sitting on a CASH COW/GOLD MINE as this might make them pay attention to the community who desperately want more stuff! It is truely baffling that companies don't pay attention to the gaming community when there is clearly demand for stuff.You've done really well with this necron overlord content, now please continue to make additional content annd the community will love you!PLEASE THUMB UP THIS ""REVIEW"" TO ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCTION OF MORE CONTENT!

												As a developer, what would you do when your game is loved by a dedicated fanbase, but mired in dislike for it's stifling DRM? You make a stand alone expansion that is six times the original game and streamline it for an excellent online experience. Good guy Relic. Real Time Tactical Roleplaying Game. That is how I would describe Dawn of War Retribution. It is focussed on character building, and using special abilities to clear obstacles and objectives. Clearning these obstacles rewards you with gear and other sweet loot to use and to adapt to circumstances. However, unlike the original Dawn of War 2, this one does it with more than just the Space Marines. This time round the campaign is open to the zealous Space Marines, the dogmatic Imperial Guard,  the enigmatic Eldar, the barbaric Orks, the horrific Tyrranids and the eldritch Chaos Marines. Each faction proceeds through the same story and events, but does so for a different purpose. The Space Marines need to clear their name, as their chapter master allegedly has fallen to Chaos, while the Eldar pursue the same cause to prevent their planets from being destroyed by the Inquisition. The Orks just want to fight and the Tyrranids hunger. The voice acting in the game is top notch and delivers the ruminations of each character with gusto and panachel; Slightly over the top, yet in tune with the material. The overal experience is entertaining and diverse, allowing for many hours of gameplay on your own, or with a friend. The game also features and extensive multiplayer component to go head to head. It plays like your ordinary RTS, but allows for so much customisation in regards to outfits and paintjobs. You might be forgiven for thinking that Valve made this game. The overal experience is a fast paced stratagem, with more focus on skirmishes between parties than massive clashes between armies. The last mode, and perhaps the most entertaining is Last Stand. In this mode, you and two others try to fend off twenty waves of enemy hordes with customised hero units. The mode is amazing for its many options and rewarding gameplay. No matter how far you come, the game will always reward you with points or items for your effort. Get a friend to two and tackle this beast. You will be entertained.I could go on to muse this game for another while, but if you're not really into the compact rts style, or Warhammer for that matter, then this game might not be your cup of tea. It can also get a bit boring after five campaigns. Especially the more human oriented races do feel a bit stale after a while. What? Of course not! Humans? Stale? Art thou mad? Humanity shall prevail. The Emperor wills it. The day that Chaos rules the minds of men shall never come. Stand fast fellow warrior and join us in the eternal battle against the foul beings that the vile warp hath unleashed. Forget you money; human lives are the Emperor's currency. So spend it well, and pay your debt to his Greatness!			"

												This is the version to get. Ignore all others. Standalone product. Retribution has no Games for Windows Live instead opting for Steamworks integration. All races: Chaos; Eldar; Imperal Guard; Orks; Space Marines; and Tyranids, are included. Save yourself the pain of Games for Windows Live and enjoy Dawn of War 2 the way it was meant to be played.

												Even after several years, this game still looks and plays well.  A shame they never got to release all of the armies, but it's still fun to go in and enjoy a game with friends.  Last Stand was a suprise hit that is remarkably entertaining for something so simple in its setup.  All in all, this game is definately worth your time and money.  Now integrated with Steamworks, there is renewed hope that Sega may bring the series back with more titles - fingers crossed !November 23, 2016Still the best DoW title of them all; excellent title that has aged well.

												the singleplayer campaign isnt too good but its also not very bad. repetitive levels though and a rather weak and short told story. still i had fun to hunt the achievements there and to play it with friends in coop-mode. bit annoying bugs there were, even before the migration from winlive to steam when achievements wont unlock, i had to play some races multiple times to trigger them. the multiplayer is really great though. its just a good concept to ignore base building (which is boring in my opinion) and focus on the micro management of your army fighting for points. i like the great variety of units and abilities which allow different playstyles and lots of strategies. the biggest issue is and was the small player count in the multiplayer mode, still you find and found enough to pretty much always get some games going.the greatest mode for me is the last stand mode, i dropped hundreds, if not thousands, hours into leveling my heroes and playing for score or just for fun or to help others. it never gets old and you can always jump back in after some time. you will always find players there immediately.really poor is the support from relic though. the game still has quite a few bugs, especially after the migration from winlive, where the game started, to steam. this update really put a lot of new bugs in the game and took some good functions away and more or less was left in this state.there is also a so called elite mod, which truely most veteran multiplayer gamer play today. its different balanced and features some more units and even a new faction. personally i dont like the balance there and prefer the balance in the original game. it ever and ever gets modified which maybe has a charme in its own, so you can adjust yourself ever again. after all superb game. im hoping on dow 3. but i dont have great confidence in relic when i see all the balance mess they made in coh2.

												INTRODUCTION:Dawn of War II: Retribution is the third and final expansion to the Dawn of War II titles. (Also see my Reviews for Dawn of War II and Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising).The story takes place after the events of Chaos Rising where Gabriel Angelos and his followers were labeled as renegades by their own Chapter Master Azariah Kyras. With the Tyranid invasions, Ork assaults, Chaos Incursions and Eldar Raids, the Imperium has had enough and has now sent the Inquisition to wipe Sub-sector Aurelia from the Galaxy. The player assumes the role of Captain Apollo Diomedes of the Blood Ravens Honor Guard in his quest to uncover the truth about his Brothers and the Chapter Master he serves.PROS:+ More Factions in the Singleplayer Campaign: -  It is refreshing to see that Relic decided to bring back their old formula where other factions are now playable. This includes, Orks, Eldar, Chaos, Imperial Guard and Tyranids. No Tau though.+ Active Multiplayer Scene: - I normally don't care about Multiplayer in games but I found it very impressive that there still exists a very active online multiplayer community. Last Stand is always fun to play.+ Imperial Guard: - This faction is the latest addition to the multiplayer / skirmish mode and is very fun to play. Well balanced in my opinion and has added new and interesting characters with likable personalities like Sergeant Merrick.+ Hero Replacement: - You can now field special Honor Guard units rather than the Hero units you are given. Example: Leave Scout Sergeant Cyrus and deploy a Terminator Honor Guard Squad instead.CONS:- Dumbed Down Action RPG Element: - What made the Dawn of War II Campaign unique was its RPG elements. It was seriously disappointing to see it virtually stripped to its bare minimum with only 10 levels as the cap and severely limited wargear selections.- Poor pathfinding: - Some of the larger vehicles will literally block your army from passing through and will do some really strange movements when it tries to make room for them to pass through. This will result in a very disorganized troop movement specially in some of the smaller maps, or maps with very narrow bottlenecks.- Short Campaigns: - As a whole, the entire campaign is long if you play through all the factions, but individually, they are shorter than the previous titles with some very weak or hastily put together plot.- Some unresolved bugs: - At the time of this review the game should be 3 years old but still I encounter bugged missions or bugged units and sometimes out right crashes. Not game breaking but this should have been fixed a long time ago.CONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND PLAYING THROUGH THE ORIGINAL GAME AND CHAOS RISING FIRST. Retribution adds new factions and units to the game both in Single and Multiplayer, it gives back life to the series with a lot of interesting new characters and story. It does suffer from a rather weak campaign when compared to the original, but makes up for it in a fun multiplayer experience.New players might enjoy this more for the multiplayer / skirmish rather than the story so I recommend new players to try the original Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising first or even the first Dawn of War game if they want to be invested in the Story.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Gameplay wise, it has deviated a bit from the traditional Dawn Of War 2 campaigns in favour of a more Dawn Of War - Dark Crusade like meta campaign. You can now choose between Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, Chaos and the Imperial Guard. The campaigns are the same for everyone, however each race has their own agenda. But the goal of every race is to eliminate Azariah Kyras. That means even though the campaign feels redundant, it is refreshing to be able to change tactics and play the campaign as other races.Retribution also brings some diversity to the campaigns, such that unlike the previous Dawn Of War 2 installments, you can now further diversify your forces by replacing your regular deployable hero units with other honor guard units, depending upon your play style or according to what sort of opposition you expect to face in the campaign. You can also now field a larger number of squads by capturing Relay Beacons (or equivalent for races other than the Space Marines) and call in additional squads or vehicles subject to the amount of Requisition you have captured during your battle. This makes your campaign similar to a skirmish game albeit with campaign like objectives.You can also gain traits for your hero units faster since you get a guaranteed trait every time you level up, unlike previous Dawn Of War 2 installments, where you have to level up 2-3 times before you get a trait.Though I feel its somewhat inferior to DOW2 and Chaos Rising story-wise, it is nonetheless interesting to see how the story ends for the Blood Ravens in the Space Marine campaign (which I believe is canon for this series).

												Dawn of War 2 is a wonderful tactical strategy game.  Overall, the game is terrific with the only drawback being the miniscule size of armies you're allowed.  Compared to the first installment, it seems like a step back in most areas.  Campaigns are inventive and unique, making the single player just as enjoyable as the multiplayer.  The addition of the Last Stand with Retribution makes this an amazing game.			"

												When I was 10, I asked my dad for a bb gun, I'm fairly certain he said no at that very moment, but being 10 I didn't hear him, and went around putting fliers from toys r' us in all of his stuff ala Christmas story with bbguns circled,well come christmas I did not recieve a bbgun.I got Warhammer Fantasy Battle.I looked at my dad, and he just laughed, and told me something like go playI did.I don't think to this day he realizes what he gave me.For inside was the warhammer rule book, and this contained not only the rules of playing the first versions of warhammer tabletop, but also the stories and art of warhammer.I was instantly enthralled, blood, violence, betrayal, sacrifice, crazy insane heroes, epic battlesskip ahead to my discovery of 40k and the fleshing out of the warhammer universe and story led me to consume the books, and art of the universe, my world has never been the same, I gave up Christianity because Jesus couldn't hold his own against Khorne, I mean really, Peace be with you? Lame.now I'll actually get to  DOW2:Retribution,Take the massive epic scale of warhammer, condense it down, down to small unit tactics, and you get  to the very heart of Warhammer, the tales of Individual squads and heroes taking part in the struggle of the  Eternal Galactic War,Every race is  balanced to a T, what at first appears to be a very limited set of units, and heroes, actually becomes an incredible and fluid tactics game, the ebb and flow of battle, the constant tug of war, ambushes, assaults, defenses,  last stands,  the epic clashes of heroes, and dread warmachines,  This is hands down, the best multiplayer Warhammer Game, it captures a very beautiful piece of this amazing universe and brought it to new life for me.Blood for the blood god, and skulls for the skull throne!

												This game is everything you could want from a Warhammer 40k RTS. It functions just like company of heroes, probably because theyre both made by relicOverall this is a wonderfull game to get if you like warhammer 40k. Theirs 6 factions to play as, each with its own unique machanics and play style, The Space Marines, The Imperial Guard, The Eldar, The Tyranids, Chaos, and my personal Favorite, The Orkseach faction has 3 different commanders you can deploy and the game is very well balanced, the sories are decent, and fun, but sometimes lacking depthMultiplayer is the key feature of this game, as it is the most fun you'll have. Stand against an ork waaaahg, or a tyranid invasion, or fight against the ruinous powers as the guard or the angels of death. The games are just long enough, and the learning curve isnt too severe if you know how to play an RTSThe Elite mod for this game has kept the community alive, as it rebalences the game, adds new units and another faction (The Grey Knights) and is updated frequently. The community for it holds monthly tournaments, has a number of game casters, and is overall a great communityPros+ 6 differnt factions that are very distinct from one another in how they play+ Lots of maps and worlds to choose from+ Graphics are pretty good+ Lots of different units for every army, as well as commanders+ good resource managment+ Multiplayer is amazing+ campaigns are pretty fun+ Elite mod has completely taken over as the official support and keeps the game alive+ AI is decently challanging+ Lots of solid DLC that isnt stupidly expensive and can easily be forgone if you dont want themCons- Only 2 multiplayer modes- Only can have 2 teams in multiplayer, so no massive 6 army free for alls, which was a wasted oportunity in my opinion- No more official support as THQ doesnt exist anymore- Controls are a bit wonky- Unit pathing can be weird at timesOn the whole, this game is well worth the mere $30 it asks for, and theirs plenty of DLC for it that is great, such as more wargear for you campaign commanders, more skins for multiplayer armies, and additional gear for the last standi give this game 10/10 Ork stormboyz rocketing into the imperial guard lines. Get the game, you wont regret it			"

Posted: January 14, 2016
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution is an excellent RTS-style game where base-building itself is dropped, in favor of more strategic combat involvement. While this may seem initially like a dumbing-down from DoWI, the playstyle it encourages is more fast-paced, usually more aggressive, and leads itself to large armies splitting off across the map. This has ended up being a very fun way to play an RTS. The campaign has benefited from this style in that in place of a Commander unit, you can have up to four Heroes that are powerful (typically single-person) units with Wargear upgrades and stat boosts while in a mission. These heroes can be substitued for an Honor Guard unit, which is a stronger version of a standard army unit. While building an army is fun, I also had a blast clearing the missions with only my Heroes and their witty banter.Multiplayer has become faster, which is usually a plus, as it allows us to play more games, or to boot up a match when normally we couldn't. I enjoy that gameplay feels more aggressive, with players capturing Requisition Points and Power Nodes in order to increase the speed that accumulate resources to purchase army units, and with holding the Victory Points, in which you must hold more than your opponent for a period of time in order to win. This leads to a very active playstyle, where you're balancing defensive capabilities with offensive, and mobility with firepower. Nearly every unit has potential upgrades, either as stat increases or new weapons, allowing them to be good against, and bad against, different types of enemies. Something as small as purchasing a few Flamers will make your unit that much stronger with melee engages, and constantly staying one step ahead of your enemy in upgrades, or creating units to counter their build, will often be the deciding factor of whether you fall from grace, or rise in glory as a successful tactician. The Hero system also carries into Multiplayer, as you select from one of six races, then one of three Hero units per race. These Heroes have different skills and Racial Abilities, and encourage different playstyles. Similar to the Campaign, these Hero units can purchase Wargear ingame once they have met the requirements (per game, no carrying over), to grant higher stats and capabilities against different enemies.The Last Stand, also sold as an individual DLC package, is a great mode where three players try to survive, and conquer, 20 waves of enemies. Each player selects a Hero and their Wargear before entering queue, with seven different Heroes, and a LOT of Wargear options. Mirrors are possible, but do not generally affect gameplay, and will likely have different builds. Wargear is obtained through leveling up, where you gain experience points at the end of the game, or through special, sometimes difficult, achievements. Most Heroes have two achievement Wargear unlocks. The Last Stand is incredibly brutal, very unforgiving, and you may never beat it. Players have the ability to revive fallen teammates, though this immobilizes the reviver, and reduces their firepower greatly, easily causing their death as well. Also on the map are two Point Multiplying Nodes, similar in appearance to Power Nodes, that add a x3 multiplier to your team's score each. Certain types of enemies will try to capture these points for themselves. Each Hero is vastly different, and every team composition is as well, leading to immense replayability, especially if you haven't beaten either of the two maps yet... (It's always that blasted Wave 20! ;-;)Lore-wise this game is both engaging and genuinely gets the grimdark feel of the WH40k universe. As the story progressed, through the earlier two campaigns (DoWII and DoWII:Chaos Rising) and this one, I felt the tragedies come one after the other, and each victory feeling less and less impactful until you get that one killing blow that just brings everything you've done all together, and you can feel the weight just disappear off of your chest, and you sit back in the chair and let out this sigh of relief... until you are informed of another emergency happening almost immediately. It kept me on the edge of my seat with its grimdarkness, its surprisingly fitting comedy (especially playing as those 'ard Ork boyz), and my genuine interest in how it was going to play out. While a lot of people feel that the campaign is short, and it kinda is, it certainly isn't lacking in content or gameplay, and it was very fun.  Pros Cons   Engaging campaign, interesting and fitting characters, fun take on an RTS. Short campaign that may be a little lackluster if you haven't played the other campaigns in earlier games.   Fun multiplayer design that encourages constant action. May take a while to get into the mode as there is a lot to learn, and a lot to manage.   The Last Stand is a great mode with high replayability and a fun premise. May be repetetive, harder for lower-levels which may discourage Hero diversity, and one Hero is locked behind paid DLC. TL;DR: 9/10 A very fun game that successfully captured the essence of the WH40k universe, and gave me three fun modes to play. There is a modding community as well, keeping it alive, and encouraging its growth. I highly recommend it to any WH40k or RTS fan.			"

Beside the better Graphics, I missed all the other playable Races from Soulstorm and hardly the Planetary Conquer Mode. After playing trough all stories I really became sad, because it doesn´t matter which race you choose, the levels are all the same. A shame!BUTand here is the but: The Arena Modes are still awesome. Very much fun guaranteed. Well, since THQ isn´t anymore I give up all hope for a conquer mode or a better DoW III6/10			"

A Video of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Retribution
By: Darkbulborb

			A video about the Orks in warhammer 40.000 Dawn of War 2: Retribution. I hope you will like it :D		


Its 1 of my best games. Over 700h are the proof. Mayby compaign isnt the best (all fractions have almost the same missions) but multiplayer is great. You can play last stand on 2 different maps and defeat 20 waves of enemys with 2 friends. If you are bored or its not your style you can try multiplayer but its really hard (veterans with over 1000h will crush you or call noobs but its normal). Learn, find friends, make team and fight in epic 3v3 battles where super heavy units will fight under your command and powerfull global abilities will crush whole armies. Im waiting for you on the battlefield with my friends to crush you or admit that this time you were better.                                                          MaxGregor			"

												9/10Campaign - Not as good as DOW2s and DOW2: CRs campaigns, but it makes up for this by allowing you to play the campaign through as all the races, Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, Tyranids and imperial guard. imperial guard is a new faction added in Retiribution we saw a little of in the previous 2 DOW2 games. overall the campaign was pretty decent.Last stand - Pretty much identical to the DOW2/DOW2:CR Last stand modes, adds one new map and a bunch more gear. Last stand is basically a horde mode, in an RTS. yes its interesting. there is a standalone game called ""the last standalone"" which is just the last stand mode.Multiplayer - Now i play the game mostly for the mutliplayer. i could make an entire essay about how the multiplayer is good, or bad.all you need to know is that unlike other RTS games like DOW1 or Starcraft 2, there is no base building. everything is produced from the HQ structure and unlocked via multiple tiers of tech, not much unlike other RTS games, just with no bas building. i would NOT reccomend the multiplayer if you are looking for an annihilate type of game, due to the lack of base buidling annihilate isnt a very popular mode in DOW2. HOWEVER, if objective based RTS play is your thing, awesome. DOW2: Retribution has some of the best objective based RTS play in pretty much any RTS i've played.due to the lack of base building the game is more about your units, how you use them, what they counter and what they're countered by, this game is extremely micro heavy as a result, and loosing one squad could potentially loose you the game. luckily there is the handy ""Retreat"" button which sends the unit back to the closest retreat point (usually your HQ) as fast as their legs can carry them.If you plan on playing the multiplayer competetively and are looking for actual challenging games with a competetive playerbase, i urge you to download ""ELITE Mod"" its basically a massive balance patch and content patch. the modding team are filling in for the lack of support relic has given this game since THQ died.ELITE Mod download ---> http://www.dawnofwar.info/thats about it. if it sounds interesting go for it.

												In the mold of the Dark Crusade expansion for the original Dawn of War, Retribution allows you to play a campaign for each available faction. Unfortunately, the Risk-style campaign map present in Dark Crusade does not exist in Retribution. Instead, each faction plays an almost identical campaign on a set path, with the only major differences being the characters you use and what your characters say. While it's fun to play the new heroes from each faction, the campaign rapidly becomes repetitive. I played through the space marine and ork campaigns and had fun, but I couldn't bring myself to finish yet another campaign with a virtually identical story and identical missions.Not recommended.

												Currently this is my favorite video game, and community to be active in. I love the game, and the people in it are some of the best I have met online. To be quite honest however my opinion is quite biased because I keep getting lured back to playing this game due to the Death Korps of Krieg which is my favorite regiment, and also a skin pack in this game. Just a warning there is a steep learning curve and you will get your butt kicked repeatedly until you learn how to play properly but never get discouraged!!			"

												Almost 5 years old and still going strong, Dawn of War II Retribution is a pretty fun game that'll keep you coming back for more with its addictive gameplay and strategic battle scenarios. It's not entirely perfect, but it can be a very enjoyable game for both old and new fans of the Warhammer 40K series.The Pros Awesome intro Six playable races (Space marines, Chaos, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, and Tyranids) The Last Stand is the most addicting. Eight heroes(two of whtich are DLC) to choose from, 20 waves of enemies to fight off, and each of the two maps has special gimmicks to make the experience different. Can create custom color schemes for each race to use in Multiplayer and Last Stand Pretty cheap when it goes on sale Mods make it fun for those who play the Multiplayer mode by adding new units and increased pop cap (+300!) Final boss is fun to fight Lots of potential for a Dawn of War III You cam wage a massive WAAAGH! TYRANIDS!!!! The Cons  Campaign is repetative. Each race goes through the exact same missions with different dialogue, different commanders, different units, and different prologue and epilogue cutscenes. Some glitches have yet to be patched. Don't worry, there isn't that many Multiplayer is not as newb friendly as Last Stand. If you haven't played the first four Dawn of War games, stay away from it Tau Efficiency achievement 100 unit pop cap in Multiplayer makes it hard to get a good assault. Dark Eldar Archon and Sisters of Battle Canoness are not DLC heroes for Last Stand  :'(  Some DLC isnt worth it even when on sale, specifically the ones for Multiplayer that offer special color schemes that dont appear in Last Stand Space Marine and Imperial Guard campaign DLC is $2 whilst all other campaign DLC is $1 Space Marine ending is only canonical ending No third map for Last StandWhile it does have it's fair share of ups and downs, you can always be sure it will keep you coming back for more9.5/11 Here's to hoping they got something big planned for this game's 5th anniversary! -chugs fungus beer- WAAAAAAAAHG!!!!!!

												Dawn of War II was a very different game from its predecessor; no base building, a prominent focus on smaller armies and objective play, and a generally more streamlined experience. While I definitely prefer the first game, I can see the appeal in the second, as none of the changes they made are necessarily bad. Dawn of War II: Retribution is the second standalone expansion to Dawn of War II, and has a pretty impressive feature list. A new race, new maps, and a super shiny, fully voice acted narrative campaign where we can finally play as the race of our choice instead of being saddled with the Blood Magpies. The single player is easily the best part of Retribution in my eyes, but this is primarily because I vastly prefer Dawn of War 1's style of multiplayer gameplay. It basically boils down to this: do you like traditional RTS? Play Dawn of War 1. Do you want a more modern experience, with tactics elements? Play Dawn of War II. Do you want neither? Well... go play Space Marine or something, I guess. I give this game 70 orky gubbinz out of 100.			"

												A wonderful take on RTS. Relic has once again made a stupendous game that combines great rts elements like cover, choke points, scouting, etc. And blends it with the intense micromangement of individual squads. The campaign is good, and well down, giving a good balance of missions to play through with different difficulties. However it lacks in preparing you for multiplayer, and the skills needed to really be able to compete against others. If your wanting a great rounded RTS, then pick this up, but be prepared for very hard, skilled opponents in multiplayer. There is no skill based matchmaking.4/5 Would pick this up again in a heartbeat.			"

												The last installment of Dawn of War II. Finally you can play as any race in the single player campaign. There is no carryover component from the previous games, and the game itself is standalone. The abilities and wargear are fairly fun to customize, and the game is not hard even on the highest setting. A second map was added to the multiplare arcade mode, which was harder waves than the first. There is a purchaseable arcade-mode DLC that adds a Tau crisis/broadside unit as a playable hero, which is very interesting.I guess overall this has to be my favourite series of all time, although I don't play this game at all anymore. Across the three games in this series I have logged almost 1000 hours of play, most of which was single player.Maybe it's a bad idea to review all three games under one title, but they are best viewed as parts of a whole. The vanilla game was really challenging when played on Primarch; there was an intricate re-deployment system that encouraged you to play every mission to the best of your ability, as well as a ton of wargear that wasn't guarenteed to drop at fixed points. Chaos rising was my favourite, offering maximal flexibility in squadmates, gear, playstyle and choices. Once the Chaos Rising patch is applied to the vanilla game, playing the vanilla part on hardest becomes really hard. The Corruption system in Chaos rising was great, decently complex, and have a bearing on the ending. Retribution was the easiest game out of the three, but you can play as any race you want and the ending is open-ended. Once again, Retribution does not require the first two games to play, and it has no carryover mechanic, although the storyline is officially continuous. If you don't like to play as space marines but like the single player aspect, just play Retribution.			"

												DOW2: Retribution is a disappointing step back from the previous Dawn of War 1 and even the base Dawn of War 2. The campaign of Retribution is a set of cloned missions identical for each race; unit customization and commander/specialty unit progression is too simple and lumpy compared to DoW2 vanilla. This cloned campaign does not even have the charm of the set of same missions from DoW1: Dark Crusade or DoW1: Soulstorm, because there is no aspect of base-building or sufficiently different strategic playstyles. While the overall storyline is not bad, the cloned nature of the campaign makes it utterly predictable after the first time you've played it, and the only virtue to playing through it again is to earn more achievements or to cheer on your second-favorite race.Gameplay in DoW2: Retribution is average; most units either suffer from a rock-paper-scissors balance mechanism, or are powerfully broken. Early game for a lot of races is slow and frustrating, as you must focus more on obtaining and securing resources than getting stuck in with your archnemesis. Whoever controls the power nodes wins. Between the focus on resource-gathering and the small size of the armies, this game could be reskinned to any other given RTS and you'd never know the difference; there is very little that sets this game apart as distinctly Warhammer 40K.Overall I can't give this game more than a 6/10. Relic and Games Workshop have quite a bit to make up for if they go through with DoW3.			"

He also seems to be a close relative of Indrick Boreale due his unique intonation and highly elaborated ingame responses. Ohh, and he's also bald, as in Captain Boreale bald. He is also notable for constantly soliciting Eldar Farseers for sex on the battlefield with bellowing cries of; ""FAHSEEYAH LET US TO IT!!"". In essence, he is Boreale with a lesser level of win and more grimdark. Funnily, the portions of his dialogue that aren't deployed at maximum volume are actually decent, as seen in the final mission and the Blood Ravens ending. They are, unfortunately, nowhere near as hilarious.			"

												Good game, absolutely love Last Stand.But there is no oubt that DOW series 1 was supreme. It just had so much more in terms of in-game potential.I found DOW2 to be lacking in this because of the ridiculously small population cap and absence of base-building.DOW3 is now a reality though and from what I have seen, Relic have really absorbed the feedback and have restored base-building and large-scale battles to the genre.To anyone considering this game as one to buy. Hold your coins, wait and see how 3 wil pan out. And if you haven't even played DOW1, I suggest that be top priority before even considering this. The final thing I would like to say about this game (and series) is the presence of DLC, which I feel, frankly, slowly kills the game for those people not willing to fork up the extra money. I hope DOW3 doesn't take the same turn.Good game though, just stick to the Last Stand, however.			"

												Building further upon the game's core concepts and ideas from Chaos Rising, this installment adds army building to the mix. The focus becomes less on your heroes and squads, and more on the overall plot, and its race/faction flavor. More linear than DoWII but still quite a bit of fun. Heroes gain more traits but the game becomes exceptionally stingy on wargear for them. Mission rewards offer you either 1 piece of wargear(in addition to the handful of items you find on a map) or unlocks/upgrades for your army units. Still not as good as Soulstorm or Dark Crusade but again a worthy title. Definitely worth it on sale, and I'll have to rate this one at 4 outta 5. I guess I really missed the base building aspects as I was looking forward to an RTS, which this still doesn't quite feel like. Retribution does, however, have a much higher replayability than Chaos Rising or core DoWII			"

												Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War II – Retribution is a standalone ""expansion"" for Dawn of War II. I feel that ""expansion"" needs to be quoted because Retribution is an entirely standalone and complete game in itself, and ownership of either of the prior two Dawn of War games is unnecessary, and, conversely, if you own the previous games you don't get anything extra out of Retribution. Still, if they want to call it an expansion and give it a $30 price tag that's fine with me, because you'll get more gameplay out of this title than you will out of a lot of games that go for twice the price.f you're new to Dawn of War II, it's a bit different than your typical real-time strategy game. You don't build bases and collect resources, at least in the traditional sense, but rather command a small group of elite heroes in missions that have you moving from skirmish to skirmish with the occasional larger battle or boss confrontation tossed in to provide some extra challenge. While this type of gameplay may seem more akin to an action game, there's plenty of strategy at play. Different heroes and units have their strengths and weaknesses, and are more effective against some unit types than others. Managing cover and suppression effects are critical to success and sound tactics win out over brute force frontal assaults.This will be familiar to Dawn of War II veterans, but Retribution has changed things up a little for those of you who have played the first two games in the series. Rather than having squads attached to heroes, heroes are now all truly individual units. However, you can have squads of units accompany your heroes into a mission and even spawn in squads – subject to a population cap and resource costs. You can also choose to bring squads in place of heroes into missions and be compensated for the loss of a powerful hero by a higher population cap for the mission. Post-mission rewards are no longer limited to gear for heroes, but now include upgrades for the various squads available to your faction.Another thing that is different about Retribution is that it does not have ""a"" single player campaign – it has six. This is probably the one feature that Dawn of War II fans will be most interested in because it gives them the chance to control factions that were once only playable in the multiplayer game. The game features campaigns for the Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Chaos, Orks, Tryanids, and Eldar, each of which will probably take you at least six hours to make your way through. All told you're in the ballpark of forty hours here, territory rare outside of the RPG genre.The storylines of each campaign intertwine, and it's enjoyable to play through the conflict over the Aurelian subsector from each faction's perspective. While the factions do have their differences and each requires a slightly different approach to battle, when you get down to it the mission structure is pretty much the same in each campaign. You enter a map and must fight your way along its linear path to the main objective points, and then face a final boss, assault, or siege at the end of the path. Luckily the fundamental gameplay is enjoyable and enough mission variety is built within this framework to keep things from getting boring.The multiplayer game remains essentially unchanged, except that now all six factions are playable by anyone who buys Retribution regardless of whether or not they own any of the prior Dawn of War II games. Each faction lends itself to a different style of play, but they're well-balanced enough that you can be successful with any one of them. Multiplayer games focus on the capture and holding of control points, and like the single-player game are more tactics-focused than most strategy games – you have to do more with less rather than trying to overwhelm your opponents with masses of units. Although personally I had more fun with the campaigns because they are more story-focused and can draw upon the rich Warhammer 40K universe, the multiplayer game can certainly hold its own with any other real-time strategy game's multiplayer mode.Overall, the game features top-notch production values. The graphics are detailed and the animations capture the personalities of the heroes and units under their command. The voice acting is excellent, and the actors have the advantage of working with a great script. Retribution is an excellent value and a great game, and a no-brainer for those who played either of the previous games. And if you're new to Dawn of War II, Retribution is a great place to begin your experience.			"

DAWN OF WAR II RETRIBUTIONDawn of War II Retribution is the second expansion and third edition of the Relic Entertainment RTS Dawn of War II (2009), following its predecessor Chaos Rising (2010). It takes the setting of the 41st millenium and lets the player experience it from a tactical combat perspective, controlling resources to build a better, more refined army than your opponent in order to claim victory.The game consists of three main elements as well as side features. These are as follows:MULTIPLAYERThe meat of the game for most players is the dynamic multiplayer which allows for intense tactical combat in 1v1 to 3v3, free for all and team free for all. The mainstay is the victory point control mode, a system whereby the winner is the first to drain their opponent out of victory points, whereas annihilation mode, where victory is the destruction of the enemy base, is slightly simpler. The multiplayer has many strenghts that have seen it through a prosperous lifespan:- Very in-depth tactical combat- Asymmetrical faction balance- Dynamic map design- Well balanced commander mechanics- Unique flow and pacing- Tactical combat that does not require lots of APM but perfect execution and follow-upHowever it harbours some flaws:- The unmodded game has certain poor balance choices- The ranked multiplayer is mostly dead due to stagnation and broken leaderboards- A few maps are almost unplayable in their lack of quality- The game has not received a balance patch since late 2011- The multiplayer is incredibly challenging and thus very hard to get intoThe game itself is very different to the one it followed up, Dawn of War, and this has turned many old DoW I players off it. I believe however the change is a necessary improvement to keep the franchise fresh, having been adapted from the Company of Heroes formula that proved to make a well established, well regarded RTS set in World War II.It is well known that the game has mroe depth with mod, so you shoudl look at these in particular:- Elite Balance Mod: http://www.dawnofwar.info- Codex Edition Mod: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/DoW2-CECAMPAIGNAlthough perhaps not as well designed as the vanilla game's campaignh, it allows for playthroughs with all factions and thus has replayability. Take the squad based combat to explore the story further in somethign that is worth looking at to grasp some mechanics.THE LAST STANDSimilar to a MOBA, this PvE aspect takes individual heroes in an arena and pits them against waves of enemy hordes. Especially fun with friends when you can combo each hero's abilities and work together, however sadly it only contains two different maps, though both play out differently.FEATURESArmy Painter: Allows you to customise your warriors before going into battle to choose pre-loaded schemes or make your own, including allowing players upload their own custom badges.Game History: Tracks all multiplayer stats so you can see just who and what you are losing to.World Builder: A piece of software I have found myself in for many an hour which gives you all the tools the developers had when making maps, incredibly enthralling and I recommend Duncan's guide for working out how to use it: http://www.dowreplays.net/DOW-II-Map-Making-Guide.pdfCONCLUSIONIt is an intensely tactical and strategic game with large depth and scope better with mods, but suffers from a thinning community and lack of developer support.If you like a challenge and an experience with something that is so unique, this is definitely worth ti if you can get in with the community.

												A dynamic, fast-paced strategy, aiming to combine being agile and being able to know your priorities at all times. A somewhat drastical change from Dawn of War I, DoW II still offers respectable gaming experience. Introducing the most of the classical races - Space Marines, Chaos Marines, Orks, Imperial Guard, Tyranids and Eldar, the plethora of races is not too much, but enough to keep the players satisfied. I definitely recommend this game to each and every Warhammer fan, especially to SoulStorm professionals !			"

												A must-have for strategy gamers. Always after Company of Heroes, but still there...unless you love Warhammer, in which case it'd probably be something like ""Dawn of War II > Company of Heroes"".Loads of units and armies (considering you have all expansions) and many customization options (something that COH1 lacks, just saying) make this game a pretty wise choice if you see it on a sale (remember, grab it with all expansions!!).

												DOW 1 IS my favourite RTS game of all time. How does DOW 2 stack up? It's different... and, for me at least, dissapointing.The Good:- Gorgeous graphics - Decent OST and great sound effectsThe Bad:- It's a reskinned Company of HeroesCOH is about realism, squads trying to hold positions, while the enemy tries to flank. DAW is all about over-the-top glorious barnies. No matter how much I try to love DOW 2, Skirmish games are summed up in one word, FRUSTRATING.Instead of enjoying massive fights, 90% of the time you're playing cat and mouse, chasing rogue enemy units around the map as they steal your points. I'm no RTS God, but I can hold my own. This isn't challenging, it's just incredibly annoying and frustrating. You never get a chance to watch your units in action or enjoy a big fight, since your constantly chasing after the next little peon sneaking through the gaps of your defense to capture a point. When a big fight does happen, the enemy usually just retreats.It wouldn't be so bad if your unit cap wasn't so ridiculously low, there's no way to guard everything and you're constantly running around the map with incredibly slow moving units, fast moving air units would've helped.The retreat function, could've been a useful feature but totally spoils everything. You harm some units just a little, they retreat, while your units are chasing the retreating units down, the AI sends another small squad to steal a point on the opposite end of the map. Your attention goes towards them and you send another squad half way accross the map to chase them down. Your first squad follows the retreating units to their base and gets wiped out or you just retreat as they chase you to your base then they retreat... This isn't Dawn of War.Conclussion:My patern of playing DOW 2 over the years is, miss the graphics and theme, decide to play a Skirmish (not a fan of online play). Remember how incredibly annoying and frustrating the gameplay is. Stop playing and go back to DOW 1.			"

												I have just scratched the surface of this game yet, but i am allready impessed how entertaining and polished it is. I really like it, and this is even more suprising for me, because i normally dont like Real Time Strategy games, but i guess its more a Tactical Strategy game. What i dont like alot is all the DLC that you have to pay for, but half of the stuff is cosmetic and the other half are races for Multiplayer, so its not that a big deal.Graphics are great, no crashes or bugs that i would have seen. Its deffinatly a solid Single player experience, the MP looks good too and there is also a coop multiplayer mode called ""The Last Stand"" thats really fun together with other pepole.Overall i am suprised how good this is, its deffinatly recommended if you like the genre.

												Probably one of the best Warhammer 40k game out there. Captures the universe pretty dam well, consdering how indepth it is. The gameplay is very tricky to get used to as first, if your a regular rts player it'll throw you off abit as the focus is on getting your army out there taking ground and points to gain your resources. Alot more thought has to go behind your attacks and its sure as ♥♥♥♥ alot more satisfying defeating anyone you face. You've gotta kit out your sqods with the wargear they need depending on your situation. Your leader units play a huge role with the wargear and abilites.The Single player while abit limited has is still alot of fun and aot of replay value.In short its a tricky to master but if you stick with it and not run off to a simpler rts (♥♥♥♥ing SC2)			"

												Really, what can you say about Dawn of War 2 that hasn't already been said? It's a fantastic combination of so many things. The strategy of an RTS is there, with squad based combat, cover mechanics, a counter system, and tons of lore-friendly units to 40k while playing as any one of 6 main factions: The fearsome Space Marines, the swarming Tyranids, DA ORKS, the numerous Imperial Guard, the demonic Chaos Space Marines, and the cocky Eldar who totally didn't help to inspire a certain teleporting, hit-and-run Overwatch character who pretty much directly rips off the warp spider *cough* Tracer *cough*I've been a fan of Dawn of War and Warhammer 40k in general since middle school, playing the crap out of some tabletop 40k, the first DoW, all its' expansions, mods, etc, and the same goes for the series belonging to the second DoW game - this one. This is the most feature complete of the Dawn of War 2 series, having all the factions and a fully featured last stand mode, though it is lacking a little in the campaign department when compared to the base game and its' initial expansion - those campaigns were godlike and this one just sorta falters in comparison.That said, the multiplayer and last stand still hold up, with extremely well made RTS mechanics mixed expertly with Action RPG/Moba style mechanics in a way that NO WAIT PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ITS NOT WHAT YOU THINKYes the game has some Moba elements, and take it from a guy who isn't a big Moba fan, it pulls it off incredibly well. Each squad has a small set of upgrades you can add on and choose between as well as levelling up as they do combat, increasing health, damage, energy, etc. and making veteran squads and vehicles significantly more powerful than ones pumped out and sent to die, and as a result making unit survival a very important aspect of the game. Each unit has a mass range of abilities on their own, too, more often than not, helping them to be counters to various things in the game. No unit feels necessarily underpowered or useless - and even the largest units can feel fragile when countered properly.There's also the hero system - every game, you pick from one of 3 heroes to your respective faction. The heroes have a much higher level cap than the standard units (10 instead of 4), and have a much larger tree of upgrades to pick between and mix and match to find a loadout that suits your style, with higher tier weaponry, armor, and abilities not necessarily being better and instead being unique and useful in their own way. The hero also isn't an overpowered beast, meaning you still have to manage them the same way you would any other unit and hope they don't die and have to be revived.If you're here from Dawn of War 1, I'm afraid base building is gone mostly. There’s only basic defense building now. You also won't find massive armies in this game - the armies are significantly smaller as are the maps, but that doesn't necessarily translate to less fun. Take it from a Command & Conquer junkie, base building is great, but it isn't something that's missed in this game as there's enough strategic value added in through all the other new stuff that the removal of base building doesn't detract from the fun of the game in the slightest, nor does it necessarily speed the game pace up either - games can still slog on with your armies valiantly holding positions and fighting to the last man, and it's absolutely incredible with a huge amount of detail put into everything.I love Dawn of War 2. I love Dawn of War 1. It's that simple. This game doesn't REPLACE the first game, so if you have to pick between the two, there is no clear winner - with its' larger scale, base building, and incredible mods and content, the first Dawn of War will always be a fantastic game. But if you're looking for a smaller scale 40k RTS/RPG that's still incredibly fun and highly tactical, I'd recommend this game any day. I can't think of any other RTS that ever has or ever will do as good a job at feeling like a complete definition of what RTS can be than the Dawn of War series. You will, with certainty, get your money's worth.			"

												Dawn of War 2 is an example of a good strategy about Space Marines. You can't have an enormously large army, only several tactical squads along with few units of Combat Heavy Machinery. Tactics and small groups of soldiers - those are the words about space marines (It's not a cannon meat like Imperial Guard afterall). But... that kind of gameplay doesn't appply to any other side of conflict though (except for Chaos, probably).I really liked approach in both MP and SP - a lot of customization options, ability to upgrade your squads the way you want to make them more effective for certain combat situations.Also, what makes this game great - realistic look of it. You don't have some cartoonish battle brothers of Blood Raven order, nor anime-styled eldars... Imperial Guard actually feel like common soldiers, rather than green plastic Army Men toys. (Not saying anything bad about original DOW)Retribution... well, I completely disaprove the idea of all races having the same darn campaign. It was ridiculous in Soulstorm, it is ridiculous here. What's the point of having other campaigns, if Space Marines version is canon anyways? (Still, ORC BOYZ RULZZZ! WAAAAGH!) And yeah... Diomedes sucks. I know, that he's always pinned there and a source of memes just like Boreale... But I'd rather play my old Force Commander or Gabriel Angelos (even though, that he'd be OP af, 'cause he can destroy legions of enemies with his badass look)AS for Last Stand - it sure great. Even though there is only one map - there is a huge variety of ways to play it. Different pieces of equpment, diverse characters of different races. Ain't it cool?P.S. (This review was made for all of DOW2 games - original, Chaos Rising and Retribution)8.5/10			"

												If there's anything I love about this game, is that it stays true to most of the parts of the original Dawn of War games, the only differences are, which, I honestly see as improvements, for the most part:Removal of Morale system but addition of the Suppression system, this allowed you to slow incoming enemies and not only that, but have them under the manner of decreased accuracy.Knockback still existsSadly, kill sync animations aren't as common as they once were, but this also is a bit of an enhancement, as killsyncs can happen too almost too frequently in the original Dawn of War, where you can still attack the enemy doing it and, as a result, you can waste abilities when they're simply immune to the damage.Low and High cover still exists, thankfully, but bombed areas now serve as light cover, and even end up changing the floor texture of the map.While not all of the units from the first set of games exist, a large majority of them are still around, and even then, they're replaced with similar functioning units (Possessed Chaos Marines to Bloodletters, Kasrkins to Stormtroopers, Flash Gitz to Kommandos, etc.)Most infantry are less versatile, but as a result, have a bit more benefits. Soldiers can't be upgraded with every single thing.There is no more armory/blacksmith upgrades. Upgrades are done specifically for squads. Level up system also serves as a bit of a HP and Energy upgrade, too.Speaking of Energy, Energy system prevents massive spellspam then retreat.Voice Acting is wonderfully done, where some lines in Dawn of War I wasn't that well done, along with a bit of humor from characters' voice lines.Shiny paint for the armies now exists.The only bad improvements I've seen is;Vehicles easily overpower most sorts of infantry, even if they do have anti-vehicle specialties. Vehicles are easily the meta unlike in Dawn of War II, where you use both vehicles and soldiers to their best course of action.Population stays locked at 100, whereas the cap in Dawn of War is increased by base levels or sometimes, other means (such as building another certain building, for IG, building an Infantry Command post raises Infantry cap). This annoyed me, as I couldn't spread my group all over the map, and it made some battles very little instead of one huge battle.There is no longer base building, which removes the feel of having your own base to use as well as making things less 'homey'No more Listening Posts, this especially frustrated me.Retreat functions can be especially annoying, where even if ranged hits do land a shot, they do very minor damage, where melee does significantly larger damage (Vehicles at least can't retreat, however)Vehicle vs. Hero, guess who wins?Overall, however, this is still a very fun game, and I recommend trying it for it's humorous colors, well done voice acting, gameplay that still stays a bit true to the roots of the system.P.S. SEGA, please make Dawn of War III or more expansions that would include some more races, such as the Dark Eldar, and the Tau.			"

												!! do NOT buy if you intend to play 1v1, 2v2 etc. literally nobody is playing it. !!First to note: it is a very good game, lots (but somewhat repetitive) content, proper multiplayer functionality, chatrooms, customgames, different gamemodes: 1v1 up to 4v4 aswell as the last stand DLC's. Also the game Indirectly supports mods.Definately not worth its full price anymore, but on a sale the 15€~ for the Grand Masters Collection or such it can be worth it IF, as said, you dont intend to play the RTS part of the game aka the 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 modes.I bought the ""Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Grand Master Collection"" during a sale, according to steamcharts there are always around 1.000~ players online in DOW2 Retribution.You want to play Last Stand? Takes around 1 - 2min to find a game.You want to play some custom game? There will be generaly 2 - 6 custom games available for you to choose from, which depending on the needed player count will take 1 - 10min to start.You want to play CO-OP in the Campain but have no friends? Alone the default Chat-room has around 80~ ppl in it almost all the time.You want to play the RTS part of the game? I've spend 30, yes thirty, minutes total, at different times in the que for 1vs1 ranked mode. I found 1 single game in that time which lasted around 5min then my opponent left because he was loosing. There also is a ""Leaderboard"" showing the top ranked players, the rank 1 - 5 players all have around 400 total games, losses & wins combined. This game is from 2012. So yes, the RTS aspect of the game is as dead as it can be. If that does not bother you and its CO-OP or Last Stand you are after, go ahead and hf. However as the RTS part was the sole reason why I bought this game I returned it after figuring out that it was dead, but it is not to say that DOW cant still be worth its sale-money value if you dont care for the RTS part. The campain is the campain, which is a mixture of a RTS & RPG, just w/o base & unit building. While last stand is a grind-RPG basically on 2 different maps with 2 other players, where you have to choose from pre-designed ""heroes"" that level up and unlock new gear from the XP you gain after loosing a last stand game (you cant win that mode it just gets more difficult untill you wipe). Last stand could also be seen as a Tower Defence with movable Heroes to a certain degree.			"

Pros:- Solid campaigns for each faction- Solid skirmish- Solid multiplayer- Well polished- Well optimized- Plenty of different armies- Very good looking- Includes an improved army painter- Many more things one expects from Relic, by nowNow, that all this is understood, there is something missing. This game lacks the lasting appeal of its predecessor. Cons- Little mod support- Simplified tech trees with less units- Overpowered Heroes- Retricted upgrades for heroes and units in skirmish/multiplayer- The Campaign is virtually identical for each faction- Lacks the creativity of the original (voice acting, unit models/textures, gameplay mechanics)This is a good game, but it is overshadowed by the original.

												One of my favourite RTS games.The campaign consists of a somewhat linear series of missions where you receive rewards in form of items and upgrades for your heroes and units.There are 6 different races (Space Marine, Imperial Guards, Tyranid, Chaos Marine, Ork and Eldar) which consists of four (4) heroes and several units.When playing the campaign you primarily use your heroes but you can create units and switch your heroes to an Honor Guard (A free and stronger version of regular units).In Multiplayer you can play from 1v1 to 4v4 and Free For All. There's ranked play and Custom Games. I mostly play the Campaign and The Last Stand but this is somewhat entertaining.There's also a game-mode called The Last Stand in which you choose a hero, equip him/her with Wargear and then fight against up to 20 waves of enemies. There are 2 maps which varies in difficulty.The game got good graphics and the gameplay is great but it's somewhat lacking in base building due to the fact that you only got your main building and the extra buildings you got available includes Turrets and sometime bunkers.It's not fully optimized but it runs close to perfect for me, my Graphic cards gets a bit warm in the menu which is weird but other than that it works good.I highly recommend it to players who enjoyed the earlier Dawn of War 2 games but for those who liked Dawn of War 1, don't expect the same building management.I still hope that Dawn of War 3 is being developed but the future looks dark.

												I know a lot of people weren't huge fans of the way the hero mechanic was used in this series, but being a long time RTS gamer myself, I enjoyed a break from the norm. For the main campaign, there is no base building, only squad based unit management. It makes for a fun, fresh approach to a genre that hasn't seen a lot of revolutionary changes. Additionally, they've incorporated their own brand of survival mode called Last Stand, which is where I feel the entire DoW II series really shines. You choose and control a commander unit from one of the eight races, then match up with two other human players and play against wave after wave of increasingly difficult AI units. Each wave cleared provides experience, which is applied to your chosen commander and leads towards further war gear unlocks. Each level gained gives you access to more powerful abilities, attack types and survivability options.The game has it's issues in executing some of what people have come to expect from the older games in the DoW series, but if you approach Retribution without these preconceived notions, you will find a lot to enjoy.

												Only problem with this game is that all the campaigns, regardless of race will have the same missions till the very end, the only differences are the cutscenes and the overall goal at the end. BUT regardless of that I would 11/10 listen again and again to CAPTAIN DIE YO MEDES SHOUTING ""IT IS THE BEEEEEINNNBLEEEEHHDDDEEEE!""			"

												6/10 A very interesting, combat based RTS game with a pretty straightforward campaign. While up front this game seems like a well built game, it has some wierd balancing issues. Due to this, the selection for armies is pretty narrowed-down. The first example shows itself in the 'army painter', a utility for players to further customize their forces. It seems unassuming at first, but upon closer inspection, the issues begin to show themselves. When selecting colors, there are a few colors that end up giving boons in gameplay. To summarize, the only colors that make tactical sense is red, because it is more or less direct upgrade from all the other colors. Moving on to the army selection. This is where the balancing issues really start intervening with gameplay. The game includes many of the signature armies from Games-Workshop's tabletop game, most notably the Imperial Guard. Normally, each army has their own polarizations, such as one may be better at meelee combat, or one may be better at shooting. The problem here is, one of the armies, the Imperial Guard, is not polarized at all, and excells in all areas. This makes it the only real choice for players if they want to have a good experience. Some players actually try to cheat at the game in order to make armies like the Space Marines (the absolute worst faction) viable.Dealing with both of these issues, I found myself very limited in my choices when actually playing. The only combo I ended up using were red Imperial Guardsmen (Guardsmen are the all around best unit in the Imperial Guard). Buy at your discretion.			"

												I had really high expectations for this one, hoping it would have a non-linear campaign similar to that of Dark Crusade/Soulstorm with the Dawn of War II's RPS-like gameplay (since you had multiple factions to choose from for the campaign), but the first four missions are literally almost identical for every one of them with just some minor flavor-stuff changed.

												I wrote several reviews about this game, this is my final. This is not a strict strategy game, its a MOBA+strategy, a hybrid. Its good only for 2v2 and 3v3 and that's what most players of this game play. Its well suited for Faction war meaning all 3 heroes of the same faction together in the same team fighting all the 3 heroes of another faction. Playing the game like that its fun so i recommend real life friends to get it as this is how i started this game. Dont get the game if you are to play it solo you wont have fun. It would be great if its campaign had 4 player cooperate instead of 2 so that's a big deal negative, if there is a patch  that makes coop campaign for 4 players that would be great for each one controlling 1 hero. In general i only recommend to get this game if you have a real life premade team lets say or you plan to play it with online friends, its good for that.  DoW 2 Retribution is a poorly made mini CoH 1 and has nothing to do with Warhammer 40K. DoW 1 mods are WAY BETTER and are 40K SOLID. The graphics of this game are great and has a very good performance, if rating a game was to rate graphics it would get a 10/10. To a casual gamer i recommend this game, to someone who wants 40K no i dont. This is a review for both DoW 2 and DoW 2 Retribution. This game is over-simplified that's a major con of it, and its very small, its like mini mini mini...(n-times)...mini me.BUTThere is a mod called The Elite mod which added more units to the game and rebalanced it to a much better degree than retail and added in its strategy value, so if it is to play  DoW 2 get Elite mod, it has way more SOLID gameplay.Also another mod called Codex Edition, it is incomplete on 1 faction sadly, but as it is its still very good on its gameplay, it makes dow 2 very attractive but sadly it has some bugs.Personally i dont like DoW 2 for it could have been WAY BETTER but this is my personal opinion, many other pro gamers like it and find it real fun to play.Also there is another important feature of this game, the quotes, for every type of attack and direction of the attack a unit receives it quotes that attack so you know what it coming and from where and you can react fast and accurately, this is a great feature this game has. The game has very good graphic as well and it is beautiful. I dislike it cause of the gameplay meaning it COULD have been way better than it is, which is good still.********VERY IMPORTANT**********Base Turrets are the reason this game's multiplayer was bad. Base in multiplayer can heal and reinforce which is enough as troops can defend the stronghold, having base turrets made low mobile factions to have a HUGE disadvantage as they couldnt deal with retreat option against very mobile factions. Retreat option itself didnt break the game, base turrets did as it was impossible to attack a stronghold except very late game. If base turrets didnt exist(a player can make turrets i am talking about the default base turrets) this game's multiplayer would be MUCH better.			"

												Retribution is one of my favourite games.  Not for the campaign, which is decent, or the playable races, which are utterly fantastic, but for Last Stand.  It's a perfect blend of character advancement, teamwork, micromanagement, and the occasional epic win.That they're now adding another hero to a game 5 years old alongside a bug patch indicates that Relic is continuing to support the product.  That's a refreshing thing to see.			"

												I think I played it enough to write a review.First of the all the game is amazing, there are 6 factions with which you can play with in the Single player and these factions are:The space marines, Chaos space marines, Imperial Guards, Orcs, Elder and the Tyranids.The campaign doesn't change between the races, but every time although you go through the same places and fight vs the same enemies it is still really fun and feels a little bit different!.Unlike in the previous games such as, Dawn of War: Soulstorm or Dawn of War 2 Chaos Rising, here you have 4 commanders which you control and you also construct an army but not a base, you get your units by capturing a beacon or barracks (depends on your race) and from there you can deply troops into the battlefield.The multiplayer is pretty active, a few cutom games here and there and it seems like people can't stop playing in the last stand! (The last stand is a game mod in which you group up with 2 more players and try to survive waves of enemies up to 20 waves)The game also has many dlc's many of them are skins for the multiplayer or some wargear for the single player, except for two DLC's which are the Tau commander and the Necron Overlord, these DLC's might be expensive, but if you really like the last stand which I mentioned above, you might want to consider buying it. The DLC will give you a new commander to play with in the last stand and he is damn powerful, but as powerful as he is, it doesn't mean he is more powerful than the other commanders, he has his pros and cons.Overall the game is amazing, the story is nice, really fun single player campaign and the multiplayer is active.

												Alright. Let me start out with saying that in this game, contrary to Dawn of War +expansions (All respect to those as they're plain awesome), you actually get the feel of the Hero type you choose, and you get that feeling of being totally BEE AYE. You get to integrate a Hero, such as (And one of my personal favorites!) the Inquisitor, into a full on battle, and at last those herotypes get the venerable strength and versatility they deserve according to the lore.The gameplay itself, albeit lacking the whole base expansion thing as far as I've seen, as many other games got, this game makes up with it with on-the-go deployment whilst getting to fully fledge the units of yours into defensive postures much like the Company of Heroes style of games and you get to really unfold your tactical knowledge and strategic flair to their full extent, and put these to the test. So if you're a selfproclaimed master tactician, this is a game where you get to test it, without having humongous unconfined levels where the enemy can literally hide behind a bush and stay alive in that way. Not to mention, you get the opportunity of fielding your factions most devastative vehicles and infantry short of a full on exterminatus.The graphics are good though at first a tad confusing overlay wise, but aside from smaller nitpickings, I love the setting the game sets for each individual map and the level of details compromising the rather blocky HUD. In short: If you're in for a thrill and want to see some De&De up close, and get to feel like you're actually a commander in WH40K, this is the game for you.  Now have me excused while I go back to wreak more havoc on those xenos!			"

												10/10 One of my most played games recorded. The story does continue like it should with some epic graphic cutscenes that surely don't disappoint. The main reason I rate this so high and recommend is due to the multiplayer/Last StandMultiplayer- The multiplayer is very fun, having a few different modes that you may play with several tiers of units that you must micro manage to get that advantage over your opponents, strategy is critical to your victory. Sacrificing 50 points just to create your most powerful unit to then turn the tide of battle is one of those decisions you may have to make.Last Stand- Last stand is my favorite part of this game and is where most of my hours have gone. A strategic survival battle where you and 2 others last against many waves of enemies while using your unique skills which propose your role to the battle. Some are more AoE and taking out infantry where you may die fast, whereas some are bulky armored and focus more on the bigger tougher enemies on the battlefield.			"

												Came from Dawn Of War, Stayed for Last Stand. I think, over 70% of the people who play this game, came for a better version of the original Dawn Of War, but got disappointed. Personally, I love base building, and to find out that it was removed was a real kick in the teeth. I've played multiplayer with a group of friends on both games, and they all agree that this seems watered down due to the absense of base building, but agree that the game feels much nicer. One other thing that bothered us was how easy the game seemed, even on harder difficulties. Yet, the original Dawn Of War is insane and very difficult. However, Last Stand is amazing. I play with the same group, and we really enjoy the game. Currently, our go to game to waste time. Really enjoyable and for that, I'll rate this positive. Don't get me wrong, multiplayer is still okay but, not as good as the original.I've played the campaign with a friend, and it's very good. We both enjoy the leveling system. I'm quite disappointed the fact you can't have 4 people, considering you control 4 heros and squads which can be real hard to micro manage each of their movements, especially since you have different roles like tanks and healers. Having 4 player campaign would be awesome. None the less I still enjoy the campaign.			"

												I'm a little hesitant about recommending this, despite having enjoyed this game a lot.I can definitely see a few problems about this game.First one being that nobody plays the multiplayer anymore, so the best course of action is to also buy extra copies to give to friends for private multiplayer sessions.Second problem being that if you play this game before playing Dawn of War 1, DoW1's gameplay will be ruined for you.Aaaand the third problem: With THQ being dead, i'm concerned that a good chunk of that money will go to Games Workshop instead of Relic Entertainment.The positive aspects of the game would definitely have to be the combat system. While traditional RTS fans will dislike the lack of base building, i felt that the combat system was pretty well done, with shrubs and small pieces of rubble providing cover for infantry, vehicles taking extra damage from behind, and infantry suppression from weapon platforms such as the heavy bolter. In addition to the gameplay, the campaign is really about as good as it can get despite all the campaigns using the same map.Final verdict: While I believe that you should play this game if you have the slightest interest in Warhammer 40,000, wait for a bloody sale. Do you really want Games Workshop to earn 20 buxx for every copy of this game sold?			"

												My dad and I Co-Op'ed through this DLC in the game. It was a good extension to the original game. I can't really say anything about this that I didn't already say about the original game.Originally posted by Gagner:This was my dad and I's first Warhammer game and we decided to Co-Op our way through it. It was fun and overall a good introduction to the Warhammer universe. We're both looking forward to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III.Pros:- A lot of content for the price we paid. We picked it up on a steam sale at the time. However, the current asking price of $20 is still quite good in my opinion given how long it took us to play through it.- Gameplay is relatively easy to understand. The only problems we had usually resulted from my dad playing on a laptop. The controls for moving the camera around weren't very kind to him. (A disclaimer though is that it could have just as easily been user error potentially)Cons:- I can't particularly think of anything off the top of my head. "

												Is it an ok game to pass a few hours on? well just look at the hours ive put in should tell you something.Having said that can I recommend it now? probably not.Whilst it's a fine game and deceptive simple looking it contains a heap of good strategy, some solid modes like the arena game, a good enough campaign though not as good as DOW 1's but it's the multiplayer that lets the game down in the end. When and if you do find a match you're going to run into the same issues Company of heroes 2 has in that your rarely going to get a game where not one person drops, robbing all players regardless of time played of their exp. Most do it out of spite, some just drop right at the start leaving you with a mess of a match as the ill equipped AI take over just goes around capping everything removing any fun or strategy from the game. Rarely have I enjoyed a good online match and 90% you will be met with nothing but frustration as players rage quit right at the end of the match to rob everyone of their rightful exp. The multiplayer is seriously flawed for this reason with no punishment system in place this will keep happening.For those reasons even though I had fun for a while I can't in all honesty recommend it to someone looking for a good experience either single player or multiplayer. Even for 40k fans there's games out there that do it far better at the end of the day.			"

												Is it an ok game to pass a few hours on? well just look at the hours ive put in should tell you something.Having said that can I recommend it now? probably not.Whilst it's a fine game and deceptive simple looking it contains a heap of good strategy, some solid modes like the arena game, a good enough campaign though not as good as DOW 1's but it's the multiplayer that lets the game down in the end. When and if you do find a match you're going to run into the same issues Company of heroes 2 has in that your rarely going to get a game where not one person drops, robbing all players regardless of time played of their exp. Most do it out of spite, some just drop right at the start leaving you with a mess of a match as the ill equipped AI take over just goes around capping everything removing any fun or strategy from the game. Rarely have I enjoyed a good online match and 90% you will be met with nothing but frustration as players rage quit right at the end of the match to rob everyone of their rightful exp. The multiplayer is seriously flawed for this reason with no punishment system in place this will keep happening.For those reasons even though I had fun for a while I can't in all honesty recommend it to someone looking for a good experience either single player or multiplayer. Even for 40k fans there's games out there that do it far better at the end of the day.			"

												This is a great action packed game with great graphics!  It has three game modes including single and co op campaign with 6 different races. The campaign can be set on easy, normal, hard and very hard.  The second game mode is multiplayer. You can also choose of 6 different races and their costume colors. You can do many different things on multiplayer, for e.g: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 etc. But my personal favourite is Last Stand. You can choose out of 6 races (or 7 if you have dlc) and can the play on two different maps. You play with three different people and as you gain more experience you can make your character stronger by giving him armor, weapons, and traits and abilities. You should seriously think about getting this game!			"

												A great but slightly different take on the DOW RTS franchise, small changes in gameplay and lot less army building and mass warfare, however it trades that in from the traditional games to a more strategic approach, however it does include the Last Stand mode, where you and 2 others play the faction heroes to survive the hoards of the galaxy on either the bloodied colluseum or the anvil of khorne, amazing amount of fun. 10/10			"

												Retribution cannot continue the streak of marvel that Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising set up even although it is continuing their story. The gameplay is a mix of Dawn of War 2 as well as previous installments, meaning there's less hero composition and more standard units to recruit and replace. While ultimately being fun to play, the several campaigns all play out the same way and feel far inferior to the epicness of Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising.The Last Stand is by far the best version we've seen so far and for me personally, one of the truly redeeming features of Retribution, which, all in all, still is a great game, but not as great as the previous installments.A good pick for Dawn of War as well as Warhammer 40k fans, but probably not the best choice for people looking for a good RPG / Tactical Strategy game.

												If you are coming from the plethora of Dawn of War games before then you are well prepared for this installation of Dawn of War: Retribution. I won't lie, if you are here for the campaign, it is fairly dull. There are 6 factions to play. They include: Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, Tyranids, Imperial Guard, and Chaos Space Marines. The campaign takes place in a galaxy with numerous planets, representing your possible missions and various rewards. Your army consists of a couple heroes that carry over gamer after game and which you can level up and acquire new and better gear for. Playing through the campaign once is not bad. However, it is pretty much the same for each factions, meaning it will get repetetive after one or two walkthroughs. Don't want the campaign? How about skirmish against the AI to test your skills. It heavily revolves around controlling objectives to gain points and power to build your armies. The biggest downfall of the game was base building though. You start the game with one building. It's your command center that is responsible for spawning all your troops and researching all the tech. The goal of the match is to destroy the enemy HQ. It has a lot of HP and it takes more advanced troops to finally put it down. I have to say that I enjoy base building like Dawn of War Soulstorm had so this game was dissapointing. Multiplayer is largely as described above, just against players.What I really found fun in this game was Arena mode, also called The Last Stand. You can actually purchase it as a sepparate game and avoid paying the Full Price all together. The Last Stand mode lets you pick your general. They all start with level 1 and level up until 20, with each level granting them unique weapons, armors, and abilities. Your general is then taken to an arena (currently 2 variants) with 2 other players and left to survive 20 waves. Each wave throws various galactic abominations at you from all different factions and your only purpose is th ""survive"". So, can you?All in all. It's not a bad game. Graphics are alright and the campaign is good for 1-2 run throughs, the last stand mode is a lot of fun, and multiplayer is action packed. I would definitelly play this game at least once for the experience, but if you are the kind of person who expects major battles with big bases, this isn't the game for you. The population cap limits your army to a specific size and the lack of base building limits the ingenuity that some players might have brought to the battlefield.Good luck!			"

												By buying this thing you get awesome multiplayer PvE arena minigame. You also get a medicore sttrategy game, but who cares, the PvE arena is the most underrated thing ever!The mechanics of the arena are simple, you choose a hero (most core races avaliable for free, the rest can be bought from DLCs), kill stuff, get exp, die, level up, gear up, choose skills, repeat. Making a successful build is very rewarding. Must have, especially when on sale.			"

												Greatness. When the first Dawn of War 2 came out, people talked about how dumbed-down it was when compared to 1. With Retribution, it is possible that Relic surpassed the first game. The multiplayer emphasises skill instead of economy. Knowing what units to build and how to use them is what wins games. The factions are different yet balanced. Chaos Rising has a much better campaign, but this is still the finest RTS multiplayer made.			"

												Good game, but the campaigns are dissapointing as its basically same one for each race. Further, now Relic charges $3 for each race with few new items for last stand with dlc instead of doing it for free. Big Dissapointment. This could be end of the line for me when it comes to DoW2 series. Game has potential, especially last stand, but Relic decided to go cheap and charge for few items instead of putting some real work on campaign dlc or fixing bugs			"

												Epic Battles!This game is a RTS title that’s focussed on maintaining each and every unit you create.I love this game because each skirmish or multiplayer game is an epic adventure from start to finish.This game focuses allot more on the units rather than the base management. As soon as you start the game you are aggressively pushing forward and capturing resource points across the map. This style of play immediately puts you into the thick of it with the other player.  Which means fun right from the start!The campaign is very different from the skirmish part. It’s more like a dungeon crawl RPG with hero units you and a friend can control that go all over the map using special abilities from equipment you pick up or skills that you learn when you level up. It’s actually really fun.But this game shines on the multiplayer. The races are all very different and each race has 3 unique heroes than you take into battle. I can easily recommend this game to any RTS fan. There is allot more to this game than I explained in this short review. You’ll have a blast finding out all the different game modes.			"

												This reveiw is only about the multiplayer experience.Dawn of War 2:Retribution could have beenthe best rts game ever made. It offers 6 factions, each faction has 3 commanders and each commander can have 1 or 2 different playstyles, including wargear that you can buy for them to make them more adaptable to different situations, so the game has a lot of variety in playstyle.But the game still has some flaws, flaws that would have probably been fixed by THQ if they didnt shut down. For example the game can be pretty imbalanced in some matchups, for example chaos vs imperial guard, where the IG need to rush to tier 3 as fast as possible because every single tier 1 and tier 2 unit that the chaos forces ahve outclass the IG variant, the game is still fun though if you get a fair matchup, and i heard that the elite mod adressess a lot of balance issues and its pretty popular amongst the community, so if you dont like the base or get bored of it and want something else then you still have a good choice.Overall the game is still pretty good in its current state, its not a bad game, it can be a lot of fun at times, but it could be so much more, i wish relic would still bring new stuff to this game like they do with company of heroes, but if you are looking for a good strategy game in one of the most interesting settings in video game history, then this game might be what you need.

												I really do like this game. the last stand and multiplayer are very enjoyable indeed. Last Stand is where you choose a hero (ork, space marine, chaos, imperial guard or  tyranid) and you try to last as long as you can against hordes of enimies that get increasingly difficult. The multiplayer is where you fight against other people online. All fine and dandy... but then there's the campaign. In the campaign you choose from any of the five races (the same ones from the Last Stand) and work your way through a story (obviously) and you give your heroes better armour, weapons etc. The only problem is all of the campaigns are pretty much the same except for dialogue, troops and the race that you are. Though the campaign is kind of fun when you play with a friend.So it's a pretty good game over all and I enjoy it. But if you're looking for replayability on a campaign and that's all you want give it a miss. But if you don't care about that play it for multiplayer and Last Stand because they are really fun!			"

												Possibly one of the most addictive strategy games I've ever played for a while. It takes away the notion for the need for resource micromanaging. Everything set in for gameplay revolves around your units using tactics and other crucial perks your Race/Hero is made for. It may come off as intimidating at first wtih a steep learning curve, but it gets pretty fun once you pick it up learning how to formally use the perks on the given units. It also includes a neat campaign and a Last Stand arena.

9/10Got it on sale, but depending on your dedication to the game it is probably worth the full price.Tip: This version of dawn of war is more about fewer units and upgrades, so more about tactics to take out players. Also you are not building bases. You produce everything from one main center. The Pros:Tyranids are playable, awesome.Graphics are excellentUnit animations are satisfactoryStill can have good battlesIts warhammerDLC makes a good impact on the game. The Cons:Mass battles are gone, like the old dawn of warDestroying the enemy base takes forever(think c&c: Renegade, remember shooting at the same building for hours?)Overall great game.			"

												Two player coop with friend controlling Space Marines, Chaos SM, Eldar, Tyranids, Orks and Imperial Guard. Each has their own unique skills and character progression. This plays similarly to Company of Heroes.The stories for each race are sadly almost identical but I have come to terms with this because you get awesome coop and multiplayer and The Last Stand (TLS) which is a COBA (Co-Operative Battle Arena) where you take 3 people into a small arena with waves of enemies to beat your way through. There are 2 arena levels although maybe someday people will mod new ones in or mod new characters in. There are a few mods for this game and they seem to have a fairly stable following and as a whole the online prescence is stable and doesnt seem to be going anywhere.The Last Stand is by far my fave thing about this game. They even added a Necron Lord and a Tau Crisis Suit to play with, again sadly this is DLC but its one fo the few I just bit down and took it in the wallet. For a longtime TT fan, this game is gravy!

												There are  a few things that run wrong with this game. However, it just might be for me and no one else. This game is like lets make Dow 1 & 2 have a baby and call it Retribution. A lot of the things that I didn't like about the first game was the fact that it was just focused on Bloodravens and a handful of Space Marines. However, this game has 5 different factions to it. I LOVE that it is all optional. Unless your are trying to get that 100%. Then it is going to take some time. I think it is interesting that they still focused the game on a handful of people but they made it into different factions. Here is the thing, you can kind of play it like it was DoW 1 because you don't have to take anybody except the commander and then you are able to have more people in the game. The treasure chests are now there for resources instead of helpful items. In fact, the helpful items are not exactly gone but they are now abilities. Which is something that I love. I have to say that I am still more of a fan of the first game. However, Retribution is a damn fine game The abilities that you choose for your team is amazing. You don't even have to really upgrade anyone. That option is up to you. I don't really play a lot of games online. So I can't comment on the online play. The things that I didn't like about this game that I think it  may or may not be just me. Is that sometimes you click on an area they just don't go to it or even acknowledge it. I've had this weird skipping across the game sometimes but then when I loaded back it. It worked fine. I another thing is that I feel because there was so many options for factions, that the storlyine to all of them are short. With it's negatives, I still think this is a really good game. I like that they incorperate both the good from the earlier games. I like that there are more factions now. The skill system I think is way better in this than in DoW 2. I highly recommend playing this games.			"

												I like this game. A lot. I like the theme/setting of the game. This is particularly ironic because, as a player of tabletop wargames, I do not like the Warhammer 40k tabletop setting at all. But in this video game, the factions and their units look and play great.I've touched the campaign and looked at last stand, but I really spent my time in this game doing multiplayer (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, TFFA, and, always to my everlasting displeasure, annihilation).I like how this game is not about base-building and sending unit after unit off to die on the battlefield. It's about keeping units, and improving units. Because of the time you spend with your guys, this game is about loving your units. It's great to see that Guardian squad that I started the match with 18 minutes later, rolling with the support of a Warlock, embolded,  and dropping effective grenades in the late game. Or that Banshee squad who even after seeing some extremely close, close calls thoughout the match and coming within just a few hit points of an untimely death, regrouped and putting the hurts on a dreadnought in the late game. But not everyone can survive, and when you lose a unit the pain is real! You find yourself giving micro-eulogies to your fallen squads, thanking them for thier contribution to the effort and reminding them that it was, hopefully, not in vain.This is the aspect of the game that I like the most. But there are other cool things. I like that there are asymetrical maps (just like on my tabletop). I like how the hero characters (I've only play Eldar>Warlock) work in the game's mechanics. I like the suppression weapon platforms and how they work with arcs and set-up/break-down timers.I really like the timing of the game. I like how you have time to flank a turtling Techmarine who hides behind his too-many-turrets. Or how you can chose to just ignore his turret spam until you get to Tech level II and address it then. There's plenty of other places to attack. (Oh, how many times have I seen poor players, including my noob-self, continuing to attempt to push into turrets and pay the full cost for the choice when it could have addressed later?)Anyway. those are somethings I like about this game. I guess I paid $60 for this game when it came out and I've played for over 1500 hours, so that's less than 4 cents per hour. You can't beat that with a D-Cannon.			"

												Warhammer 40k DoW II is a moba like twist on the beloved origonal DoW franchise, for some it will be a welcome change, for others a turning point to other games.As an fan of the old DoW game / expansions i found that this was a wierd yet intriguing change for me, the game focuses less on base building (all you can build is generators and you can upgrade your main base, thats it) and focuses more on the constant exchanging of forces and holding capture points.For people who are used to the general combat of games like Star Craft II this will be similar to how you DoW II runs with no base building and a focus on controlling points. the big focus for this game is control and managing your units effectivly. this can be appealing to some and off putting for others this expansion / all in one game is better than DoW II itself and id say just get this as it adds more units and another storyline (which isnt amazing but works)so in general i would say if you want the old DoW game then give this a skip, but if you want a Warhammer 40k game similar to Star Craft II then id say go for itDisclaimer**i have played Star Craft II, im no pro or anything and i dont know 100% what im talking about so this is just a general view i can give and comparision from to 80+ hours ive played** "

												I only have The Last Stand DLC which is a multiplayer coop survival mode and is sold like a separate game. I like this game because of visuals and Warhammer assets. It just looks awesome, sounds awesome. It also play smooth, but if there is a lagging player all other players lag as well and playing it becomes disgusting. There are only 2 maps for this mode and 20 waves on each map. You'll need to play this maps over and over to get enough XP and be able to finish all 20 waves. At first I thought that it is lame, but the game is a pleasure to play and you enjoy to gain this XP and new weapons. You can also get a dose of adrenaline when playing on the last waves. Co-op is not enforced(I mean that everybody plays mostly solo), but if you get to agree with other players you can have even more fun using some tactics(happens rarely).			"

Just playing ring-around-the-strategic-points with 3-4 squads of infantry that never die because they can instantly retreat with little damage from ranged attacks. Last Stand mode gets pretty stale after you get to level 15 with a character. Pray to the Emprah that DoW 3 has more big action than this.			"

												The missions seemed bland and formulaic - Drop in, go somewhere, shoot things along the way, fight a boss once you reach the end. Occasionally this is broken up by the mission prodding you along (the infamous BEHNBLADE), or having to deal with fortified strongpoints.The gameplay itself actually seemed weaker than the previous DoW II titles - While it's still a very unit-centric squad-based RTT, there's a lot more units available to you and on the field in general, each with their own properties. Normally I wouldn't complain about having a lot to keep track of, but micro-heavy gameplay like slotting your infantry into good cover and placing/orienting heavy weapons squads works best when you're dealing with smaller forces rather than larger ones. This is especially amplified by the general trend towards smaller engagements; Fairly frequently, I'd be cramming 40 guardsmen into a space meant for a dozen Space Marines.Basic encounters tended to feel chaotic, but not urgent - Lots to keep track of, but not a whole lot on the line.Boss fights rapidly became repetitive. The nature of them, one at the end of every level, plus the limited unit selection brought about by 40k armies meant that, fairly often, I'd be fighting yet *another* Hive Tyrant, except this time in a jungle-themed arena rather than a gothic cathedral-themed one.Honestly, I think Chaos Rising is a lot stronger than Retribution, simply because it's closer to the overall design of the series. Retribution has a lot more units on the field to play around with, but Dawn of War 2 isn't a game that's designed for that and it shows. "

												I really enjoyed the game itself since I am a 40k fan and I am collecting miniatures as well, gameplay is pretty interesting with simple rules (hold the strategic points or simply annihilate your foe), multiplayer is decent, although have some issues like high pings and minor lags during the match. Last stand is a good feature, you can have fun with your friends or just random folks against waves of mobs which come more challenging one after another. Havent played campaign much so wont say anything much about it.In conclusion I would say, that I dont reccomend this game for people who dont know anything about Warhammer 40k universe, although if you are from chosen one, go and buy the game, most likely you wont regret it.

												If you like the 40k universe and Games Workshop this series is the only one worth having in my book, so far. But Dawn of War 2 is quite a different concept to your traditional build a base and destroy the enemy Command and Conquer style RTSYou have to be fairly proactive, you cant simply build an impenetrable base and watch swathes of your enemy try their best, you have a smaller force allowance and you have to seek out power nodes, control points and currency. BUT this does make for consistant tactical gameplay which makes you use your brain which is why we play RTS games.O and you can be Tyranids!...			"

												The thing that sets this strategy game apart from the rest is that its based almost exclusively on micromanagement. It is a very interesting game that is very fun online with a small but active community in the Elite mod for this game; which more or less is a balancing mod. In my opinion the game is much better paced than Company of heroes having a more skrimish type feel than a breaking through enemy defenses feel.  I recomend you get this game if it is on sale or if you have the money. In my top 5 stratagy games. (and I play a lot of stratagy games)			"

												Dawn Of War II Retribution Takes place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, a milky way galaxy filled with xenos, daemons and super soldiers called Space Marines. It has a campaign for all 6 playable races the Eldar, Chaos Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Space Marines, Tyranids, and Orks. It has a 3 player co op survival mode called The Last Stand, which has 2 different maps to play on. The Multiplayer is great you can have up to 3 Versus 3 Player versus Player or with ai. There is also an army painter for you to make your own army names and color schemes. My personal rating of this game is a 9 out of 10 because a few things seem overly powerful, but other than that this game is very balanced. So Good luck, Have fun, and get out there and PURGE FOR THE EMPORER!!!!			"

												the campaign was 'alright' (i always wished it was more like soulstorms camp, but the story elements were nice), BUT... the overall feel of the game were spot on (thanks relic for doing right by WH40k every time!) albeit smaller scale.  Aside from multiplayer skirmishes my favorite part of this however is the gem that is last stand, and how coordinated a small elite squad of commanders needs to be to win, and how varied builds you can do with the wide array of gear.DoWII:retribution (and DoW:soulstorm mainly for the UA mod) are a must for any 40k fan.

												New playable race, Imperial Guard, is represented so good here. As in Dawn of War, they are the most expendable race, meaning you don't need to worry if you execute one troop with your Comissar to have a tactical advantage over your opponent. Imperial Guard allows the game for more varied tactics, interesting battles.Not only that, IG also feels good and enjoyable to play, something that is really important in my opinion.Anyway, recommendet for people who seeks something new in RTS genre, and for people who likes Imperial Guard.And remember - numbers mean everything. :)			"

												I really enjoyed the game itself since I am a 40k fan and I am collecting miniatures as well, gameplay is pretty interesting with simple rules (hold the strategic points or simply annihilate your foe), multiplayer is decent, although have some issues like high pings and minor lags during the match. Last stand is a good feature, you can have fun with your friends or just random folks against waves of mobs which come more challenging one after another. Havent played campaign much so wont say anything much about it.In conclusion I would say, that I dont reccomend this game for people who dont know anything about Warhammer 40k universe, although if you are from chosen one, go and buy the game, most likely you wont regret it.

												Dawn of War II has a really interesting universe. The campaign in this game clearly shows love for the Space Marine faction, every other campaign seems tacked on and unimportant. The graphics are good, as well as the sound design. The Strategy elements are well done. It's the same engine as Company of Heroes, so it basically plays the same as that game, however the engine feels a little bit better in this type of universe. The game is definitely geared towards multiplayer, but the its either a hit or miss. The mechanics of the game are easily fustrating in a game of poor connections and none of the strategic elements are clear enough to know what's what. Counters are hard to learn on your own, as well as build orders and proper micro's. There are a good community of players geared toward helping players imrpove their game, but if you not totally invested into the game's stats and numbers for every unit prepared to get scraped over and over again because the player base is 75% veteran.

												I was not going to bother with a review for this game as really its just DLC for Dawn of War 2, but I feel that people looking to buy this game need to know it has a few bugs. While playing with friends we have come across the following : Resolution issues above 1920x1080, Video memory errors, Game crashing, connection issues, buggy AI, micro stuttering etc.The game is awesome and the new maps / features are worth the money, but you are most likely going to get issues from time to time.8/10 (would be 10/10 if not for the issues mentioned above)			"

												Is this a good game? It is... It's fun, and fast paced... But I feel like it didn't capture the feel of the original dawn of war, due to the fact that they COMPLETELY take away the base building, which is something in RTS's I enjoy. However, I'm going to base this review in the style I did for the first Dawn of War, Speaking from a die hard Warhammer fan.Let's go over the positives of this game...-The action and pathing are improved, You are stuck right into it. and the fights are fun to watch.-The Voice acting in this game, is superb. And Very well done.-The campaign is very well made, However, this also contains a flaw, which I'll go over.-Multiplayer play is quite well, and still has multple game types, like the first Dawn of war game.-Each unit has to be treated like the table top counter part, such as, some are expendable, but if you keep losing too much, you will lose. Which has an immersion factor for me.-The soundtrack... Oh My God... The soundtrack for this game, is probably one of the best I've heard... -The developers added attention to detail, and added unit cries and announcer cries that differ depending on what race you are going against. for example, If you play orks, and then order an attack on an eldar, they might say something like ""Eldar ar da squishiest.."" Capturing the humor and immersion of the Warhammer universe.-To make the game more strategic, you have a small population, So choosing your units contains strategy to it.-The last stand mode is really fun, and it's a great idea. Holding off hordes of enemies with other players controlling your character is quite immersive.That's the positive aspects of this game... now for the negative.-The campaign is only fun once. As you get through playing with your race, you'll notice it's the exact same missions, but just with different races, which hugely downs the fun factor to it. Which leaves multiplayer and skirmish the only thing that maybe can bring you back.-The no base building is quite disapointing... Many RTS fans, such as myself, loved base building, due to it allowing you to manage and macro, while this game just focuses on micro.-The races seem more similar this time around... I don't know why, but it feels like they share some of the same strategies, Which doesn't help this game much for bringing you back, and keeping you in. Of course, this is my opinion, comparing it to the original, which felt like you are playing a different race. Don't get me wrong, there are differences, just not as much as I'd like. More like a peeve I suppose, so if you feel they are different, ignore this.-Giving the small population, Which is also a good thing, but it has a flaw for me, I like commanding big armies, Having a swarm of tyranids, or a horde of orks is probably the best feeling for me, but this game downs the population, which I can understand.Basically, this game can be fun, but it lacks compared to the others imo... I'd say only try it if you are a die hard warhammer fan. But this is my opinion, yours may differ. If you want to get into the universe of Warhammer 40k, try the first Dawn of war instead. "

												Very nice game if you like Warhammer 40k.But you cant play Necrons Darkeldar.you can play Tau in the last stand (that is a survival game mode) but not in campaign or other multiplayer games.But one thing i think is badthat is that its not like the old down of war games there you build a base because here you already have a base that you buy troops from. But it is still a very good game.it is a fun game that is worth buying.9/10 "

The Last Stand multiplayer mode is also a great change of pace when you and your buddies need a break from constant bloody skirmishes.			"

												A wonderful RTS which focuses on managing fewer units and forgoes base building and large scale macromanagement. Oozes 40k charm with each unit, with multiplayer and singleplayer offering both a quality experiance and with massive replayability.Buy it if you have any interest in warhammer 40k, buy it if you like RTS or Company of Heroes, buy it because decent Warhammer games need your cashbucks to thrive.If you already own this game play it more, the fantastic Elite mod offers continual support and its sheer accessibility means you can get good games going very quickly. The wall of inaccessability which hobbles most RTS is absent here, allowing games against even experianced players to go either way with the right choices - rather than build orders and meta gaming dictating the outcome before the game even begins.Probably the best Warhammer game out there, and it deserves your attention.

Anyhow I love this game and highly recommend it. If you have a powerful system, download the mods to play with bigger armies.			"

												Multiplayer became so competitive, that even the ranking play becomes a painfulexperience for newcomers such as I. I am currently at lvl. 7 and players that areplaying are either transitioning from other races to mine (Space Marine) that I solely play and no other. I do make use of the matching system, but even the system can do little with numbers that the skill the player behind the screen actually posses than the numbers suggest. This game is for multiplayer and if you're purchasing this for the solo-play, thenit is still good as the story follows the first Dawn of War line of story. Where inone of the silent characters will be made known to be from the previous gameclose to the end of campaign. Also there's a vast choice for AI difficulty that makessolo-play more exciting as there is the Expert Mode, try it yourself. "

												The Emperor demands that you acquire this title and proceed to aid your brothers in cooperative skirmishes and campaigns against the heresy of Chaos. And the WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH likes your hat by the way.Now then. The singleplayer campaign can be played with all the 6 races - Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, Tyranid and Imperial Guard. The maps are the same, almost completely. But the story and how it branches out are not the same, and seeing how every race plays differently it adds a lot of replayabillity. Did I mention all the campaigns are co-op? Oh. Well, I did now. Besides this, you get to play an RTS which does not focus on the boring aspect - wasting 5-15 minutes building a base. In Skirmishes, you are given a single building - A barracks of sorts. This is your only building, in which you produce your units. You capture and hold the points around the map to get requisition (money) and power (power), which adds another strategic element. I like. Go git.			"

When you start playing the campaing you realise something is happening, a big PLOT cooking inside. And it's AWESOME.The multiplayer is fun but you realise when you are fighting against a player who played more than you in multiplayer when  he is alredy in front of your base and conquering all the points, but still, you can learn how to battle against em, after a couple of matches you will understand the tactics they use. And remember, allways take cover, cover is IMBA. :PI really love this game, but i miss the building part from Dawn of War vanilla. 9/10			"

												If there is an RTS game to be the one and only of the category, it would be FAF.Bad start to my review.If there were two, they would be FAF and the Dawn of War franchise.The campaigns in Dawn of War 2 Retribution are not as impressive as the rest of the series. Don't get me wrong, the campaigns are very fun.However, DoW II Retribution Last Stand mode is THE MOST FUN SPIN ON RTS EVER. It technically counts as real-time tactic, I guess. But it is SO MUCH FUN.Three heroes, against 20 waves of awesome.I'd give this game a more deserved deeper review, but it would not help anyone, because this game is so unseen.

Now with that being said lets move on the game itselfAs with every game in the series that respects the 40k universe, this title offers:1. Blood and gore at its fullest2. 6 playable races for you to choose3. Awesome single player and lots fo different stories as well for every faction of the game4, Great coop battles and awesome multiplayer5. The best laststand6. All the typical rpg stuff found in previous titles.7. Full modable game 8.

												If you like the Warhammer 40k universe then you will love this.Although be careful this game is not to be confused with the first Dawn of War games. The gameplay is totally different in DOW 2 and isn't so much about base building and massing the armies, but instead more focused on single units with multiple abilities.Graphics - 9/10Sounds - 10/10Gameplay - 10/10			"

												The thing that sets this strategy game apart from the rest is that its based almost exclusively on micromanagement. It is a very interesting game that is very fun online with a small but active community in the Elite mod for this game; which more or less is a balancing mod. In my opinion the game is much better paced than Company of heroes having a more skrimish type feel than a breaking through enemy defenses feel.  I recomend you get this game if it is on sale or if you have the money. In my top 5 stratagy games. (and I play a lot of stratagy games)			"

												I was not going to bother with a review for this game as really its just DLC for Dawn of War 2, but I feel that people looking to buy this game need to know it has a few bugs. While playing with friends we have come across the following : Resolution issues above 1920x1080, Video memory errors, Game crashing, connection issues, buggy AI, micro stuttering etc.The game is awesome and the new maps / features are worth the money, but you are most likely going to get issues from time to time.8/10 (would be 10/10 if not for the issues mentioned above)			"

												Dawn of War II is an incredibly complex strategy game based on almost total micro-management of your couple of squads. If you like Warhammer, this is the Dawn of War to pick up (forget the other ones). Make sure to find a friend to play with, and watching some replays on youtube will introduce you to gameplay well enough. I can't get enough of the MP, teaming up online with friends to stomp pubs. Good luck and have fun!			"

												WoooooooootSo I've decided to make this a proper review.Let's get straight to the point. DoW2, much like it's predecessor, is a RTS set in the grimdark world of Warhammer 40,000. Unlike its predecessor however, your battles are on a far smaller scale. No longer do you have a huge squad of 9 marines per squad for example. Nor can you build more than one Land Raider. Instead squad sizes are far smaller(unless you're 'nids or orks in which case numbers wins the day), and focused more on flanking, tactics, special abilities and the like. In my opinion this actually makes the game more enjoyable for me. DoW1 felt too much like any stereotypical RTS wearing a 40k skin. DoW2 feels unique. The campaign is basically an adventure, with a neat story, neat gear and the like. Done with campaign and bored of it? RTS battles await. Don't want to play it as a RTS? Last Stand. For a game that is this old now, there's plenty to see and do. If you're a 40k fan, then every now and then it's great to get your 40k kicks in.DoW2 Retribution is perhaps the last great 40k game. None of those released after it so far has been anywhere as epic a journey. Until Sega decides to make a DoW3, this game above all else, is probably THE 40k PC game I'd choose if I had to pick one to play for the rest of my life.And I guess it'd be remiss not to mention that I'm massively into 40k today only because of this game.

												Dawn of War II: Retribution is a superbly made Real-Time Strategy game. Each player has a HQ from which they build units. Unlike a lot of strategy games, Retribution does not require the player to build structures to train units and gather resources. Rather, you start the game off with your choice of 1 of 3 of your chosen factions hero, as well as the basic infantry type of your faction. Then, to gather resources you command your units to capture Requisition (the main resource used for everything) and Power (a secondary resource for purchasing more advanced units and upgrading your units and their tech as well as researching the next tier) points. For each point you capture, the amount of Requistion/Power you earn per second increases. The only disappointment i have with all of the Dawn of War games is the very limited unit cap of 100.Don't let that stop you from getting this amazing game, perfect for new players and RTS veterans!Jester's Rating: 8.5/10			"

Posted: September 10, 2015
												TLDR – Dawn of War 2 Retribution is a standalone Real Time Strategy game following the events of Warhammer 40k Dawn of War 2 and its DLC Chaos Rising.  This time around you actually get to manage some resources and build a few units instead of just commanding a team of heroes.I didn’t play Chaos Rising, and a bunch of stuff apparently happened in the story so I wasn’t sure of the timeline on starting Retribution (the stories are pretty much completely unrelated). Fortunately, the plot is cohesive and you should be able to follow it if you have basic knowledge of the Warhammer 40k universe. Note that despite the fact that there are 6 different races to play in Retribution, they all have pretty much the same story. Space Marine, Chaos Space Marine, Eldar, Ork, Tyranid, and Imperial Guard all play the same series of missions just with slight changes to the narration. Basically, no matter which team you’re on, you need to stop a bad guy from ascending to demon form before an Imperial extermination force wipes out the entire star sector. If you’ve played Real Time Strategy Games like Starcraft, Warcraft, or Command & Conquer, you should be able to pick up Retribution’s gameplay almost immediately. But instead of building a base and harvesting resources, you start each level with hero units and need to work your way across the map while claiming resource “nodes” and command points. Do you remember the “commando” missions from Starcraft where you need to get your hero through the level relying on special powers while occasionally having backup appear? Well the whole game of Retribution is like that. The enemy is already entrenched in each level, and each of your hero units has special abilities gained through level ups and / or special items (war gear). The war gear is randomly dropped during gameplay and equipped between missions. So beating the game is mostly about managing your energy (mana) for using special powers and not biting off more than you can chew at once.The game has a cover system where if you move near certain items on the map like buildings or busted up walls, your units will attempt to hide behind them for a defense bonus, but honestly with so many special powers flying around, the cover isn’t as important as blasting the enemy before he blasts you. Make sure you diversify the equipment and special powers of your team and take your time with each level. You will find the game is not very difficult, especially if you’re playing as the Tyranid race. The Tyranids seem to be unique in that you only get one hero in the campaign (but that hero is seriously badass). Along with your hero units, you have the opportunity to requisition additional units at command points throughout each level. These units are obviously much weaker than your heroes but you can build up a nice army and flank enemy positions. The army will never be too big due to the population cap, but it does make finishing each level easier.Pros:+Fun game and not very punishing for casual gamers.  It’s pretty hard to actually lose, I don’t think I failed even one level. It just takes patience for your energy to recharge before you assault fortified enemy positions. +There is some variety in gameplay. Like the original Dawn of War 2, your units mostly have both melee and ranged attacks and you can gear up your units with particular equipment to enhance your play style. With 6 different playable races you shouldn’t be surprised to find that you’re occasionally fighting each of the six races throughout your campaign.+There are still people playing the game online if multiplayer is what you’re into. When I played there were usually about 300 other players though I didn’t really interact with them. I did try the Last Stand gameplay mode which is a 3 person co-op vs waves of enemies (took about 2-3 minutes to set up each match). I didn’t get very far but it seems to be the kind of game mode where you keep playing to level up, and hence get further and further along. Yes, there is also a co-op campaign mode.Cons:-Like the original Dawn of War 2, there are a ton of Steam achievements that seem tied to multiplayer. If you’re mostly into single player story campaigns like me, you’ll beat the game with less than 20% achievements and bring down your overall stats :(-As I mentioned before, all the races essentially have the same campaign. This makes the game surprisingly short and you can be done with it in about 2 days. No point in continuously replaying the same missions unless you’re grinding for achievements.Overall the game is fun if you’re into real time strategy or the Warhammer universe. If you have a friend to play co-op or Last Stand mode with, even better. Just note that getting far in Last Stand will require a significant time investment. There’s not much luck and skill involved until higher waves, and to get there you need to be high level.  And again, if you’re playing the single player campaign as Tyranid, play it in Hard or Very Hard difficulty mode unless it’s your very first time playing a real time strategy game. They’re just too strong for normal difficulty if you focus on ranged warriors. "

												Dawn of War II? Moar like Dawn of War II, III and IV, amirite? Okay, it's not that huge, but it can make for really fun times, and really does happen to be more like three games than just one.  You've got the campaigns which play out as an action RPG. In Vanilla and Chaos Rising, you follow the exploits of a group of Blood Raven Space Marines, super soldiers out to save the day and stuffs. Retribution here lets you pick any of the factions available in the game for your campaign. The single-player/co-op is a lot like a Dungeon Siege style of RPG, where you get to handle squad leaders with ability points and items as you level up. Multiplayer is a fast paced RTS, with matches that last around 30 minutes and jump into the thick of it, without having to worry about base building at all. Lastly, The Last Stand. It's a game on its own. Play as heroes, and team up with others to survive waves of mooks. It's as fun as it is nightmarishly addicting. So yup. That's all, folks!			"

												Yeah well this is a 2900h player telling you the game is really ,really good! The only bad thing is for the new player you will need time to understand the mecanism. Time to comprehend the game system and all the tactic on it. Ive played a lots and still learn new stuff everytime i play it. Dont buy it for the campaing but for his multiplayer. Dont expect to be a pro just because you are in Starcraft 2. Its a total different type. You need to control the map. Gatter ressource prevent them to your ennemie. Protect and capture stategie point. There no building in this game only Infantry Tank and lots ,lots of tactic and strategie! Hope you enjoys this game as much as me. ^^			"

												9/10Retribution is the second and last expansion pack of Dawn of War II, and between the three games which compose the II storyline, Retribution is most certainly my favorite. It possesses all the content of the previous two games, updated with the inclusion of the Imperial Guard faction alongside new units for every race. These include superheavy units for each race, and now your Space Marines, Orks and Tyranids will have something to fight those pesky Avatars of Khaine and Great Unclean Ones with the addition of Land Raiders, Ork Battlewagons, the Swarmlord himself and the Imperial Guard's newly arrived Baneblade.Retribution has its own campaign which serves as a conclusion for the storyline of not only Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising, but also for Dawn of War I and its own expansion packs. All that has happened in the games' storyline has led up to this game, and you have the opportunity to play as any of the races in the campaign. While the campaign is repetitive (all races share the same missions and overall story), it is nonetheless enjoyable to go around defeating armies of daemons with irish Ork space pirate captains.Retribution also wins because it has the best voice acting. Everyone has a british accent. EVERYONE.IN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FUTURE, EVERYONE IS BRITISH.AND I LOVE IT.			"

												Great RTS.   it focuses more on unit tactics rather than economy/base building.  infact, there really is no base building, but there are points you capture that slowly add requisition or energy point for you to buy new units or upgrade existing ones.  the main focus is on managing your units instead.      as a Warhammer game, it's probably one of the best in existence.   if you're a fan of warhammer or are looking to play a solid RTS check this one out.

												Well, this is a RTS. It is played in the dark universe of 40k and feature 6 factions. Bio engineered superhumans with freaking 200kg armours, normal humans that loves tanks, deamon worshipping humans with horns and spikes, squishy and fast eldars, orks that lives for fighting and the tyranids who eats everything. you simply choose one of these factions and head straight into multiplayer. i wouldnt bother going campaign without a friend (atleast after finishing it 5 times with each faction). each faction has 3 characters who each offers a different field presence and supporting abilities. in this you have to look out for your units, and micromanaging is the way to win. this does not give you the oppurtunity to build bases as in the first game, and the units are way smaller, but the effects are better and the randomness of melee is always fun. the real problem is that it doesnt have a huge community, and so not many games are up. for the really great experiance and balance of the game, simply get elite mod. fast to doenload and enhances the gameplay alot.

												The new (now old) DoW 2 : Retribution is a very beautiful looking game. Graphics are very good, gameplay is somewhere in between good and bad. When comes to Single Player/Campaign game is actually really good, it's a mix of RPG and strategy. You can build and customize your heros and armies and play in interesting linear campaign missions. Also a good thing to say, is that you can experience same story from angle of total 6 races, bad side is that all 6 races have same identical missions, only different is final goal. So once you complete campaign with one race, you have seen it all. But DoW 2 and expanision shine in Campaign gameplay but are total let down when comest to multiplayer and skirmish against AI.As an old player of DoW: Soulstorm, multiplayer game experience was mix of huge armies and building a bases all over the map. DoW2 and this Retributin expansion offers you a small scale battles (in true meaning of word skirmishes ). You will lead maybe a 4 or 5 units max at the time, there is no base building, every unit comes from one building, which means you can't build two different units at the same time, which slows gamelplay drastically. Resaurces are scarce.Pros:CampaignGraphicsSingle Player gameplayCons:No base buildingTraining one unit at the timeScarce resourcesSmall battlesTraining both vehicles and units of all types from one single building.My Recommendation:Buy it for campaign and good looks, but for real and better 40k experience buy DoW:Soulstorm or Dark Crusade.So first DoW + expansions for MultiPlayer and DoW2 + expansions for SinglePlayer (Campaign) "

												DOW2 is very different to DOW1 but the gameplay is very refreshing. Instead of having a huge army of units you have a small group that you build up with better gear. The Last Stand gamemode really stands out in this game and easily give you a extra 20 hours+ of gameplay.The single player campaign is good the first time round but having to redo almost the same story with each faction sucks. The multiplayer game modes make up for the poor single player.			"

												Warhammer 40, 000: Dawn of War 2 Retribution is a completely different game from the other earlier 40k RTS's. This one focuses more on squad combat and strategy, rather than whoever gets the biggest army (maybe) or whoever rushes first. There is no more base building, which is kind of a disappointment but not a huge deal breaker. There is a single campaign that you can go through with the six races (Eldar, Tyranid, Space Marine, Imperial Guard, Orks, and Chaos). The campaign is the same for every race with minor story variations. The part about it that makes me the most sad is that they removed the Necrons and the Tau as if they never existed. Again, not a huge deal breaker, but still. You can get the Shas'O Commander and Necron Overlord in The Last Stand gametype as DLC (a little overpriced if you ask me), but that's the extent of it. The Last Stand is basically a horde mode consisting of you and two others. I am not kidding when I say it is pretty damn hard and evidently takes some getting used to. The community seems nice enough as well, though it's better to play with friends.This is a great game with improved graphics, physics, and well, it's Warhammer 40k. What more could you ask for?			"

Pros:+ Great variety of units+ Races are interesting and beautifully crafted (Tyranids, holy mother of god, these reminds me of Godzilla)+ In-Depth strategy+ The leveling system of units, though some don't like it, I say it is a good system to employ so that players don't just command his/her units aimlessly.+ Last Stand is a great alternative game mode. It reminds me of RPG games, with strategy sprinkle onto it. (E.g. Demigod)++ No other game allows you customize your units' color.Cons- Campaign. It reminds me of CnC4, a bit short, and a bit unnecessary. Wish it was the DOW I Dark Crusade's style of campaign.- Sometimes, units will not activate their skills. (Hive Tyrant's Bio Plasma, for example. He will stand there even though you issued the command.)- Seemed that spamming range units is better than melee units. Melee units are a bit underpowered in this game in my opinion.Overall, it's a great game. I hope that the RTS genre will survive in this MMORPG-ruled universe.			"

												Dawn of War 2 and DoW2: Chaos Rising made a vast departue from the original Dawn of War games, going from a grand scale RTS similar to Command and Conquer to a squad-focused action-strategy game (for want of a better term). Retribution tries to marry the two, giving you a four-man team of hero units to work with and providing the option to exchange them for less-complicated but weaker elite squads before deployment or even calling in larger forces on the field (back to the DoW classic formula, albeit with perhaps fewer unit choices, particularly in the vehicular department).But honestly, the hero units (and/or their elite squad replacements) are usually enough to complete most missions by themselves. Where DoW was like the equivalent of a standard game of tabletop Warhammer 40K, DoW2: Retribution is more like playing a game of Kill Team. In fact, if you're planning to buy the Kill Team game on Steam, don't bother; just buy this instead.Also, the Last Stand multiplayer mode is super-fun. It's probably dead nowadays, but if you can get into an active server or have a few friends with the game, give it a go!9/10 it okay, not subtle or nuanced but it okay			"

												Retribution follows up the story events of Chaos Rising, and then allows you to play a number of different single-player campaigns as each of the different playable races. Unlike in Winter Assault however, the campaigns here are... pretty much the same thing everytime without any real difference between the races. This is one of those games where multiplayer was the chief focus, and the ""Last Stand"" Mode actually can be kinda fun if you can manage to get some people together who know what they are doing.As for me, however, it's just one more grindy multiplayer experience vying for my attention... and I have WAY too many of those as is.I'll give this a ""yes"" because it does not do anything wrong per se, but this game is pretty much for Warhammer 40k fans only, as far as I am concerned.

												Chaos Rising, in my opinion, was a full fledged expansion. Completely worth full price because it extended the story and introduced a corruption mechanic to the campaign.  I really can't comment on online PVP because I only ever dabbled in Last Stand (Which is an excellent addition to the game, I'd like to see more PVE like it in the franchise.)Retribution, while it allowed me to finally sucker punch the system with Eliphas, felt like half a game when it came to the story.  They did their best to allow every faction to have their spotlight, but in trying to please everyone sort of left the experience feeling a bit lackluster, in hindsight.  At least incomparison to the previous two.This isn't unique to retribution, it occurs in all the DoWII titles I own: It does have some running problems on my junker of a laptop; dropping to a single frame per second during loading sequences.  It just really hates transitioning back to the star map after a mission. I still really enjoy the game and play through all three once a year or so.  Best snagged when the whole bundle is on special.			"

												Deprived of any choice's,repetitive, overpowered items (extra paid) and simple as wire + co-op s buggy as hell - Campagin.Repetitive and full of overpowered extra paid items + all thoses bugs - Last Stand.Convenient controls, good graphics, low amount of maps (no workshop is a Heresy ! ), overpowered factions, pathetic upgrade system, ""sync errors""(You'll need to restart game), higher audio settings may cause ""sound bugs"" (game crash, after few mins or instant) - Multiplayer.Its a♥♥♥♥♥♥on WH lore and logic - weapon range.Even in spite of all these drawbacks I like this game, sad it isn't better. (The only reason I play it still, is blood, murdering and total slaughter or My Friends )			"

												After 20 minuites of waiting you will find a 3v3 game with the people on your team unable to speak english. one of them will have left his mic next to a swarm of angry bees the other will swear at you in a language you cant understand.Then the match starts.Three seconds later you realise the other team is a clan that all play as the same race and abuses the ♥♥♥♥ out of whatever exploit relic has failed to patch this week.You abandon all hope of victory.During the opening 30 seconds of the match the frame rate falls into single figures as the ping of one guy on the other team skyrockets.Somebody from your side is kicked from the match, It wasnt the guy with the broken mic.Finally after half an hour of grinding away the other team rolls out a super weapon that your army has no counter too. You watch as it slowly swaggers towards your base and teabags all your units to death.You will call a vote to concede the match, your team mate will refuse before ragequiting, leaving you unable to end the match with any honour still intact. I love this game.			"

												A game that will test your reasoning as well as your skill. If you are looking for a strategy game that is not a clickfest and does not reward APM this is the one. Think of it like a CoH with melee! The single player experience is a bit stale and monotonous, but the multiplayer is fun and addictive. Sadly the playerbase is a bit small compared to, say, Starcraft 2, and the online community is more than a little harsh with noobies. And don't get the damn Elite mod, it only contributes to further reduce the playerbase and it's mostly smoke and mirrors!			"

												Let me start with this, I love both Dawn of War and Dawn of War II and all of their expansions.One is a RTS and the other one, I would consider it as a real-time tactics game.I love both, It's different, it sure would have been better to have two gamemodes (one that would be the classic from the first one and the other one would be what we got in the second game).That would have made it far better but that is not my biggest complain about this game.I'll start with its flaws.It's missing factions the previous game (its expansions) has, why can't we get them in this game? I find it very stupid because it's always like that in the modern gaming industry.I'll explain it to you in a simple manner that everyone should be able to understand.Keep in mind that this will be an example that doesn't directly apply to Dawn of War II.But it sure is a fact for many games.First game - 1996 - 6 factionsFirst expansion for the first game - 1997 - +2 factions, campaign and all the other great stuff.Second expansion for the first game - 1998 - +2 factions, campaign and all the other great stuff.Third expansion for the first game - 2000 - + 2 factions, graphics remastered, audio remastered, new content and other great stuff.Second game - 2008 - 2 factionsFirst expansion for the second game - 2008/2009 +2 factions (that were already in the base game of the orignal game without expansions) plus few content.Second expansion for the second game - 2009/2010 + 2 factions, skins and things people should not care about.Tell me, which one is worth more?Of course, Dawn of War II isn't as worse, I was especially thinking about Blood Bowl to Blood Bowl 2.The expansions of Dawn of War II are good, and they're expansions, unlike most of nowadays games which are just crappy ""DLCs"" (generally cut content before release) but they're still missing factions that they already invented.Release it as an expansion at worse, make it worth with a campaign, a few new maps and interesting content.That would be that.I hate the fact that we can't play as the Necro, the Tau, the Sisters of Battle nor as the Dark Eldar in this game.The thing to do would have been to released them all right from its the game release and to release other/new factions with the expansions, that's how it works, that's how it should works, that's how we advance.I could name a lot of great old games who do that and it works pretty well and most of them aren't so known because they are not mainstream/triple A made games.But they're even better because they have variety, lot of variety, and the gameplayer and stuff gets better after each release.So a developer such as Relic Entertainment have no excuses, I repeat, NO excuses! at all.It pains me to see where the gaming industry is going.Don't get me wrong, I love this game and that is why I leave my review positive.There is much, much worse, and it's everywhere.But still, this game could have been so much more.And it should have.9/10 for the game itself.4/10 for the fact that it's missing so many things.I sincerely hope that it will change for the best soon but I doubt it.Anyway, great game itself despise missing a few factions and content/stuff.I would suggest it if you're into the Warhammer universe and if you love real time tactical games.

												This is an insult to the players of the previous games in the series. I don't mind the change to the format of the single player campaign, but the atrocious lack of quality is unexpected given how much thought and time was put into the first two campaigns. -The maps are almost all long snaking paths where you just roll through watching stuff die. There's very little in the way of tactics or strategy, even on hard difficulty. -The hero/unit upgrades were not well thought out. It's very easy to trivialize the campaign, in terms of difficulty, by stacking upgrades on certain well rounded units and then just attack-moving through the entire level. There's no challenge, it's not interesting aside from just watching a bunch of explosions go off.-There is not much detail or attention given to quality story development compared to the previous installments, with poor or non-existent justification for the missions you undertake, and very little in terms of voice over work.-There is little thought or time given to customizing the campaign for each race. They all play out exactly the same, with minor changes in dialogue being all you usually get (if even that), only occasionally having a different in-game cutscene at the start of the level. -There's no real replay value considering that there's no real decision making involved in the missions. The only replay value would be in choosing different upgrade paths for units, but the campaign is too easy so there's no incentive to try different strategies. -There are many bugs and evidence of lack of playtesting. It feels like they put no love or care into this, rushing it out on bare minimal resources. Units get stuck on terrain. Building lots of units in the campaign bugs out their pathfinding, causing them to get stuck. There is even a part where as imperial guard the commander calls for artillery fire but an orbital strike comes in instead (which is what happens when you play as space marines), showing that they intended to do something unique for the IG campaign but ultimately did not bother to animate it in.Overall it's a disgrace of a campaign for Relic's usual quality, and an insult to the customer that they would expect this to be a good value considering what they are capable of delivering. It feels like they are just trying to quickly tie up the DOW2 storyline because they don't have the resources to do a proper single player campaign.However, the one saving point of this expansion is that it gives you access to the Imperial Guard in multiplayer - Which is done to a very high standard of quality in terms of it's design and artwork, on par with the races before it. They are quite fun to play, having a different style based around cover for infantry, defensive structures, and vehicle support.Unfortunatley for Imperial Guard multiplayer, they also miss the mark on a few big issues:1. Lack of numbers. IG is known for numbers, but you never have the population capacity to utilize large numbers of guardsmen at once. The only way they simulate this is by making guardsmen very cheap and quick to re-enforce compared with other races.2. Lack of on-map artillery support. This is a huge part of IG military doctrine, so the lack of a basalisk on the map really kills a lot of the potential fun you could have holding the line behind entrenchments while you lay down fire support. The off-map artillery options are a poor substitute for the on-map artillery of DOW1, and the on-map manticore (rocket based artillery) is not very effective or satisifying to use - It doesn't fill the role of sustained fire support; because of it's single volley and long cooldown. Although it is at least some form of artillery which has it's uses, it's a let down compared to how IG play in DOW1. And the low population cap makes it difficult sometimes to use a proper mix of combined arms, because you can't always make room for armor and artillery with your infantry. All you're really paying for is a DLC race pack for multiplayer Imperial Guard. Relic would have been better off simply releasing it as a DLC pack if they weren't prepared to do the single player properly. They squandered what could have been an epic conclusion to a storyline they had been building up for years, settling for a cheap version of it that leaves the whole experience feeling sour.			"

												This review is for the game: Dawn of War II: Retribution – The Last StandaloneApparently if you buy The Last Standalone, steam will automatically decide that you have also purchased Dawn of War II: Retribution. Trying to leave feedback for The Last Standalone game, will post here because the steam game client apparently has the wrong link. Also, if you buy the Last Stand you will not be able to buy this, for some reason steam thinks you have already purchased this game, so will not let you purchase it again for your self, only as a gift for someone else (this include any bundles that may contain the game, steam will not allow you to install a game that is already installed). End result, you will NEVER get to play this full game!Actual review for The Last Standalone:DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THE GAME (The Last Standalone) unless you already a know your way around the full game. There is no way to do solo training / practice in game other than being dumped in the thick of it with two other players that will be relying on you to hold up your part of the co-op match, which is impossible when you don't know what you are doing, making it unfair for the other players!This game has the description as Single player, however there is NO single player in the gamme. The only playable option is The Last Stand!I would post this where it should be, as a review for The Last Standalone, but steam will not allow this!			"

												Relic, what the hell were you thinking?Firstly, there is no mention of your original character, i was rather annoyed to see Martellus when i started the campaign so it looks like, your choices in chaos rising do not have any effect on the timeline, other than the whole ""Heroes of Aurelia"" line. While Cyrus and Tarkus come back, neither have squads and you brought the old game mechanics along for a ride with this too, why the hell does a renegade commander have the ability to call for reinforcements from a starship that dosnt exist? (or at least no mention thus far has been made, considering the fact that youre using a ""teleportarium"" to move around, im going to assume you dont have a ship - this feels like a ginormous plothole.) Nevermind that they changed the loadout system; energy based abilities for everything - which again, takes your mind away from conserving limited special abilities, while characters like Cyrus still shout ""Do not waste what the Emperor provides!"" when you order him to use a special attack.While, yes you do still have limited resources now in the form of power and requesition, it dosnt play like the same animal - you have an army beyond the confines of the original game, which imho was much more enjoyable the way it was - this has boiled it down almost into a generic rts clone.Also, what annoyed me the most about this iteration of DOW II - having watched friends and family who are, like me all avid Warhammer fans (I even purchased that trainwreck Fire Warrior, i believed it was a decent game for a while fyi) was the fact that each of the 6 sides campaigns, pretty much played as if you were the same side - just subtle differences like the endings.Other than that, if you've played one side then you dont really need to play the rest, unless youre a cheev-wh*re.Honestly i could go on all day about what i, thus far have personally thought is wrong with this piece of the DOW II title, but ive always had a soft spot for Relic - theyve made some awesome games (*cough* Homeworld *cough*) but i feel that this iteration of Dawn of War is -NOT- one of them.Plainly and simply put; if you prefered Dawn of War II and Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising - dont even bother playing this one, even if you purchased it (like me) as part of a Steam sale package.If you prefer the original Dawn of War and its myriad of expansions, then DOW II: Retribution is totally going to be your cup of tea.- Captain Soban.

												A good game, but lack of optimization means that people with older PCs can't play it very well. Even higher end PCs do have a little bit of trouble with the graphical load, but that's few and far between.The player community, on the other hand, is often toxic to an extreme. Multiplayer is good, but matchmaking is not. The complaints that people have for DOTA 2, especially against Russian players, is very much extant here, especially with regards to teamwork, as well as loadtimes (because for some reason, most Russian players cannot afford decent computers or set their settings to low, and often use vulgar language when asked to cooperate with host requests or to work with teammates. The learning curve is steep, and I have to say I took several hundred hours in Vanilla DOW2 and Chaos Rising to get to some degree of skill, enough to reliably defeat opponents. To be very frank, this is not a newbie friendly game. The micromanagement required to perform well, or at least at any decent standard of play, is quite above the average micromanagement capacity of a newbie. As for ELITE mod, though I have personal misgivings against a mod created by someone who felt that DOW2 wasn't balanced and as such balanced it to suit his own tastes (Which to be honest is enterprising, but reeking utterly of hypocrisy), it is a fun mod to play, even though the community is even tinier than the already small DOW2 community.The campaign, well, is fun at first, but loses its novelty when one compares it to the original DOW2 and Chaos Rising, which have a dedicated and properly fleshed out campaign with multiple choices. The fact that THQ actually reused campaign maps and storylines for each faction is indicative of their slide into mediocrity and bankruptcy - no game designer should be that lazy. Overall, this is a fun game to play. I have put many hours into it, and likely will continue to for the foreseeable future.			"

												Where do I start? Unlike Chaos Rising, this is not an expansion of WH40K DOWII. This game stands alone, has a different campaign and last stand. It also has Important DLC content for you competetive types, but I'll get to that later.The Good:+More races = more fun. Yes, you can play the campaign, multiplayer and last stand as Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Orks, Eldar, Tyranids and Chaos. +Same basic game as the others in the series+The campaign continues the story from the first two in the series, but in a method much closer to regular gameplay+Campaign voice acting is decent. I won't say outstanding, but hey, you're not here for voice overs... unless you want to play all the campaigns.+In PVP, your units matter. So does map control. It's not about how fast you build your base, but how well you can micromanage.The Bad:-The system requirements are much higher than those listed. Yes, you can play the game with those specs. I would not recommend it. (unless you like 15 fps)-The campaign missions are the exact same between races. The ""motivation"" is different, but the missions are the same. -Campaign skills and talents do not always translate to multiplayer-To be truly competetive in multiplayer, you have to buy DLC packs. I'm sorry. There's just no way around it. I know from personal experience that they can be game changers. Pick a favorite race, and get their DLC upgrades. This goes for Last stand as well-Tau only have one unit and he's a DLC for the last stand. You can skin the tau onto the Imperial Guard units if you really want to play as the Tau.Final thoughts:This game is fun and unique. If I had to describe it, I'd call it an RTS with elements of a MOBA. The Dawn of War 2 series as a whole does a good job of bringing the tabletop feel back to the game. It's a bit of a learnig curve, but if you like RTS games in general, I definitely reccomend this one.			"

												For none-tabletop players: 9 of 10 stars.For all those of you, who love playing the mix of strategy games and RPG's, its an awesome game.You can choose a race like Space Marines (gen-manipulated super soldiers in the heaviest armors you can imagine), orkz (big, green and tons of aggression), the imperial Army ( normal humans, throw-away-units, but like a mass army, they overrun every enemy) and many others.While playing, your units gain experience and level up. So you can raise their stats and change the equipment of every hero in your squad.The game is split up in more or less 15 missions, individualized for each of the races.Otherwise you can play the ,,last stand"", where you and 2 other players try to survive 20 waves of enemys.Last aspect of the game is the multiplayer mode, where you can play solo or in team against other players.For tabletop players: 7 of 10 stars.Of course the game is still epic. But there are a few bad mistakes in the game, which let your smile disappear....Much of the equipment isn't codexconform, there are characters and Chapters that doesn't exist, an exterminatus that isn't an exterminatus ((it's an overkill in game.....first thousands of lances, and then a magmabomb which is much bigger than usual)(and although it's an planet with a great flora and fauna, there are no virusbombs)).Ok, this could be called pedantically, but if you know the codex and the rulebook, you will notice theese things wether you like or not...In spite of everything i advise you to buy this game ;)			"

												I enjoy playing this game. I have a love for RTS games and grew tired of the old medieval era, even though that's a favorite theme of mine when it comes to video games. Though the space side of an RTS that is more focused on squad tactics and implements heroes is an excellent addition to the genre. Most RTS games are simply ""a numbers game"" meaning who ever has the largest force will win. However, this game allows you to win fights against larger forces. Being able to use squad/hero abilities allows you to be more versatile on the virtual battlefield. If you know what you're doing and can think before you make your move, prep your assaults/defensive positions, then you'll win without a doubt. Scout the terrain and pick the best positions available.P.S.The boss fights are pretty epic too. Not to mention being able to loot wargear in game and select rewards to upgrade your heroes and honorary units is pretty slick too. It gives the game a personal touch.			"

												This game has aged quite well. While there are rumors of DoWIII coming around, I still say give this game a try. It's challenging, and has quite a bit of strategy to it. Think out your attack, and execute. Be mindful of all your units. I recommend it, but be ready to have a few bad games.			"

Posted: May 15, 2014
												It all started when our protagonist, Civ 5, woke up in a pumpkin patch. It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth... how could he resist?It didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ♥♥♥? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the ♥♥♥ rolling up. It was Civ 5.----o0o---- As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the ♥♥♥ and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang.'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.'...What's that smell?'Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was plainly in view.Civ 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.----o0o---- Just yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth.About seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.Less than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(			"

												For none-tabletop players: 9 of 10 stars.For all those of you, who love playing the mix of strategy games and RPG's, its an awesome game.You can choose a race like Space Marines (gen-manipulated super soldiers in the heaviest armors you can imagine), orkz (big, green and tons of aggression), the imperial Army ( normal humans, throw-away-units, but like a mass army, they overrun every enemy) and many others.While playing, your units gain experience and level up. So you can raise their stats and change the equipment of every hero in your squad.The game is split up in more or less 15 missions, individualized for each of the races.Otherwise you can play the ,,last stand"", where you and 2 other players try to survive 20 waves of enemys.Last aspect of the game is the multiplayer mode, where you can play solo or in team against other players.For tabletop players: 7 of 10 stars.Of course the game is still epic. But there are a few bad mistakes in the game, which let your smile disappear....Much of the equipment isn't codexconform, there are characters and Chapters that doesn't exist, an exterminatus that isn't an exterminatus ((it's an overkill in game.....first thousands of lances, and then a magmabomb which is much bigger than usual)(and although it's an planet with a great flora and fauna, there are no virusbombs)).Ok, this could be called pedantically, but if you know the codex and the rulebook, you will notice theese things wether you like or not...In spite of everything i advise you to buy this game ;)			"

												Being a die hard DOWI fan, It took me a long while to warm up to the changes they made with DOWII, however now that they've stopped bombarding us with mini DLC's I decided to bite the bullet, get the entire game and give it a go.Single player campaign.Very action RPG very well done with a star map allowing you to pick your missions mostly, and a different campaign for each race.Action RPG is not really my thing, but its still nice to play this on occasion.Co-op campaign.Not tried it, its nice that its here though.Single player Skirmish.This is more my style customize your game and experiment to find your favourite tactics and strategy.DOWII has taken a very different approach to RTS than DOW I, essentially you have less units, no buildings, and more micro, all ideas I thought where bad, but they have produced good and distinctive tactic oriented game, the action feels alot mor intense here but if you can keep up it is very satisfying when you succeed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Multi-player Skirmish.This is where things really heat up, and this is my favourite mode, be warned as with many game you will need to practice VS the AI before attempting to take on other players, but the huge arrange of units and sides and the beautifully done maps, animations etc all contribute to making this an unforgettable RTS experience. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.One of my favourite RTS games, recommended if you like both ACTION RPG or RTS or just W40K   - 8.5/10One wish - that they included the Tau, fortunately there's a mod for that.			"

												8.5/10 (-1pt. bcause of the lagg that is encountered sometimes and -0.5pt. because people will still compare it with the first game of the series... including me <-call it just a personal preference)Well, even tho the lagg in the multiplayer games can become an issue (multiplayer being a peer to peer thinghie), the game is pretty badass. Yeah, it's not the first DOW where u spammed units until your enemies would die. Yeah it's not Starcraft 2 (and for the love of the Emperor, stop comparing the two) where you need the dexterity of a piano player; but it's a game where tactics and strategy blend nicely. learn to abuse the retreat button in multiplayer. The learning curve is kinda steep, especially against veteran players BUT (and that's a big but) once you get the hang of it, you will realize that there aren't two games exactly the same. Let's take for ex the orks. Deadly at close range, with the right upgrades, will♥♥♥♥♥♥anything from afar too. A little word of advice for the new players tho: use space marines/force commander. The strategy is simple: run, conquer the requisition points, retreat, heal, harass, overcome and overpower. The MOD that people talk about it's not that important. The title is solid as it is. The only question that remains is... are you a loyalist or a traitorous scum?			"

												Where do I start? The Dawn of War series has always been one of my fav franchises as a 40k fan, and Dawn of War 2 Retribution has been my most played so far. The game leaps from the more mainstream aspects of stragety gaming, like any Relic game does, and goes straight for the battles and action, forcing you and your opponent to tackle over land and territory of the map in order to get resource and Victory Points. Many 40k fans complain about the games small army and squad size, being that the average Space Marine Tactical Squad goes in a maximum squad of 3-4, personally I was dissapointed on first hearing this, but now I mostly enjoy the tactical flexibility it gives to your squadrons.; this game has no base-building, and it requires you to keep your squads and units alive if you want the advantage over your opponent, giving you capabilities such as a 'retreat' system and a unique 'cover system' for you to take minimum casualties. Dawn of War II has always been a more tactical-soaked game than mass armies, though great online 3v3 games can be insane anyway in terms of relentless fighting over Victory Points.The single-player is the games weakest element. Although it gives you 7 different racse, each with a unique story, the gameplay is not at all replayable, since all the races experience the exact same missions, and a rare amount of unique dialogue interactions, which was very dissapointing.For anyone interested in a strategy game that exits from the mainstream base-building and isn't too interested in the Company of Heroes franchise, give Dawn of War a run for your money on the Steam Sales. I'd reccomend this to 40k fans who can tolerate the small squad sizes.			"

												This is a great RTS, and the campaign is full of story and action. Great character designs, and I loved the number of available races. Last Stand is GREAT for friends, pick a race hero and survive. Spectacular gladiator-inspired game mode, coupled with the individuality of each hero, all the pros and cons, I always have a blast. Dawn of War II is a must-have for any RTS group player, Warhammer fan, science fiction fan, or just somebody looking to have a good time, for a long time. You will NOT get bored for quite a long time, it is a very fulfilling game with more than enough to entertain you for months.			"

												Disclaimer: Definitely buy on sale in the bundle so you can play DoW 2 (Vanilla) and Chaos Rising.PositivesOut of the Dawn of War 2 series, Retribution is my least favourite. That being said I enjoyed the Space Marine campaign, and a bit of the Eldar.NegativesOther than that it's essentially copy / paste campaign with a different race (skin) and non canon story.As for the multiplayer, I've not yet tried it beyond Last Stand. Which Last Stand is fine, but definitely not something I'd keep playing after I get the achievements.There is also a weird sound bug which the first two Dawn of War 2's did not have, which can cause your game to crash, and there is also an achievement campaign bug if you lose steam / internet connection which corrupts the whole file and any with that name apparently and never allows you to get the completion achievement.In addition if you think you're buying all the DLC content if you purchase the DOW  Franchise Pack, think again. They exclude the Overlord hero for Last Stand, and instead only include that in the package which has Space Marine, A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME that is has no function with.ResultI do NOT recommend this game at full price or purchased alone, but the dow 2 bundle, or rather buy the sega collection that includes the Last Stand overlord and Space Marine.Don't be mislead like I was by a stupid marketing ploy meant to rip you off.Rating for Space Marine campaign because of previous two, 9/10.Overall rating for game because of the bugs / crashes, and the  misleading rip off for Overlord and bundles.2/10.Definitely buy on sale in the bundle so you can play DoW 2 (Vanilla) and Chaos Rising.

												Dawn of War II is a huge step backwards from the original Dawn of War series (winter assault, dark crusade, soulstorm). Why they ever decided to throw base building and big-scale wars out of the window in a strategy game is beyond me. Command and conquer 4 made the same massive mistake as all of the Dawn fo War II series did. No more big battles, no more base building, no more really epic units battling it out, no more epic long games. Just you and a handful of squads versus an enemy with a handful of squads in games that usually don't last very long. There's not much room for strategizing and diversification with such a small pool of things to do stuff with. The entire game feels more like you're participating in a few small-scale guerilla warfare missions rather than a real epic war. Graphics and sounds aside, which are actually pretty decent and a reasonable improvement over the original series, I really cannot recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the original series. If you are new to Dawn of war in its entirety, then sure, you can give this a shot. It can be an ok time sink. But in my opinion, you'd still be better off just going with the original Dawn of War anyway, rather than this one. Only the campaign is reasonably fun to play due to the storyline. but even then many of the things in the campaign (including the missions themselves) constantly repeat no matter which race you play it through with next, so it doesn't give you any reason to play it again after you played it out once.TL;DR - Overall, I just don't recommend it at all, nor do I recommend any of the other Dawn of War II games. I would much rather point people to Dawn of War: Dark Crusade or Soulstorm. Even when Dawn of War II isn't compared to anything, it still only reaches a 5/10 rating in my opinion, at the very best. An 'ok' time sink, but not much else.Trying to be innovative and new is all well and good, but that does not warrant completely annihilating a working (and fun) formula, which the original series was most popular for.

												The campaign story from the other other two dawn of war games doesn't connect well. You lose the force commander and get replaced by captain Apollo Diomedes instead. Last stand was good but sad about campaign. Also the 6 campaigns are clones of each other with just different diologue and units, story is same.			"

												Cool graphics and ""on the edge"" artstyle but that's all it's got going.Unit control is clunky, they won't obey you and their fihgting movesets are repetitive.No micromanagement to speak of, send unit X to counter unit Y and click on its ability for maximum damage. There really isn't an explanation about damage or armour types other than ""unit X can beat unit Y, Z and W"".=fighting is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>What about basebuilding? There is none, and that might be ok, several games manage to stay fresh without basebuilding.But here you've got nothing to do, you capture the objectives and it only goes downhill from there, there's no ""escalation""- you're scraping for cash to get a unit early game and you're scraping for cash by lategame, except this time you do that even more because later units are more costy.Rpg system? Sounds amazing on paper, in reality it just means you gotta grind to get better.It's a worse game compared to dow1 not because dow1 was more ""traditonal"" (although pretty groundbreaking for its time) but because dow1 knew what it was, dow2 on the other hand tries to be company of heroes, an rpg and an arena game all in one. But fails at the most important thing: being fun.Do you recommend this game?Only if you hate older graphics, fanatically disdain basebuilding or are legally forbidden from coming 10 feet near anything that resembles dawn of war 1 but still deeply crave dawn of war 1's sweet♥♥♥♥♥Otherwise? Pirate/buy on sale the first entry: it has everything, and what it doesn't have can be added through mods.			"

												First time on a Warhammer 40,000 and it's awesome~If you want to play a coop campaign with a friend then this game is perfect.The multiplayer is meh but the story mode is awesome and the wave mode.But there is something who dissappointed me, the challenge. There isn't a big challenge in this game, even on the hardest mode it's still ""super"" easy. I only lost once our heroes but you can quickly respawn them because they can't die.The second thing is when you're doing a second playthrough with another faction, it's the same maps but with some differents enemies. But they are funny to play.Musics, units, heroes and the story are epic I recommand you!			"

												The most recent Warhammer 40k stratigy game. Will continue to allow online play after the other DoW2 interations die due to the ending of Games for Windows Live. Focuses heavily on squad combat, with resource aqusition reduced to territory control; the only way to get what you need is to hold ground. Results in a far more enjoyable tactical experience than games like Star Craft 2, where holding ground and tactical expasion is much less important relatively. Factions are not all perfectly balanced, but there's a good number to choose from (not as many as in the final DoW 1 expansion, but I'm not sure if you can still play DoW 1 online).Gameplay:

			The first two games of the Warhammer 40k Dawn of War 2 PC franchise will literally become unplayable when GFWL goes down. Retribution, the second expansion to DoW2, WILL KEEP WORKING!

												I can't recommend this game enough and I can't believe I never posted a review for it until now, but in all honesty, this game doesn't need reviews. This entire series is gaming gold. If you like RTS games, it's a must. If you like 40k, it's a must. Even if you like RPG or MOBA games it's a must (yeah it's got some of that too). Obviously with Dawn of War III coming out sometime in the near future, the prior games won't get as much mileage, but if you ever see this or any other DOW games on steam sale, just do yourself a favor and grab them up... for the greater good.

												This ""standalone"" feels so rubbish it hurts. Every single race campaign is kind of the same as you visit the exact same area,  capture the same stuff at the same spot etc, they reuse everything way too much.The new Army system added to the 4 man squad is just unpolished,uncomplete and useless.This new system uses ressources that replacesthe refillable items and abilities from DoW2 transforming equiped said abilities and items into energy based skills.That change killed any means to play stragically. Retribution suffers from the same very bad itemization as Chaos Rising making most of the items unusable by being either way too good to don't use or way too bad. The Space marines story is very bad even with the great voice acting and the ending is just oh god,Emperor forgive me, so dumb and meaningless. Go through it on the easiest difficulty if you really want to play the Blood Ravens campaign to the end but otherwise just watch a video of it as it doesn't worth spending too much time on it ...

												After having been a long time player of Dawn of War: Soulstorm, I was very excited when I got Dawn of War 2: Retribution on release date, and needless to say I was not disappointed it all. The first Dawn of War games were a great series, but Dow2 just blows it out of the water with incredible voice acting, tactical gameplay, and lots of faction variety. Though the campaign is a bit lacking now, each race having their own but almost identical, the real fun is at mulitplayer.			"

												having problems with this game. despite buying the base Dawn of War II Retribution, i can only play in the LastStandAlone game mode, with both multiplayer and campaign greyed out. it says both on the store page and in my library that I own the game, so why can't I play two of it's modes? Having tried to get the issue solved through the offical support page, but they have not answered the ticket I submitted last year...I will happily admit that the LastStandAlone is great fun having sunk in more hours in a row than I care to admit, but it is severly hampered (in my opinion) by it's lack of diverse maps, as there are only two (that I know of) in the game currently.If these iusses were fixed, and I hope they will be, then I would happily give this game a 9/10. But alas, due to issues i can only give it a 3.3/10 (as the LastStandAlone is way too much fun, but is only 1/3rd of the game I purchased D:  ). P.S. if anyone has encountered the same problems and knows a solution, please send me a message, I would love to be able to acutally play the game more!cheers.			"

												Pretty fun game, despite all the problems it has. You are going to be frustrated especially if you feel compulsive need of getting every achievement, because online stats are buggy as hell. Still, not as good as e.g. Dark Crusade, but it's an alright game on its own. Last Stand mode is incredibly repetitive, yet it manages to make you keep coming for more. If you're a fan of DoW series or 40k in general, you won't regret getting this game (too much).			"

												As THQ died, I am not sure about this franchise's future. This game however is great! Brutal combat, and a cover system like COH, and as an add-on The Last Stand mode is fun to play as well. Each Race/Faction is unique and for each of these races, you get 3 commanders, with their own specializations. Sadly, i'm not sure about the multiplayer, as depending on where you are in the world, it may lag.			"

												Dawn of War is the only franchise (except for Deus Ex) in existence where the german synchro is actually better than the original version. So thanks for not♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my ears. Also thanks for eating about 600 hours of my life (for the entire franchise). But still a fun game, love it!			"

												I find it difficult to enjoy Retribution, but I will recommend it with certain reservations. One the one hand, the small unit tactics and powerful feel of 2 and Chaos Rising has been preserved. On the other, there's no actual difference between campaigns. If I use Imperial Guard, for example, the campaign is utterly identical to the Tyranid or Eldar campaigns with the obvious exception of who I'm actually playing as. Most of the campaign missions are exercises in flooding the map with as many troops as possible in the vain hope of killing the massive monster with more health than a tank before it squishes everyone on the field. One late game mission comes to mind wherein a massive biological nightmare is attacking an unarmed APC that conveniently has your only way out on board. This thing has more health than most armored vehicles and can near instantly kill most infantry sent at it, and due to the mission itself, infantry is all you can send at it. One early mission has the player party of cardboard boxes intercepting and destroying a light armored convoy with no anti armor weapons avaliable due to how early in the game it is. Eventually the only solution is to barricade the exits with gun turrets and hope massed infantry fire will kill the vehicles. The best mission by far is roughly middle of the game, during which the player and party revisit a location from Chaos Rising and finally put an end to the big baddy from that game. This mission was certainly frustrating for a number of reasons, but it added a certain sense of closure to the whole plot line that wasn't present in Chaos Rising. IN short, this game is rather flawed but certainly playable if grinding is acceptable.			"

												Great RTS but I still liked the first dawn of war because you had some base building in it.This game feels more like commandos almost. You have your group of men that you upgrade with equipment and you fight to gain territory. You defend and attack and it can get repetitive sometimes but Warhammer 40k is just too awesome to pass down.			"

												Whilst I do prefer the original DoW games over Dow II, Retribution has one feature that has me coming back again and again The Last Stand.I wish someone would do a The Last Stand sequel as a separate game and add even more Playable characters, maps and even a few different game modes. Possibly even adding a solo mode to ramp up the challenge!Overall a decent game but for me The Last Stand is the best part by far.			"

												Orks, Eldars and Tyranids, oh my!DoW2:Retribution is the third installment of the Dawn of War 2 saga and a succesfull one at that.The campaign, one for each race, got a respectable playtime and also extremely fun to play with a friend!However DoW2 is an RTS at heart, and thus have MP as focus.DoW2 sticks out alot compared to fellow RTS game of making a base and mass produce units. Here you only have one building that will do all of it for you. And for every loving warhammer nerd out there, this game is a must have! Unless you don't like RTS games.Things like using the terrain for cover, or using a force push to send your own or the enemies troops to a location all makes DOW2 a unique RTS game that focus much more on you to take care of every squad you have. Retreat when necessary, roll in a tank to smash through walls when also necessary!With 6 Races, the game comes fairly balanced for an RTS. Should be considered purchase for the MP possibilities. 4/5			"

												Ok, well first of all, I come from playing Dawn of war 1 and its expansions, I skipped DOW2 and Chaos Rising. That being said, this game is very different. For multiplayer I would say this game is excellent, if you can get good enough to beat the skilled people who play. Quite a learning curve unless you're really good at RTS's .Also, the Last Stand Mode was amazing. In my opinion the Campaign was quite weak, but I suppose that can be excused by trying to create a storyline for 6 races. However, Dawn of War 1 dark crusade did this with 7 races and made an amazing game, with a decent story. One of my major complaints about this game is that it takes FOREVER to kill a unit, and more often than not, they just rout (run away super fast so you can't catch them) and regroup. I realize that does add some strategy to the game, but overall the battles are just not as fun or as dramatic as in DOW 1.So here's the summary:Gameplay:Singleplayer: 4/10Multiplayer: 8/10Graphics and Sounds are both about 7/10. I know people will say that i'm wrong with this, but I really liked the cartoony-but-cool graphics from DOW1 and the sound as well. This is, after all, my opinion. Anyhoo, that's what I think, thx for reading.			"

												Whilst I do prefer the original DoW games over Dow II, Retribution has one feature that has me coming back again and again The Last Stand.I wish someone would do a The Last Stand sequel as a separate game and add even more Playable characters, maps and even a few different game modes. Possibly even adding a solo mode to ramp up the challenge!Overall a decent game but for me The Last Stand is the best part by far.			"

												RTT done right. No base building, just straight into the action. Play is very deep and it is challenging to become good. Single player is fun and easy. Last Stand is fun and challenging. Multiplayer is hard. Been playing this game and its predecessors for years. Pick this up and join the battle.			"

												Driver disclaimer: This developer prioritizes Nvidia graphics cards.Newer AMD cards are probably fine - but older ones (particularly the ones nearing end-of life) are likely to crash after 10-20 minutes of gameplay.Additionally, the gameplay in DOW2 is fairly lackluster compared to DOW1 and the Company of Heroes series.Here's hoping DOW3 changes that trend.

												Fantastic RTS, That’s all about Micro Management. Like playing multiple people in a single Warfield. All about the Hot Keys, if you have bad memory don't even attempt to play Multiplayer. You'll find some of the most challenging players of the RTS genera in DoWII. An intense feeling of satisfaction when you win an online game. Even when you’re stomping a noob into their corner of the map. Out-♥♥♥♥’n-Standing in my opinion. I’d say some people are even scared♥♥♥♥♥♥less to attempt to play versus in multiplayer anymore.It’s a game where only the hardest players are forged or break down and their ego, shatter to pieces.

I mean honestly after trying to play the game I now know why most people ♥♥♥♥ing hate it. It is a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥moba version of the original. Everything takes an eternity to build/destroy and the game feels like everything is coated in congealed cosmoline. You can't even set the game speed. It does nothing well that it is attempting. I dislike almost everything about the game. Even with such little time played on it I can't get a refund for this pile of clunky reskinned CoH. Guess that is what I get for buying something on sale  and just now get around to play it 3 years later.The only positive comment I have is that the Tyranids are playable. That is honestly it. I highly recommend the first Dawn of War over this. Or really any other game.			"

I have always wanted to see the different ways each race would handle the same situation. I have enjoyed this game a lot and hope they either continue DW2 or start up DW3 series.The best part fo the game is playing with friends in the last stand mode.The biggest thing I would love to see is a Tau Campaign in a DW game in the future.

												One of the most entertaining games I have ever played, in my opinion of course.Its sad to see people wining about the campaign since I think its one of the best I have played. I have always wanted to see the different ways each race would handle the same situation. I have enjoyed this game a lot and hope they either continue DW2 or start up DW3 series.The best part fo the game is playing with friends in the last stand mode.The biggest thing I would love to see is a Tau Campaign in a DW game in the future.

												Driver disclaimer: This developer prioritizes Nvidia graphics cards.Newer AMD cards are probably fine - but older ones (particularly the ones nearing end-of life) are likely to crash after 10-20 minutes of gameplay.Additionally, the gameplay in DOW2 is fairly lackluster compared to DOW1 and the Company of Heroes series.Here's hoping DOW3 changes that trend.

												While still not a solid RTS, it fixes all of the stupid that was in DOW2 and made even worse in Chaos Rising. You still have heros, but you also get units, like an actual strategy game, rather than walking a bunch of chattering dolls around (or in the case of CR, balancing a terribly designed karma system). The campaign is comparatively short but playable by each race and provides reward choices that aren't throwaway trash items 90% of the time. Unfortunately, the campaign hero units only go to level 10 and there's a much more limited selection of equipment. Ultimately a much better game than DOW2 and CR, but too short. This still isn't anything like the original DOW - so if you need a 40k RTS fix, get a copy of Soulstorm and grab the Ultimate Apocalypse mod.			"

												Перед нами детище студии Relic и ныне покойной THQ:Warhammer 40.000 Dawn of War 2 Retribution.Я бы хотел начать свой обзор с сюжета и описать его по подробнее, но так как его нет (об этом позже) перейдём сразу к деталям:1)Графика: на графон разрабы явно забили и не стали ничего менять со времён выхода Dawn of War 2.2)Звук: среднего качества, вобщем радует неочень.3)Геймплей: нуден и глуп, это САМЫЙ большой минус игры4)Сюжет:теперь по подробнее, нам наконец дали сыграть за кого-то кроме Кровавых воронов, нам обещали много интересных компаний.Что я про это скажу?Да♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥там был, компании шаблонные, тоесть одни и те же миссии только в разном порядке и разными диалогами(зависит от расы за которую мы играем) так что провал и тоже минус.5)Мультиплеер:1)Битвы-очень долгие и не экшоновые, постоянные лаги из-за людей у которых комп♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ но они выкручивают графон на максимум(синхронизация проводица по самым лагерным) так что хрень.                        2)Режим арены-интересная вещь, за ней можно скоротать несколько часов описывать больно не буду, но приедается он быстро.Итог: игра является эталоном того как нельзя делать и игры, так что НЕ РЕКОМЕНДУЮ И УМОЛЯЮ НЕ ТРАТЕ НА НЕЁ СВОИ ДЕНЬГИ!!!!!!!!

												Ok, I normally can't be bothered to write a review, but there's a few things you should know before paying anything other than 75% off for this game. I'll keep it simple.Single player campaign feels like a rushed afterthought. No more cool planetary backdrops or watching your ship jump into a new system. Now you get a static map and dumbed down levelling system. DoW II is better if you want single player, unless you simply HAVE to play as Orks/Eldar etc.But wait! Multiplayer is what it's all about anyway right? It could be, but seeing as finding a public game that doesn't boot you out after the countdown reaches zero is next to impossible, you're limited to private matches. The Last Stand works fine, but if you only want to play that you can buy it seperately anyway.Overall it's a shame, as DoW II is good fun, especially in multiplayer, but without the ability to actually play public matches, all Retribution really brings to the table is a new race to play as. On your own. If you want a solid multiplayer strategy game with an active community and servers that (mostly) work, get CoH instead.			"

												This is not a good game.I love the last stand gamemode and the fact that Tyranids are now a thing, but that's where my love for this game ends.I'll start right off with the absolute worst thing about this game: Tau are DLC and, soon enough, you'll have to pay for the Necron DLC as well, although for the time being it is free.What the ♥♥♥♥!?I can play those two in DARK CRUSADE if I want to! You shouldn't have to pay extra for content that was IN PREVIOUS GAMES!The Tau and Necrons were my favourite factions, and now I have to pay *extra money* to play as them because the publishers are such bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.And what's more, they completely ruined skirmish mode! The gameplay is entirely different and it's the kind of thing I'd expect from something that ISN'T part of the DoW series. It completely deviates from all the games before it, and it sucks.They also got rid of that sandbox-y campaign and it's now linear.Long story short: If you want to play Dawn of War, play Dark Crusade or Soulstorm. Not this pathetic excuse for a Dawn of War title.			"

												I kinda have to say no to this expansion. I like the fact, there are 6 fractions(I only played two so far) but the fact is, than none of them got me wanting to play more. I have to forced myself to play more, to feel I didnt waste any money(glad I got it on sale)The game is VERY liniar(same maps for all fractions). The old games had me wanting more, when I left the computer, this does not.You can chose between heroes or units, to bring along, but it seems the units are the strongest, so you bring them, even though the hero classes are the most fun, so I kinda wish I did not have the choice.The game does not feel ""intimate"" anymore. You bring some units and on top of that you can buy more units, so you do not get that ""personal"" relationship, with your units as you did with your heroes.All in all, I do not recommend this expansion.5/10			"

												10/10 destroy cover with large units simulator 2011But seriously, I didn't really want to do an actual review because it's just going to be whatever everyone else says, but what kills it for me is that all of the campaigns are identical except for the dialogue of whoever you decide to play. It's a 5 year old game, and $30 dollars is still way too much to pay for this. I will edit my review to give it a thumbs up when it's 5-10 dollars. No wait...I won't, because it's also riddled with DLC.If you want to play an awesome game and don't really care about older looking graphics, get Dawn of War: Soulstorm. Far superior game.			"

												Actually one of the worst DoW games I've ever played. See DoW should resonate two things: Incrediable heroes, and incredible single player experience. This game.... neither. The heros aren't ""incredible"" by any means. They lack the personality and story lines from the previous DoW's. In DoW 2, for example, I loved Aviticus's character. His **** everything attitude, his ""no males, no females, just soldier's"" look on gender, and not just his story or just him, I liked all of the characters, they were all unique and intriguing... this game... literally.... is just copy paste mentality gone too far. The campaign consists of the EXACT....SAME....LEVELS..... OVER.... AND OVER..... AND OVER..... NO MATTER WHICH RACE YOU PICK. SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""Well how can that be? The Space Marines have to fight a giant demon for the end where they and chaos are the only races that ever go to that planet at that time""Man ♥♥♥♥ your logic, we're LITERALLY gonna put in a 30 second narration that says durring the tyrinid campaign ""Yeah that demon is bad news we better just break the space/time continuium and make a battle that should never have happened happen.... cause we dont want to spend the time or effort actually writting a ♥♥♥♥ing story that makes sense for each individual race.""""Well fine...ok... thats one race.... but what about the other's?""Repeat my last comment but input the name of whichever race you want.""What about the battle sisters? the necrons? the Tau?""We'll have one sentence of dialauge that mentions each race and how we chalk up their lack of existance to ""they arent around."" But the tau can be a playable race in the Last Stand Stand Alone game... just no story or any real relevence at all.""So... you took the time and effort and money to develop the Tau models, and weapons, and unit actions.... and then just said.... '♥♥♥♥ them and their story?'""YepDawn of war 2 and Dawn of war 2 Chaos Rising were a little dissappointing but I would still recomend them. They were very fun and surprisingly had decent character story and plot. This game is terrible. And if you want to get the game just for ""The Last Stand"" game mode, dont.... you can get it stand alone.			"

												Seemed like a good idea for $13.75 with all the DLC. However, it seemed that Relic Entertainment didn't provide any updates to resolve the slow load times or co-op multiplayer issues. It could be due to the free weekend overload but I doubt it.PROS1. ThemeInteresting story about the Blood Ravens, Exterminatus and how all the different factions play a role in the overarching story. I like how they made sure all the races melded into one main story.2. Wargear & SkillsI like the customisation of skills and equipment. The 3 different skill trees (Combat, Health and Energy) add a small change in playstyle.3. Multi-Race CampaignNice to know that each race has its own campaign.4. Last StandFun. Gets a little boring playing the same match though.CONS1. Load TimesFor some reason, the game requires one to wait for 2 whole minutes before one can start a map and another 2 whole minutes before one can close the game. This is a major downer for me. For a 2011 game, it is quite odd.2. Server IssuesWhile trying to play Last Stand, the game hangs after the countdown finishes. It is only during some rare occasion that a game starts up.3. RepetitiveControl your leader and his honour guard, attack or defend, break open crates, capture points and bases. Every single location seems to be exactly the same. The only major difference tends to be a boss fight, other than that there is nothing unique.4. Overly-Simplified CampaignThe way you capture the bases at fixed locations is quite odd. It's as if a base was magically planned to be there. Sometimes, the bases are redundant as your hero can just summon units. E.g. Hive Lord calling in Genestealers5. CoverUnsure if it's even necessary. While it is possible to hide behind cover, there isn't a real need to.6. AIThe AI is just silly, it can't path around simple blockages or auto-attack enemies. E.g. Genestealers don't know how to go around an obstacle to attack. You have to break the obstacle with your Hive Lord before the Genestealers know how to attack. 7. Unit SupplyI really do not understand why you have to capture a supply building. I can understand capturing Requisition and Power but the whole idea of a satellite dish providing supply seems odd. The theme just doesn't sync with the idea of unit supply.8. Redundant Heavy UnitsYou don't really have to destroy bases in the campaign, so it makes you wonder why you need vehicles/heavies at all. You hardly see turrets in except in the early stages of the campaign and even then you can deal with the turrets without heavies.9. Resource CratesYou have to manually Right Click on the Requisition and Power that appear after a crate is broken. It's quite tedious and does not provide any fun. Why couldn't they just automatically collect the resources when they fall out? The same problem applies to dropped Accessories and Hero Equipment.10. AbilitiesLots of visual effects but no impact. a. The casting is not smooth. There is a long windup before certain abilities trigger, which may result in misses. E.g. Hive Lord's Plasma Barrageb. Inaccurate E.g. Doombolt from the Chaos SorcerorThe best executed abilities seem to be those that do not require aiming and are centred on the hero. E.g. AOE heal or Doomblast.11. Last Stand Lack of DiversityWhy can't we use all the commanders? Why is it restricted to 1 from each race?NEUTRAL1. Unit DesignI'm a bit aghast at how some units were designed. This is a personal preference but I thought I ought to write it out. E.g. Tyranid ranged units (Termagaunts, Hive Lord) and their ""hose gun"" concept.SUGGESTIONS1. Ping Column for MultiplayerI can't see the ping to another player. I would prefer a lag-free game instead of a 200-400ms lag game.			"

												Retribution isn't an AAA title but it's very good. It manages to capture a lot of the Warhammer feel while focusing on micro-based gameplay. The game is also more friendly toward mods than the previous Games for Windows Live entries in the series.The game needs some balancing work in some areas (which may or may not ever get done), and it has a memory leak issue on load times. Also the DLC is generally not worth the money.			"

Had great potential but failed. Level cap is 20. Everyone gets the same weapons. This is would be great for an xbox console. I restate this is extremely inferior to the DOW 40K-DOW:Soulstorm. Shame on you Relic.. I really wish I could get my money back. I feel conned thinking this was an upgrade to DOW.. Stay far away PC DoW fans.			"

												The worst part of DoW II. Definitely not like it. Vanilla part was quite good, Chaos Rising just perfect, and the final part Retribution wasted the potential. It's sad that devs abandoned the way the made previous parts. Now we have a mix of the first and second part of the game what make it not as good as first and the second one. New ways of receiving troops and mechanics are bad part of this title. And most disappointing fact is that we cannot import save from Chaos Rising and use our team. As well it is weird to use in campaign heroes that we killed in Chaos Rising as traitors...			"

												Retribution is quite different to DoW2 and DoW2 Chaos Rising; there are 6 races each with their own campaign - but the campaigns are only slightly different in terms of dialogue and enemy. You will still visit the same planets. The game also added a different dimension to your hero squads by giving your resources to buy units. These units are cheap cannon fodder for the most part. The loot & RPG elements of DoW2 and Chaos Rising have been drastically dumbed down for the worse. I would recommend this but the game has crashed twice on me in the first 2 hours. Played the first level of each campaign to play with the units, but overall not worth me fighting through the crashing. Coould be because of Windows 10.			"

												I am a bit confused as to whether I own the game or not lol.Edit: I traded for a ""pack"" that said it contained both Retribution and the Last Stand, both SEGA support and Steam support deny any issues with my case so I am left with wondering why I even got it in the first place if I didn't get what it said it contained in the description, that being also Retribution, for which I got it, and not just The Last Stand.

												In my opinion the Dawn of war franchise is the best warhammer based game ive seen and played. If you like  strategy games and either warhammer or a stong story of space meets fantasty id highly recommend this.Community is still keeping this game alive today, if you are new to this game id download the elite mod which transforms this game with loads of new skins, maps, wargear and even a very well put togeather secondary race: The Grey Knights.

												I hate this game, plain and simple. The first game was awsome and had all the features I want in a RTS, while this is just a♥♥♥♥♥♥MOBA game. Despite the fact I adore the Warhammer franchise despite all the crappy retcons and bad management descions I just can't play this pile of crap. When they take down the servers in a few years it won't even work becasue there is no skirmish mode. You have to play an online match against bots that you can't kill because everytime you hit one of their units it runs away and heals up.Also tanks are OP. If you expect the Great Unclean one to be worth your time, don't. The only other daemon units die before they can even engage the enemy most of the time becasue they lose health at a ridiculous rate outside of combat.No base building either. This game pulled a Skyrim and made the franchise something prettier to look at, but under its skin its simpler in a bad, annyoing way that isn't fun for some people.Lot's of people like it, but I hate this game.

												I came back to DOW2: Retribution after a long hiatus and I can honestly say: I would NOT recommend this game to anyone.  It is a poor and feels like a rush and sloppy continuation of the series.Pros:1. You can play 6 of the Warhammer 40K races in campaign and multiplayer2. Co Op campaign with a friend3. custom color your army for multiplayer4. new DLC skins for troops and Last Stand5. The Last Stand is funCons:1. The multiplayer takes far to long to find a ranked game.  Likewise, there are very few NonRanked games avaialble at times.2. The races are always unbalanced, despite the amount of updates released.3. The units LEVEL UP makes it impossible to fight back or even start a counter attack near the game's end.  This only makes the opposing side quit early or just lose interst in playing any further.4. Campaign is linear and has the same story arch, with no variation for either race.  Every Map has no freedom of movement, which forces players to go in ONE direction.  This was never a factor in the previous DOW II installments.5. People who bought hte Collector's Edition were cheated out of their money for rubbish cards and a small poster.  For the same price I expect an art book, a soundtrack or more.  I purchased the C.E. upon pre-order and I was utterly disgusted by what was offered.  Their advertisement for the items was very misleading.6. Units are expensive, you spend more time managing them than playing the game.Too add: I have been giving this game so many benefits of a doubt that I just finally said, ""it fails"". A Game is ment to be fun and exciting, DOWII: Retribution kills that by making you feel RUSHED, TENSE, & ANGRY. It takes a lot to get me mad, and this game has pushed that button. Other RTS games were challanging but at least they were fun and had preferable replay value. DOW: Retribution is so unbalanced it's annoying. Every race is expensive, even for weaker units. You spend more time trying to amass resources that you when you finally buy that 400 gold +250 Wood super unit, when it dies out just 10 seconds after purchase, I just say ""F@ck it!"" Dawn of War 2 Retribution is a poor sequel to its predecessor, Dawn of War, in terms of multiplayer, unit management, combat and most importantly FUN. I have more fun at the table top than I do with this...thing. (It doesn't even deserve to be a game, let alone have a Warhammer 40,000 theme attached to it.) This game feels more like it was rushed and lacks any sign of polish, enjoyment or a supportive staff.			"

												I'm not sure what to think of this game. When I heard that there were different campaigns for all the playable factions, I was hyped. I thought it would be reminiscent of Warcraft in that they'd all tie into each other - nope. They're all the same missions, just with your faction. They all play differently, but not to the extent of Dawn of War 1. You never really ""feel"" like your faction is all that different from the others.Speaking of Dawn of War 1, Retribution really feels like it wants to recapture the massive, awesome battles that took place there. Does it succeed? Not really, no. All it did was take the squad-based mechanics of 2 and took the scale of 1 to make some overly-simplistic, watered down mess. And despite what Orks may say, ""bigger"" isn't always ""best"" - the game doesn't seem to know what to do with big armies, so if you're at a choke point or narrow walkway your units will kind of just crowd around and get stuck. That is INCREDIBLY frustrating. Be an RTS or a squad-tactics game, you can't be both.And I don't know if this is just me, but I have a hard time telling some of the units apart. In DoW1 it's never an issue because the lighting was better and each unit just seemed more unique.Overall, this isn't a bad game, just a disappointing one. Some people may not feel the same way I did about some of these things, but I personally just found it to be a frustrating experience.			"

												This game makes a feeble attempt at solving the massive issues with DoWII, and fails. I had so much hope that this title would live up to the DoWI-series games (Dark Crusade, Soulstorm, etc), but was left completely disappointed. The battles may be slightly larger, but you are not able to ""build a massive army"" as the advertising claims. It, just like DoWII, tries to be both and RTS and an RPG, but fails at being either of them fully. It has the same boring, linear levels, the same short, flat storytelling, and the same overall lack of tactical depth and complexity that we have seen from the DoWI-series games. Hell, even the ""campaign customized for your favorite race"" isn't even really true. Every single race has the same campaign, just reskinned with minor differences. I'm glad I got this on sale instead of full price, because it is *NOT* worth full price.I know the fanboys are going to whine at me about how DoWII is sooooo much more like the tabletop, and to that I have one question: does it NEED to be like the tabletop to be GOOD?

												Dawn of War 1 is better, you can mass and invade, here you only get about 7 squads and run back and forth to the enemy base or to protect yours.It's like cat & mouse.Notice: All reviews are subjective to opinion, if you don't like mine and you're going to be a troll, you can walk the other direction and shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, your comment you write WILL be deleted if it's trollish.

												I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR DAWN OF WAR 1 FANS. this game is decent as a separate game, but it claims to be  from the dawn of war name but it PLAYS NOTHING LIKE DOW1!.ill number down the reasons.IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER GAME entirely.1-lack of variety the units types are significally numbered down for example Space marines(expansion included) had about 17 units, now is numbed again down whit only 8 or so. also DOW used to have 9 races(whit expansions)  DOW2 whit expansion has the grand total of only 6......2-There is no builder unit and beacuse of that there are no building to be build, you just buy them from your HQ which numbs the game down into just a tactical stratey game inteads of a hydrid RTS that was DoW1. you cant longet build turrets, barrack etc or  keep unlocking technologys like a RTS should be and DoW was.3-The special kills that used to be so prevalent in DoW1 are almost missing in DoW2.4- Squad size and equipment selection is also numbed down. what was a Space marine whit a squad size of 10, is now fully upgraded in DoW 2 only size 4. in DoW1 you could have different weapons add ons in the same squad, for example a Space marine squad whit two plasmas and 2 bazookas, this is no longer true in DoW2 you ca only equip one add on and equip it to only 1 squad member.5- DoW1 where you captured resource points and build energy at your base,. in DOW2 you capture bot on the field (resources and energy) and cant no longer build a turret to defend the command points.6- No longer have multiple heroes instead you choose from only 3 available ones at start. that will determine how you play... or so they claim they basically fight in a bunch of units. Those are the major diferences whit all of this changes DOW2 feels like a capture the flag game just taking a point to be taken back later and retaken by you again, there little about strategy here basically go whit your entire units in one big bunch and take point after point and battle agains another big bunch of units doings the same. there basically no strategy here.   They tried to mix the excelent system of Company of heroes whit some DoW dashed in there. if only they did it right in COH you  took command of points 3 to be expecific (gas,ammo and  the star thingy) but they needed to be linked up whit the base in order to receive you resources. you could have a unit take a strategic point between the connecting points and cut off their resources from them enteriley by breaking the chain, by doing that they manage to have a fast but STRATEGIC game and here is not the case in DOW2 it feels like and asymetrical DOTA.

												This game is fun if you are into MOBAs or ARPGs. But if you are looking for a good actuall RTS game or the succesor of the greatest game of all time, this is not one of those. The only positive thing I can say: good graphicsWhat I really really hate about the game:-retreat function-no way to stop the retreat halfway-no view range on strategic points and power noded-no ability to place listening posts on your strat points-victory controll point system-lack of bases-vanilla game was so poorly balanced you kinda had to play the elite mod, banshees could jump over nothing and would die long before they could melee any ranged unit in cover.-open maps (+ poor view range on strat points) allowed enemies always to sneak units behind the lines which would decap all your points before you can react.-original campaign was total boring with just 11 soldiers total instead of 100 soldierspoor pop cap + shared vehicle/infantry cap-can never controll areas because you never have enough units/turrets to cover every acces, and even if you could your army was spread tot thin-small squad sizes-game is more about microing special abilities than it is about troop composition and deploymenttypical game was over before anybody could afford a tier 3 unit.-useless minimap with oversized and ovelapping symbols, made it extremely hard to locate units when they were close to a strat point. The square structure symbol would overlap the power symbol when you build a power nod.summary of gameplay; there is no gameplay really... the only thing you do is micromanaging your squads to capture, decapture and recapture strat points, power nodes and victory points. Capture points faster than the enemy and you will win. From my experience I noticed that you quite litterly spend more time capturing stuff than to attend to actual combat. With so much micromanaging it was not even remotely entertaining to play vs an AI opponent as he would have a unit capping your points 24-7.My oppinion, this game is not even remotely an RTS game for it lacks the S part and as such it is an epic fail as a succesor to dow1. The gameplay is so horribly useless and because of the frustrating micromanaging I could not give 2 damns about the goodgraphics. If it was a standalone game I would give it 4.5/10 as DOW succesor 2.0/10			"

On hard/very hard sniper can easily kill soft target without the AI resisting, might as well be a coffin instead of a bunker. No base building or gathering of resources per se as this game is a tactical RTS. Loot is kinda of minimal. One run thru on hard maybe around 13 hours but that's probably on the slow side.			"

												한글 리뷰는 밑에 있습니다.Retribution is good game.If you imagine stand and lead Imperial Guard army into Imperial battle field, it nice game for you.But! But I must NOTICE you 2 THINGS before you buy this game.First.DOW2 : Retributuion has some critical bug like Imperial Guard Heavy Weapon Squad, AND IT DIDN'T FIXED FOR 4 YEAR SINCE BETA TEST!SecondDOW2 has NO USER, EXCEPT NO LIFE KINGS WHO THROW BUNCH OF THIER HOLE LIFE IN THIS GAME(ofcourse, includes me.).Becarful, no noobs in this game.At 1st time you access multi player game, every players will leap on you, bite your windpipe, cut your legs, and eat your heart while you are beg for mercy!!

												Not the worst game I've ever play'd but lacks any real replay factor in the campaign. The multi-player is solid as long as you have a friend to play with, and the same can be said about the last stand gametype.t its core, the game has some pretty neet features  like the use of cover and race/hero abilities, but falls short with a fairly low population cap and feels to be lacking that X factor that makes certain games stand out in you'r mind.all and all, if you buy this game you wont be makeing a mistake, just not the best choice out there, for a better experiance I'd advise Company of Heros. Wich has all the things that are great about this game, but with base building, and more interesting campaigns/maps. (Relic really nailed that one)			"

The art style is quite good.If you really really like the original mythology, or like MOBAs in general, then this game could be for you. Get it when it's under $7 USD on it's own, or better yet, wait for a Steam sale and get the whole series.			"

												It seems that since the last game they've taken a huge leap backwards.There is Literally no base building, You just hold point with he tiny armies that have been allowed in this installment all spawned from the home base structure. No room for different play styles, little to no skill is required to play, or learn.Heroes act as just another unit, rather than a leader, other than the fact that they can spawn turrets, but thats it.For small scale Battles, sure 10/10 but for the intricate mechanics of a real RTS, Opt for the first game.</Rant>			"

												Stellar, absolutly fantastic. i love everything about the game!core gameplay - a straight continuation of the great Dawn of War 2 - RTS with focuses solely on unit tactics and no base building. you will have to take care of every single unit you have, position it the right way, make sure it covers the right area, and its in proper cover. use every one of your units' special abilities to turn the tide of combat. and make use of global abilities to decimate your foes.the lack of base building only enhances the experience - less focus on your off-battle base and more micro and tactics in the actual battle.what adds more to the experience is how different this game's singleplayer than the original DoW2 - instead of just starting with 4 squads and nothing more. you start only with 4 heroes and can buy additional squads and units as you progress through the level.this  makes long-term descions with what units to buy at what time and what weapon to equip them with - all the more exciting.and despite the fact that i liked the original's campegin more. this is still a fresh and exiciting way to take on the SP.now a very important note: the presentation are BLOODY AMAZING,the graphics are beutiful and every unit is very detailed. the effects of explosions, plasma shots and blood are awsome the physics of how rocks and buildngs fall apart as the battle rages on is facinating.and to top it all off, great voice acting. every unit has great responses and LOTS of them. they even respond differetly to every kind of enemy they face. the amount of detail in this game is simply unmatched. this is a must-have for every RTS fan. who cares about the base building if the combat is what really matters? if basebuilding is what you want. go play a city building game or stronghold.

												I'm not sure what this is.... this game used to be $5!!  Now its 66% off for $11?  And all the dlc too? Definitely not worth it, virtually no updates or improvements since release... in 2011! And the price has gone way up in 2014?!  Good game but no where near the original DOW and no way deserving of a huge price jack up.			"

												Linear game, that's all I can say. RTS as it's worst.Gameplay in 99% of time is limited to frontal assault. World is a maze... no, it's just a straight road with lots of turns, to fit into minimap.It should be fun for 12-years kids. It's boring after any good strategy. I'd prefer first warcraft.			"

												Apparently not cross-platform multiplayer. I find this very disappointing, as I got this back when I used Windows, and figured I'd be able to play it with friends who use Windows, while I'm on Linux.As for the game itself... It's a huge disappointment to a huge fan of Dawn of War 1, and the expansions for it. DoW1 was amazing. With the expansions, there were something like 9 unique races to play. It was a great RTS. DoW2 came along and wasn't even worthy of carrying the DoW name. It wasn't an RTS. It was a tactics game. It's fun for a little bit, but it's far too dumbed-down compared to DoW1. One ultra strong building producing everything, within 3 tiers. Fewer units, smaller maps, more restricted gameplay, and a cute gimmick ""last stand"" mode to compensate for the boring tactics play.From the perspective of an RTS fan who played the original DoW, this game was a horrible miscarriage of a sequel. But looking at the game as a standalone... It's okay; nothing special. Had the sequel been more like the original, it could have been phenomenal.			"

												while there is some things to this game it is not overly complex, there are interesting single player campaigns and quite a bit of mission depth hover it to me falls into the same sort of trap a lot of rts games do with odd balancing and limited unit variety: so if you like good single player campaigns then this should be good for you, if you want a really good and interesting multiplayer and skirmish experince then I would say while this is not ""bad"" the should probebly keep looking; and the dlc so much useless 80$ worth of dlc so bad I didn/t even want to buy it.

												I really want to recommend this game. Trust me, I really do. But after playing with a friend for over 6 hours and completing only 7-8 missions, I've come to realize that I've completed hardly anything in my co-op Campaign. Why?The game is riddled with bugs.I've had sessions where the desync between me and my friend was horrendous and we couldn't play at all that day, then there was an issue where the mission wouldn't load... Later my friend dropped from my game which ran fine for a mission or two, and then crashed straight to desktop. Found out it was a bug regarding sound between players which basically meant that if you wanna play properly and avoid the bug, the workaround was to disable Sounds Effects volume. Like really.What the hell was the QA team for this game doing?Excuse me if I'm harsh but I work as QA too, (I immediately regret my decision), but seriously! These are freaking basic bugs that should have been sent to the devs after finding them in an easy 2 player co-op to fix them... But... Nope.I got the game on a sale for like 5 bucks, so that's cool, don't pay more than that for it, I recommend it for that price, for it's current price, however... PERFORM EXTERMINATUS.			"

												So I just bought the Dawn of War II Retribution for mainly nostalgic reasons since I used to play alot of the first Dawn of War and loved it. Once I installed the game I played a bit of the Campaign then vs'd bots in a custom game and it hits me. THIS GAME BLOWS! They removed all base building♥♥♥♥♥♥the UI is confusing asf and the AI are so unrelenting and random its like playing a goose chase. *Captures a Requisition point*, *Base gets attacked*, *Go back to base, defend*, *Ooh the requisition point is under attack*... This is essentially the essence of the game, they have made it so hard to think strategically since from the moment you start the game the AI are doing random♥♥♥♥♥♥like sending units to attack your HQ and just being a pest.. This ruined my day and will ruin yours if you buy.			"

												This game is not a patch on the first game, it is repetitive and boring with each mission for each race being the same boring garbage each time.  The different races missions are basically the same as each other.  Nothing interesting at all.  The on-line coop game mode is boring and pointless, in fact most of the time you feel like you are an observer to some mayhem rather than playing a game.Very very disappointed in this, honestly if you want a Warhammer 40K rts experience then the first dawn of war and its various expansions is the only way to go as this is way below average.

												I'm a fan of the Dawn of War series. I'm looking forward to Dawn of War 3. And I'm telling you to NOT purchase this game.I bought the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Master Collection for $54.00, which included Dawn of War 2, Dawn of War 2: Chaos Rising, Dawn of War 2: Retribution, as well as an extra DLC Campaign, DLC Multiplayer and The Last Stand DLC game mode. Of these, only the base campaign in Dawn of War 2 and the Chaos Rising expansion pack actually work. Retribution, on the other hand, won't load. You can get up to the main menu just fine, but then the game displays a steam error and freezes up. You can't start a campaign, multiplayer or The last Stand. Whatever the problem is, it's related to Steam. Either way, avoid this game unless the problem gets fixed.			"

												Was really hyped to hear about every faction having their own campaign until I started another playthrough with a friend and it turns out each race is just C&P'd into this mostly-boring campaign. There are a few really good missions but most are tedious and/or too easy. Uneven difficulty and a short campaign makes it hard to justify playing on higher difficulties. Besides that, you basically have Chaos Rising's MP modes and units. Unless you are a big IG fan I would recommend getting the original and/or Chaos Rising (which I loved but I'm a huge Chaos fan) instead.			"

												Dark Crusade with the Annihilation mod was better than anything that came after it. Don't grab this unless you're a real WH40K buff and wanna own anything related to the franchise. Took away the fun aspects of the original DoW games and turned it into little more than a MOBA blended with a RTS. 40 points.What changed versus the original DoW series?- No more building bases, you get a single HQ with lots of HP. You call in reinforcements at this point. That means no more forward bases.- Strategic Points became Requisition Points and Power Nodes. Prepare to run your squads from one end of the map to the other to defend, because that's always fun. /sarcasm- Balance went out the window. You can basically field nothing but Tier III units and win. Eldar are even MORE hilariously overpowered than the original, but that's okay by me because I love them.- Campaign is...so...BLAND. The Risk incarnation of Dark Crusade and Soulstorm went to hell - became linear missions. Unfortunately, all the races share the same missions with vague differences here and there. Good lord, I can't even bring myself to complete it multiple times and I'm a serious achievement buff.- Certain hero types with certain wargear setups are absolutely overpowered and will wipe out entire armies rather easily. I'm looking at you, Eldar Farseer.- So few races. You got Chaos, Orks, Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar and Tyranids.- THOSE DLCS! God, it's like...Borderlands 2. A more shameless money grab you will be hard pressed to find.- 2 sides. Yours and theirs. No more 8 player FFAs.+ Wargear became more interesting. They're all interchangable once purchased (with a bit of time needed to swap), so you better figure out a play style eventually and upgrade your commander accordingly. I'm referring to multiplayer of course.+ The Last Stand is fun. Also known as The Last Standalone in the steam store.Never played DoW games?Beyond the whole avoid-this-like-the-plague commentary...this is a bit of a mess. Regular gameplay (I'm talking multiplayer) involves you and your allies sharing a base on one side of the map. You get a Headquarters (once destroyed, is gone for good) along with some anti infantry turrets. You basically use your initial units and resources, go and capture a resource point to increase your resource trickle. While you're at it, go capture the enemies' (there's only 2 sides - your side and theirs) points to slow their trickle. Rinse and repeat until you have overwhelming firepower one way or another and can press the assault. It's pretty much a glorified MOBA. No idea what's with the strategy tag.Campaign involves linear missions with no real side paths. You jump on the same mission regardless of race but get vague variances here and there based on race. Maybe you can bring yourself to grind those out repeatedly, I couldn't. Campaign gameplay has no resource trickle, but to be honest your storyline heros are good enough without needing to train additional units. It's the whole 1-man-army crap all over again.The Last Stand is pretty much speaking for itself. Certainly popular enough that they made a standalone version and threw it in the steam store for like 10 bucks. Basically its you and 2 other people fighting waves and waves of enemies until you all die (think usually people explode in wave 15 or something where your enemies are all clones of the 3 of you). Amusing way of passing the time if you have friends or something.The amount of DLCs for this game is...unprecedented. It's like Relic was trying to hold on desperately to their sinking ship by throwing out cosmetic packs at high prices, knowing full well people would love to buy those. Didn't work though, their ship sank and the DoW series is gone with a horrific note.I see this mess is on sale now. As someone that lives in Australia (land of the hilariously costly games - can you say Diablo 3 for 90 bucks on release day?), 20 bucks seems decent for it I guess. Knock yourself out, but would really advise against it unless you're a serious diehard for WH40K and/or MOBA gameplay. Good thing this was a Christmas present that I could just bury under a rug somewhere.			"

												Something feels off. This expansion is a curious mix of two RTS styles: The base building we are all familiar with, and the squad tactics championed by its predecessor. While it is a fun playthrough, this is only thanks to the new races that have been introduced. But as far as cries for attention and attempts at raising the bar go, this game is far and away better than most.			"

												So is 2015 and is this game worth it?First of all for the prices YES, this thing is three games in one, with the only thing in common being that is a warhammer 40k game, and the top down perspective, but let´s see how these three games hold up.Single Player: The single player is an Almost Diablo-like Action RPG, there´s not much of troop management or what it is, is so little, the real focus is the campaign is to level up your character and get more gear, so you can stomp the oposition better, I´m not a big fan of the campaing, in fact if you´re looking for a good RTS or Strategy campaing, stay away from this, also as Diablo-like is not that great either.Last Stand: This mode, is almost like a CooP Moba game, is like that event they made for Dota 2, where you need to defend the Wrath King, like that. Is fun as hell, and addictive, as a matter of fact they made this into an standalone game you can get, if you don´t want the other two portions of the game, if you want an addictive and hard coop experience, this is the game for you. Multiplayer: Now this is my favorite part of the game, even If I´m not that good at it, it just have a great feel to it, people may say that there´s no strategy involve in this since you only spawn units and send them to fight, but they might be playing the game in the wrong way, the game is more focus on the actual fighting, and making a great fighting unit, for me this is like the Warcraft 4 that I always wanted, I like this game more than Company of Heroes or Starcraft II... I´m in love with this multiplayer, and fortunaly people still play it, there´s even a mod that expand on this, for this alone this I recommend this game.ALSO, is a great introduction to the Warhammer 40k universe.

												This here is an OK game. It unfortunately lacks a lot of the luster the previous DAWN OF WAR 2 games had. The campaigns are unfortunately EXTREMELY lacking. As in, they are ALL THE SAME. The equipment you get doesn't even seem all that unique either. But how you tend to approach the situations at least provides some differences that can be handy to take advantage of. However, the biggest advantage of the game is NO Games for Windows Live. That alone can make up for a lot of things, including just being able to play the game with other people. Its an OK game, overall. Can't wait till Dawn of War 2 in general gets away from Live though. With that done, Retribution won't really have much going for it			"

												The table-top brought to life! A great addition to the DoW franchise:- Offers a lot of re-playability in both the campaign and Last Stand game modes- RPG elements –particularly the gear and character customisation feel a lot more polished then the last expansion- Voice acting is great; I can't help but have a soft spot for the Orks and ol' Captain Bloodflag! - It's Warhammer!! What's not to like?Not so great:- Non-hero units in the campaign often feel useless compared to your heroes- Unit pathfinding can be a little frustrating (tip: use the right-mouse button to orient your tanks)- Tyranid campaign is a little lacklustre compared to the other races- The Last Stand mode is popular and really needs more love by the developersA worthy addition to your library and a must-have for all Warhammer fans.

												Great game, I rather like the gameplay, it really diverges away from the traditional base building and focuses more on the tactitical side of things where individual squads have the power to change the tide of a battle.The last stand mode is also great, I rather like the way you need team work to complete it unless of course you are a great farseer play in which that case it may take a long time but it is definitely possible to solo it.The campaign was a bit of a let down after playing the other two games that came previously in the DoW2 franchise, it is great the first time but it is a generic campaign for all the races and so can be a bit repititious.

												Breaking away from the traditions of the first Dawn of War, this second instillation of the classic and iconic RTS brings a new bold RPG element to it's gameplay. Borrowing game mechanics from hero-based strategy's such as DOTA and Leauge of Legends, Dawn of War II and it's expansions are based around hero units with special and dynamic abilites as well as a few supporting squads of infantry/vehicles. Do not be deterred by this change of pace, the action and combat is fluid and quite manageable. Loot drops and hero unit skill trees bring the player a close connection with the units on screen, and at times you'll find yourself praising whichever deity/ideal as you mow down your enemies with superior tactics!Overhauling the graphics engine, the visuals in this game have never looked better. THQ's and Relic's attention to detail with unit design, level design, and user interface is rivaled by few, and the developing duo captures the spirit of the Warhammer 40,000 universe once again! This is a must-play for Warhammer 40,000 fans, and the gameplay is very player-friendly, allowing newcomers to RTS's to learn the ropes quickly. In a nutshell: A second Dawn of War? What's not to like?!			"

In starcraft you can spam one unit and win the game. If you do that in this, most likely your going to lose because every unit has at least one other unit to counter it. You will be victorious by making sure your army has variety in it instead of just the same unit.			"

Under the looming threat of the Ordos Hereticus and its dreaded Exterminatus, the Blood Ravens and the other war hungry factions of the systems are pitted in a race against time to uncover and undermine a heresy that may spell the doom of the Blood Ravens and purge their entire Chapter from the annals of human history, and to the Emperor's blessed sons there is no fate worse than to be forgotten by their father.Beware the alien, the mutant, the heretic.

(Sega known for RTS game as well, and Try shogun2!! ) If they put all the element from Warhammer and ShogunI think there will be a great game will be born! just hope so though. Anyway heres the rating :Graphics : 4.5/5               Gameplay : 4/5 (single) 3.5/5 (multi) and hero defs( 4.5/5)         Physics (4.8/5)Fun : 4.5 / 5            Community : 4/5       (sorry for bad english though) :) "

												A unique and addictive tactical hack&slash gameplay on six different campaigns with six different (although not entirely) stories, the only RTS game which made me learn to play on my own online (as in, without any friends), good visuals (at the time), many game modes, generallly balanced six factions with three heroes per faction (compared to StarCraft 2's three) - this game is an absolute must buy, especially for a 40k fan.

												Campaign; Decent albeit rather linear. i.e, same campaign reguardless of Race but is understandable considering most of the development has went into the hero abilities and equipment.  Which in my opinion makes up the repetitive nature of it.Race Diversity/Balance; Tyranids caught my attention in lacking a little diversity in the fact they only have 1 hero to equip compared to the other 5 races having 4.  However, this is made up for by the Hive Lord being somewhat overpowered and 'Nids being good fun to play.Land Stand; Generally the same as the previous titles but tidied up a bit and with an awesome DLC hero, the Shas'O.Who, in my experience, is very nicely designed as he gets completely wasted in melee but the equipment options make him one of, if not THE best Damage option.Overall I feel DoW 2: Retribution is a far more accurate portrayal of how the armies should perform, based on the table top game.In comparison to the the previous DoW titles, which had some serious balance issues, mainly in having ranged units able to hold their own in melee or light/medium tanks with ridiculous health/damage.To sum up, the design of the armies in DoW 2: Retribution makes far more sense.Perhaps i'm looking at it the wrong way by basing my judgement on how accurately it reflects how the armies perform on table top, but the armies are meant to be using that as a template.That's my opinion anyway.

												I've always been in love with the universe of Warhammer 40K. Its races and the eternal war seem so familiar to me that one would think I would automatically fall head over heels with this game but not quite....The learning curve for this game is the biggest challenge and therefore to some people a turn off. Its taken me a long time to have any relative level of skill to even fight and know the procedures for one specific combo list let qalone the many formats that there are.Now that I'm in the know and I took some tiem to study and practice the multiplayer isint quite so daunting as it was before and I fully reccomend the Last Stand mode if you wanna experience something slightly different and fun in a different way, though still alot of grinding. Would I recomend it... yes to the gamers who want to challenge themselves.			"

												This really is for Warhammer 40K geeks and maybe no one else. The Game play is shoddy for a real time strategy. The campaigns can be fun for ther RPG elements but are overly short. Multiplayer can be a great riot in groups but it certainly isn't because the game is easily learned or played and not because the execution is solid either. Buggy and unresponsive controls will get to you. The only redeeming factor is the last stand function  whch has pretty good replay value.			"

												Great game, I rather like the gameplay, it really diverges away from the traditional base building and focuses more on the tactitical side of things where individual squads have the power to change the tide of a battle.The last stand mode is also great, I rather like the way you need team work to complete it unless of course you are a great farseer play in which that case it may take a long time but it is definitely possible to solo it.The campaign was a bit of a let down after playing the other two games that came previously in the DoW2 franchise, it is great the first time but it is a generic campaign for all the races and so can be a bit repititious.

												A must play for any W40K or RTS fan alike! Dawn of War II: Retribution brings the final playable faction to the second title in the Dawn of War series in a smaller, tighter and intense squad-focused tactical game.The campaign's story will leave you scratching your head (for those of you familiar with your 40K lore) but the multiplayer skirmishes, Last Stand mode and Army Painter make this another notable entry to Relic's hall of fame. The CG movies are beautiful and the art and sound department go all out to put on an impressive stage.I would love to see better community-involvement support for the next title. While there are quite a number of fun mods out there, you'll find yourself craving for new maps or a better replay viewer after putting in tonnes of hours. Of course, having all the armies playable would be a nice feature too. Lots of players still play Dawn of War: Soulstorm because of that! "

												Its has a easy mechanics however ever so difficult to master. The key things that well prevent you from being the best is:*Learning your play style e.g mine is using Choas Space marines with blood of khorne upgrade while using Choas cultist with grenades and terminator missiles with heavy bolters to supress enemy*Remembering what units are best for specific things and each unit in different factions. E.g Banshees from eldar, Flamethrowers in I.g and Space marines and Noise marines in choas to destroy Structures.*Adapting to fight in many different positions simulataneously.*Stopping hording armies to win like you did when you first played DOW2.*Take damn cover if possibleI do reccomend this game but when you first buy it you'll feel like it was a rip off. Thats because it takes time to realise you must adapt and stop using one type of unit for example I basically molested space marines all the time because I didn't know what other units to use and how. Also the other reason why you'll hate this game is because YOUR PLAYING ONLINE! There are 1000 players who have racked up 100's of wins and tend to be more common as they haven't given up in the game and mastered the game and start to have fun because they start to get consecutive wins. I mean I may not have the most hours but thats because I still know how new players feel like when they first play this game but I've played enough games and lost alot of games but still had my fair few in winning which means my perspective is from an average player in this game.Basically finish the tutorial it helps! Also play a few offline games before you jump in online games.			"

												A must play for any W40K or RTS fan alike! Dawn of War II: Retribution brings the final playable faction to the second title in the Dawn of War series in a smaller, tighter and intense squad-focused tactical game.The campaign's story will leave you scratching your head (for those of you familiar with your 40K lore) but the multiplayer skirmishes, Last Stand mode and Army Painter make this another notable entry to Relic's hall of fame. The CG movies are beautiful and the art and sound department go all out to put on an impressive stage.I would love to see better community-involvement support for the next title. While there are quite a number of fun mods out there, you'll find yourself craving for new maps or a better replay viewer after putting in tonnes of hours. Of course, having all the armies playable would be a nice feature too. Lots of players still play Dawn of War: Soulstorm because of that! "

												This game is a wonderful addition to the wide retinue of RTS games available for the PC. It is a great introduction to the world of Warhammer 40k - it simplifies the huge amount of rules and variety in the tabletop game into a great representative RTS.What I especially loved about this game was it's huge variety of units that weren't just remodels. Much like the tabletop game, the wide variety of races and units for each race makes each match/battle unique and it is indeed a challenge to figure out counters and a strategy for a specific race against specific races.The community, though small, is tight and dedicated. There are few regulars, but their matches are very fun to watch. More fun in my opinion, than Starcraft, simply because it looks much more like a battle. Instead of a heavy focus on a player's ability to pump out APM, DoW places heavy emphasis on strategy - unit choice, retreating, maneuvers and placement are of utmost importance. The large breadth of unit compositions and hero choices add to the challenge of the game.Overall - a very good game! I only wish the community was larger!			"

												dont get me wrong I love warhammer 40k and I think this game is a lot of fun but a few glitches and lazy A.I. programming at times can really detract from the fun. Theres nothing that ruines an rts more than poorly flushed out A.I. leaving a unit to gaurd a spot then coming back to them to find that they're being shot at and not only are they not firing back but they're not even reacting, lazy programming to the fu#@ing extreme. or moving all your units together click attack on a group of enemies an less than half of them move up and start attacking and the others just stand out of range staring until you click the indivual unit and tell it to attack seriously did somone spend like two minutes working on how the ai moves in a group? cause if they spent three they're fu#@ing idiots, not to mention how obvious it is that they just made the space marine campaign then just tacked on the other armies there are missions where you face heratic gaurdsmen and chaos marines when they did the chaos campaign they couldnt even be bothered the change the heretics to regular gaurdsmen and the chaos marines to regular marines so if you play as chaos most of the time you end up fighting other chaos forces with absolutely no explanaition why.overall it is a game worth playing just not a game worth paying full price for if you really want it wait for it to be on salerating : 5.8 out of ten			"

												Great game, I rather like the gameplay, it really diverges away from the traditional base building and focuses more on the tactitical side of things where individual squads have the power to change the tide of a battle.The last stand mode is also great, I rather like the way you need team work to complete it unless of course you are a great farseer play in which that case it may take a long time but it is definitely possible to solo it.The campaign was a bit of a let down after playing the other two games that came previously in the DoW2 franchise, it is great the first time but it is a generic campaign for all the races and so can be a bit repititious.

												Retribution is a very varied and flexible RTS, with lots of replayability (especially with mods) and enough variety in game modes that in many ways it's like three or four games in one.The required planning and micromanagement makes individual units important, but is balanced well enough that the loss of an individual unit isn't fatal. There's a huge range of abilities and different playstyles for the varied races, so you can usually find a race that suits your style, and the many different commanders create a lot of potential for replayability. In terms of scale, the massive battles of Dawn of War One are long gone, so if you're expecting apocalyptic thousand-soldier battle, you'd probably be better off with Soulstorm or Dark Crusade.In terms of value for money, this game that can give you a lot of replayability even before DLC. there is a lot of DLC that oter players will have and (if you're as poor as me) you probably won't, but in PVP it's all purely cosmetic, and in the Last Stand co-op mode you'll probably just be glad to have such good teammates. The campaign is pretty much the same for each race (even the enemy races are the same, meaning that players will probably end up facing their own side at some point) so once you've played through the campaign once, there isn't that much to encourage you to come back to it. The Last Stand is probably the most replayable feature of this game, as the huge (and increasing!!!!) number of different characters that you can use in it give you plenty of reasons to keep playing. The fact that there are only two TLS maps makes it slightly less interesting after a while, but leveling up heroes and unlocking new equipment to play with has always made up for that in my view. Put it this way; people would buy a TV series on DVD for the same price as this game, and I've got a lot more entertainment out of this game (in terms of time and quality) than most TV series.Dawn of War is great fun, and while it may not be the best RTS in technical terms, the over the top sci-fi setting and variety in gameplay helps to make up for the (few) shortcomings in balance.And if you do buy this game, and decide that you don't like something about it, there's probably a mod that changes it anyway.

With about 6 campaigns and awesome online multiplayer against CPU or real people its great, and the best part of the Game... LAST STAND were 3 people hold off against waves of enemies and upgrading and changing your gear is always nice, so get this game and have fun with the game, cause it is!!! there is so much more to say but,   just play it for yourself and you'll understand what I'm talking about			"

												Dawn of war 2: Retribution is what SoulStorm was to dawn of war 1. In simpler terms, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isation. Though this time they skipped the honey moon of Dark Crusade. Its basically Rambo 2. It looks like Dawn of War 2. It sounds like Dawn of war 2. But its just not Dawn of War 2. The campaign is lousy. The once decent, some-what well written and interesting characters have taken a back seat to ""Who gives a damn"" and it plays out from there. The campaign is rubbish and in a completely different style to how the last two games where, the multiplayer still suffers from the same problems as the last two (namely drop-outs) but this time there's super heavy vehicles. The DLC is a terrible joke. Go spend your money on something else. This game is what? 59$? Thats a movie and dinner for two. Or like, a mid range call girl.			"

												Not quite the same as the first Dawn of War, which blows the first Starcraft out of the water in terms of real time strategy games, but Dawn of War II is a great series unto it's own, the best in the series being Retribution which opens up the campaign story line (continued from the first game) into a sprawling galactic warzone involving many of the 40k races. Retribution has an excellent mod called Elite, which further balances the game as well as introducing the Grey Knights faction.			"

Online multiplayer is riddled with ruskies and other such scum that have played 500+ hours, making it nearly unplayable. When someone leaves an online game in the middle of a match, NOBODY gets exp. Very rarely you'll have a nice online multiplayer match, but you're better off playing with friends (implying anyone has this game)			"

In starcraft you can spam one unit and win the game. If you do that in this, most likely your going to lose because every unit has at least one other unit to counter it. You will be victorious by making sure your army has variety in it instead of just the same unit.			"

												DoW II: Retribution is easy to sum up.- It's somewhat buggy, and crashes a decent amount.- Balance in all modes is terrible (like in every-other DoW ever made, so what's new?)- DLC is expensive for what it is ($10 for ONE new character in Last Stand)- Single player campaign missions are copy-and-paste skirmishes.- It's netcode for multiplayer, while not the worst in history, is pretty damn close.- and I still recommend it, if only in a cautiously optimistic senseDespite all this, it still manages to be fun, especially the Last Stand mode, though if only you can manage to look past and ignore these considerable flaws.  It is also one of the only 40k games still kicking around.  There are much better experiences out there at the moment, which you might as well invest in, as the player count can get quite low sometimes, and the game can feel as though it is at the verge of extinction on a day-to-day basis (which it is).  There are always enough cool people to play with still dipping back in every now and again, whether it be for it's lop-sided competitive play, or the fun-but-heavily-flawed last stand mode.			"

												Slightly different from the predecessor DOW2, but more RPG type stuff with more of the units that were ejnoyable. Its neat to play the different races, even if its basically the same story taylored to a different team, all the same pretty neat, had a few elements that made the world feel real. I liked it, although i didn't go in for the 37 special mods, I felt kind let down by the new skins without new/more story.			"

Don't spend hours painting your model to then decide the colours are wrong or don't go together and having to paint the model all over again.Once you do get the colours right, the reference is right ther in front of you, everything from shading to highlights, rotate the model 360 degrees on the screen and paint with ease.

												A brilliant game, but is slowly dying and quite unbalanced. However if you do buy this game, I recommend downling the ""Caeltos Elite Mod"" which is an active mod, with active players and it balances most things that Relic failed to do. The mod adds new units to each race, major tweaks to each race, extra additions and also adds a new faction: The Grey Knights.The game is a worthwhile buy, plenty of hours can be put into the game if you stick to the Multiplayer, but shamefully its just not as good as it used to be.

												Ok I'll give it to you straight, This is a very short game around, one weekend you can finish the campaign! But this really is not a factor in this RTS, This game represents how good RTS games can be by providing you some of the best multiplayer ever seen with you having MOBA fights or massive land battles with you and a friend. The Graphics are far more superior than DOW one and has much better strategy but BEWARE, If you want a 1000 v 1000 battle your dreaming. I am speaking harshly about this game, but only because its so good to play and deserves to be in every one's steam View list as a Favourite or Favorite, if your American. One of the best RTS games is here! Although this is a bit dear, you get what you pay for. $40. May the Ork blood be forever on your chainsaw!			"

												Dawn of war: Retribution is an amazing game based on the popular tabletop wargame Warhammer 40,000. I have only played only3 missions and i am already hooked! I can see it has a lot to offer. You can play as any of around 7 different factions, each with their own background and story. I love the firing system, story so far and the charcater customisation. Along with the level-up system, there is a lot more character customisation than you would expect from this kind of game. My only criticisism is the movement system. It is confusing at best and the mouse is far too sensetive, especially for a real-time rogue-like-like game. Overall, 8/10			"

												A little 50/50 here, played and had fun with a few campaigns but I did not enjoy the game enough to play through all the others. They were too closely related and I felt as though I was repeating a lot of the story. In the end I felt unsatisfied. Only reccomended for Warhammer fans, not for everyone.			"

												very nice fusion of RTS and RPG where you can effectively level and equip hero units for a four man squad of death for a more rpg type of game or you can choose to unlock troops instead of equipment to play more like a rts. the game showcases the warhammer 40K setting incredibly and provides a taste of the major factions and there effective playstyles. all in all an encridible game with tons of replayability through the last stand game mode a 3 player coop wave based mode.

												A little late writing a review for this game, but it had to be done given how much I've enjoyed it.First and foremost, if you want a ""traditional"" RTS with basebuilding, mass unit production, and hundreds of the same unit: then this is not the game for you. That aside, there are a lot of ways to play this game (campaign, singleplayer skirmish, arena multiplayer, and pvp multiplayer), so you do get a good amount of game for your money.Singleplayer:The singleplayer in this game isn't the best. For campaign, all the 6 races have the same missions, which makes it lose replayability quite quickly. Worth a play through if you enjoyed the previous DoW2 campaigns, and having your 4 heroes make their way through masses of opponents as if it were nothing is always entertaining. There is also a co-op mode, but it doens't really change anything drastically.Skirmish against the AI isn't great either, as it is not particularly strong, nor much fun to play against. Sadly I think this is just a consequence of how the game works.Multiplayer:Multiplayer is where this game shines. There are 2 very different modes in multiplayer: pvp, and ""The Last Stand"" (TLS), a co-op arena mode, both of which are still going (albeit with a amall nice community) years after release.In TLS, you and 2 partners will try and survive 20 waves of AI opponents. I very much enjoyed this, and while newer characters have succumbed to power creep, there are a lot of options and fun ways to play.PvP is the mode I play most these day, and while the ""Find a Game"" option rarely has players, I've never struggled to find a game in the public list. This sees you pit your forces against another human, usually in gaves of 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3. These move between a lot of cat-and-mouse positioning and capping in 1v1, to much more army-vs-army battles in 3v3.This is not a ""traditional"" RTS however, you will only have a single base structure, and a few units, with most of the figting centred around Victory Points, where holding more than your opponent will tick down the count to victory. (Sidenote: there is an alternative ""annihilate"" mode which focuses just on detroying the opponents base, but this has much less finesse than victory points.)On the surface this seems simple, however there is a lot of depth, and play at a high standard can be a true art form. This is not the constant scaling up of economy and unit production seen elsewhere, intead being an elaborate dance of positioning, cover, hard counter, soft counter, and abilities.This comes at a cost of it being a challenge to learn, and you may not enjoy it without a significant invesment of time playing vs other human players to get to that standard.TL:DR: Very very different from DoW1 (and if you were hugely into that, and ar elooking for DoW1v2, this is not it). However if you want something a bit different a lot of stuff out there with various different modes, and don't mind putting in a bit of time to be able to appreciate it, you will enjoy this.			"

												Warhammer is the kind of game that you see the name and you instanly judge it. But I must say its nothing like i originally expected, infact it very much surprised me, its not very often you get an original Strategy game anymore as the genre is just of sequel's of this game or that game but not Warhammer, it makes you actually think about strategy instead of just using brute force. Also worth noting is the Co-op arena mode, forcing you to work together with you teamates to defeat wave of enemy after wave of enemy.I Recommend Warhammer if you like game like:Company of Heroes			"

												With every release of another Dawn of War the game turns more and more so into an RPG and less of a RTS. Personally I preferred the old engine, where the faction was the focus rather than the hero character which doesn't seem to provide any significant benefits that a basic squad or two of infantry couldn't make up for.The campaign is decent, though the same maps and scenarios are used for every faction as far as I can tell from playing a few Chaos and Imperial Guard missions.And of course there are a bunch of new characters for last stand which ends up taking up the majority of the time I spend in the game.All in all, a decent game worth the $7 I paid for it and the few cents spent on a couple of DLCs.

												This expansion acted as a springboard for THQ to try out Steamworks games, and as such, couldn't be set up to continue using the GFWL saves from the previous campaigns. With that in mind, the campaign here sees a lot of changes, mostly taking the gameplay backwards in design to the first DoW games where blobs of units were king. Though you can play as any race in the campaign, it's clear that a lack of focus on one race makes the game feel as if it's trying to be too many things to too many people.The multiplayer sees a few changes, mostly for the better, but the real star of the game remains the Last Stand mode, where character building stays intriguing thanks to 2 new heroes and achievement equipment that can be unlocked. It's essentially the perfect survival mode for people who like to tweak skills and see what the outcome is.			"

												Retribution is both a good and bad addition to the Dawn of War series.  The campaign is playable as muiltiple races, however it is identical missions for all of them and in order to facilitate the multiple races, some story depth was lost.  It was a lot of fun to play however, and should remain fun for a couple playthroughs with different races.  The addition of generic units again was also a nice feature!			"

												One great stand alone expansion to a great game series. That being said the MP is the same (still as good as ever and now uses steamworks though it can still be slow to find a match) the SP(/coop) however feels quite watered down from the previous games. The SP(/coop) story is the exact same for all factions apart form different scripts for the characters to speak and I feel this takes away from the players experience. I would rather have a great Campaign as one faction instead of a mediocre campaign for loads of factions.			"

												Dawn of War II changes almost in every aspect to the first release of the franchise. While many people have been dissapointed by the course that Relic has taken for this title, I myself am delighted by the changes they applied in here:+ The gameplay changed brutally, giving DoW II much faster pace than in first game,+ We have 3 heroes at disposal for each side of the conflict; we choose our commander in accordance to our play style,+ Our commanders, as well as units, gain XP during encounters, which brings the sense of progress during every skirmish,+/- The engagement during fights is more or less counter-to-counter, meaning that each unit has strong and weak points; of course you can spam one unit and hope for adversary's lack of wit,+ Nice set of global skills for each race, charged while fighting,- The biggest struggle of this game is weak balance. If you play for some time you'll notice that in some situations you just cannot prevail, no matter how good of a player you are.I recommend this game if you like fast paced, slightly tactical and bloody RTS experience. It's totally different from Dawn of War, but it shines in it's own aspects.			"

												In the name of the Emperor if you are a fan of Warhammer 40k you must try this series. Retribution was sadly the last Dawn of War game before THQ died off but that does not mean the game is bad. In fact the game is one of the better ones in the series, the multiplayer is by far the best out of all the DoW2. Sadly the single player is not as good as Chaos Rising or the base DoW but it does try to change things up by allowing all the races to be played in the campaign with their own ending shown, but this does not change there isn't really much replay-ability unless you want to coop with a friend. The multiplayer mode with last stand though picks up the slack of the single player though even if you only play with computers. Since the game has been out for a while though the community is still there and active, it is not as numerous as it once was, so I recommend picking up this game when it goes on sale at some point if you want to enjoy controling squads in an RTS fashion.

												the game itself has little to offer fans of the dawn of war series except bad story lines repetitve game play and a lack of proper planing all in all the game is a 4/10 for anyone who enjoyed soulstorm ordark crusade this is similar but lacks even the ability to off a different gameplay experience with each race			"

												Enjoyed playing the different races, it's system is slightly different to the other DoW2 games by which you don't just use heroes but add squads to make a bigger kill team. preferred the other way. Last Stand is great apart from having to grind your way through the first 10 or so levels of your Hero until you have decent wargear, it's quite hard to get past waves 8-10 unless you have a great levelled team.

												Dawn of war II: Retribution is the final RTS in the dawn of war series at the time of writing. Although the gameplay of the Dawn of War II games is vastly different from the original series it still has the same bloodied combat that made the first series a major success. The game centres around three resources; Population, Power and Requsition which all combined together provide access to new units and upgrades for current units.One of the major differences is the base building aspect is gone, although you can still build turrets etc. This means most of the tactics revolve around the new cover system which allows alot more strategic maneuvers than the previous games. Also the game punishes troop death, unlike the previous games keeping your troops alive longer and killing troops provides combat advantages aswell as bonuses to health etc.Commander units and vehicles are much more restriced in this version of the game. One commander per player from a choice of three per race which equal to Offensive, Support and Defensive to suit your tactics. The vehicles use up alot of rescources and population and are not seen in great numbers as they would in the previous Dawn of War games.However bearing in mind the changes to the Dawn of War series in the form of the II series, many veterans of the originals may not be as attracted to the game. However if you still want the blood thristy combat which the originals brought about, then this game which is the last add on for the Dawn of war II series, more than delivers.			"

												For a warhammer 40k fan (like me) this game is a great rts game. The main problem i have with this game is that (compared to games from the total war franchise) the units are very small. When i train a unit of ork boys, i expect 20 or 30 boys but in this game a unit is more like 6 or 8 orks. It wouldn't be a big deal if the game had no unit cap (but it does). I still like this game and i do recommend it. I'm just saying it could have been better.			"

												One of my favorite Dawn of War titles. The tactics based combat is an interesting change from base building combat even now. Multiplayer is best done with the Elite mod. Otherwise you may feel some faction imbalance and the like. Though, I'm not particularly good at the game. So, don't take my word for it. On a side note - there is a small community here. Last stand mode is far more active than the ranked multiplayer, but you will find people playing occasionally. Recommended hesistantly. Oh, and the story is good. Standard old Relic fare, what did you expect? You can play as all the races this time.			"

												Best graphics yet out of all the games in this series. The cap is a bit to restrictive, making it so you will not be able to get even one of each unit type during each map. It also counts turrets and other deployables making them more or less useless if you want to get to use the top tier units. The most annoying part of the game is the ability to ""fall back"" which makes the unit super resistant to range fire as it falls back to home base at a speed you cant match even with fleet of foot. The computer uses it so well you will often find at the end of the map you only killed 50 units. Another annoying aspect is the A.I cheats in all the little ways. It knows exactly where your suppression unit sets up and just quits going there, it knows you are throwing a grenade and will vacate area unless capping before the nade leaves your hand, knows where your fow vision line is and skirts around it. Can use these things to your advantage but is still a bit annoying to watch units constantly hit fall back the second you throw a grenade or launch your grenade launchers before the nade visual leaves your charecter. Was a great game and i recommend it, but fall back was too much and the restrictive caps didnt allow enough. You will also really miss building stuff as this just comes with one base that is prebuilt, no other buildings or construction whatsoever.			"

												There simply is no better or more varied RTS to be had, and it kills me that the game isn't available for OS X. Retribution, for me, is the epitome of the RTS genre: it's fast, it's hard, and it's incredibly tactical. Positioning and proper use of your skills is essential, but the reintroduction of larger squads and more macro-level gameplay really makes Retribution shine as the perfect balance between micro, macro, and hero-based play. I'd pay hundreds for a Mac port without blinking twice.			"

Retribution addresses the concerns players had about the transition from DoW and DoW2 in that it allows you to play the game with a large variable force, or with a small force of portent heros.  This flexibility as well as a few mechanical additions make this one of the best RTS/RPG combo games out there.  Well worth a look if you are interested in the Warhammer genre or RTS games in general.			"

												The first Dawn of War was amazing and so is this one.It has a completely different playstyle compared to DoW 1 - I like that.It's not a rehash of the old Game and keeps things fresh and interesting.The campaign is really fun to play. Including optional missions and the ability to level up and customize your team.The multiplayer is very fun especially on 3 vs 3 matches as you have to work together to conquer your enemy or capture the flag points.If you expected more Dawn of War 1 you might be a little dissapointedbut if you are fine with the new gameplay style then you will love it!also try The Last Stand(alone) it is basically an arena mode where you and two other players fight for the highest score against endless waves of enemiesI rate 8.5/10			"

												Ok first off this game is not perfect, there are balance issues and the fact you can't play as many races as DOW 1 with the necrons, TAU and dark eldar not showing up to the party. However gameplay wise it is steamlines with less micro than DOW 1 (Up to you if you perfer that) But don't expect to build bases. Also smaller maps and armies do hurt a bit. However its gameplay is good the units feel authentic with enough of a difference between armies.			"

												Very good ""RTS"" game. As all, DOW 40k - series.Pros:1. Very nice story mode, you can choose between 6 different fractions, and play with theyr own different stories. 2. Have, nice coop mode, in ""story mode"" and in ""last stand"" mode.3. Have, beautiful graphics, soundtracks, sound quality, nice voice acting, nice game physx's...4. Have, smooth multiplayer mode: ranked matches, custom matches, lan matches etc...5. Game very well optimized in performance question.Cons:1. Developers, could add all remaining races like: Tau race, Necron race, sisters of battle, Dark eldar. Like they did, in soulstorm game...2. Too much, micro ""DLC"" like: skins dlcs, for all the fractions. They should focus, on more useful stuff like: additional weapons, mp maps, or new units.3. In last stand mode, way too lack of maps variety, really? two maps only...My verdict - 8/10			"

												Sehr geehrte fans und evtl. Neulinge der Wh40k-Spielereihe Dawn of War - dieses Review bezieht sich ausschließlich auf den Einzelspieler-Modus in englischer Sprachausgabe und Erfahrungen, gesammelt wärend eines kurzen Ausflugs in den Modus ""letztes Gefecht"" (evtl. Spoiler enthalten!) Wer sich vor längeren Texten fürchtet oder Probleme mit der Konzentration hat, der kann sofort zum Ende und ans Fazit scrollen.Das Intro - kurz aber dennoch in gewohnter DoW Qualität, hat es mich direkt gefesselt und hungrig gemacht, einmal mehr als Truppführer für die Blood Ravens in das Gefecht zu ziehen.Das Hauptmenü - für einen Moment dachte ich, die anti-aliasing und Texturfiltereinstellungen sind aus. Grob-pixlig und hässlich, auch auf höchtmöglichen EInstellungen (Das Spiel wird unter Nvidia-Experience nicht erkannt, was die Option die Auflösung künstlich auf 1080p+ zu setzen zumindest über diesen Weg unmöglich macht).Immerhin wird mir ein bis dato unbekanntes Charaktermodell vorgesetzt, ein Mitglied der Inquisition - Adrastia.Kampagne-Modus Auswahl - Wow, sechs Fraktionen zur Auswahl? Genial! - Als Spieler der DoW-Serie seit 2004 allerdings, werde ich dabei aber auch direkt an DoW - Dark Crusade (2006) erinnert.Dort wurde wie ich finde, bereits sehr viel ""Seele"", also eine stimmige und packende Geschichte nebst Charakterentwicklung für mehr spielbare Völker geopfert. Die immer gleichen Kronus-Karten mit allen verfügbaren Fraktionen zu grinden, war mir damals bereits zu blöd. Sollte ich nun, fast 10 Jahre später eine änliche Erfahrung machen?Kampagne - Der Prolog klärt den Spieler über die Erfolge und Erlebnisse der Bloodravens innerhalb des Aurelia-Sektors auf - Ich schreibe Blood Raven, weil es unabhängig von Fraktionsauswahl immer der selbe Prolog ist, was mich etwas verwirrt. Immerhin, die ersten Minuten im Spiel lassen das Gefühl aufkommen, trotz der selben Karte doch etwas neues zu erleben.Kampagne - Hauptspiel (Als Eliphas, ehemaliger Champion der Word Bearers (Kronuskampagne), in DoW2 als Gefolgsmann der Black Legion, und nun als Sklave von Abaddon dem Plünderer anzutreffen. Was ein ""Aufstieg"")Tiefgreifende Dialoge und Charakterentwicklungen sind nicht zu erwarten, aber deshalb habe ich DoW auch nie gekauft - die Momente allerdings, in denen Eliphas von Abaddon kontaktiert wird, und einige Szenen mit seinem, ihm ""dienenden"" Chaoshexer Neroth sind äußerst amüsant! An ""chuckle""-Momente aus DoW1-Winter Assault oder Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Tarkus und Avitus aus Dow2 und dem Addon ""Chaos-Rising"" allerdings vermag nichts aus ""Retribution"" anzuknüpfen.Spielgefühl - Während Deckung, die Auswahl der richtigen Fertigkeiten zur richtigen Zeit mit dem richtigen Helden (ein Wechsel zu einem nicht all-in Helden Setup war zu keiner Zeit im Spiel nötig) noch wichtig ist, so verwandelt sich das Vorgehen schon sehr bald in ein no-brainer Szenario.""Alles auswählen"" und Angriffsbewegung in Richtung X, dabei immer fleißig mit dem Kopf über die Tastatur rollen, um die Fertigkeiten auf cooldown zu halten. Die Option ""Grid hotkeys - ON"" bei der alles im WASD-Sektor abgelegt wird, macht die Sache fast schon zur einhändig gespielten farce.Ernsthaft, die größte Herausforderung als Vertreter der Chaosfraktion liegt in der Befehlsvergabe, um Kisten nach Ressourcen zu plündern. Diese Ressourcen werden natürlich in noch mehr Schaden und evtl. Energie für den von Level 1 bis 10 mit Lascannon ausgestatteten Kain investiert - mal von den zwei Missionen abgesehen, wo ich sie in jeweils einen Trupp Ketzer gesteckt habe, damit sie mir um einen Schrein von Khorne tanzen.Die Missionsauswahl wurde grafisch im Vergleich zu Dow2 - Chaos Rising wenig ansprechend gestaltet.Eine Sektorkarte mit kleinen Icons, kein toller Hintergrund - wie Beispielsweise ein von einem Asteroidengürtel umkreister Planet Typhon. Immerhin, klicke ich einen dieser winzigen Punkte an, so offenbart sich mir doch tatsächlich ein recht detailiertes Infokärtchen zum Objekt - Bevölkerungsdichte und Hintergrundinformationen, wie zum Beispiel Entwicklungen seit der Tyranideninvasion vor 10 Jahren etc. Durch dieses quasi verstecken wurde wie ich finde, eine Option für packende Inszenierung vergeudet. Nun walze ich also mit meinen seelenlosen Heretikern von einer Mission zur nächsten, und alles woran ich denken kann ist: Wann genau geht es endlich los, wo bleibt der Augenblick, an dem mich die Gänsehaut packt - wie damals, als ich von Isador Akios's Verrat überrascht wurde, oder als selbst Tarkus - mein treuer Space Marine, in der ""Judgement of Carrion"" von den Schrecken des Warp beinahe korrumpiert wurde.. Ich warte.Die drei zur Verfügung gestellten Skilltrees für meine Helden, und wenn nicht eingesetzt, für die sie ersetzende ""Ehrenwache"": Stamina ""Tank"" / Stärke ""Angriff"" / Wille ""Energie u. Regeneration""Hier habe ich nach Level 3 (von 10) aufgehört zu lesen und nur noch die nächste Option gedrückt. Das einzig wichtige war, dass Eliphas's Attacken den Gegner spotten und noch mehr Energie (Energie = mehr Angriffsgeschwindigkeit/RoF) für Kain. Dieser Bursche nämlich zerlegte mir gepanzerte Einheiten noch bevor ich den Cursor über das entsprechende Ziel ziehen konnte, und das im vorletzten Schwierigkeitsgrad. Einzige Ausnahme war der mit gefühlten 10 Millionen Lebenspunkten ausgestattete Ork-Panzer in Mission X/Y.Das ich mich weder an die Mission, den Planeten/Szenario oder gar den Namen meines Widersachers erinnern kann verdeutlicht die Bedeutungslosigkeit von sich mir entgegenstellenden Feinden. Equipment - So öde und leer wie eine Welt nach dem Exterminatus, so gestaltet sich auch meine Waffenkammer.Vor meinen Augen offenbart sich die Warnung: ""Dies ist die letzte Mission, es gibt kein Zurück"" - und alles woran ich denken kann ist, Wow! das nenne ich mal Auswahlmöglichkeiten.. (nicht!) Zum Glück habe ich mich im Verlauf der Missionen stets für Gegenstände als Belohnung entschieden, und nicht für Truppentypen bzw. entsprechende upgrades.Kampagne - die letzte Herausforderung/Epilog. Da rennt nun also Gabriel Angelos, zuerst gefeierter und dann im Verlauf von Chaos Rising als abtrünnig erklärter und verbannter ""Held"" mit seinem Anti-Dämonenhammer auf den sich in einen Chaosprinzen verwandelnden Ordensmeister der Blood Ravens zu - Azariah Kyras. Und stirbt. unspektakulär. Dass daneben Jonah Orion, letzter Überlebender Psioniker des von Capt. Angelos kommandierten Schlachtkreuzers ebenfalls das zeitliche segnet, wird ebenso lieblos inszeniert. Ich habe dein Eindruck, die Entwickler wollen es an dieser Stelle einfach nur noch zu Ende bringen.. ich übrigens auch. Die an dieser Stelle nicht mehr zu leugnende Frustration meinerseits wird von dem nun folgenden ""Endkampf"" leider noch einmal angehoben. Das schwach entwickelte Schadensmodell für den Chaosprinzen Azariah Kyras erlaubt es nur einem Nahkämpfer wirklich effektiv an ihm zu stehen. Mein vor Seuchen und Krankheiten strotzdender Seuchenmarine ""Varius"" steht leider nur dümmlich in der Gegend herum und belegt Kyras von Zeit zu Zeit mit etwas Bolterfeuer - ebenso mein Chaoshexer.. Immerhin, nachdem ich die beiden in die Zweite Reihe gestellt habe, legen diese die spawnenden Chaos-Schreine und Dämonen um. Zeit für mich, einen frischen Kaffee aufzusetzen - 5 Minuten später ist es vorbei.Fazit:Mein Ziel, eine möglichst objektive und auch stärkenorientierte Wertung für DoW2-Retribution abzulegen habe ich leider nicht erreicht. Zu groß waren dafür die Unterschiede in Sachen Qualität der Vorgänger DoW1+WinterAssault und DoW2+Chaos Rising. Wer nach gut inszenierter Einzelspielerkampagne und einigermaßen anspruchsvollen Kämpfen sucht, der lässt die Finger hiervon - oder wechselt direkt in den Mehrspieler-Modus.D-fens out "

												The core gameplay remains the same, but the switch from a Baldur's Gate style single player to a more traditional RTS ironically makes it feel weaker. The fact that the single player campaign remains exactly the same but is merely reskinned for the different races does not help either. Still, worth playing if you're a big fan of the series.			"

												A brilliant game, but is slowly dying and quite unbalanced. However if you do buy this game, I recommend downling the ""Caeltos Elite Mod"" which is an active mod, with active players and it balances most things that Relic failed to do. The mod adds new units to each race, major tweaks to each race, extra additions and also adds a new faction: The Grey Knights.The game is a worthwhile buy, plenty of hours can be put into the game if you stick to the Multiplayer, but shamefully its just not as good as it used to be.

												So dawn of war II retribution or any other dawn of war II series.This game isn't your default startegy game.We all know stuff like basebuilding,collecting resources,getting a huge army and then crush your enemies.But dawn of war II is different.Many ppl say this game isn't the game dawn of war series was looking to get.But actually this game is fun,a lot of fun.There is no basebuilding which is a bit sad but details of units like unit upgrading and veichle upgrading is excellent.Fighting over a 1 victory point was never fun as in dawn of war II and don't forget there's a cool mod ""The last stand"" which is just a lot of fun.So after some stuff i said about the game you're probably here about a 1 opinion and that is ""is it any good,should i buy it?""I say yes,if you're looking for a fast paced strategy game with a good upgrading system and well overall fun game i think this game is a must have :)			"

												A nice variation on DOW2 and fun in it's own way I just can't help feeling that it's trying to push DOW2 into the mold of DOW1 when the whole point of the game was to break out.A fun expansion of DOW2 but nothing too special. I'd recommend it as an expansion for anyone who has run out of things to do in DOW2 but not a great stannd-alone. Personally I'll just load up DOW Dark Crusade or Soulstorm next time I'm in the mood for a 40k RTS.			"

												I love Warhammer 40,000. I love strategy games. Therefore, It was a no brainer that I'd love Dawn of War II and it's associated expansions, and Retribution might be my favorite, as it allows you to play the eternal underdogs of the Imperium, the Imperial Guard, in the campaign- absent since Soulstorm as a playable faction. You can play any of the included factions besides, given the game's choice of a modular campaign system a la Dark Crusade. It features many nods to earlier installments and returning characters therof, as well as some good new ones like Inquisitor Adrastia. I cannot speak for the competitive multiplayer, as such in strategy games has never been my forte. But the campaign alone is worth the price, even without the entertaining Last Stand (Which is availiable alone as a seperate purchase) gametype, which puts you and two others in control of various hero characters against waves of swarming foes. Did I mention the campaign can have 2 player co-op?			"

												A worthy addition to the Dawn of War franchise. It finally boots the annoying Windows Live account requirement and just uses Steam. Really I don't know why that wasn't an idea first. Retribution also adds the Imperial Guard, enabling you to summarily execute to your heart's content. New campaigns, new units, blah blah blah, oh, and tons of BAAAAANEBLAAAADS!!! Let's not forget BRUVVA I AM HIT, BRUVVA I AM PINNED HERE. I CAN WITHSTAND THIS. I AM ON THE MOVE. I WILL LEAVE IN A RUIN. IT WILL BE THE EMPEROR'S SOON.

												Honestly.. 85-90/100  ..and i guess 50+ hours gameplay with all the races^^I didn´t like Warhammer Games very much till now, BUT this is GREAT!this games offers a lot for the money:-good Grafics (also on older Hardware)-nice Setting-fitting Units-Combat is FUN - teaming up different units is key.. same for positioning (eg: flanking^^)-Lvl-Upgrades for your Commanders (Heroes) or Units - whatever style you prefer - since you get EXP-Heroes can be leveled in different directions - depending if you prefer a Fighter, Tank or Supporter-those Upgrades can be used in the missions - but some Hero Skills have an initial cost (for the whole mission)-Some Badass Hero-Weaponry can be randomly found as gift for missions-Unit-Upgrades (Sniper Rifles..etc) build up a Units strenght and make your Unit more efficient (longer Range, more dmg, ..)-Different Factions/Races - each playing different with their own unique units and skills-There is a straight way.. but many additional extra-missions if you like (very good rewards)-You can use Buildings.. or destroy them-Just one of the best Real-Time Strategy Games atm. Reminded me of Warcraft 3 (strong heroes, nice quests, good story) and Spellforce.. just no real basebuilding.. just conquer buildings.. summon units.. but spend resources wisely ;)			"

												Instead of working off of a time limit on missions like the other DoW2 games you have to pick and choose rewards to build your army plus whatever dropped during said mission.When you level you just pick traits for your heroes.I dont know if its a good or a bad thing for you but it kind of ruined the experience for me.  This game would be my least favorite of all of the Warhammer games because of how they tried to simplify the game and took out some of the RPG elements.Its still a good enough game to play but id recommend any of the other Warhammers before this one....go get Soulstorm if you want a REAL Warhammer experience.

												Retribution is a funny one: The campaign is a lazy ring-in, where each and every faction is playable (excitement!) through exactly the same series of maps and via a very similar story each time (disappointment). It's still more DoW II, but nowhere near the same quality as Chaos Rising or even the original. A new arena and a few new characters are also thrown in for Last Stand (the most compelling reason for purchase in my opinion), but all in all it's a bit of a let-down. Still, if you can swing it for $10 during a sale and you enjoyed any prior entries in the series, do it and you might not regret it.			"

The multiplayer includes fun challenges and options, including coop in an RTS campaign and a 3-player gauntlet of ever-increasing threats, along with more classic vs modes. The tactical options and variety offered by Retribution's multiple races take it a step beyond the Space Marine campaigns of the previous games.			"

												(Iv'e actually played a few more hours in the local cybercafe)As of Late 2014 , apparently the game can't be played at all. for some reason, I can't seem to connect to the ""steam servers"". I have checked my firewall and internet connection. Everything should be working yet it doesn't. That's not the worst of it. Now I can't even play the offline campaign and the ""connection lost"" message keeps appearing, which prevents me from playing the offline campaign.The game itself is rather fun. Nothing wrong with it when it actually works, as far as I can tell, Gameplay wise. Not a Dawn of War game. Dawn of War, DoW Winter Assault, DoW (kronus one), DoW Soulstorm, are Dawn of WAR games. Considering the lack of base building, and large scale battle of the prior games, makes this game feel more like Dawn of Skirmish. Also, Imperial tanks got NERFED! :( (compared to DoW 1)Going back to Cyber tomorrow to get the crack version of it so I can revisit the Campaign.(It's not piracy if I already did the right thing by buying it. On sale.)(On a side note, I believe Piracy of games and movies should be made legal by governments in certain cases as protests against unfair developer/publisher practices like bad DRM, glitchy unfinished games, or games that don't work at all.)Funnily enough, as I wrote this earlier, a Sale on games by ""games workshop"" came up. Including the DoW franchise.			"

The multiplayer matches are running much smoothier and they can release patches and balancing changes much faster than for DoW2 or Chaos Rising. There is a new hero and a new map for the Last Stand mode and there are six campaigns which can be played alone or in two player coop mode. In addition Relic promised further DLCs for free (e.g. for Last Stand Mode).			"

												Warhammer is the kind of game that you see the name and you instanly judge it. But I must say its nothing like i originally expected, infact it very much surprised me, its not very often you get an original Strategy game anymore as the genre is just of sequel's of this game or that game but not Warhammer, it makes you actually think about strategy instead of just using brute force. Also worth noting is the Co-op arena mode, forcing you to work together with you teamates to defeat wave of enemy after wave of enemy.I Recommend Warhammer if you like game like:Company of Heroes			"

												Less Grand Strategy and more squad-level than the 1st Dawn of War, for better and worse. No base building this time. On the other hand, there are 3 games in this package: Classic Multiplayer/Skirmish squads battles. Campaign, with less units but with a RPG flavor. And the Last Stand, the true gem that keeps this game away from dying.			"

												40K is a fascinating universe. I started out just wanting to learn about Space Marines and what was so special about them. I've read several 40K anthologies now, and enjoy the literature and history. I started playing the first Dawn Of War series and love moving my little Marines about on the map. They die a lot. I mean a LOT. Mostly because I send them without thinking into a horrible death. DOW II is fun in a different way, as you don't build structures, you take them to get the resources needed to upgrade and build your army. It's more of a squad-based focus, rather than masses of troops like the first game. Graphics are excellent, and with 6 sides to choose from, you will find at least one race to enjoy. I am a rotten multiplayer, but The Last Stand is a fun way to group with friends or matching with 2 other players to defend against ever-increasing waves of enemies. As you gain experience in TLS, you unlock better gear for your hero to increase the damage and mayhem with.  "

												Yep, this is one of Relic Entertaiment's most cherished RTS games to be appeared on the market, even though the old base constuction is removed, the tactical movements, covers from COmpany of Heroes and Badass Heroes units make this game very close to the tabletop, though in a smaller but no less intense scale, battles are quick and decisive, melee battles between Chaos Dreadnaught and Force Commander, suppression from Davastator or Havoc squad is sheer joy to be played. This game is an exceptional quality of its own.The graphic is well optimized, though the requirment is decent, the presentation is very well done, brightly color tyranid invested jungle, the gloomy snow tundra wasteland, all with the units blend in without any degrade in performance. Excellent work done on the game presentation.Even though I personally dislike Company fo Heroes 2, the Dawn of War series, along with the fist Company of Heroes are Relic Entertiament Crowning jewel of exceptional RTS game design. Well done Relic Entertaiment. You did us proud.			"

												The 2nd expansion to Dawn of War II, the squad-based Warhammer 40,000 RTS. This brings factions to six and adds super units (Land Raider etc.) to existing factions. A fun low-APM game with great visuals and setting. The focus is on fighting and controlling individual units with precision than managing your economy or base. This expansion has all the multiplayer content so you can skip the previous titles.			"

At the time of writing I've just finished the campaign (Eldar: Very Hard) so this isn't a review of the multiplayer. Retribution is my entry point in to Dawn of War (DOW) 2 and though I'm not a fan of a lot of the changes they made to the DOW1 formula I still think this is  a great game. The amount of content provided through expansions to the original meant that it was inevitable they would have to change things up in the sequel and that's resulted in two games that stand well alongside each other. Play DOW2 for smaller skirmishes with lots of special abilities and units that gain experience. Play DOW1 for large scale warfare.A few campaign Pros and Cons that deserve mentioningCons:- Frequent bugs: They're not game breaking but you'll regularly find your heroes unable to revive each other until they walk away and come back for another try, and occasionally I had a hero fall through the ground when he died. - Balance issues: The campaign is incredibly easy even on the hardest difficulty thanks to a pretty huge design flaw. For the most part enemies don't respawn but when your units die you get a full resource refund, which means you basically have infinite units.- The directional cover system: I hate to criticise this because it's a great idea and opens lots of strategic possibilities, but the reality just doesn't work. This game mostly dispenses with the areas of cover that appeared in the previous game in favour actual pieces of terrain that units can take cover behind (or destroy). Unfortunately getting your units to do this isn't as easy as you might hope and requires an impractical amount of micromanagement.Pros- Interactive environments: Aside from the directional cover this is pretty great. You can take shelter in literally any building (or bring it crashing down if you're so inclined), demolish walls to make new pathways or send a tank in to flatten your opponents cover. - Race specific stories: The overarching narrative is the same so obviously there is some overlap but they clearly put some effort in to developing individual narratives withing that framework. The result isn't particularly memorable and the Eldar Vs Eldar section seemed quite forced, but there are also some compelling moments and it definitely adds a lot of replayability.- Looks great: They've done a great job of recreating the 40k units and the environments are colourful, varied and interesting.- Leveling up heroes and gathering loot is addictive.Edit: Skirmish mode is really good. And there are still people who play it. :)			"

												I've beaten all 3 of the Dawn of War 2 games. They are some of the only RTS games I can enjoy, mostly due to the much lower number of units you are tasked to control. I can actually wrap my head around the tactics, whereas your StarCraft or any other just overwhelms me. The amazing graphics, audio, and dynamic combat with full destruction certainly help things. This stand alone entry added a neat hoard mode, but these days you may be hard pressed to find low ping people to play it with. Most people just stick with the regular skirmishes online, but those are too much for me.Edit: So I got back into this to complete the last 3 campaigns, and maybe beef up my Last Stand guys mode. If you're going to only buy one of the three Dawn of War 2 games, this would be the one. It definitely has the most content. It allows you to play the campaign via 6 of the races, all with some differences in plotline. It has the better version of the Last Stand hoarde mode than the other two games. The multiplayer I can't comment on as I am terrible at RTS online, but I'm sure it's the best edition as well. I wish I knew the lore better, as I have never been a tabletop RPG fan, but I love this series so much that I'm actually listening to Warhammer 40k audio dramas to supplement this. It's just so badass. Skulls for the skull throne, and all that jazz.			"
