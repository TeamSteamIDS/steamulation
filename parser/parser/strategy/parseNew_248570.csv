												Absolutely unique and still awesome through the years.Toribash is game where you control your character limb by limb, from feet or knees to the shoulders or neck. Most popular are 1 vs 1 fighting mods (named after martial arts: aikido, wushu, judo etc), where you win either by disqualifying your enemy (e.g. pushing him outside the mat) or earning more points (attacking enemy vitals, or head). But that's not all, possibilities never end, you can also play mods like parkour, climbing, football and cooperate with your friend! You can even create your own mod!The game has quite high learning curve but when you get the hang of it you want to master it and you cant stop! Toribash is one of the games I play for many years already and cant simply stop. Once uninstalled, comes back like boomerang. Try it out!			"

												First topic: When people say ""Its impossible to play"" or ""Controls are 2 confusing"" they probably havn't even done the tutorial which basicly tells you everything you need, plus theres hundreds of guides out there, give it a chance.Second topic: ""I can't play with my friends"" to create a private server you can set it to two players and then in the steam chat it will say '(username) is playing toribash' then you can click 'join'.Third topic: Most of these negative comments consist of ""GAYYYY"" or ""worst game ever doesn't teach u how 2 fite""they obviously haven't played it for more then 10 minutes, and the tutorial is 15 minutes worth of basic fightingThis is a great game but a hard topic to grasp. but once you got it, you got it! I reccomend getting this game ASAP for the fighting enthusiast. Remember, If at first you dont succeed try and try again! "

												First of all, this game isn't anything what I expected. I was under the impression this was like Fighter Maker or something, but no. far from it.rather than a button smasher, this makes a person actually THINK about every single movement plus the physics of the game. Very addictive just for the replays on some of the cool stuff you can do.Did I mention this game is free? sure, there's a bunch of shop crap... over...priced...shop...crap... BUT the important part of the game is free, so ♥♥♥♥ the hats. Free game, so far, over 3 hours of enjoyment on my end, even just watching the featured replays, or saving my own... cool game is cool. Very different. And it will make you think. SCIENCE!			"

												Do you want a fighting game where you can screw around with your drunk friends on the weekends laughing at how dumb you guys look trying to fight each other, a la Sumotori Dreams? Then download this game.Do you want a fighting simulator that you can get into immediately? Do you expect to look like the guys in that video up there right away? If you do, then don't download this game.You'll get discouraged VERY quickly.When they say you have total control, they mean it. You control every single muscle in your fighter's body. Are you expecting to know how to do a jump kick right away? Throw a punch? Expect to educate yourself on muscle movements instead, because trust me, you have no idea how complex even throwing a simple punch is. I'm not kidding about learning muscle movements. You basically have to take an anatomy and physiology course before you can make your fighter even look human.Go through the tutorial. It'll teach you some basics, but expect your fighter to look like a robot while fighting, and expect to get beat. A lot.Then, watch some more advanced tutorials on Youtube. There are a surprising number of these, but for a game as complex as this, I'm not really that shocked. Even after practicing and watching Youtube videos, you'll still get beat, but don't get discouraged. There is a very high learning curve, but this is part of what makes this game exciting! I've played this game on and off for 7 years, and I'm still nowhere near as good as the higher ranked guys.Playing this game takes commitment. It'll take a LONG time before your character will even make fluid movements. Don't expect to look like the guys in that video up there without years of practice. It'll take a long time, but is it worth it? You bet.P.S. If you want to get serious and actually make your fighter look cool, be willing to spend a fortune because the shop is stupidly overpriced.

												Fell on the ground, tried to crawl, but all I could do was raise my booty to the sky.  Opponent fell, I won.11/10.  Would flop againVery original yes? Now SeriouslyThis is a fantastic and very original gameToribash is not your average fighter, most certainly not.  You have to move yourself limb by limb over a series of turns to be able to execute the move you want to do.  It's very difficult to be able to do really cool moves, I'm not even close to that skill.  Don't let that turn you off though.  It's easy enough to get the hang of and by playing more and more you will learn of course.  Plus, there are belt (rank) restrictions on certain servers so you'll always be playing with people of similar skill no matter how well you do.  It's much easier to learn that way.  You could also create a server for just your friends and play around together!   There are what seems to be hundreds of mods so even if you do manage to get bored of something, just start up a server with a different mod on it and there you go!  I only started playing this when it came out on steam and don't have terribly many hours of game time at the moment, but I'm certain I'll be playing this a lot.  It really is a phenominal and unique game.  If you're looking for something to keep you occupied, something challenging, something rewarding, and most of all something insanely fun, PLAY THIS GAME.  There's not another one like it.			"

Brief ReviewToribash is a turn-based game 3D third-person tactical martial art using physics-based attacks. The game is played by relaxing, holding, extending, or contracting  the various joints on the player's character and hitting the spacebar to advance time by a user-specified amount. When properly manipulated, one ragdoll will strike the other, and if enough damage is inflicted with a single blow, a limb or body part may be dismembered, or fractured. Through careful manipulation of the ragdoll's joints, complex attacks can be performed.Pros and ConsProsSatisfying/Rewarding MomentsPretty Art StyleGood Amount Of Game ModesCustomizationMod SupportConsThe Highest Learning Curve Of Any GameAn EndingNot everyones cup of tea, but certainly if you have the time to work things out it can be an entertaining game			"

But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												This game may not seem like much; it's just 2 guys flailing around and hitting each other. However, this game is probably one of the hardest and most complex games I have ever played. You can start off executing simple maneuvers against your friends and having a bit of a laugh but, as you get better at the game, it becomes more interesting and unpredictable, leading to an amazingly personalised competetive experience.And if you don't like competetive stuff, there are plenty of crazy mods you can try out with your friends.

												Been playing this game for around 5 years now, joined late 09 and have played it ever since, with breaks of course. When it comes to gameplay it's amazing, not much to say about singleplayer, you're able to maul the ""antagonist"" in the game ""Uke"". He stands still of course, but it's fun nontheless, kick his balls, rip off a leg or his had, throw your own bodyparts at him etc.Multiplayer is the real deal, compete against other players from all over the planet and get higher ranking, duel, bet or just have fun with friends in a private room. This game is really fun, but quite advanced and difficult to learn at first! Give it a week of try&fail, you'll learn! I quit because I thought it sucked, but it totally doesn't if you learn the basics and from other players! Watch replays, improvise and have a great time.Pros:* The game is cool and original* There's a lot of players, never empty rooms* EXTREME customization options, all you need is Toricredits and you can have people make you textures or make your own. Recently added is the 3D accessories, hair-styles, shutter shades, football helmets etc.* Complete sandbox, do whatever the hell you want, dance, fight, slaughter, anything is possible!* A awesome forum full of tutorials and helpful members! (www.forum.toribash.com) Just take a look, introduce yourself in the beginners sanctuary and read the rules!* Adjustable graphic settings for low or high tier computers, ray-tracing, shadows, atmospheres, custom sounds, different BG's etc* Achievement systems, belts (white belt, yellow, orange, blue, brown, black etc.) decided by QI (Games played)Cons:* The controls are very complicated for starters, take your time and learn how each and single joint works! Don't quit.* Toricredits might be difficult to earn at first, prices seem SKYHIGH, but if you get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together and start marketing, texturing or get really good in-game for duels or betting it's quite easy-earned. DON'T BEG for toricreds, that's frowned upon.* Some scammers, un-fair players and ragequitters are always around, some use easy-win moves or run away, don't get mad, just ignore and get better! If you're scammed that can be reported at the forums!* Sounds, some of the sounds in the game like the music are quite dull and repetetive, that's why it's good to have your own music in the back or custom sound!* Some people suffer lag because of bad internet and can make your character freeze (For a while, until the other guy is logged out)* Sometimes servers ""ghost"" and disappear, Game master tourneys uses to suffer from this (Temporary problem, might already be fixed)* Items are activated via the torishop, not in-game inventories. (forum.toribash.com/tori.php)~Fenris, art moderator and graphic designer (hobby and soon2be trade), see you at the forums or in-game! Feel free to pm me if you have questions :D			"

												Good day there, chap! If you are reading this, you have clearly found yourself upon the interesting game called 'Toribash'. (Before I state any more, pardon my keyboard! My grammer is great, but I cannot say so about the keyboard!), I shall simply explain the pros and cons to it, and if what I beleive might sway your decision, I am satisfied ( :D )!    First we must put this game in retrospect and look at the optimistic view. I shall now list the pros.Pros; * Great graphics* Runs smoothly for laptops with RAM and extra disk space* Only 272 Megabits (Extremely miniscule amount!)* Physics compare to real life scenarious* Has multiple tutorials* Has Multiplayer* Runs with multiple languages* Computer bots* Custumizable Avatars* Mod content* Texture Packs*  Innovative designing* Creative Idea* Thousands of guides* Youtube videos (more guides!)* Simple design* FREE TO PLAY! (Got to love money XD )   There sure are alot of positive things! But, alas, there usually is some sort of demise to games. Now I shall list my personal cons.Cons;* (Alledgedly) Bugs* (Alledgedly) Lags out with crappy computers* (Alledgedly) Tutorial might be confusing and doesn't explain* (Alledgedly) A lack of background might confuse or bore some* (Alledgedly) Community can be very unfrienldy* (Alledgedly) Long wait times for servers* (Alledgedly) Tutorial doesn't explain* (Alledgedly) No content available* (Alledgedly) Overpriced customizables* (Alledgedly) Boring Graphics.(All of the cons were said by users, but I have had none of these issues or complaints correlating to the subject).   Honestly, I rate this game 9/10 because it still has to iron out alledged bugs, but it is extremely unique and has amazing graphics. It takes up little space, runs on modern computers and allows for mod content AND the creation of it. Multiple languages are provided, along with user customizable charecters, backgrounds, textures, sound files, etc. Thank you for sparing your time to consider this work of coding genius and it is all free!   Have anything you want to add? Comment below and I will be sure to contimplaint and decide to add this to my short and quaint review! Thank you!			"

ToribashMini-Review Thing7.5/10Developer: Nabi StudiosGenres: Turn-based, Fighting, MultiplayerYear: 2006Pros:+Free to play+Contains a shop with it's own currency (called Toricash), allowing you to customise your character+Has its own belt-ranking system+Ability to tear limbs off, break bones and do sick tricks m8+Good blood physics+Can make and play your own gamemodes (Called ""mods""?)Cons:-Lag destroys the game, what a suprise right?-Everything in the shop is REALLY FREAKIN' EXPENSIVE!!Summary:My friend ripped my head off and I survived, and then he tore his arm off and started hitting me with it.Another round I ripped my own head off, dropped it onto the ground and kicked it at my enemy and it hit him in the nuts.This game is for you if you like clubbing people with your own detached limbs.Or playing soccer with your own head.I recommend getting this game.

												As far as turn-based competitive physics games go, this is probably the best. It definitely takes a bit of practice to understand when to hold a joint and when to relax it, and how exactly to bring a leg up for a kick without falling on your butt, but that's why most of the servers are limited by your belt, which is a representation of how many games you've won. The biggest tip I can give is this: Experiment with how you start each game. Even when I've been matched up against my first fight of a new belt, meaning that I'm almost certainly less experienced, I've won many games by simply being unpredictable and making up moves as I went.I highly recommend playing this with or without friends. Sometimes you just want to be a ninja and rip someone's arms off, and this lets you do just that.			"

TLDR; At the bottom!Due to the fact that I've played this for 600+ hours without realizing it, I thought it was time to review this game.Toribash is a physics based fighting game. All the negative reviews you see are from people who don't have very long attention spans. This game has a high learning curve. By high I mean it's *very* hard to get good at it unless you spend a lot of time into this game.  You need to play at least 100 - 200~ hours to get a basic understanding of the joints and how they interact with each other to make moves. If you want to start doing the stuff that you saw in the video (they're called madmans, by the way) right away, let me tell you this.You can't.Yep. I've played this game for 600+ hours and I've only gotten 1 madman. And it's not even that good! But most players don't realize that there is a forum for this game. The forums is where the actual community lies. I've got many of my friends to download and play this game (I had to nag them so much) but they just didn't find it interesting.Most players only play it for the lols. And that's not a bad thing.The bad thing is that players expect this game to be easy. And when they are surprised by how hard it is to even make your character do a punch, they just quit.Now let me state the pros and cons of this game.Pros:A lot of replayability. Entertaining, funny at some moments.Has multiplayer, so, you can practically play it forever until the community or the game dies out.Doesn't require a high end PC to run itIt's free to play.A darn lot of gamemodes to choose from.Cons:High learning curve.The graphics are bad.Requires a lot of dedication and hard work to make a good replay.Frustrating.Neutral:Small, but tightly knit community.So that's my review for Waste your life and time with ragdolls simulator.TLDRDon't play if you have a short attention and are serious to get good at it.Play it if you are willing to play for fun.Play it if you are willing to dedicate your time to get good at it.All in all, 7.5/10 for this game.

Product received for free
												Let me get right to the point and say I love this game. When I first started out about a year ago I felt like a toddler learning to walk, and I admit, it was a bit frustrating. Then I turned to Youtube. I learned a few basic aikido and judo (two different mods/game modes in the game) opening moves and from there my results sky-rocketted. I was flooring noobs left and right until I got to the intermediate level where (most) every player had a rudimentary understanding of how to move in the game then it was fairly evenly matched and I quickly got over myself.Here's some things that are just excellent about the game:-- IT'S FREE. TRY IT.-- The graphics are so simplistic it could run on a computer from the 90's, but at the same time it doesn't look bad, and when you use shaders it looks quite nice. (My opinion, of course)-- The game is utterly unique, you'll never play anything like it.-- The game can be quite dramatic and/or comical when you watch people who actually know how to play do what they do. Think of it like the WWE, just not scripted.-- You have nearly complete conrol of your character, which could be a bit overwhelming, but once you understand the functions of the joints you will come to enjoy it as well.-- The community is very tightly-knit. You seldom come across a player you just can't get along with.-- Being good in this game is not matter of higher level, better quipment or any of that junk. Being good in this game comes down to one factor. Skill.-- There are tons of events to take part in.Now, to be fair, here are some things that kind of suck about the game.-- Store items are a bit expensive, and it's a bit difficult to earn money. That being said you don't have to pay real money for most of the store items, and they're really just accessories.-- The community is small compared to other games. This is the consequence of the tightly-knit community I mentioned earlier.-- I said earlier how skill is the deciding factor of this game, but it can also be considered a bad thing as you have to fumble around a bit to get the hang of the game, which can be frustrating if you're the impatient type like myself.-- Very little will change about this game, I expect. This can be a good thing, as some games change ""too much"" and become ruined, but I expect this game won't change enough, as it has been roughly the same for about 10 years.			"

												This is most likely the most unique fighting game you have ever played. Toribash has been out for quite a while but I never had played it untill it released on steam. Overall I think that the game is extremely simple, at least in theory. You will find yourself needing a lot of practice in the order and timing of the joints you want to manipulate, so in simple terms the game is easy to learn but hard to master. Toribash is free on (and off) steam so if you want to try it out ( your reading reviews so you at least have some passing interest in the game) I think that you should go for it, try it a while. In the end no one will hold it against you for deciding NOT to play. Not everyone will enjoy Toribash.			"

												I ripped a guy's head off,and smashed him to death with it.Rated 10/10As for the game,it is good.It's the type of game where you'll take time to master or even get used toSaying this game was a complete $H!T means you're basically dumb not to see how good it is,or just everybody's daily noob telling he doesn't want to control unrealistic people,WELL IT'S A GAME,GET A GRIP of your loser selves,just because you bought off some TC in the market and get full textures,doesn't mean you're also good,you're just a scrub with money.This is that kind of game that will take a year or two for you to understand how complex it is.

												Toribash is the kind of game that grows on you. When you first play it perhaps it will be confusing and you may quit because you think the game's bad before you put some hours in it. I've been playing Toribash since 2007 pre-Steam release and I still enjoy it.Toribash, while hard to pick up, can be very fun once you learn the basics and begin to get more experience.			"

												No game I'd recommend more than toribash, I've got literally thousands of hours in toribash outside of steam(On the standalone version available at the official website).This game is super worth the couple days it takes to learn it, if you just give toribash a chance for 2-5 days it will become super rewarding, just make sure you're playing against players of your skill level.I starting playing this game when I was 10, if a 10 year old has the time and patience to learn how to play this game you probably do too.I've never played a game this close to perfect, if you get involved with the community you can avoid getting burnt out too.9.5/10			"

												Great casual game. The learning curve is quite large given the fact that I have reached black belt and still feel that I have no idea what I'm doing but it is still very fun to play. There are tons of mods that you can explore when you get bored of the common game modes. This game isn't for everone though. You either love it or you hate it. The turn based playing makes it possible to play other games while you wait like Town of Salem or Besiege. 10/10 from me!			"

												Ever wanted to be your own Bruce Lee? Wanted to pin someone to the floor with nothing but brute force? Or did you ever want to gracefully pluck your opponents' head off their shoulders before splitting apart the rest of them with one kick? Ok maybe not the last one, but if this sounds interesting you're definitely gonna love this game. Now seriously I have never loved gore fighters. Wrestling was more of an afterthought than anything else. But there is a certain thrill you get when you're able to do a backflip and kick your opponent's arms off. This game combines the freedom of ragdoll stick figures and mortal combat in a really amazing turn-based but rapid action masterpiece.I first heard of this game about a year ago and I was interested then, but my machine at the time couldn't run it. But I got a new one and when it came out on Steam I quickly checked it out to see what would happen. The small download size was really great as I didn't want to wait long. My first experience in the tutorial made me feel almost helpless as my character seemed to have so many parts and possible actions I didn't know how I could remember all this. The fact that it was turn-based made it seem quite complex. Fast forward 1 day later and I was a Green Belt. After looking at a few moves online and trying them out, I found a couple easy to do, easy-to-remember moves which brought me success in my games. This game is really hilarious. I mean 'drop down dead laughing' hilarious. In low belt ranks, people who don't know how to control their characters leads to one hell of a ridiculous experience which has everyone wishing for more. The wait in large lobbies can be a little tiring but most of the time I'm enjoying watching others play and I can learn from them. The wait is also great for the moments when you wanna take a bathroom break or try to memorize a new technique online.What makes this game stand out to me are the mods that are currently avaliable for it. Right now I can't count the number of mods that are in the list and I've only tested about twenty now. From sword-fighting to pool diving to racing, this game has it all! I could not believe my eyes when I found myself in something like a drag racer that raced down the map into the oncoming wall. Needless to say I had a very good laugh.Already my review is really long, so I'll say this last. Download the game. Play it for even a day or two. You won't regret it. And it has a very good community, perfect for taking my mind off bad experiences in League of Legends.			"

												Toribash is a free to play pvp game with turn-based puppet combat.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.You program a puppet to move each joint per a turn and try to connect with enemy puppet.  Very strange game, and hard to get into, takes brains to get successfull at this.  I don't like this game, there are some people that do like this game.  Try it, you might like it.For more info:

												There are many gamemodes in Toribash but for most of them, there is one objective: kill the opponent with what you are given in any way possible. Toribash goes with an interesting art style but they make it work. I have never seen a single bug, glitch, or modder while playing and it's community is mature and stays clean almost always.When it comes to a fighting game like this though, there needs to be more guidance and tutorials, which I'm not seeing. This average fighting game becomes unique when it comes to being able to control your characters ligaments with extreme precision but with that must come practice. It's a hard game to master, especially with little guidance, which is why I stress again the need for it. I'd recommend Toribash to hand-to-hand combat lovers.			"

												A really fun physics/strategy game with a very steep learning curve.Trust me to play this you will need to put in a couple of hours learning the physics.The game's progression involves the upgrades in belts like you would in a real life martial art. This system allows you to pick multiplayer sessions to give a good idea of the skill level you will be presented with. That's if you dont get a secret pro who made a new account to get easy fights =,=Anyway, for beginners this game is gonna be very hard and you're gonna need to have determination to even think about being good. But yeah would I reccomend this game?Yes, if you like the whole human anatomy thing and want to put a few hours into something play toribash :)  And it's Free so you havent got anything to lose!hope this was of help ^_^			"

												I've been playing Toribash since 2010. I have non-Qi void relax, custom head texture, and some other neat things. I have 2 black-belt accounts and a crazy library of replays. This is one of the few games I feel like I have natural talent. Making it one of my favorites.However, I cannot recommend this game. These are the reasons why. (Underlined content has been edited April 10th, 2016)1.  Players are queued on a server. This means the more players join, the more you have to wait your turn. This negatively affects loser and rewards winners because they ""stay warm"" and can easily bash people who have been afk for 3-5 games while you've won each one. I would much prefer a lobby where all players play simultaneously and then when you win or lose you spectate the remaining players till everyone has played, then you rotate.  A commenter stated that a new ""matchmaking"" was implemented.  This is the same old matchmaking with a new (confusing) UI.  At my skill level, most people rage quit after the first game.2. Lag affects your ability to ""ready up"" and sometimes angrily hitting spacebar can ready your next turn too! Not only that, if you join in the middle of a game, it doesn't catch you up, it shows ragdolls flopping around in a half-initialized state. This gets annoying when you join and the room goes ""DID YOU SEE THAT!?"" and all you see are ragdolls flopping around.  Update: Ragdoll states are initialized after the first turn.  However, moves made before you join are still not synced, thus you get the flopping around.  For a text-based protocol on a turn-based game, there simply shouldn't be lag3. In multiple interactions I've had with the devs, concerning real money, their customer support was terrible.Server stability seems to be better since the old days and steam release. "

												Fighting games? Boring. This game sucks! NOT. This game is so original, and wow. It's hard. REALLY HARD. But once you get the hang of it, it's awesome. Oh,  you hate fighting games because you can't do whatever you want, only punch? Not Toribash. In Toribash, you make your moves. From scratch, and you don't click: use move. You literally make your character do the move, by telling the body parts what to do. PECS, CONTRACT. That way, you will pull your arm in front of you. If you master it, you can become a master of the air, and pull people's  heads off, do flipkicks, your choice!And oh my, so many mods. So easy to access! No need of workshop, just go into game, setup, mods! And the best part: It doesn't even need to download the mods. Well it does, but it takes like half a second even with a 100 kb/s speed. (Experience)Don't like how it looks? Enable shaders the same way with mods! Epic game, definitely reccomend. And it's not even that big! (File Size.)			"

												Free to play, Ragdoll based and online. The critical aspects that make a game work well. The comunity is good, the gameplay is good (provided you get the right begging move) and there is plenty of blood splatters. For every hour you play, you will find around 3 screenshots worth taking. 10/10 would laugh as I get ripped to pieces by an 8th Dan in Judo.			"

Of corse i had short and long breaks, ups and downs and i only made it to Brown belt's so far, but I still get back to it in the end, to bash some face or cut arms and legs to little peces then kick them intot the other guys face. Well as you can see this game is full of possibilities but it's quite hard to master the first few moves, also you need to understand the movment of the bodie in a way you can adapt in mid way trough battles.

												If you really do love fighting games, this one is for you. But mind you that this is not a fast paced game. Anyway, you control each joint on the character's body to make them punch, kick, grab, jump or flip. Total control and flexibility. It takes time to actually know how to do it, but once you know how to, it's worth the time spent. Oh, and the game's free!Now for the cons.What I really don't like are the players who spam the same bloody technique over and over and over and over again. Even after some other guy had bonked him and his 'fighting form'. It gets really annoying and the fight will starts to feel rather bland. The learning curve in this game is really high. It's easier to practice by getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked, and study your adversaries' moves. If it's too frustrating and you don't get any fun out of it, just uninstall the damn thing. lol			"

												Awesome game. I was playing this for a long time before it was even released on steam. Toribash is a free and unique turn based fighting game where you control your character by clicking on a different parts of your character body every turn. There are MANY game mods already installed in the game (judo, aikido, sword fights, etc.). If you like fighting and turn based games you probably will like Toribash. I didn't really found any CONS in this game except few ones... I like the games that are hard to master but this game is a little TOO HARD TO MASTER - as I said before I started to play this game long time ago before it came out on steam but I feel like I'm just a little above random average player. So in short:PROS:-awesome and brutal gameplay,-you can design your own moves,-you can upload your own face textures etc,-many mods,-not pay 2 win (you can't buy anything that will give you advantage ingame),-free to play (you can pay for colors etc but still you can have all the items for free if you will play enough or if somebody will gift you).CONS:-game is hard to play and very hard to master,-if you will join on public game room with like 10 people or above you will probably wait like over 20 minutes to play a round.Solid 8/10			"

If you join this game and aren't encouraged at all to learn, you will get frustrated, leave and never play it again. If you try your best learn the basics and reach the ""turning point"" where you understand everything you are doing with your character, that's when this becomes a great game. This game is basically dead, I had fun with it for a while and still retain my skill in the semi-complex gameplay, but I will never play this game for a long period of time ever again.			"

												Been playing this game for nearly two years solid (Before I was on Steam, so that explains my 0-gameplay time, I use the standalone) and I must of spent at least a total of 250 hours on it. It is super difficult to get into, but who's to say that's a bad thing? You have fun while you learn, you learn to laugh when you accidentally break off your limbs and you get the immediate satisfaction of doing something you've wanted, whether it is doing a certain grapple and turn in Aikido, or landing a corkscrew in tricking, or even finishing a three-hour spar, the possibilities are endless. Would definitely recommend this game, and best of all, it's free! No pay-to-win features, I haven't spent a single penny on this game yet, but you can support the dev team by buying items and stuff and getting some fancy forum features, to make yourself look the part. Overall, endless fun, endless possibilities and a whole lot of choice.I'm personally into tricking, parkour and sparring, I struggle too much with madmen and aikido. My IGN is RossBarker.			"

However, I've been recently been experiencing an issue, where I'm unable to start the game.The ""Preparing to launch..."" window pops up, but then it doesn't launch. This doesn't seem to happen to anyone else, so I think it's just something to do with my computer. So yes, play this game. Definitely.			"

												Like attempting new and fun ways to defeat a joint moved person? Well, you probally haven't tried that out... have you? If not, you should try Toribash. A way to kill your boredom and most definitely give you some bloody gore. You start out as a White belt. Eventually you will get to a Master. or maybe even a Custom rank! Custom meaning you name it! The color and the name. Awesome. Me, as some really foolish 7th grader, found this amazingly fun. I had no clue what ""Extending Glute"" meant, but trial and error told me the definition. So dont be surprised if this game gave you a bit of noggin knowledge. It did to me too. Anyways, to sum this all up, Toribash is a great game for anyone, if your bad at this kind of fighting classification. No worries, Toribash has its own new category (not really but go with it). The best of all, it's free! So go out there and get Toribash. Dont worry, you WON'T regret it.P.S. ik i sound like a salesman but its a good game trust me lol... why not trust me?? oh, prob cuz ur a normal person who doesnt trust cringey people lol			"

												When I used to be younger I used to put endless amounts of hours into this game before it was released on steam. It is still as great as I've always remembered it. I could easily put 1000 hours into this game if I am not careful. There is so much to do and so much to explore about this great game. I would suggest it for the following few reasons.1. This game is Free to Play and not pay to win, nothing you buy in gamr will ever make you stronger than anyone else, its is all appearance. If it is free and it is only a 200 mb download then why not get it when you can.2. Making an account is simple and there is no age limit on this game. This game is for and will always be for all ages, considering you don't even need an email unless you wish to recover your account is one of the amazing things about Toribash account making.3. This game has almost endless mods and addons to try. You will spend hours in single player browsing all the mods and seeing which each of them has to offer when you figure out, there is millions more on the website.4. This is one of the best games I've ever played for replayability. You could do the same thing endlessly in this game, and it could turn out differently each time.5. Online is greatly designed and greatly exicuted. You can join a server in a matter of seconds and almost never get kicked or other things from them. The online is a brand new game the first time you play it, it has many modes and offical and unoffical servers waiting for you. Also if you have limited internet, this game requires almost no memory to play online.6. The amazing online gamemodes. There are many great gamemodes on the offical servers online including, Judo, Aidiko, Wushu and other major ones to join and earn ToriCredits (Ingame Currency) and meets friends.7. The community. This game has a great sytem of meeting people online and maing friends and/or foes to fight in battle. There are no mics only the chatbar which is easy to access and unites everyone in the server. I haven't joined a server I haven't met someone cool or friendly in.8. Clans and groups. Ingame and on the website you can make clans and other groups. If you join one or make one, they have a lot to offer. First of all, you can chat and group with fellow clan members and your friends. But you can also have clan allyships and clan wars. Which can majorly change you gameplay style and social standing.9. Trading/Market. This game has a good market system activating open player trade and group sharing. They put a limited amount of an item on the market for people to buy then if you want it, you either have to hope it is in stock, or you may buy it from another player. There is no scamming with the safetrade system so no worries.10. Overall game graphics and game playability. The graphics in this game are very simple but very great at the same time. Almost any computer can handle this game that I know of. But I love how the game looks and it overall feel in the mechanics. The game is halfway simple to learn but extremly hard to master. Once you get the basics of the game down, you can destroy your foes that stand in your way.These, overall are 10 reasons why Toribash is and will always be one of the greatest ames availble for the PC. Considering it is free you should just get it to try it out anyways.   Feel free to point out any spelling mistakes or bring out another point of why this game is bad or not how I say it. "

												I remember playing this game when it was a standalone title I believe around 2006 or 2007 when it was new. Ah, the good memories of playing Toribash and other freeware titles I found when I was around 12. My account I made from newer versions of Toribash still works and I'll need to do more management of that so that I remember that I have an account here.The game's unique gameplay by moving each body part each turn is hard to grasp at first, and gets trickier when trying to perform certain moves. Even I who played this on and off have some issues doing good moves, although the basics deal with setting a body part in one of 4 states, or sometimes just 2 for certain parts of the body. The physics engine handles how your body moves and is the basis of this fighting game, which makes this a great physics based game (I found this game on some blog highlighting only physics based games back in 2006-2007! I thought physics games were the bomb.) Scoring is done with points based on how hard you hit your opponent (sometimes dismembering them), or you can win by disqualifying your opponent depending on the rules. The sound and graphics are simplistic, focusing more on the game action and fights. Multiplayer is present in this game both online and offline. You can fight other people online on a server using the same turn based and physics ruling gameplay, or locally by controling the two dummies on one computer.This game was originally freeware and has a little shop for cosmetics that you could spend money on. For a fairly minimal game where you just move parts of the body turn by turn with physics ruling over what happens, this is a different and good take on fighting games and makes excellent use of physics.

												Not recommended for people who are unpatient.However if you're willing to actually get into the game you won't regret there is pretty much and endless amount of content, but at the same time a small amount. You control your character by contracting, extending, holding, and relaxing limbs. There's a tutorial but it's not much to go off of, I recommend to find another way to learn, either be self-tought in the ways of bashing your enemy or find a player who CAN teach you. The community is alive, but not thriving. The only thing I'd say I wasn't too happy about was the customization while again endless amount yet a small amount applies here too, TC isn't the easiest to obtain. You'll get 10 TC per win in a duel type match (none in free play, obviously) The main way to obtain TC is through tournaments, which usually have some good players. There are belt specific lobbies however the obvious con to that is that there's a chance a bored player will make another account and essentially smurf in White Belt lobbies and what not. This is my first review, but I do hope it encourages you to get into Toribash!			"

												When I used to be younger I used to put endless amounts of hours into this game before it was released on steam. It is still as great as I've always remembered it. I could easily put 1000 hours into this game if I am not careful. There is so much to do and so much to explore about this great game. I would suggest it for the following few reasons.1. This game is Free to Play and not pay to win, nothing you buy in gamr will ever make you stronger than anyone else, its is all appearance. If it is free and it is only a 200 mb download then why not get it when you can.2. Making an account is simple and there is no age limit on this game. This game is for and will always be for all ages, considering you don't even need an email unless you wish to recover your account is one of the amazing things about Toribash account making.3. This game has almost endless mods and addons to try. You will spend hours in single player browsing all the mods and seeing which each of them has to offer when you figure out, there is millions more on the website.4. This is one of the best games I've ever played for replayability. You could do the same thing endlessly in this game, and it could turn out differently each time.5. Online is greatly designed and greatly exicuted. You can join a server in a matter of seconds and almost never get kicked or other things from them. The online is a brand new game the first time you play it, it has many modes and offical and unoffical servers waiting for you. Also if you have limited internet, this game requires almost no memory to play online.6. The amazing online gamemodes. There are many great gamemodes on the offical servers online including, Judo, Aidiko, Wushu and other major ones to join and earn ToriCredits (Ingame Currency) and meets friends.7. The community. This game has a great sytem of meeting people online and maing friends and/or foes to fight in battle. There are no mics only the chatbar which is easy to access and unites everyone in the server. I haven't joined a server I haven't met someone cool or friendly in.8. Clans and groups. Ingame and on the website you can make clans and other groups. If you join one or make one, they have a lot to offer. First of all, you can chat and group with fellow clan members and your friends. But you can also have clan allyships and clan wars. Which can majorly change you gameplay style and social standing.9. Trading/Market. This game has a good market system activating open player trade and group sharing. They put a limited amount of an item on the market for people to buy then if you want it, you either have to hope it is in stock, or you may buy it from another player. There is no scamming with the safetrade system so no worries.10. Overall game graphics and game playability. The graphics in this game are very simple but very great at the same time. Almost any computer can handle this game that I know of. But I love how the game looks and it overall feel in the mechanics. The game is halfway simple to learn but extremly hard to master. Once you get the basics of the game down, you can destroy your foes that stand in your way.These, overall are 10 reasons why Toribash is and will always be one of the greatest ames availble for the PC. Considering it is free you should just get it to try it out anyways.   Feel free to point out any spelling mistakes or bring out another point of why this game is bad or not how I say it. "

												I have been waiting for this game to come out on steam for at least 3 years. I am so happy it has finally. This game will be the best fighting simulator you could possibly ever play in your life. It is very detailed and takes alot of concentration. You have to use all of the muscles in your body to either pull off some amazing dance moves or you could take it to the arena and battle it out to the death with the best gore graphics. You can brake every bone in your opponent if you felt like it. The mods can go from a really intense game to becoming really funny. I have enjoyed playing this game for a very long time and you haven't downloaded it yet get it now.			"

												If you don't have a basic understanding of anatomy and it's relation to physics, it will take you a very long time to get good at this game.  If you've got some rudimentary understanding of both, this game will blow your mind!  This is a sandbox/ragdoll/fighting game based around the concept of manipulating your body to complete a goal, whether it be knocking your opponent to the ground or running through an obstacle course in an attempt to knab the best time.  It has a wide variety of settings to allow you to add variety to your matches.  You could change the mod and give one of the players a sword, while leaving the other barehanded.  You can edit the gravity settings to match the real world which is something I would recommend doing, as it allows you to relate your actions to those of the real world.It has a varied community, some are idiotic, but on the most part you'll come across experienced players who are willing to help people who have less experience with the game.  That is something that I really love about this game, it really encourages experienced players to help out the ones with less experience.  It's rewarding for both parties.  The new player learns, and the experienced player sets the new player on the road to being an opponent.  Very interesting.  Take a look if you're having doubts, it's free.  Find a player who knows what they're doing and have them teach you.			"

												Been playing this for a while now, I can safely say it's one of the best multiplayer competitive free to play games out there.Toribash's design philosophy is very simple and elegant. The game works by manipulating multiple joints on your character's body in order to execute movements under the timer of a turn. When done properly, the character's ragdoll (known in-game as a Tori) will be able to hit and/or grab an opponent. The player is awarded with points for sucessful hits on most of the many parts of an opponent's body. Usually, a game is won when an illegal part of a Tori's body touches the ground, or when any part touches down outside the designated dojo area, or when the match timer reaches zero and the points are compared.Because of this, the game has a nigh-infinite variety of possible fight scenarios, although most players will find that fights tend to follow some kind of pattern as the various common strategies are countered time and again. Despite its variety, the game suffers from a high entrance barrier for most newcomers. First learning how to properly manipulate your Tori and composing your first moves can be very daunting and no doubt will turn some down from the experience. Fortunately, the community is ever helpful, and many guides and tutorials are available to help newcomers overcome this first major obstacle.I very much recommend Toribash. It's a truly addicting and satisfying experience with one of the best free to play models I've ever known. The playerbase is incredibly active and frequently engages in many competitive events that award the winner with various prizes. Even if the learning process might feel somewhat frustrating, It's all worth it when you finally get into a public server ready to kick some♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Toribash is a fun and unique game for everyone, I first played in 2009 and I still get the same feels from playing.Toribash is not a typical button-mash fighting game you would see out there, you actually have control of your own character and you adjust every single little move you make.At first when you start the game, it seems really complicated and difficult but the fight school shows you the basics of this game pretty well. You don't need much skill at beginner levels if you go play with other people in multiplayer because there are the belts  which are basically the ranks. The more you play, the more you get experience and that means you gain belts so you can fight with people who are equally skilled with you! This is not obligatory though, you can still keep fighting the most known person in Toribash, Uke. Or you can just make your own server and play there with friends or whoever you want to without the need of thinking about rankings or belts. You can also play hundreds of different mods which players have made to make the game more interesting and awesome, there are mods like aikido and judo but there's also mods where you can be involved in a car crash or even go skiing.Toribash has a very nice community, it's really fun, challenging and can keep you occupied for a long time.

In some moments it is making you angry, but this is the game plan. Also i recomand for begginers to learn about game forum and how it works. Then learn how marketing, clans, ingame and all the others things works. After this learn to play the game, and then have fun.This game must be try by any gamer that want something new. Also this game is an oldder one, it was realeasd on 2006, and we are on 2017. So for a game so oldder it is still awesome, and cool. :D			"

												Toribash is a fun and unique game for everyone, I first played in 2009 and I still get the same feels from playing.Toribash is not a typical button-mash fighting game you would see out there, you actually have control of your own character and you adjust every single little move you make.At first when you start the game, it seems really complicated and difficult but the fight school shows you the basics of this game pretty well. You don't need much skill at beginner levels if you go play with other people in multiplayer because there are the belts  which are basically the ranks. The more you play, the more you get experience and that means you gain belts so you can fight with people who are equally skilled with you! This is not obligatory though, you can still keep fighting the most known person in Toribash, Uke. Or you can just make your own server and play there with friends or whoever you want to without the need of thinking about rankings or belts. You can also play hundreds of different mods which players have made to make the game more interesting and awesome, there are mods like aikido and judo but there's also mods where you can be involved in a car crash or even go skiing.Toribash has a very nice community, it's really fun, challenging and can keep you occupied for a long time.

												I have been playing toribash for a few years now, and i'd like to say im JUST starting to become somewhat decent. This is not a game where you can just pick it up and be good, you need months and even years of practice. If you want a game that you can pick up and play to its fullest extent, this is not the game for you. But if you want to get a game that you will need to actually work for, you might like this game.			"

												I have played this game since 2009, so my opinion is well-founded when I say this is the single best fighting game I've played. Where a traditional fighting game has complicated button sequences that can take a while - and some sore fingures - to get down, this game only requires a click of a mouse. It might seem complicated, difficult, and hostile at first, but the community is friendly for the most part, and there's a forum dedicated to sharing knowlege about the game - don't forget about the videos on YouTube! If you stick with the game, you can end up pulling those cool moves in the replays, or be able to figure out what's going on. Anyone who says this game is impossible to learn is flat wrong. Anyone who has spent only half an hour trying to play this game has an invalid opinion. The game doesn't hand-feed you information, and if you lack the ability to read, this game is going to be a pain. A few negative reviews mention that ""This game doesn't explain what the joints do."" Well, yes it does. What do you think contracting your knee would do? Contract your knee, of course. Use common sense, fast-food players!In conclusion, this game is a terrific fighting game that is hard to learn, and even harder to master. Really seperates the men from the boys, don't you think?This game easily recieves an Elaxter rating of a 9 out of 10.TL;DR? Too bad.			"

												Toribash is a fighting game unlike all others. instead of pressing button combos to do preset moves, you make up your own entirely using joints like you would in real life. you can pull of crazy moves that are fully customizable to your play style and skill. it takes a while of getting use to but is a great game. you standardly have 20 seconds to do your move and it the moves last 10 frames untill you can control yourself again. it is an extremely fun game and recommend it 8.5/10			"

												I've been playing toribash since 2010, and it has grown A LOT  since then, I personally think its one the best games out there, if you have the patience to play a steep learning curve then you can enjoy this game for years.Some notes:If you're new to the game I definitely URGE you to play the game a week straight, nothing else(I did this when I first started and got black belt within that time)When in doubt, Focus on guides, wiki moves and learn from them.ENJOY THE GAME!Pros:Good graphics, constantly updating(and options to turn them ALL off if needed)Wonderful community, it's only as good as you make itEXTREME customization - ranging from gametypes,mods,character looks,sounds,hair,hats,flames,textures,80+ coloured forces,relaxes,gradients.Servers are hosted by the central server, so you dont need to port or anything like that :)Organized clan system, with battles of any mod and amount people you want it to be.Cons:Large learning curve, If you were to play 4 years straight,8 hours everyday, you still wouldnt be the best- definitely a badass though.Need to play A LOT when starting off otherwise the game will seem impossible to you.Thanks for reading.~More soon maybe~			"

												This game is frustrating to the point where QWOP would seem like a more relaxing alternative... but its also engaging and addictive. I really want to practice and get better at it. Just try it, i mean, it is free.			"

												I've been playing toribash since 2010, and it has grown A LOT  since then, I personally think its one the best games out there, if you have the patience to play a steep learning curve then you can enjoy this game for years.Some notes:If you're new to the game I definitely URGE you to play the game a week straight, nothing else(I did this when I first started and got black belt within that time)When in doubt, Focus on guides, wiki moves and learn from them.ENJOY THE GAME!Pros:Good graphics, constantly updating(and options to turn them ALL off if needed)Wonderful community, it's only as good as you make itEXTREME customization - ranging from gametypes,mods,character looks,sounds,hair,hats,flames,textures,80+ coloured forces,relaxes,gradients.Servers are hosted by the central server, so you dont need to port or anything like that :)Organized clan system, with battles of any mod and amount people you want it to be.Cons:Large learning curve, If you were to play 4 years straight,8 hours everyday, you still wouldnt be the best- definitely a badass though.Need to play A LOT when starting off otherwise the game will seem impossible to you.Thanks for reading.~More soon maybe~			"

												Toribash was avaliable as a free-to-play work-in-progress on it's official website long before it came to steam (I know right? A Free-to-play early access? What kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥is that?), I am happy that the now finished game has finally made the jump into the Steam library.Toribash's style is turn based fighting, you get your own Ragdoll- Oh sorry I mean ""Tori"" and attempt to sever your opponents limb from limb until one of you hits the ground or the unlikely event of time running out from one of you sitting in a tripod while the other floats away freely.It has a high learning curve that only the most determined of players will decide to persue, at the start of the match, you and your opponent are stood in a T pose which then you are required to execute your moves with each limb, you control all of your Tori's bodyparts, so if you wanted to do a kick, you might grab them by contracting your left pec, clicking on your hand so it initiates a grip and raising your left knee to prepare to deliver an extended kick the following turn, of course, you're doing this while your opponent is also trying to do a move on you, so it might require some wiggle room to finally execute your move, this adds some strategy to the game where you have to try and predict what your opponent is going to do and how you can work around it whilst attempting to deliver that punch into the lumbar.As PCGamer said, Toribash shows us why Ragdolls are the best thing since...Well anything, the replays after a match are so entertaining to watch, whether it was the most awkward game of twister or observing a well made kick with several build up spins. The later belt-leagues are filled with all sorts of incredible plays, if you're at all intrested, a good chap named Les Duncan hosts the Toribash Esports Youtube page, where he commentates over several high league tornaments.Best of all, Toribash is 100% free with even more additional game modes, no pay to win elements present here, customisation is avaliable but TC - Toricredits which are used to purchase cosmetic colours for your blood spouting ragdoll - can be brought with real currency or earned through the game with each win.If you think you can master the art of Toribashing, I would wholeheartidly recommend you download it.

												An excellent game,ragdoll physics allow you to do so much things with your enemy's body.If it's your first time playing and you think it's complicated,don't just give up and say : ""This game is too complicated!I give up."",go to youtube and see some move tutorials,after watching a few you do exactly what they do,and then maybe try to make your own cool moves.And a tip to newbies,you don't HAVE to hold all of your joints,try starting relaxed then work on some limbs,joint by joint.See a few replays and see what can be done while being relaxed and not being stiff like an Iron Ingot.

												This game is tonnes of fun with friends! You can pull of amazing fighting moves and there are tonnes of mods and gamemodes. This game is also, probably, the hardest game i've ever played. Its easy getting started but extremely hard to master! ... And yet it keeps you interested. You always learn new moves an ways to play when you play against someone better than you - and you learn what youre doing right or ""ok"" against people that you are better than.Overall 9/10 - The only negative side is the camera controls.

												Toribash is a fighting game unlike all others. instead of pressing button combos to do preset moves, you make up your own entirely using joints like you would in real life. you can pull of crazy moves that are fully customizable to your play style and skill. it takes a while of getting use to but is a great game. you standardly have 20 seconds to do your move and it the moves last 10 frames untill you can control yourself again. it is an extremely fun game and recommend it 8.5/10			"

												I have played this game since 2009, so my opinion is well-founded when I say this is the single best fighting game I've played. Where a traditional fighting game has complicated button sequences that can take a while - and some sore fingures - to get down, this game only requires a click of a mouse. It might seem complicated, difficult, and hostile at first, but the community is friendly for the most part, and there's a forum dedicated to sharing knowlege about the game - don't forget about the videos on YouTube! If you stick with the game, you can end up pulling those cool moves in the replays, or be able to figure out what's going on. Anyone who says this game is impossible to learn is flat wrong. Anyone who has spent only half an hour trying to play this game has an invalid opinion. The game doesn't hand-feed you information, and if you lack the ability to read, this game is going to be a pain. A few negative reviews mention that ""This game doesn't explain what the joints do."" Well, yes it does. What do you think contracting your knee would do? Contract your knee, of course. Use common sense, fast-food players!In conclusion, this game is a terrific fighting game that is hard to learn, and even harder to master. Really seperates the men from the boys, don't you think?This game easily recieves an Elaxter rating of a 9 out of 10.TL;DR? Too bad.			"

												When i first played this game...i thought to myself that this game, could be one of the best ones i've ever tried.So think of this game as if it was Street Fighter (or any other fighting games out there), but this has 2 ragdolls..and the best part about this game is that...1: You can do some flips and other amazing tricks.2: You can rip off body parts XD.and finally..3: What else is there to say? its just fun and addicting.And who knows, maybe if you are lucky..you can one day try to attempt to do an upper-cut :P.i rate this 10/10.

It's a great mix of learning to control your tori and pregressing through the belts as you become more experienced. it's not your typical fighting game either. The turned based aspect allows you to come up with certain moves and amazing combos that cause complete and utter distruction. You always fight people with different skill levels and you never know what's going to happen. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a constant challenge and a fun progression.			"

												This game is one of the hardest games i ever have played .That's good because i need a challenge when it comes to games in my life.It's only one thing,You level up so easy you cant even learn how to play before you are like should we say green belt.I am a green belt and i only know so very basic ''moves'' and i fight people that's the same belt as me but are MUCH better then i am and know some very cool and advanced ''moves'' so i be like ''how did he/she do that?''i give it 6 out of 10 because of a very bad tutorial and a very fast level up so you dont learn anything before you get to some higher belts and play against better people that will rip apart your body before you can do one turn.But don't take it like i don't like the game,it's a good game but it's just that (read text above) that makes so it's not perfect,but good ^^			"

												To start off my review, Toribash is the most pumped up, mechanical, and definately the most in-depth figher game I have ever seen. I have formed a saying around this game, and whenever a newcomer joins a lobby with me, I tell them this. ""Toribash is a very hard game to learn, but a quite simple game to master."" All you have to do is get the basics down, learn how the joints move, and gain a strong sense of strategy and tactics. Once you have there standards met, you will be soaring up the ranks faster than a blue belt being ran through by a custom belt... Wanna know what I mean by that? Start playing and youll find out. ;) "

												Finally the day has come. I've been playing this game for a year or two now and I'm excited that it has come to Steam.Toribash is essentially a fighting game but it is so much more. The mods completely change the way the game is played. Whether it's skateboarding, lazer dodging, or jousting, there's so much to be done. One of the most fun games I've played in a while. Maybe now that it is on Steam, the community will gain more people which will mean more mods and whatnot. Overall, it's an awesome game with tons of fun to be had. Play it now!			"

												Are you the type who likes physics simulators and stuff? Do you like kicking @$$? If you answered ""yes"" to at least one of those questions, this game might be for you!**The game works in sort of a stop-motion kind of way.  Adjust your joints to line them up with your enemy's knee, head, crotch, anywhere, and let that snap kick FLY! Kick heads off with style and science! SPLIT YOUR OPPONENT IN HALF WITH THE SHOULDER OF YOUR DETACHED ARM (as I've done). Just play it and see what I mean. The controls and the physics are your main enemies--trust me, I've been playing this game since late 2009 (okay, on-and-off) and I STILL suck--but you can have [LOTS of] fun nonetheless. The fact that it has multiplayer that just WORKS makes this one of the only real-time strategy games (technically) I've really been into.  It's one of those games where, if you're looking for some satisfying WHAM-BAM-BOOM punchy-type stuff, there IS no butthurt, as long as there is CARNAGE (why are you looking at me like that?).  Trust me, there is NOTHING quite like this little indie gem.**[Oh, and by the way, if you answered ""no"" to both of those questions up there, I don't believe you.]This unique little purple-pink-whatever-the-f*ck-u-choose-idrc-cartoony-splashy-blood-encrusted jewel is WELL worth a try.  Start kicking your mortal opponents' heads off--you may come to like it!

												My reveiw won't be that much different from the other reviews, this is a VERY unique game that really stands apart form the rest. The gameplay could be calm or relaxing or really tense and exhilarating. Its super fun with a group of freinds and tons of fun  playing with other people online. This game also has a (what seems like) limitless amount of customization, Your character could be compleatly unique and can stand out from everyone else. Then theres the Mods, and there must be THOUSANDS of them. You can easily get any Mod by going into the menu and just picking one, no download required, no wait time, no loading screens (btw this game has no loading screens. yay!). This game looks way more fun than it looks (in my opinion) and once you start playing you probily wont stop. The download is not even 30 seconds and you dont even need to plug in your email for it to work (I did and they don't spam you) so you really have nothing to lose.                                                                                                               P.S. This game is actually free, theres no Pay2Win/Pay2Play, You can get everything by just playing and you can do everything in the game just as well as everyone else without grinding hours awway trying to unlock somthing.

												My reveiw won't be that much different from the other reviews, this is a VERY unique game that really stands apart form the rest. The gameplay could be calm or relaxing or really tense and exhilarating. Its super fun with a group of freinds and tons of fun  playing with other people online. This game also has a (what seems like) limitless amount of customization, Your character could be compleatly unique and can stand out from everyone else. Then theres the Mods, and there must be THOUSANDS of them. You can easily get any Mod by going into the menu and just picking one, no download required, no wait time, no loading screens (btw this game has no loading screens. yay!). This game looks way more fun than it looks (in my opinion) and once you start playing you probily wont stop. The download is not even 30 seconds and you dont even need to plug in your email for it to work (I did and they don't spam you) so you really have nothing to lose.                                                                                                               P.S. This game is actually free, theres no Pay2Win/Pay2Play, You can get everything by just playing and you can do everything in the game just as well as everyone else without grinding hours awway trying to unlock somthing.

One thing bad, but not going to say its a bad game because so.When you first start, its hard. You get the hang of it though, and once you do, its easy. Their's different mods, so you don't need to worry about getting bored either. :)Probably more, but i'm to lazy. Go ahead though, its so fun!			"

												  I have not played this game in a long while, but have finally gotten back into it.  This game may seem difficult at first because its gameplay and mechanics are unlike anything in any other game.  Once you do master how this game works there is no limit on what you can do with its countless modes and games.  There is a clan system where you can meet new players and hone your skills even more.  I would highly suggest giving this game a try, you get the full game for free, so try it out, you may just find that this is a hidden gem in the cancer that is the genre of ""Free to Play Games""			"

												Toribash is like if you made OctoDad into a fighting game. It is fun to play with friends, but don't expect to be great right off the bat. Practice for a while and you will be able to do very cool moves. Definetly get this game, especially because it is free. 7.2/10			"

												As someone who has played the game for years before it was out on steam, i can confirm this is a good physics based fighting game. Of course it will take some time actually learning exactly what all the joints do and how to use them. Took me about 3 years. But i can assure you that this game is extremely fun. There is also the site where you can get in a clan, get into events, share your replay, etc. And everyone who plays this game is pretty nice and skilled too! Imo this is one of the nicer internet communities you could join, and one of the funnest games you could play. Hopefully this help with decisions and such. ~Firesun			"

												  I have not played this game in a long while, but have finally gotten back into it.  This game may seem difficult at first because its gameplay and mechanics are unlike anything in any other game.  Once you do master how this game works there is no limit on what you can do with its countless modes and games.  There is a clan system where you can meet new players and hone your skills even more.  I would highly suggest giving this game a try, you get the full game for free, so try it out, you may just find that this is a hidden gem in the cancer that is the genre of ""Free to Play Games""			"

												I have been playing toribash since 2010, only on steam I - currently - have about 600 hours, and definitely over 2K hours before the steam release.It takes a lot of effort to become good at this game, but it's definitely not impossible.the possibilities of replays are infinite, so it is definitely a great sandbox game.multiplayer has it's flaws, especially regarding connection because it's really easy for you to be disconnected - hence why it's a rather common practice for players to force-ping you during matches, etc.Either way, the game is still good, and definitely worth a shot.

												Toribash is very addictive. If you are bored and need a 'Free to Play' game to keep you busy, you should get this game! At first, you would probably find the game confusing but after randomly causing your ragdoll to do multiple backflips and 360's, you'll eventually understand the game. I used to really enjoy playing this 2D ragdoll game called 'Ragdoll Masters' and this game brings back memories from back then. Toribash still has a few minor bugs but otherwise, it is a very enjoyable game.			"

												if you can get over the steep learning overhang its a brilliant game of play and counterplay.  hundreds of mods to experiment and play with.  Some more silly than others while others turn you into a scorpion or a lion and a gazelle or a mech.   There are a Few glitches with dqs not registering but that just means you can hit each other for longer. If you're new to the game start with the tutorial and single player. Perhaps ask around in a few rooms for someone to teach you the basics or stick to the white belt servers and learn together. if you want to learn basic aikido message me and we shall see if we can organise a meeting time or team bushido has a brilliant tutorial on youtube. This game is what you make of it silly, serious or somewhere in between its up to you. May you streak till you're weak. oh right score 10/10 its kept me playing on and off since 2008 its got to be doing something right.			"

												To start off my review, Toribash is the most pumped up, mechanical, and definately the most in-depth figher game I have ever seen. I have formed a saying around this game, and whenever a newcomer joins a lobby with me, I tell them this. ""Toribash is a very hard game to learn, but a quite simple game to master."" All you have to do is get the basics down, learn how the joints move, and gain a strong sense of strategy and tactics. Once you have there standards met, you will be soaring up the ranks faster than a blue belt being ran through by a custom belt... Wanna know what I mean by that? Start playing and youll find out. ;) "

												I feel like im quite experienced, since i joined 5 years ago (2011), which might be why i have a different view on this game than other people here.First of all, this is NOT an Adventure/RPG or any similar kind of game, so if thats what youre looking for, youre probably at the wrong place. Toribash is a Fighting/Simulation/Ragdoll game, in which, similar to Rocket league, matches are short and really hard. Even though i have nearly 300 hours of gametime, i feel like i am still scratching the surface of mastering the control of the tori (Your character).The first 10 hours is probably the worst; Here you're still wandering around trying to figure out how you move your tori and control it the way you want it. And there is NO shortcut to learn this. You have to feel it yourself.10 - 100 hours of gameplay; Here you have probably learned the basics of how to control your tori and have settled down on a basic mod. This is were the game gets really fun, and you realise how hard this game can actually be.100 < x hours of gameplay; When you have reached around 100 hours, i recommend you look into Sparring. Not only montages of youtube, but also try it yourself (even if failed miserably). I feel like sparring is THE best way to learn.Tl;dr : This game is the most fun AND the hardest game i've ever played. If you like ragdoll/fighting/simulation games, its probably worth looking into. AND ITS FREE!.			"

												This is a game from what i liked to call the simpler times of FTP games, and i LOVE IT!to avoid being biased i will simply list a few pro's and con's rather than giving my ""true opinion""Pros:1. A True free to play, the only in-game purchases are for cosmetic items.2. It is an interesting concept that allows for many complex manuevers and moves that look incredible if done correctly.3. Being a new player doesn't really hinder you, as there are no real restrictions you can play with litterally anyone from other White belts to Black belt players.Cons:1. The physics can react differently each time you do a move so its 'almost' impossible to perfectly replicate moves2. modifying the ingame physics when in free play can cause numerous glitches.3. the interface is HELL to understand when you are a noob...now inspite of all these possitives and negatives i still think this is a game that deserves to be in your steam library no matter what and because of this i am giving an overall possitive review.So in conclusion... WAAAH!... DIS IS DAH ORKZ COMPUTA NOW.... that is all.			"

												To start off my review, Toribash is the most pumped up, mechanical, and definately the most in-depth figher game I have ever seen. I have formed a saying around this game, and whenever a newcomer joins a lobby with me, I tell them this. ""Toribash is a very hard game to learn, but a quite simple game to master."" All you have to do is get the basics down, learn how the joints move, and gain a strong sense of strategy and tactics. Once you have there standards met, you will be soaring up the ranks faster than a blue belt being ran through by a custom belt... Wanna know what I mean by that? Start playing and youll find out. ;) "

												I feel like im quite experienced, since i joined 5 years ago (2011), which might be why i have a different view on this game than other people here.First of all, this is NOT an Adventure/RPG or any similar kind of game, so if thats what youre looking for, youre probably at the wrong place. Toribash is a Fighting/Simulation/Ragdoll game, in which, similar to Rocket league, matches are short and really hard. Even though i have nearly 300 hours of gametime, i feel like i am still scratching the surface of mastering the control of the tori (Your character).The first 10 hours is probably the worst; Here you're still wandering around trying to figure out how you move your tori and control it the way you want it. And there is NO shortcut to learn this. You have to feel it yourself.10 - 100 hours of gameplay; Here you have probably learned the basics of how to control your tori and have settled down on a basic mod. This is were the game gets really fun, and you realise how hard this game can actually be.100 < x hours of gameplay; When you have reached around 100 hours, i recommend you look into Sparring. Not only montages of youtube, but also try it yourself (even if failed miserably). I feel like sparring is THE best way to learn.Tl;dr : This game is the most fun AND the hardest game i've ever played. If you like ragdoll/fighting/simulation games, its probably worth looking into. AND ITS FREE!.			"

												Don't be fooled by the animations in the trailer. Those are all done against AI fighters & with replay editors, or in fights where there's only fractions-of-a-second per turn. They represent what CAN be done, but not what you'll usually see or do.This is a strange fighting game with a considerable learning curve.After every second or-so of combat, the game pauses. During this pause phase, each player manipulates their character's joints to try and control them..After the pause, the results of the players choices play out for another second or two.Thankfully, despite the *difficult learning curve* most of my friends still find it a ton of fun, even when we're terrible at it. You really won't have an easy time with refined movement without just playing the game for a few hours. Creating a private room and setting your own game-rules is easy. There are lots of variables you can change very quickly (turn timers, frames per turn, starting height / distance, ect)the game is a very light-weight install, and the 'mods' (quickly loaded scenarios with custom maps rules, weapons or modified characters) give it a lot of life.It's worth giving this game the time of day.

												Toribash.....One of the few games I cannot understand.In case you didn't read the discription of the game, Toribash is a physics-styled combat game, where you move your bodyparts to attack. However, it's really difficult if you don't know what you're doing, since it's complicated to do the cool stuff. In order to do that cool stuff, you gotta make sure that every joint (different word for bodypart in this case) goes in the direction as planned. It's sort of turn-based, since you can chain multiple joint-movements.If you have patience, and a good computer, then go play this. If you're impatient, and have a shitcomputer, then don't play this.			"

												I've played this game quite a lot in the past before it was released to Steam. By no means was I good, especially since the game has a rather large learning curve. This learning curve comes from the fact that various joints must be manipulated to get results, but casual players (especially friends) will often find hilarity due to the manipulation of their characters sometimes in rather awkward positions. Multiplayer games are rather fast-paced compared to singleplayer sessions due to the timer which limits the time players can think before it runs out. Otherwise, various mods come with the game which adds plenty of PvP options (arena type, weapons, body sensitivity, etc.), or solo challenges (parkour, skateboarding, sports, etc.).In terms of play by more seasoned/veteran players (not including myself), other players can find interest in the rather complicated techniques used to simulate real fights or complete parkour maps.Overall, this game takes a long time to fully understand since the tutorial does not completely cover everything, but once players get past this, they'll find many challenges to overcome.

												Toribash is a free game and i very happy it is. You may look at the trailer and say ""Wow that game looks crappy"". Well that is kind of true. But it is purposely made that way! It is made to make them look like ragdolls as you can rip your own and others limbs off! You might say the ragdolls look very bland but with coins you earn from winning matches you can customize your ragdoll. Now to the gameplay part of this review. There are mods, yes mods. But you dont have to download them of the internet or off some program they are built into the game. The mod maker is built in the game so when people create a mod it is just uploaded to the game instantly. Therefor, making the hard process of downloading fun mods much easier! Now to multiplayer. There are servers in which you can battle other people the server owner determines which mod the server should have. you can even create your own server (for free) and choose a mod and play with your friends (you can always change the mod). Therefore overall this is a great game that might lack some detail but overall is a great game. However there is one really annoying glitch. When you start up a mod the mod creators put the 2 people in certain spots, and sometimes when you start up another mod when you recently just played one, it will keep the same positions as the old mod and will start you off i nthe incorrect place for a mod. However this is easily fixable and does not happen on multiplayer (that i know of). You quit Toribash and start it up again a usually quick and painless process and boom, your good. Therefore, this is a great game overall. 9.5/10			"

												(PROSVSCONS)+great community+limitless gameplay+a plethora of great mods without the need to download external programs to use them.+addictive+controllable gravity and other factors+many hotkeys to make the game easier to control.+very helpful tutorial.-bad server balance (white belts getting paired against black belts constantly)-complicated for new players-time consuming.conclusion:overall, great game... for those who play it at length.'what is toribash?'it is a turn based fighting game controlled by entending,contracting,holding and relaxing certan muscles to attack your enemy ('uke') or another player depending wether you play freeplay or multiplayer.

												I've played this game quite a lot in the past before it was released to Steam. By no means was I good, especially since the game has a rather large learning curve. This learning curve comes from the fact that various joints must be manipulated to get results, but casual players (especially friends) will often find hilarity due to the manipulation of their characters sometimes in rather awkward positions. Multiplayer games are rather fast-paced compared to singleplayer sessions due to the timer which limits the time players can think before it runs out. Otherwise, various mods come with the game which adds plenty of PvP options (arena type, weapons, body sensitivity, etc.), or solo challenges (parkour, skateboarding, sports, etc.).In terms of play by more seasoned/veteran players (not including myself), other players can find interest in the rather complicated techniques used to simulate real fights or complete parkour maps.Overall, this game takes a long time to fully understand since the tutorial does not completely cover everything, but once players get past this, they'll find many challenges to overcome.

												A wonderful fighting game, but made extremely complex by simple means. Most fighting games throw you a character like Batman, or Chun-Li, or Scorpion, but this game throws you a ragdoll. And it's limp. You control muscle movements, and therefore control motion and actions. You can create a personality through moves and attacks, you can personify your own character like that. But learning motions and how to properly use the controls isn't a quick process. Also, the main basic fight mode, Aikido, has a couple of punches and swings in the beginning, but it always end up with the two of you grabbing each other in a jumble of limbs, trying to find joints to move, and hoping someone else hits their knee or elbow on the ground and loses first.The combat itself has potential to be amazing, if you find the right person/people, but for me, It's always grabbing each other, trying to throw each other out of the ring or make you hit the ground and disqualify. It's less so fighting and moreso who can foul first. If you can get over that issue, this game will be endless fun, so long as you try new things.			"

												<h1> Generic REview #15857375927382 </h1>In my opinion, the game is interesting.PROS:- With full control, you can literally do flips and fun things- The fact that the rules and almost everything is customizable is astounding- Millions of mods to keep you busy- It's very fun to be played competitively- Active community- It's free, with cosmetics being available to buy with real and in-game curency.CONS:- The lack of the twisting of some parts of the body bothers me. (ex: You can't twist your back and fore arm)- Confusing at start, not very attractive for new players.- Tutroriaal may be better if they introduce more moves to the new players.Overall:<h1> 8/10 <h1>It needs to be more appealing to newer players, as people really hate it for not knowing what to do.Still a good game though.-Green Belt-			"

												If you were looking for a review, then keep looking. If you're hungry, this is the place for youGrandpa's Dutch Apple Pie RecipeYou need a Pie pan, a fork, and some sort of Apple peeling device-----------------------------------Ingredients:------------------------------------------------- 5 apples (Granny smith, crimson crisp, etc.) (Decently sized) A stick or two of butter, depending on if you made your own crust Some cinnamon (To Taste) Some sugar (To Taste) Pie Crust  3/8 cup of flour---------------------Recipe---------------------------------------------------------------------- Preheat oven to 225 Degrees Celsius (437 Farenheit) Peel, Core and Cut all 5 apples in small cubes or thin slices (Soak in water with a bit of lemon juice to prevent browning) Mix together a stick of butter, some oatmeal, a third cup of sugar, a pinch of brown sugar, a dash of vanilla extract, and a little under 1/3 cup of flour. Mix it together until you end up with a crumble-y texture.  Precook pie crust at 225C for 4-5 minutes Mix sugar, cinnamon, and apple slices Pour apple mixture into crust apply crumble on top of apples, they should be piling over the top of the pie pan Bake at 225 degrees C for 20-25 minutes Add whipped cream or vanilla sauce to your hearts desire.Note: I prefer to mix apples in a colander, then move them to a bowl after they've been sufficently sugared, so that they don't soak in the apple-sugar-cinnamon juice for too long. Just long enough to give it some flavor.			"

												Really like this game! I have been playing it for around 7.5 hours now and I am really impressed with how the game works and how fluid gameplay is. One thing I don't like however is the fact that once you get your yellow belt you are dropped straight into the intermediate ranks with not much practise and quite often get destroyed by some wizard with a 4th Dan black belt. Apart from that, this game adds a new twist onto fighting games and changes the way I play them. I would reccomend this game to someone who is a fan of strategy, tense moments and violence.			"

												This game is a masterpiece it has realistic physics, and it also depends on your knowledge of human joints. You use the joints to move your tori and make fantastic replays.Like spars,parkour, and all kinds of stuff you can also make your own mods too! Customize your character, be very skillful, and be worthy and join different clans and do clan wars!I really do recommend this game, its a masterpiece.Enjoy!			"

												Toribash is:-When high belt tries to pull something of, but fails and gets beaten by white belt-When you play trampoline mod and you fly into space-When you fly into space even without trampoline-When you play with any kind of sword and accidently get millions of points-When you waste more than 5 hours to learn good moves, and then they fail in multiplayer-When costumes worth more than gta 5-When ultra graphics looks worse than high graphics-When kids can say that you're a cheater and kick you from the server. Why? Because you have beaten them.-When you can win 7 times in a row doing very dumb moves-When you're waiting for your turn 10 minutes, and when you finnaly can play, you fail on your first move.10 white belts out of 10, would fly to space again.

												this is a really fun game, hundreds of fun mods and pretty intense matches online, my only complaint is the moves, they are a LITTLE hard to pull off, but overall, i reccomend this game for anyone looking for an enjoyable fighting experience for anyone who is looking and also for someone who is looking for something unique in the fighting game roster.

												Great game, Hard to learn but when u understand the game a bit better You''ll find out how funny this game is. Alot of modes as well, you might not find all the fighting fun, Then you can play another mode like parkour which is nevertheless fun! Always something to learn too, Im miles away from being considered ''Good'' in this game, With 100hrs playtime! :)			"

												Toribash is an OK game...Its kinda slow to me though, im not used to ""pick a body part to relax, contract, hold or extend"". In some cases, You only get a small amount of time to kick or grab the other player-- sometimes you get a long time and you accidentally perform a trick.Im only reccomending this game because it might get better.

												Story: None. You learn from ""Uke"" in the beginning and go on in various mods and servers.Gameplay: 7/10. The game can be quick ,annoying, and frustrating when you first start.  When you get more experienced, you can see how the new players use basic pathetic moves that can beat a high belt.This game can be casual, but you have to learn fast. It can be exhilarating and tiresome 24/7. I myself played for about 3 months in 2015 and quit for a year. Its a game where you have stop and eventually come back to play, and redo.Graphics: 5.5/10. This game is kind of old, and the Toris/Ukes(Avatars) aren't very good looking . Theres no buildings or anything except for mods, and they're minecraft graphic quality.Controls: 6.5/10. The controls are eventually easy enough, but when you get to more complicated things, as boxshu mushu and so on, it gets harder.Speed: 9/10.This game takes about 5 minutes to download and is fast for me online.This game is pretty good. I do recommend, but you're likely to play it non-stop, or not at all.			"

												Toribash is an outstanding experience! At first, like any game the controls seem foreign and hard to get a grip on, but you soon get the hang of it and have a blast playing other people from around the world. Generally, the community is very friendly, with one or two exceptions here and there, but once you get hooked be prepared to be shut off from the world for the 5-6 weeks.			"

												Story: None. You learn from ""Uke"" in the beginning and go on in various mods and servers.Gameplay: 7/10. The game can be quick ,annoying, and frustrating when you first start.  When you get more experienced, you can see how the new players use basic pathetic moves that can beat a high belt.This game can be casual, but you have to learn fast. It can be exhilarating and tiresome 24/7. I myself played for about 3 months in 2015 and quit for a year. Its a game where you have stop and eventually come back to play, and redo.Graphics: 5.5/10. This game is kind of old, and the Toris/Ukes(Avatars) aren't very good looking . Theres no buildings or anything except for mods, and they're minecraft graphic quality.Controls: 6.5/10. The controls are eventually easy enough, but when you get to more complicated things, as boxshu mushu and so on, it gets harder.Speed: 9/10.This game takes about 5 minutes to download and is fast for me online.This game is pretty good. I do recommend, but you're likely to play it non-stop, or not at all.			"

												Toribash is an outstanding experience! At first, like any game the controls seem foreign and hard to get a grip on, but you soon get the hang of it and have a blast playing other people from around the world. Generally, the community is very friendly, with one or two exceptions here and there, but once you get hooked be prepared to be shut off from the world for the 5-6 weeks.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												I played this game basically from the start, and it was a blast. But now I can't even connect to a server to play the game, and even if I could the community has just been infected by the scum of the pc universe. People who now play this game only use the cheapest strats and if they dont do that they just complain until they can get you banned from the server. This game was great until the move to steam.GG toribash, it was a good run			"

												I received a low-threat prisoner, so I didn't pay much attention to him. How wrong I was..It was a normal, average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.He attacked from the shadows.Prisoner ""Leeroy jenkins"" viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!54/11 would plastic fork again.			"

You had to time your moves just right to actually do something and I quit because it was really difficult. Then, I tried again and practiced for a small time and in a mess of moves when I was in free play, I dismembered the leg of my enemy.It felt so good.10/10			"

												Cool interface and all, but don't change the graphics or much of the settings. It will go nuts and you'll hear a guy getting beat up insanely like my head. The screen will go all black, and you won't be able to do anything except reinstall the game. Either way, its fun.			"

												This game is absolutely terrible, until you get used to it. The goodness of the game scales with the skill of the player. Luckily this game is easy to get used to. This game is definitely worth spending your precious time on. The game modes consist of general martial arts such as Judo and Aikido, however, for the more... shall I say, mature gamers out there, there are game modes that are more like ""marital"" arts such as ""torisex"" (uncommonly found on servers). This game allows players to control just about every joint in their tori's body, creating over-the-top moves and combos. Limbs can fracture and dismember, adding to the satisfaction of your already oh so sweet victory. There is a microtransaction system however the effects are purely cosmetic and can also be earned by completing matches. This game is one of my favourites and I definitely recommend it to everyone who is willing to spend at least some time getting used to it.			"

												Toribash is a free-to-play game where you control the individual tori limbs each of them can have 4 different states meaning number of possible moves is almost endless. It is fun to play with friends and with strangers and making a server is as easy as counting to 3. However, there are some downsides to such a game, even with almost 24 hours of constant playing I still find it hard to perform the most basic of moves and some may not have the patience to spend a long time experimenting. Also, the community is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and will comment on every move you do, trying to correct you which may sound helpful but in reality is incredibly annoying.There is also a wide range of mods that can be easily accessed by pressing ctrl  + m as the host of a game, ranging from a sword fight to 'torisex', these can really make the game much more fun.

												Toribash is a great game for multiple reasons. There is a few flaws about the game because it's not perfect. Some great things about it is the freedom you have over the character's body. Because of this, many combinations of body parts can be  used to create awesome moves. Multiplayer is VERY simple and requires no difficulty in creating a server. There are a LOT of mods that come with this game that requires no downloads. A few cons is that it can get repetitive if playing for long periods of time. Also, a lot of in game-currency is required to unlock new character skins and that's about it. I strongly recommend this game and the best part about it is that it's free!			"

There are a LOT of mods that come with this game that requires no downloads. A few cons is that it can get repetitive if playing for long periods of time. Also, a lot of in game-currency is required to unlock new character skins and that's about it. I strongly recommend this game and the best part about it is that it's free!			"

												Okay Toribash is a great game for those with patience. Iv'e been playing this game for a little over a year now and I'm still relatively bad at it, it takes time...unless if you're some type of prodigy. It's one of those games that playing with friends makes it 2x better, but playing by yourself is cool too. Honestly, Toribash gets a 75/99, a great free game.			"

												Toribash represents a new generation of strategical fighting games since 2006, and no other game came ever close to what you can do in Toribash. Just give it a try and you will get fascinating experience playing the best fighting ever, where all depends on your skills. Customize your Tori to make proper impression on your opponents. Join tournaments to fight for prizes.Play smart and don't lose your balance. See you in-game.			"

												Awesome game, I've been playin it for 8 hrs (100+ hrs now!) and still loving it! This game has really good physics, you can make new fighting moves/control your own body and best of all, THE RANKS, and the RAGDOLL. But I dont recommend (Kinda) it for people who has no patience, or hates fighting games and hates being in queue now you dont have to be in a queue they added a matchmaking system for people who wants to play with unranks or ranked 1v1 so you dont have to wait in a queue. Or verse a person the same belt as you which is GREAT. It is really satisfying just winning one round, and it will make you wanna play more, trust me it's addicting. Personally I think 50 hours + is worth.8.5/10			"

The game is very hard to get good at, but once you get good its extremely fun. I always find myself coming back to toribash.Pros: Has great staff.the rules are fairly liberal with a ""Just don't be stupid"" approach.Very fun with a variety of mods/gamestyles you can play around with.Overall very competitive.Cons:Toxic players.Dueling is dead.Would definately recommed commiting to (And yes, this game is a commitment if you want to get anywhere on it, but once you do its amazing)			"

												Toribash is probably the only Japanese Physics based Fighting Game out there but if there were more Toribash would be the best one out of the lot.Its FREE it involves dismemberment and can get very competitive.Playing this game with friends is so fun and then beating your friend in combat EVEN BETTER.Toribash is hard and you need to practice to get better. If youd like to know how to quickly Decap Uke in Free Play check out my ""Quick Decap"" Guide.Toribash is fun because there are endless moves to perform and even the noobs can perform them, all you do is experiment on Uke in Free Play.KIMBOF1's Score = 4/5Fantastic free game to play with friends where no level of brutality is absurd. Can get a little boring in long sessions though, I recommend this for when you are bored			"

												FINALLY its on Steam. This game is strategic, sometimes fast paced, and it requires quick thinking. When you start playing you see all these cool replays and you think ""how can I do that?"". Well in the beginning, you can't. But don't be discouraged keep playing and practice. Soon you will understand the game and then you can make your tori do anything that pops into your head. This game takes practice and creativity. Being creative is what its all about. Whether you are making replays or fighting another player you need to be creative. Make your very own moves so you can have others saying ""WOW!"". There is not much that I want changed with the game except for maybe a better tutorial for new players and maybe a matchmaking system. I reccomend this game for anyone looking for a free game. Alsothis game has a steep learning curve, but stick around and you won't want to leave. If you quit before you've learned the game, thats fine but you have missed out.			"

												YES you need to play this gameI recommend for casuals and competitives! This game may take AGES to get used to, but it's worth it! The moves you can do are AMAZING, swift gameplay, tournaments for the winning type, and violence for the mature :)You'll have a BASH XD			"

												No matter how good you think you are, no matter how complex your move. Gravity will still win. And because gravity apparently doesn't affect the other guy. Other guy tears your head off and eats your brain raw with a little heart sauce.11/10 would have brain served with heart sauce again.			"

												Ever wanted to dance but ain't good enough to do it? Well with this game you still can't dance but instead you can atleast do it in this game. In this game you are originally ment to either push your opponent out of the fighting ring or deal as much damage to him/her before the time runs out. But these days you can simply breakdance, do ballet or anything just for the fun of it and nobody minds it. So download this and start playing if you want to see some fabulous moves. It's worth your time.			"

If youd like to know how to quickly Decap Uke in Free Play check out my ""Quick Decap"" Guide.Toribash is fun because there are endless moves to perform and even the noobs can perform them, all you do is experiment on Uke in Free Play.KIMBOF1's Score = 4/5Fantastic free game to play with friends where no level of brutality is absurd.

												Very simple at the beginning but as the understanding of the game grows so does the experience. Not so fun to play alone, but loads of fun with friends for a long time. You can play it casually, or learn some advanced techniques and spend 100s of hours in tournaments. Along with public servers you can get your own skins, modify the gravity, use custom maps, and change just about any feature of the game, and ITS FREE!			"

												Well... If you put even a decent amount of time into the game it feels very rewarding. Maybe take a day or two to get used to the movement of joints. Also let me tell you that the tutorial sucks, if you need help go to there forums on the beginners thread and ask for help in the mod you play. If you don't know what mod you are playing ask someone in the lobby you are in or if you are alone, or with just a friend the default mod is Aikido most of the time. Anyways on with the review.Honestly one of the best games I have put time into. I am am blue belt and have beaten black belts, I honestly think is was because of the time I put into it as soon as I picked it up. If you plan to play this you need to put time into it to be good, don't expect to get in and be good (Of course there are some exceptions). Anyways I give this game a 10/10 for its ""different"" gameplay aspect, its mostly friendly community, and its great mods to play for fun or to compete in.			"

												An interesting take on fighting games, and a good one at that. The fighting isn't about mashing keys or memorising combos, but rather chosing how and which joints to use. This obviously leads to many failures and fights won by flopping around until someone is disqualified for beginners, yet in higher levels, people can pull of stunning moves. The extremeness  of high level players gets to the point where they can use their enemies head as a weapon, and luckily a feature of the game is to save and watch replays (there are some included).

												I've played this game since 2009 when it wasn't on steam yet. I've amassed AT LEAST 5000 hours on this game, its truly video game heroin. The game is very hard to get good at, but once you get good its extremely fun. I always find myself coming back to toribash.Pros: Has great staff.the rules are fairly liberal with a ""Just don't be stupid"" approach.Very fun with a variety of mods/gamestyles you can play around with.Overall very competitive.Cons:Toxic players.Dueling is dead.Would definately recommed commiting to (And yes, this game is a commitment if you want to get anywhere on it, but once you do its amazing)			"

												Toribash is probably the only Japanese Physics based Fighting Game out there but if there were more Toribash would be the best one out of the lot.Its FREE it involves dismemberment and can get very competitive.Playing this game with friends is so fun and then beating your friend in combat EVEN BETTER.Toribash is hard and you need to practice to get better. If youd like to know how to quickly Decap Uke in Free Play check out my ""Quick Decap"" Guide.Toribash is fun because there are endless moves to perform and even the noobs can perform them, all you do is experiment on Uke in Free Play.KIMBOF1's Score = 4/5Fantastic free game to play with friends where no level of brutality is absurd. Can get a little boring in long sessions though, I recommend this for when you are bored			"

It's one of those games that playing with friends makes it 2x better, but playing by yourself is cool too. Honestly, Toribash gets a 75/99, a great free game.			"

												I played this for a little bit, it's not something I can get the hang of xDI'm actually afraid to even wonder what playing with some of the more elite players would be like. Simply put this is a pretty cool game, the concept is nice, using body mechanis, just simply turning, raising lowering, extending, retracting, relaxing parts of your characters body and gripping the others to in turn beat the ever loved ""S**T"" out of your enemy looks pretty fun but I cannot get the hang of it xDIt may be easier in the actual pvp because you have to compensate for your enemies movements to create more complex combos but with how badly I was doing I think I'll just have to miss out on it. But from simply looking at the video if this looks like a game for you, give it a try. Play the tutorial and learn what the game is about and I promise you you'll love it.			"

												Had lots of fun on this game over the years even before it became available on steam.There are several modes and maps on this game to keep you amused.It takes time to make your moves look any good, but it feels very rewarding when you pull off that sweet decap.While most skins are fairly expensive, everything you can put money into is purely cosmetic, so it's not like the game is Pay-To-Win (I've done fine without investing a penny into it)So give it a try, the worst that happens is that you end up losing 5 minutes of your life by trying it :D			"

												This game is brilliant, it's very addictive and fun to play but a problem is, a lot of people don't play tutorials, so they are extremely confused how to play and end up deleting it, so I recommend this to only the people who play the tutorials. Tio improve this, I would add something so if you're new, you have to play the tutorial as at times it gets confusing but overall it's a brilliant game.			"

												This game is amazing, full control of your character, make it do what you want, customise it and add your on looks, upload your skins, textures, have music when you enter a battle tourneys, all the mods you could imagine free.The game is easy to run and any computer can play it, the graphics are smooth and the physics work like a charmThe list goes on on what you could do, parkour, tournaments, fights, host a server to play with your friends, belts to distinguish pro's from beginners.now i have to add that you won't be making the moves you see in the trailer at the start, took me a year to learn to walk in the game:Dbut none the less, don't get frustrated when you can't win, just try and try over again and soon enough you will be as good as the top players.this game is amazing and i could talk about it forever, but i don't have forever and theres your overview about the game.
