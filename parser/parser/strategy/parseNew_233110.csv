												This game tries to imitate Defense Grid (which is the best tower defense I've ever played), but contains a lot of failures :- There are no checkpoints ... and some levels last 30 minutes, it's horrible!- There is no pause either. (you can't freeze time and put some turrets)- You can speed up the time (x2), but if you do that the turrets will be less effective!- There is no minimap and you can't zoom-out to see the whole map.- You can't change the targeting priority of your turrets.- The interface is failed ! It was designed to play with a controller, which is cool for people playing on consoles, but isn't effective with a mouse and a keyboard.- The first half of the campaign is boring : no difficulty, no mazing, no original turrets. Fortunately, in the second half, you gain acces to more interesting turrets, you can start mazing and levels become challenging.- There is no other game modes, just the campaign.The level transformation idea is interesting, though it isn't used a lot. The graphics are good and I like the mecha-style of the turrets.The game isn't entirely bad, but it contains a lot of frustrating things. Buy it only on big sale, prefer Defense Grid or Defenders Quest.			"

												Decided to grab this while waiting for Defense Grid 2 and while it looks like Defense Grid it it lacks a huge amount of depth the game had, the game is playable and enjoyable enough that I played all the way through but almost everything is copied from DG.Set pieces are copy paste including almost all art assets, the upgrade system even down to the colours and the music.It's dissapointing that a developer with enough money to put some effort into a PC TD decided to waste it in copying another game.Unless you have played Defense Grid to death then don't play this, if you're hardcore into TD then wait until it's cheap then grab it.If this doesn't feel like a real review it's because it's not,anything I write about the game feels like I'm reviewing DG.

												Defense Technica is Defense Grid, but with less polish. Everything about it is directly from Defense Grid. The art style, the interface, the icons. Everything. This is like the shameless copy-catting you see on iOS, where they try to confuse the customer into buying the wrong game. This isn't totally broken and useless, but why pay $15 for this shameless thing, when you can pay $10 or less for the actual Defense Grid? "

												Defense Technica (19/50) - Just Badby YiasmatEven tho i´m a huge fan of the genre, i still can´t convince myself to recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a nice TD, just go for anotherone, there are so many good TD´s out there (Defense Grid for example).Graphics (4/10):Not really that impressive. Considering this is a PC version, it has crappy animations, the framerate is just taken over from the android version and overall it could have been much better.Design (2/10):As this is a TD, especially the leveldesign. It´s just.... aweful. They tried to copy what DG did right, a mix between maze and standart. I hope you already know: they failed. The first levels are actually ok, but as they get bigger comes a confusing layout. That doesn´t change with the ""blockers"" standing on each map (things the enemies will stop at and attack till it´s gone).For the overall design: The enemies are nicely diversified which doesn´t count for the towers. If a tower is level 1 or 2, you will not see it.Gameplay (7/20):You can upgrade your towers, so thats a plus. But what else? You always have to place your towers on the exact spot it was supposed to stand in order to block the enemies path. How strategy is that. After the first level, the fun is just gone. It gets repetitiv really quick as you don´t get any new useful stuff. The real killer are the blockers tho. Having to build towers which you than have to sell later is just stupid.You also don´t need to adjust any towers to the enemies spawing as they nearly all do the same thing.Controls (4/5):Works overall. Sometimes the camera pans a bit strange but thats ok. Annoying is the zoom tho. You will never use it. You don´t need to, but it´s really bad.Innovation (2/5):Copies DG, every tower has already been seen in other games and there are no new enemy types to speak of.Tho you have a upgrade system of each tower and the blockers are (even tho really bad) new as well.

												I was hoping Defense Technica was going to rival one of my    top rated TD games Defense Grid: The Awakening, for playability;  unfortnately it   didn't, but it certainly helped me  to scratch the itch I get when I see  a new TD release.  Tower Defense games are one of my favorite  arcade/indie genres.  I'm quite pleased with this one even if it doesn't  offer up anything new apart from the crystals that enable you to occassionally reveal  the most  optimal placement of turrets or the luck based card system that offer enduring bonuses such as reduced build costs.  Sadly   these crystals  take an age to  save enough to use effectively. If you're new to TD games, I'd give this one a miss at least until its on sale as it can be quite   hard to win once you've passed the first  several levels.   I'd score it  an average 6.5 out of 10			"

												The Good:+ different variety towers each with its own upgrade skill tree+ 22 unique levels, some levels provide mazing, others do not+ Some levels can transform mid play offering unique expereince in the game + Good graphics for a tower defense game +2 levels of difficulty +Controller Support The Bad:- Doesn't really do anything new that hasn't been done already, its about as standard as it gets (except for level transformation)- Most levels (especially if you play on harder diffuculty) usually have one solution to complete it perfectly. This to me is the single biggest negative against the game. If your not going for a perfect run than this shouldn't really matter. -Game seems to be optimized around controller support. You can use mouse and/or keyboard however the controller seems to be the best way to play. If your looking for a fun little tower defense game, this could be the game for you			"

												It's impressive in how many ways they miss the mark of what makes for an enjoyable tower defense game. There's little introduction or explanation to gameplay concepts. For example, the 4th level introduces its first weather effect, except it doesn't really tell you when this is happening, or what its effect is. You have to go out of your way to find such simple things.You know what other amazing feature it possesses? Enemies drop a cube of additional resources upon death, which you are required to hover your mouse over to collect. Maps become several screens large even from the first level, so if you create a few killzones, you have to constantly cycle between them to scavenge your rewards. It's kind of ludicrous in a terrible way, honestly.I would best describe Defense Technica as a half-hearted mash-up of Defense Grid (in look, feel, and mechanisms [you quickly acquire what is essentially the orbital laser, towers pop out of the ground in little boxes, etc]) and Kingdom Rush (towers are limited, but gain upgrade paths). Maybe somewhere in there is a kernal of a good idea, but it's not easily accessable, and it's hugely unpolished.Sadly, this is a purchase I regret.			"

												If you played Defense Grid and enjoyed it, this is a game you should try, cause it's quite similar! But you should be warned that some of the stages are really hard to beat. This can be frustrating, cause you have to finish a stage to unlock the next one. I personally liked that challenge, but if you don't own Defense Grid yet, I'd recommend that you get that game before buying Defense Technica, cause Defense Grid is a bit easier and the better game over all.The graphics in Defense Technica are really nice in my opinion. The tower upgrade system is a lot of fun. To have more than one core that is attacked by the enemies is also a great idea. Another nice feature: Some of the stages change during play (for example an area with another core that is under water at first becomes accessible after a while).			"

												Good tower defense if you like challenge. There aren't certain super powered tower in this game, it depends on what enemy's type(s) gonna hit you next (light-bio,light-mecha etc). Mazing options are quite puzzling! once you found the perfect one, you'll get a killer maze, so its not just some random-placed tower grid. Towers are quite varied and their upgrade paths are interesting and fun. Level designs are solid and seem well thought, I especially like their level-transformation concept and implementation. Control is a bit clunky at times though, also it is hard sometimes just to figured out the path of flying enemies and the lack of pause isn't making it any better.A lot of people complained but I actually spend more hours on this game, 35 hours vs  14 hours on Defense Grid, and I just finished all level on hardcore.As a fan of tower defense genre, I would recommend this game.

												I have played completely through this game and both Defense Grid and Defense Grid 2.  I don't think the other reviewers have played through this game entirely.  While there may be similarities between this game and the Defense Grid games, there are also very significant differences.  Since so many other reviewers are comparing the two games, I will as well.One of the biggest differences is that you can add upgrade ability to your towers between levels which carries over.  In Defense Grid there is no overarching upgrade ability.  Every level is brand new with the same vanilla towers.  The upgrades in Defense Technica can significantly change the way a tower behaves.  In Defence Grid, upgrades just increase damage and range.  For example, the basic machine gun tower can go up the machine gun path which will give it longer range and more damage against biological enemies.  Or it can become a mass driver which allows it to penetrate all enemies in a line specialized again mechanical enemies but with a much slower rate of fire.There are very distinct catagories of enemies and damage.  One type of damage is optimal for a certain type of enemy but may be very weak against another.  Defense grid has shielded and unshielded.  This game has shielded, unshielded, heavy, light, bio and mechanical.  If you specialize in one type of damage, you will become vulnerable to enemies that are resistant to it.Unlike in Defense Grid, when enemies make it to your core, they do damage.  They are not stealing cores which float back to your base.  They stay there until your core is destroyed at which point you lose the game.Also, the core itself has a couple of finite abilities.  It can do a smart bomb a few times or heal itself using ether.  Once the ether runs out, then you have no more for the rest of the level.I found the game to be enjoyable.  IMO it is tactically more challenging with the added complexity of upgrades available and the more varying enemies attacking you.			"

												If you saw this and thought ""did Defense Grid make a sequel?"" you will be in for a disappointment.It has a similar art direction and thats it.The game is very ... lackluster at best. The missions and upgrades are run of the mill. THe maps are average at best. I didn't get a single map that I set things up on and went ""man this is awesome"".Most of the game suffers from the fact that it has one way to be played. If you like seeing if you can defeat it with different combos, you are going to be let down again.  Combine it with boring towers and really clunky controls, and you have this piece of trash. Its a shameless cash in on the Defense grid hype, avoid it.			"

												This game is actually pretty great so long as you let go of your expectations of what a tower defense should be.There is no pause, but this is to emphasize the tension of racing to get towers built in time.  It is kind of charming in an old-school way when you fail because you weren't fast enough.The first night I played this I got frustrated around level 9, but after thinking about and going back to it the next day I beat the level solidly.After beating the game, I even went back and beat all the levels on hard difficulty and without juggling.  So the game doesn't require juggling to beat.You MUST pay attention to what the towers are strong and weak againt.  Having a good variety of towers and upgrading a tower to transform it to be strong against the next wave helps immensely.For half-off or even 75% off as I've seen this game for now it is a good buy.

												One of the best Tower Defense games I have tried. It has great replayability, and you have to really focus to get through all levels. The further you get the harder the levels are. There are tons of different ways to make the enemy walk through the levels, and tons of different ways to take em out.I really don't understand why this game only gets 63/100 on Metacritic. I found it very very enjoyable. 10/10.			"

												2/10Compared to Defence Grid this is a severely lacking and low grad game. DONT spend money on this!AUDIO; all the audio is terrible, no audio story just thinly thought out text. BG music track and FX are both terrible and annoying, it's best to have this game mostly muted and play your own music to get through it.GRAPHICS;Fairly lame, low quality. Enemies look overly simple and not enough visual differances.Gun particles are serverly lacking, tesla and lasor are both a single 2D line, no electric effects to speak of. rocket explosions also suck.Design and Story;Almost none to mention for either category.Levels are also really limiting and lacking in what's nice to have in TD games.The balacing for levels is terrible, get past the first few waves and its fairly easy, strength numbers and composion are fairly the same for each level adn throughout a level.No variaty of game modes and reply value, I dont understand how any TD game could be soo bare in content, especially when sold for money!Just get Defence Grid and play free internet TD games for much more in depth and enjoyable game play.

												Being tasked to create a game that is the exact same as another game must be an unjolly life. Many EA employees are subject to such fates, and as Defense Technica showcases, Devolver Digital are no strangers to the concept.If you want ""a harder Defense Grid"", this might not be the worst choice.

												Big pile of meh. It tries too hard to copy Defense Grid, but without the story, or interesting AI voice, and without a decent difficulty too. Boy does Defense Technica's difficulty spike like crazy, with Defense Grid, there was checkpoints and you could hit backspace to go back to the last checkpoint in case you made tower placements mistakes, it was also a bit more forgiving in terms of tower effectiveness versus vertain enemies. With Technica? You're restarting the map, and you will be doing that, often.Treat this more like a Roguelike Tower Defense, because it's highly unlikely you'll finish a level on the first attempt, it's about experimenting with different placements and towers and upgrades until you get a combination that works. You NEED the best tower for each kind of enemy, because other turrets will barely scratch them.Personally I don't have the patience to do the same level a dozen times just to defeat it for the first time. A hard mode or custom game mode maybe, but not my first playthrough.			"

												Almost cool... but sadly, no.  I have attempted 3 times to write a review that didn't sound like me just ranting about the seemingly random level design with dumb pre-determined placements that you can't move or control, the silliness of the AI that has creeps ignoring clear paths to go through barriers for no reason that I can discern, or the crazy difficulty ramp that has you crushing hordes of weak enemies until suddenly a wave appears that is so strong all of your defenses together manage to almost deplete the shield on a single creep.  I can't seem to keep myself from ranting, see?It's fun for a while, but around level 10 it's just blah, more of the same, and not worth the frustration of spending 20 minutes carefully pruning all the possible paths down to a manageable few, only to have a sudden wave of ridiculously overpowered creeps saunter in and kill you without any possibility of winning.Worth it if you get it for really cheap, but only as a temporary diversion. Hope the second one is better, especially for the price they're asking for it.			"

												I'm a huge fan of tower defense games, this being one of the 2 categories in my Steam library that have no unplayed games.Defense Technica seemed to be a great game when I first saw it so I decided to give it a try. Gotta say I was really disappointed. The game has quite a few strong points that will surely raise your interest but somehow it still manages to change your initial opinion in a very short time. I really liked the artistic direction. Defense Technica has a very nice futuristic sci-fi look and feel to it that goes very well with the detailed graphics and the soundtrack. Unfortunately this impression is ruined by the level design. While some levels are great and allow you to plan your strategy and try multiple approaches, some are incredible badly designed. So, while on some levels the enemies seem to respect the level design, on some everything is chaotic. Enemies come on multiple paths that don't intersect, from the first wave, when you are very limited in resources and force you to use them all to block the extra paths (if you can, that is) and then rely on the default towers that tend to fail a lot. And as if this was not enough, sometimes enemies refuse to go on the designated path and they either take a different path that is unprotected of they keep attacking the tower that's blocking the way until they manage to go through. And if you think that's all, think again. Some levels are so badly designed that it's virtually impossible to plan something because the concept of strategy seems to vanish. There is only one approach, and you can only place the exact towers in the exact spot to succeed or you will get bored and frustrated trying, no matter how logical and right you think your choices are.  All these make Defense Technica incredible inconsistent. Some levels are very easy and some are very hard. Some levels can be finishes with 0% breakthrough rate while for some you will have to replay dozens of time until you get the strategy right. I really wanted to love this game for all its good parts, especially for the artistic direction and graphics but it turns out, as if we had to be reminded, that graphics aren't everything. I'm not even sure if I should give this game another try of ditch it right away, if I should upvote it or downvote it but what I know for sure is that if you like games like Defense Grid or Anomaly you should be aware if planning on playing this. Buy it only if you find it on a sale for $2 or so, otherwise it's not worth it.  5.5 / 10 potatoes from me.			"

												The early maps help you learn the game and they get more difficult as you go, making it more fun than the way it starts out.  There need to be more squares to place defense towers allowing the player to divert the bad guys into traps/mazes.    I bought it after the cube pickup thing, so I cannot comment on that, but it sounds distracting from the tower defense aspect.  I agree with many user posts that the zoom mode needs to be able to zoom out to view the entire map.  Positives:  Learning curve/difficulty progression is fine.Music is fine. Power core countdown and warning is a plus.NO bugs to report---I've seen too many early access and betas so, a finished game is kinda nice. ;) ;)Negatives:  Need more tower placement opportunities on the maps. -- Let us decide the route of the enemy.  It's as if we have to merely figure out what route the game developer wanted us to make.  This really limits the fun of the game and it destroys the ""replayablity"" of each map.  Zoom in/out is too limited in scope.I chose recommend, because I like tower def. games and I got it on a Steam Summer sale price.  If you can get it cheap, you'll get a few hours out of it.   If you have a choice, Defense Grid is way better.  I wouldn't pay the full $14.99,  If they had a steamworks mod ability to let users make maps, it may be more interesting and fun. "

												This is a pretty typical Tower defense. It's about what I'd expect from a $15 game. Although, there are a few things I'd change if I could. The game's sound track is basically one song on a loop. Before I had finished my first tutorial, i had gotten sick of the one song playing in the background. To be perfectly honest, the song led me to believe my sound card had driver issues. It was beyond repetetive.After playing a few matches, the game seems to have a persistant leveling system, which is nice. But the Interface leads me to believe the developers never intended it for PC. The mouse controls feel sluggish at best, and The tutorial help windows abruptly stop, despite introducing new towers regularly, leaving me to guess what my strategy should be. The level design seems to be the best thing about this game, as you can maze your towers to some degree, while still deciding what's most effecient with your customized towers.In summery:Soundtack: 1/10RPG elements: 7/10Voice acting: 0/10 (There isnt any)Controls 3/10 (I'd say one, but they atleast added mouse controls.)Story 1/10 (basically nonexistant, but thats a tower defense for you.)

												It just doesn't have a hook.While ""Technica"" is in the title, there's not a whole lot of ""technical"" to the game.  I can appreciate lack of MM (some TD games are designed this way), but it's usually supplemented with the option to do so or having MM applied during a paused wave - this has neither.It's a very basic TD game, with a standard rock-beats-paper-beats(etc) format.And while I understand there are always similarities between games, if you're going to LOOK like Defense Grid, don't have ""Defense"" in your title.  Ridiculous.Play DG2 or Gemcraft 2: Chasing Shadows if you want modern TD. This ain't it.			"

It seems someone forgot to include the pause and fast forward buttons. You must make every decision on the fly without a chance to strategize. This would be fine if most of the maps did not include a maze aspect to them! Don't waste your money, just as well burn it to keep warm in the upcoming winter months!			"

												I do not at ALL recommend buying this, it's not at all fun, very restrictive and hectic as hell. You have to manually collect resources all over the map and also at the same time try and build/plan out a defense, it's too much to micro at the same time. DO NOT BUY! Your cursor abilities are weak, and you feel rushed. There is no casual or easy difficulty.It seems highly built for use on a -pad of sorts, not at all optimized for PC.			"
