												Installs Apple products on your PC without asking....""Apple Application Support"" and ""QuickTime""Which are required to run this game.Of course, it installed it for me, which I did not want. I do not want crapware on my PC.And the game gave me QuickTime errors anyways at startup.So, I have never seen what the game looks like.I would advise you never to install this unless, of course, you love Apple crap.You already have iTunes or any other Apple products installed on your ""PC"".Then maybe you would not mind.I, and millions and millions of other people do NOT want Apple craps on our PCs.The game might be great. but I'll never know.Pros :I do not know.Cons:Apple auto installs on PC without asking.Min specs required does not state it required QuickTime.Rec Specs has an additional that says it does.Game does not ask if you want to install Apple crapware on your PC.I was wondering why it took some time to install this game.

												Shad’O:+/+ Unique setting and storytelling style.+/+ Unique use of FOW (fog of war) with towers allowing vision.+/+ Solid graphics, music, and sound effects for a TD.+/+ ‘Special battles’ that unlock rewards.+/+ Fun boss fights.+/- Very generic & limited tower options.+/- Upgrade choices are permanent.+/- Magic system requires you to actively collect mana.+/- Towers have health and can be killed (they can also be healed).-/- Lack of stats for levels limits replay value or the desire to perform well.-/- Only two difficulty options.  Shad’O is not hard enough.-/- Game can be beat using only 3-4 out of the 10 towers (with the last boss requiring only two towers to beat).-/- Voice Acting.-/- Requires you to download QuickTime or QT Lite in order to play.Verdict: 6/10.  The style is what stands out most in Shad’O as well as the few boss fights.  But it’s a very generic TD game and probably only worth a play through for hardcore TD fans desperate for anything new.

												I love tower defenses that is why I am so disappointed with this game. It's not a bad game but it lacks some basic features of any good TD, e.g. the ability for the player to change strategy or to get empowered from failure; indeed in this game should you fail a level, you have no choice but to redo it with your current set of upgrades and spells. There is no mean to upgrade unless succeeding levels, no mean to respec... Should you have made unadvised upgrade choices you are stuck with playing again – or abandoning the game – without feeling better equipped neither more ready since the game mechanics lack depth and the right strategy is always straightforward.Yet the gameplay is generally balanced, monsters are consistent with towers, towers do their jobs... But that's all. At the third (and last) upgrade level it's still just a stronger version of the basic tower; no additional ability, no new mechanics. Towers don't combo so don't expect more than legacy TD – which nowadays means shallow – gameplay, aside from the spells which are the only things that can occasionnaly be triggered in sequence to have a little more useful effect.On the graphics side there are pros and cons: 3D modeling, animations, fog effect are good, but 2D graphics (used to illustrate the side story) suck, and the overall color choice/association is poor, leaving a dirty brownish atmosphere. The game terribly lacked art direction.The side story (that serves as a theme, don't expect any meaningful connexion with the gameplay) is a drama about a little boy... again. So uninspired.The camera does not zoom out enough to allow for all the field to be seen and since there are usually more than one generators and monsters are hidden by the fog, good luck for knowing from which generator came those monsters you just heard spawning... because, no, in this 3D game the sound is not even spatially localised...Most one-man-made free Flash TD games allow for a better player experience & progression and deeper strategy, thus fun, than this game. There are many much better alternatives in free Flash games, and would you want to pay for a TD on Steam, go for real deals such as Kingdom Rush.Edit: I played once more after my review, unlocked the last 3 towers, to find there were uninteresting. Bored, I uninstalled the game. At first I wouldn't have said that this game doesn't deserve to be on Steam but now I would; it is a very shallow TD, eventually bad.			"

												Requires you to install quicktime, but doesn't work with current version. So if you already have quicktime you have to uninstall it and then install QTLite to get this game to run.If you actually need to have quicktime installed for something else to function (iTunes), QTLite will break that.Even GFWL games gave me less problems than this game.IF you can get it to run, it's a decent tower defense game.But I'd take Pixeljunk Monsters, Kingdom Rush, or even Super Sanctum TD over this, since you can actually just install those and have them work.

												Fun tower defense. Requires replaying some of the scenarios until the mobs' abilities are learned.Two minor cons are apparent: Quicktime installation is required and the poor English translation of a somewhat mediocre over-arching storyline detracts from the game slightly, however the basic concept of fighting inside one's nightmares is otherwise well executed and lends itself to interesting environments. - Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

And making a player to play twice (in nightmare mode 2nd time) to get a good ending? No, thank you. I've had enough. There are definitely better TD games out there.			"

												Quicktime? Quicktime is in the RECOMMENDED section, and yet the game will just exit if it's not installed. My ""problem"" with Quicktime is that I will never install that piece of crap. Then, the developers suggest QT Lite, which is weird at best after the devs pulled some shady stunt 4 years ago. Okugi : VLC supports Quicktime. If you are married to Quicktime, why not try to offer a free, open source alternative at least? Or offer the chance to skip the video in game?This is a mess. Shame though, the game doesn't look half bad.			"

												There are few games that I find myself unwilling and unable to complete. This is one of them. It has an interesting mechanic of territory control (pushing shadows back with your imaginary tower-friends), and it creates a nice sombre tone with its cut-scene art.However, it is ultimately a tower defense game that lacks player-friendliness and failed to have an impact on me. Skill points that you allocate are absolutely permanent. If you find yourself unhappy or unable to progress because of your skills, you'll have to restart the game from scratch to repick your skills. Further, winning battles leaves me unsatisfied, and I'm more irritated than distraught when I lose my units, little yellow plushies with no personality. The cut-scene art is nice, but the inexpert voice-acting can be grating if you pay attention to it.Lastly, installing this game means you have to install Quicktime as well. This is how the game plays its cutscenes. It's pointed out in the requirements (har har as if we read those), but if you have the same hate on Apple I've noticed in some Steam threads, then this is just icing on the ""Try something else"" cake. I only recommend this game to hardcore tower-defense game enthusiasts who enjoy skill-picking with no backtracking, and who do not listen to cut-scenes.			"

												This would be a real fun game, if it were playable. The devs really need to work on this and put out an effective patch with some good programming behind it to optimise performance. Without this the game is unplayable and will die, which would be a shame. The basic problem is that the mouse moves like a slug and destroys all enjoyment, replacing fun with frustration. It is a pretty game, but really not very high end and should not be experiencing these technical  probelms.  Compare it to defence grid for example. It's the sort of game that should work smothly on a basic android phone. .....and it needs quicktine - what?!!!Get it fixed guys and I will review it positively, as the game has potential.			"

												I am a fan of Tower Defense, and while Shad'O doesn't necessarily bring much new to the genre, it's a solid and extremely polished offering with a wonderful surreal setting, and great sound design.The way maps are shrouded in fog, which must be lifted by placing 'companions' (towers) allowing you to see and defend more of the map is an interesting approach, and makes for some pretty intense scenarios, where monsters move in and out of the safety of the fog.Fans of the genre should definitely check it out.

Posted: May 26, 2014
												First of all the part that interests most buyers of this game: how to get it running. I don't know if you have to perform all the steps I performed, but it the end thats the way it worked for me. The second screen you will see when starting the screen most likely will say something like ""an error has occured with quicktime. please follow these steps"" or something like that. after klicking OK you will be directed to a website, that tells you how to get the game running. there you also find a link to update your quicktime version. quicktime is automatically installed by steam before playing this game for the first time, but I did it anyway. I tried to start the game-still failing. For some reason (probably quicktime) I find out that I have apples auto updater. Since quicktime is from apple I figured I might as well try that. it installed Itunes and Icloud. I deactivated all apple products I then owned from starting automatically to not ruin my performance. Then I turned my computer off and on again and started the game. it actually worked for me then. I have Apples junk as well, but hey the game is running. my system is windows 7, maybe its different for others, I dont know anything about computers.To the game itself:Before reviewing I have to admit that I am a large fan of the TD genre, so this game might be less appealing to those who arent. the mechanics are those of a standard tower defense game. there is a given path the monsters travel accross and you place towers along this path. what is a bit different is the fact, that you can only place towers in illuminated areas. towers themselves illuminate the area around them and there is some starting points at the beginning of each level that are already illuminated for you. aside from the towers there is also a bunch of spells that do damage or freeze the enemies and things like that. you get ressources for spells by killing monsters and ressources for towers by a special type of tower that collects the ressources neccesary to build towers. to build these collectors you start with some ressources already. there is a limited number of collectors you can only build of course. another thing that is a little different about this game is, that there is a lot of enemies that, while passing them, hurt your towers, up to the point that they die and dissapear. the ""story"" is ok, since this genre of games usually doesnt have any the story here is pretty nice. the game is divided into 3 parts. in each part you unlock new towers to a total of 10. for a standard TD game thats pretty decent. when you complete a level you get the possibility to unlock the upgrade of a tower. this means you can upgrade these towers to this level in every round you play after unlocking. towers start at level 1 and go up to 3. this is not really anything special, a lot of TD games for example kingdom rush, actually have more upgrade-possibilitys. you can also unlock a spell after a level instea of an upgrade. there is around 10 spells I think and you have acces to unlocking all of them from the very beginning. at the end of each of the 3 parts of the game there is a battle against a gigantic boss. these battles are pretty nice. at the end of each normal level there is a boss as well, which is just a larger version of the monster introduced in that level with more health. ""introduced in that level?"" yes this means, that for the first 2 parts of the game there is a new kind of monster added in every level. what about the third part? well there is only 1 new monster for the entire third part. I think thats the games biggest weakness. you can replay every level except for minigames and bossbattles in a harder mode, meaning the monsters have more life. this way you can have more possibilites for unlocking towers and spells. I was actually doing every level a second time in the first part. of course with towers from the second part included because I went on before going back. in the second part I did not repeat this. the fact, that in the third part there is only one new monster added, makes it dull with a single sudden strike. with only the paths changing with each level you only want to get to the final boss and be over with the entire thing. sadly the final cutscene crashed for me , but I looked what it was on youtube. there I found out, that if you complete every single level in the harder mode you get an alternate end. With the third being as boring as it is I had no interest in doing so though. and noone else uploading content did so either. not a SINGLE vid of the alternate end can be found on all of the internet. I think that says a lot. I wasnt even interested in finishing the last minigame. minigames are levels that are optional and dont give you unlocking possibilites but small bonusses like reducing the cost of spells or giving your towers more life. the minigames are brutally hard as well, because you cant cast spells and the upgrades you unlocked dont matter in them. there is only 2 types of minigames: 1 where you have a level full of already placed towers and have to click them to activate them. the challenge here is that there can be only one tower active at a time. 2 where you get 3 cards: 2 that show very weak level one towers and 1 that shows a question mark. this question mark either gives you a very powerful tower, or (and that seems to be the case 2 out of 3 times) does something bad, like hurting of freezing your towers. I often felt that it is rather a question of luck rather then skill to complete thus type of minigame. there is one of each minigame in every one of the 3 parts of the game. TL:DR:Its a nice Towerdefense game without being anything really special. the looks are good the music is good, the story is ok. the types of towers and spells and monsters brings a nice variet to the battle. the third part of the game is extremely boring though. the game will make you want to keep playing, even the minigames and the harder modes, for the first 2 parts, no matter how much time you waste and how often you fail. the third part will bore you and make you want to get done with the bloody thing. all in all this game has flaws, but is one of the best generic TDs out there.

												Shad'O is a very nice tower defense game developed by a French gaming company. I'm about halfway through the game right now and I've found it to be very enjoyable. Controlling the friends of the young boy William, you need to fight back the darkness which has enveloped his memories. Graphically, this game is wonderful. The maps are dark, a little creepy, and at the same time accessible to younger players. The towers have a cartoony, quilted, stuffed animal look to them which fits very well into the overall theme. The gameplay is nice enough; the gimmick in this tower defense is that you can only build in areas from which the darkness has been driven, which limits your initial tower placement and makes tower placement very important. You can spread your towers out to try to reach more advantageous areas of the map, or clump them together for a more focused result. The spells available in the game are also interesting and varied; there are a few attack spells, spells to protect your tow			"

												Built into this bog-standard tower defense game is a great story of a young boy fighting to regain his memories. The dream world, where the action takes place, is moulded by William's experiences and reflects a mind shrouded in the dark fog of forgetfulness. All this is visualised using beautiful 3D graphics painted with the stark contrasts between colourful innocence of childhood and bleak grey of memory loss. The bland and boring tower defense mechanics are spiced up a little through special challenges that introduce new rules and gameplay elements, shame there are only 2 types of those. Overall a decent play if dosed appropriately, well recommended for the story and visuals.			"

It could have been fun if this Quicktime forced install crap wasn't there.Once I finally managed to make the game works, I had a frame rate of 15 (which drops lower with more enemies in screen).  Which make the game unplayable at best after level 10.Sorry but I could not appreciate that such a simple game works bad on a quad-core computer with 8GB of Ram and a 2GB DDR3 video card... sorry but all the ''beauty'' is so much frame skipped that its not fun at all.I'd bet the problem is all caused by apple BS quicktime crap ... NEVER install anything from apple on your PC and avoid all programs that need their♥♥♥♥♥♥- its ALWAYS THE SAME DYSFUNCTIONAL CRAP... Maybe the apple cultist virus (that turns your brain in some kind of stupid-drone consumer jelly) is contagious too (you never know).So, if you have a PC.. look elsewhere.  There are tons of tower defense games that will run fine without installing scrap on your computer.   And psst... most of them are under 6$.			"

												uhh hang on *pretends to muck about with a QuickTime reinstallation so I can play a god damn tower defense game* ok well i uhh played this game, and didn't just accidentally sit at the graphics settings popup for ten minutes while being distracted with other stuff, only to find I needed to reinstall QuickTime so this game can figure out what the towers look like or whatever. So, having played this game, which I've done (I've done the action of playing the game - I haven't done the game), I can say this: It offers graphics and some sound effects and uh there's a colored and dreamlike universe and also a captivating reahahhashahgfafha ah ah aha hahahahhahah  who gives a single godd­amn f­ucking s­hit about the lore of a f­ucking tower defense game ahahahahahasbashash ash ashahahhash asha sh ah ibg eihgbeh grwlha a fwqe   i qewfuhe esdguobersw im dying r ffffewrb  b "

												Shad’O isn’t a bad game, not by a long shot. It has everything you want from a tower defense. Plenty of various towers, plenty of various enemies to kill with said towers. It also has an interesting story-line and structure with some unique game elements. I just had two major issues with the game. The first was that the unique elements, while being thematically relevant, didn’t really add much to the gameplay itself, but only served as slight annoyances, hindering you in a way that other tower defenses don’t. This lead to my other issue with the game and is something I’m a little reluctant to complain about since it sounds whiny… but the game was hard.Admittedly, Shad’O was a bit of a disappointment for me as it was a good example of poor game design and ‘game features’ that took away from the game rather than adding. An interesting story was developing in front of me and I’ll probably never see the outcome as I can’t get past the first chapter.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/07/08/shado/ "

												Mediocre tower defence game. Just seems like you are going through the motions rather than having any kind of strategic effect. Probably wouldn't buy again.			"
