												This game is great for those people who like the overall planning of the original X-com but didn't like the slow pace of the battles. It takes the same experience and replaces those tactical battles with a space fighter sim. It's definately fun but it's  a bit of a departure from the rest of the series.If you are playing on a modern system(xp-recent) then there will be a game breaking bug for this game that will prevent research from completing. THERE IS A FIX FOR THIS and it is a must if you are gonna play it on a modern machine. The thread for it is here: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1722992 "

												I love this game and alway have. Sadly if you are playing on a relatively new machine there will be some game killing bugs. 1) alien data jammers can't be killed. If you try to engage them they just dont show up leaving u in space chasing a radar blip that you can never catch untill u get bored and retreat. Its a pain because they shut down your research and there is nothing you can do about it. 2) pirate bases have the same bug. You can't kill them so get ready to fight suicidal pirate fighter craft every 5 minutes. Not fun. If you have an old rig picking up dust somewhere the sure buy this game and enjoy because it really is a fantastic game. But if you don't then I'd pass.			"

												X-COM: Interceptor is different than most other XCOM games. Instead of being a turn-based ground combat game, it is an amazing real-time space combat game. Like most XCOM games, you have to manage resources, bases, and soldiers (or in this case, pilots). It isn't too well optimized for modern computers and I think the resolution has a maximum of somewhere around 1080x720, but it is still a great game.The best part, though, is that it isn't X-COM: Enforcer.

												If u like Xcom and/or flight sim games, then u will probably enjoy this. I thought it was pretty hard at first, but once I figured out how to play, I had a LOT of fun. I think this game is really underrated. It has all of the cool base management of Xcom, but then the battles are real-time flight sim. The campaign is awesome, and I also really like that there's a ""skirmish mode"" that u can create your own custom practice battle and jump right into the action and/or practice your fighting skills if needed. I definitely recommend! =)			"

												I hear so much hate for Interceptor, but it really is unique. I've never encountered an X-Wing style game where you also control the strategic side. After all those times you were hideously outgunned, or had completely the wrong warheads etc on X-Wing, TIE Fighter etc, it's nice to be able to do something about that. Now it's YOUR job to make sure your craft are up to spec. Also ties UFO, TFTD and Apoc together nicely, and hey its a great game in it's own right. Yes, it isn't the game everyone expected when a new X-Com game was announced back in 1997, but it's a worthy addition to the series.			"

-Quick Review-X-COM: Interceptor was the fourth game developed by MicroProse and released in 1998. MicroProse decided to the previous installments had too slow of combat so they decided to stick you into an spaceship instead of controlling units and moving them slowly turn by turn.Basically this has all the same base construction, slow paced strategy building, but instead of the strategy-game-element used in the battles they replaced those elements with a space ship simulator where you fly and shoot down enemy UFO's.-Detailed breakdown review-Story/NarrativeRemember how in the last game you were fighting to protect the plannet? And then you were forced to fight under water to protect the planet? Then you fought to protect one single city? I'm under the impression that we must have lost there too (because lets face it, X-COM is too hard core for most of the video game audience out there. Especially now-a-days)So now where do you go when you can't hide underwater, or in one city? You get the heck out of dodge and go to the moon. So welcome to *speaking in a deep narrators voice* X-COM in space! You must do your best to keep the aliens at bay by using your super powers of ocd fine tuning control!


Moar Space Combat Perspective!

			Since I can't get the Steam Overlay to work with this game, I can't upload screenshots, so I'll just upload artwork instead. This one was when I was attempting to take down an alien base/outpost/community/etc.		


GameplayGeneral Base controls:Most of the controls and mechanics in the previous two games are the same you have a crazy amount of base customability, ship/vehicle customization, freedom to choose where you want to construct new bases. The biggest features I noticed in this version is that there's actually a ""help wizard"" that pops up whenever you enter into a new window or UI you've not seen before. You can then toggle the wizard to give tool tips over each user interface portal (window) and button to help you learn what does what. (That's pretty big, seeing as the first two games didn't give you any explanation and assumed you had the paper manual that came with the game.The controls still feel very much like a 1990's game though, you can see they really were coming up with some clever ways to keep the game feeling fresh. Do remember that when I say ""controls"" I'm specifically talking about the controls and menu's you navigate in the base-view. Once you enter into flight combat that's a whole different ball game.Flight controls:Full disclaimer, I played this game on an older windows 7 laptop which has a habit of over heating, I also played with only a keyboard. In the past I could get away with that, because it was turn based. This time things got a bit more interesting.You can control the game with keys, and you can rebind them! But you turn WAY too sharp and you can't pull off any of the close shots you need to pull off in a flight simulator. But you can also aim with the mouse (or center red-didly-thing in my keyboard, or even the mouse pad) I learned to use a system of switching between the keys and the mouse pad to get some kind of ""flight simulator work flow"" going, which ended up working for me, at least slightly.

I'd highly suggest getting a joy stick or controller (if controllers are supported.... whichhhhh based on the steam store front it might not be. But it recognizes joy stick buttons, so there's that. If any of you out there still have one of those. I do.) The controls feel really good actually! I think this would be a pretty fun space ship flyer simulator. However I was having flashbacks to playing X-wing alliance, and TIE Fighter...

			Since I can't get the Steam Overlay to work with this game, I can't upload screenshots, so I'll just upload artwork instead. This image was taken after you finish a skirmish objective and you're finished with the area.		


So I had a look at some dates, and it seems that X-Wing was the first of the space fighter simulator series and was released in 1993, so it's possible there might have been some influence, but it seems the greatest influence came from a game I haven't played: Wing Commander, which has released games from 1990 based on space combat simulation. (looks like I've still got plenty of older games to try out and play, huh.)Problems:As always, older games have problems. I've seen several other reviews mentioning glitches with drones, I can't speak from experience about them because I never played the original game.  I can say the steam overlay wasn't working for me, and since I'm playing this on a windows 7 machine, that doesn't bode well at all. I also couldn't exit the game after starting a game. It felt like I was playing the game Hotel California, ""You can check-out any time you like, But you can never leave"".There ya go, a 1976 song for a 1993 released game. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go rant about woodstock and other dated references that make me sound older then I really am.Conclusion:All in all, I can see why this game gets mixed reviews. I could thumbs it up or down. As a reviewer it was nice to have a game that introduced something new to the series, however it's still very difficult to get into, even with the addition of a helper-wizard. Wizards does not magic make.I could see myself enjoying this game far more on my desktop computer because I like the idea of combining a strategy game AND a flight simulator. (the genre's seem to mix pretty well, in my opinion) There's a very good chance you'll probably pick this game up with an X-COM Game bundle deal. I think it's worth your time if you're looking to play something different. But the X-COM UFO Defense is the staple for the series, and the reboot X-COM: Enemy Unkown is the game which will bring in a new generation of X-COM fans.I'd suggest those other two games before this one.

It's X-COM but in SPACE!!!!!This game has not aged especially well from 1998 but it does have some charm left deep inside it's husk.  Changing up the formula after three terrestrial X-COM games, Interceptor takes the fight to the aliens.While the classic base building, research and soldier management are all present.
