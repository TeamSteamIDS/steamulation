												I saw this on sale for 99 cents and when a game is that cheap, unless the offends your ancestors in some deep and unforgivable way, you buy it. I, like many others on steam, bought this simply because it's this cheap. The 90% off sale is the ""we're not making any more money from this"" sale last ditch attempt to produce some revenue from a title.  Considering I haven't heard of this rather generic looking, what appears to be some sort of RTS game, I wasn't expecting much and I wasn't surprised in so many ways. Arena Wars 2 is a top down real-time strategy game that pits you against a player or an AI component in what is essentially a match of capture the flag. This is a ""first-impression"" review as I am honestly unwilling to put more than the hour and 20 minutes I put into this game. The gameplay is very mediocre and the units in the game are fairly uninspired. The game seems to be a ""rock paper scissors"" game in the sense that one unit is clearly designed to defeat another particular unit. Unfortunately this concept I felt was implented poorly as one unit will do more damage to another unit seemingly abritrarily and it lacks the thougthfulness of a mature RTS game. There is no tutorial or any intro missions to introduce each of the mechanics so the player is thrown in to engage in a trail and error process of figuring everything out. To this game's merit, I do like the idea. This game is designed to get he player in the action right away and matches will end quickly whereas a full RTS game might include 2 hours of base-building prior to any combat. A match or two of this game could be played on a lunch break.This game is an online game but seeing how this game doesn't have a consistent playerbase this is effectively a single player game. There are several difficulty levels and in my first hour and 20 minutes it took getting to the hardest difficulty level to experience any sort of challenge. One very annoying aspect is that these difficulty levels need to be unlocked *per level* and there are five of them. This means that for each level I want to play on, I need to suffer through four matches of boring before I get to the very average gameplay.I noticed a bug where an area-of-effect ability hits the wreck of a tower it will register damage and repeat ""Turret destroyed"" - there may be more bugs but finding this so readily underlines this game's overall lack of polish.The idea has some merit but I cannot recommend this title for any price. The real cost of a game your own freetime anyway.Score 4/10			"

												Three strikes ANNNNNDDDD...it's out.1)  Nobody plays this game so If you don't have friends that play this game you won't find anyone to play against.  2)  The single player ""campaign"" is horrible, the computer AI is really exploitable and it's just really boring.3)  It doesn't work for a lot of people and the dev doesn't support the title anymore so you are pretty much on your own on getting it to run.

												Great game.... (IF)... you have friends... and (IF) it's on sale....otherwise it gets really boring playing against bots.. so if you get this game on sale.. buy two copies and gift one =D just a bit of extra money for so much more fun (applies to all games)... sometimes buying a game you already have, to gift to a good friend, can be more fun than buying a new game for yourself =D. i have to admit tho that it's system for playing with friends is a bit querky, you can't create a match for 1v1 and invite your friend. you join a queue like a quickmatch and not many people play the game like that so you should be matched to your friend.... but you can inv your friend to a 2v2 quick match queue to play with him against 2 other people.. if more than 2 people actually join queue at one time.

												While the singleplayer side of things seems dim and underdeveloped the multiplayer with friends is a huge blast. 1v1 can bring 2 hour wars of attrition or quick sweeps with rush builds that either get crushed with well-thought defense placements or heavy investment for the countering unit(s). Many people are bashing this game for the lack of depth and while the game certainly does lack depth, it can teach a deep appreciation for rts games with it's handful of interesting mechanics to even someone like me who has never touched many rts. If a single dollar can teach me the basics of an rts and build appreciation for more polished games like Starcraft and Red Alert, I'd say that's a dollar damn well spent.			"

												This game is awful. The camera is shaky and zoomed in way too far. Items are overpowered. Scoring system is terrible. Units are awkward to control and you can't have too many out at once. Maps are small and encourage placing units at item spawns to win the game that way. Unit abilities only work 50% of the time. Calling precision air strikes at the start of the match is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanic. Payed 49 cents for the game. Normally i dont care for such a low cost but i kind of want my money back at this point.			"

												5/10 ""Mediocre""Arena Wars 2 is a bare-bone strategy game, and can obviously be seen at first glance. The game offers little strategic involvement as spamming units over and over is an easy task in this game. Games only last about ten minutes and can be quite boring at times. Graphical wise, the game isn't that pleasing the eyes, but does have good explosion effects I will give it that. Overall it shouldn't be purchased at full price, I got it for .99 cents and gotr my moneys worth out of it, but make sure you have a friend with it if you do buy it! BECAUSE NO ONE PLAYS IT.			"

												For every ten or so big releases which disappoint, there’s a relatively small-scale title that comes along and surprises everybody by being pretty good. Arena Wars 2 fits nicely into this category. Fast paced RTS that puts you straight into the action, no mineral collecting to slow the game down. It really is a joy to play a game that hasn't been done what can seem like hundreds of times.  "

												I get where they are coming from when it comes to trying to make an arena based strategy game. If you like pulling apart arena games and enjoy trying new ones now and then. (Yikes I know you have invested so much time learning the current ones).On the plus side after playing with the settings I was able to try this game I grabbed in a sale some time ago for 99c.What I liked: * Control over the entire battlefield* Ability to mix and match units when you need to.* Upgrading to your unit strategy. Though the towers lend themselves to only a few winning strats.What I was not so keen on:* Farming power ups and XP on the sides took away some of the promise of ""Fast Paced"" promise. * Generator concusion blast is too strong. Something that does less damage would be fine, or at least draw out the concussion line around the base so defenses can be set accordingly. * Unit roles are not diverse enough to stop what would inevitably be a battle of attrition. (Whoever upgrades the Destroyers first will take out the turrets and eventually win)* No creeps do make the game seem ""Quiet"" now and then unless you are taking the action to the other player. "

												Well, I bought it for $.099, and it seemed nice in the screenshots and videos. I also read a couple of positive reviews.When I first launched the game, the intro videos and menu were very sluggish, so I checked the video option and lowered the resolution. Guess what? That didn't help at all, it was still sluggish.I continued to start a game, and here I was lost. There is no indication on how to play this, no objectives, no tutorial or gameplay guide. You have to figure out what every UI element, unit and building does. When I finally figured out how to start, well the game is not fun. After two or three rounds I was bored. And of course, the game was sluggish during gameplay as it was in the game menu, no matter what resolution I chose.The UI is horrible, too big and no way to scale it down. There's no way to zoom out the map, you only see a small portion of it. I found no way to center the screen on a unit or group of units, or to have the camera follow the units.I regret I bought this game, even if it was only $.099.			"

There are multiple maps and multiple difficulty levels for AI to keep you busy for a while. There is an online mode which can be tricky to find players on. Also there is not a 2 Human vs 2 AI mode to practice in but there is 2v2 Online Multplayer. If you can get players online then it is a fun and unique experience.

												don't buy this game. not even if you're life depended on it. it has terrible graphics and and.... the only thing you do is to build some robots and click on the enemy robots to kill them. it has a goal system which includes you getting the 3 cylinders from the enemy ""something"" and taking back to your ""something"". and that's it.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!score: -10 out of 10			"

												You have few money to spend on a videogame? You have friends on Steam? Buy this game. The money is worth it, trust me.Arena wars 2 is not as beautiful as a game like Starcraft 2, but it's an incredible mix of fun and skill (online playing, AI is not that good...).It's cheap, it's fun, it's perfect to play with friends. What else?			"

												Got it for a dollar and it's well worth the buck.  Unfortunately it's not worth much more than that.  Has great graphics, UI, and physics.  Where it's lacking is in gameplay.  It's extremely basic.  Probably great for a little kid, it's not for adults.  If they marketed it that way it would be better.  I love the capture the flag element to the game.  Hate flag auto returns though even in FPS CTF I hated auto returns.  Game could be so much better and sell more if they put more work into making it more strategic, allowing more units on the field (units cost much less).  Then you'd have a really good game because the CTF aspect is really great.  The different power ups are nice but they rarely help a lot.  Would be nice to see more power ups and ways to get them.  For the cost... can't complain just a little disappointing that this game has so much potential that isn't being developed.			"

												AI pathfinding is bad.  it may not be fair to compare this game with other RTS games like Starcraft 2.  But controlling your units is so much more natural in SC2, that it makes this game feel obsolete - which is weird because SC2 came out in 2010 and Arena Wars 2 is newer.  Too bad they did not implement some of the gameplay and control ideas.the game did not hold interest very long.  but for $1, might as well check it out.  not a big loss if you dont like it.			"

												Well, I bought it for $0.79, and it seemed nice in the screenshots and videos. I also read a couple of positive reviews.When I first launched the game, the intro videos and menu were very sluggish, so I checked the video option and lowered the resolution. Guess what? That didn't help at all, it was still sluggish.I continued to start a game, and here I was lost. There is no indication on how to play this, no objectives, no tutorial or gameplay guide. You have to figure out what every UI element, unit and building does. When I finally figured out how to start, well the game is not fun. After two or three rounds I was bored. And of course, the game was sluggish during gameplay as it was in the game menu, no matter what resolution I chose.The UI is horrible, too big and no way to scale it down. There's no way to zoom out the map, you only see a small portion of it. I found no way to center the screen on a unit or group of units, or to have the camera follow the units.I regret I bought this game, even if it was only $0.79			"

												One of the first steam games I picked up. It kept me entertained for about.... an hour. Its essentially a 1 player lane game. If your looking for something to occupy a little time, go for it, but otherwise I'd save the money/time for something else. I've pretty much stopped playing it after my third or fourth steam game.

												Meh, total waste of money.My friend bought me that game cause it was cheap and looked good. I bought another cheap game on sale worth like that one - Braid - that's another story, perfect game.So back to this game - Camera is bad, can't get to the menu, I think other words are useless.			"

												This game is......boring. The sound doesnt work for me and the gameplay is repetative and ectremely boring. You can only play against a novice opponent for god knows how long. I would not reccomend this game unless you like rtsish games and have only 99 cents			"

												Well, I bought it for $0.79, and it seemed nice in the screenshots and videos. I also read a couple of positive reviews.When I first launched the game, the intro videos and menu were very sluggish, so I checked the video option and lowered the resolution. Guess what? That didn't help at all, it was still sluggish.I continued to start a game, and here I was lost. There is no indication on how to play this, no objectives, no tutorial or gameplay guide. You have to figure out what every UI element, unit and building does. When I finally figured out how to start, well the game is not fun. After two or three rounds I was bored. And of course, the game was sluggish during gameplay as it was in the game menu, no matter what resolution I chose.The UI is horrible, too big and no way to scale it down. There's no way to zoom out the map, you only see a small portion of it. I found no way to center the screen on a unit or group of units, or to have the camera follow the units.I regret I bought this game, even if it was only $0.79			"

												Game runs like a turd even on a good rig. Gameplay is the shallowest kind of rts you can imagine with a taste of dota in there, multiplayer is nonexistent and singleplayer is so bad that you wish it was nonexistent. it's like a minigame you'd play in a far better game as a distraction. I wanted to give this game a chance, so I waited until I upgraded my computer to try it again. Turns out that this did nothing to help. No recommendation here. Just shame.			"

												I played for half an hour and I couldn't put up with anymore.  SO very lame, so very uninteresting.  Stick with Dawn of War 1 if you want a good strategy game - this could just not hold my attention.  I was thoroughly bored.			"
