												This game is just bad. Not bad as in buggy,  or unfinished. Bad as in, just not fun, and down right boring. Although, it does have its share of bugs. I wasnt able to run it fullscreen without having the UI stop responding, and just to play the game single player, you have to create an online account that you log in with every time (just annoying).You spend most of the game looking at your ships as little blue dots, not actual ship graphics. You have to zoom in to an unplayable level to even see your ships graphics. And combat is a snore fest. Even basic frigates last forever, even with 20 enemies blasting them. Takes forever for any ships to die.  Im ok with the bad voice acting, and mediocre graphics because the game is an indie game, but the rest of the game is just unacceptable as something I would play when Im looking to have fun.			"

												This game feels like it is still in beta with all the glitches.Pros:    Good concept. I enjoy how quickly bases can be built if you have the resources which makes comebacks not entirely out of the picture. Easy to pick up.Cons:    Ships will shake violently when trying to move and sometimes won't even move when part of a large selected group. AI is horrible for skirmishes. I played a skirmish where the AI player sent its starting construction ship to where I was building my fleet about 5 minutes into the game and it was destroyed easily ending the game.    Gameplay mostly involves waiting around for resources and ships to build up while the AI does nothing to stop you and then easily winning, but if you move into their space too early they send massivly overpowered waves to crush you.    Full of glitches that simply freeze the game and make you have to re-launch. Research points are hard to come by at first, but then there isn't enough to research and you have an abundance of unuseable points.If you can deal with all that is wrong with this game or if any patches come out to fix the many problems, then this is a decent game.

												I'd like to post a review, but I can't play it. Apparently, a very common problem with this game is that it won't let you register the CD-key. You have to register an account with the developer (even if you just wanna try the single player campaign), and the registration system is broken. It seems you can fix it by contacting support by email, but let's be honest: If you can't even get past the main menu without contacting support because of a bug that is still around after more than two years, is it really worth the effort? I think not.TL;DRThis is broken. Don't waste your money.			"

												First off this game is not a top notch AAA title and treat as such.  When it was first released it had bugs and save game issues.  I waited much later to buy in a indie bundle and couldn't go wrong.  If you like Sins of the Solar Empire but with an actual campaign this game is good.  The user interface takes some getting used to and could be optimized better to control your planets and territories but for a cheap and enjoyable game it's alright.  Game seems stable now and I'm on 8th mission.  If you get be sure to catch it in a indie special or steam sale.  Wouldn't suggest paying full price.			"

												This game is extremely glitchy. Coming from someone who grew up playing Sins of A Solar Empire, Gemini Wars is essentially the same thing, with less smoother combat, and extremely unresponsive UI controls. In addition, the graphical design of the spaceships and buildings themselves are clearly composed of simple polygons and geometric vectors. I feel that this game is far from what description and videos say it is.If you want a good space RTS game, this is definitely not the game to get. If anything, Sins of A Solar Empire is infinitely better.			"

												Have you played great space games like Endless Space or Sins of a Solar Empire? Looking for another space game to help you get your epic sci-fi fix? Perhaps you are looking for a nice space game to give to your friends or family as a gift. Well DON'T look here. Simple and sweet, this game is a cash cow whose sole function is to con unsuspecting consumers looking for good space games out of their hard-earned money. I have never seen a game with so little redeeming qualities before i was burden with this game's prescence. Firstly, this game has all of the major mechanics of Sins of a Solar Empire, but it fails to take any of its finess. I literally couldn't care less about either of the factions if I tried. The game's interface was complex to the point that it gets in the way of the gameplay. there was very little unit and defense diversity and even that was plagued with rediculous prerequisite and resource costs. What I'm trying to say is that this game is a waste of everyone's time. But then again, that is what cash cows are meant to do: Steal away your precious money and time			"

Steam I've said it before, product keys from 3rd parties don't work, stop endorcing them. when you buy a game digitaly there is no point and really no need for product keys unless its a gift for a freind. Why because digital accounts keep all your purchauses in a library to play, delete, and reinstall at any time and for a pc user that is the whole point due to hard drive space.  A static key should only be used once to downlaod the game if bought in a store as a hard item not when bought and downloaded digitaly.

												So i had around 40 hours in this game, it is not good it is not bad either. Missions lack in challenge, they are mostly the same, protect this,  defeat that. The later part where the aliens apears was slightly better but i wish game is longer, more ship classes and details. However for people who like this kind of game its okay. Graphics, could be better, much better. Would i recommend this game?Game recieved many negative reviews,and mostly because it didnt deserve positive ones, for the current price of 14,99EUR i wouldnt recommend this game. If you find it on sale, for cheap, try it, you wont lost anything except few hours of your life. I would give positive on this one since i did had fun in skirmish with this game, and because i love some of the ship designs. Otherwise if there is neutral button i would hit instead.

Product received for free
												Once every few years, you find a game that shines in utter brilliance as the quality of the graphics reel you in, the story enchants you to remain and the mechanics never leave your mind bored as it furtively guesses at the beatiful chaos that you've immersed yourself in. This is not that game.Did you know that if you shaved the rear of a bulldog and taught it to walk backwards, it would look better than the graphics of this game? Wagging tail and a single ""eye"" staring at you from that lovely bulldog is preferable.But the mechanics you might ask? I'm a fat asian kid, and I would rather go outside and play basketball BY MYSELF than play this game. Hot tropical sun and laughing crowd of onlookers jeering at my solitude and wiggling flabs whilst I feebly attempt to chase the ball around and tripping? I'd take that one please, anything but this game.Oh, but the plot, you ask? I have seen 4-minute long lesbian porn videos with better plot than this. The 4-minute video didn't even try, it knew it wouldn't have any semblance of plot. But guess what? It won over this game.And don't even get me started on the voice actor. My ears have never felt more affronted than listening to the nasal gurgling of a 12 year old kid without a pop filter as it attempted to make coherent sounds.But hey! You get this thing for free in a bundle every Steam Sale! Remind you of anything? Like Ask Toolbar and all that other crap bundled in when you install something? Yep. It's a little piece of garnish to blow up your Steam library game count so you can stroke your epeen. Go on and buy it, your epeen is hungry.			"

												On Mission 11, got problems with this mission. When reloading a save game file, your colony which you have colonised will vanish so your ship limit goes down the toilet. So you can't build any more ships. Also definitely some sort of problem with the programming side of things as the ship limit numbers are not right. I barely have any ships and the game is registering I have 160 odd spots taken. Weird. Playing on a Mac. The Al in this game is screwed. Basically they outnumber you 5 to 1 a lot of the times. Also their ships are a lot more powerful than yours sometimes. The programming is not very good as the game slows down a lot. Interface for the Mac not well implemented and thought out. I'll see if I can finish Mission 11 with all the programming bugs, if not I'll delete the game and send it to the trash. Rating 5/10 till Mission 10. 2/10 for Mission 11. Campaign is a linear kind one.			"

												Very basic game for a 4x RTS. Way too basic.The User interface is clunky at best. Theres no way to build units from a base structure except by zooming in to said structure and building it. Takes precious time, and is difficult to do if the building is surrounded by swarms of your own ships. No shortcut to select it, no empire tree or similar manager.No hotkeys whatsoever and no settings for controls.This is in space. SPACE. Despite that, unit maneuver are severely limited since there seem to be only two levels they can fly in. They cannot really fly over each other. Yes, this means that in a space game, you're restricted to x-y movement. No z-axis movement. It is odd to see that cruiser class ships are able to turn around on a dime in a short span of time... then not be able to move becuase of his two wingmen. Then all three of them try to figure out how to move for the next 30 seconds straight. Ship models are basically bricks with different lengths and very low detail. From what I've seen so far, most ships do not even have more than one weapon system (ie all the firepower from a destroyer comes from a SINGLE cannon).Everything in the game screams overly simplistic. From the combat mechanics to the resource mechanics, to the user interface and the graphics (I'm usually not too concerned about graphics if the game is good, but on max graphics, weapon projectiles are VERY low resolution TEXTURES. COME ON. Homeworld 1 in 1998 had better projectiles with higher resolutions. For the Homeworld fans: One of the projectiles looks exactly like an energy weapon projectile from Homeworld Cataclysm, but lower resolution. This is 2012, not 1998).As a long time fan of Homeworld, Sins of a Solar Empire and the space RTS genre in general, I cannot really recommend this game unless you enter with rock bottom expectations. Anything higher and you will be dissappointed. I didn't even have any expectations and then it disappointed me.Risk it only if its on sale. Thats luckily how I got it, so it wasn't too much of a waste.PS: The metacritic score for this game is 53. There's a reason for that, too bad I didn't listen.			"

												Blech. If I already have to log in to Steam, you are sufficiently protected. Making me create a NEW login just reveals how bad your game is. Do not buy, this pile of crap is terrible.			"

												This is not a game, this is a chore. So buggy that contacting support is the only way to get it functioning. notice I stay away from the word ""playing"", because ""playing"" infers the idea of having fun. You sit high above where the actual action is taking place, so much so that Zoolander would bust in and loudly ask if this was a game for ants. sure you can scroll in, but what's the point? when there is combat, it's a snooze fest. My biggest issue running the game was the difficulty settings. I was new and i tried on easy. apparently ""easy"" means that the A.I. is going to take a giant crap on you as you try to get your fleet launched. the A.I. is broken. The game is buggy. Customer support REQUIRED to get playing. Oh, on a side note, don't expect customer support to even be polite to you! Apparently they are getting tired of customers asking for...support. They will show this by being impolite and directly insulting you (calling ""stupid"" for instance, which was in my case)this game isn't worth 5 dollars when it's on sale, it's not worth 1 dollar, it's not worth one penny. It's worthless. It sure as HELL isn't worth 15 dollars that some crap indie company is trying to extort out of people. no bug fixes in two years. They gave up long ago, why should anyone bother?			"

												I was excited when I saw that this game was available for Mac on Steam, but once again a game that my computer clearly meets the requirments for, fails to work on Steam. This is extremely frustrating after paying for and installing the game only to find that it freezes once I start it. On top of that, contacting Steam support is completely useless... Kinda feeled like I got screwed on this.			"

												Not very good quality. The controls are clunky, the graphics are blocky. It just seems like a dumbed down version of Sins of a Solar Empire. Overall it's about the quality of a early 2000's pc game. But you get what you pay for (-$5.00) If you want a casual game with no depth or enjoyment, this cheap game is for you!			"

												At first look the game looks promising - the trailer certainly made it look worth a go at the offer price. The game itself seemed very unstable for me, I had to keep deleting a registry key just to get it to run and when it did I would occasionally be faced with a crash. When playing the game between crashes I found even on easy skirmish that it was difficult to build any kind of defence before I was attacked in full force and wiped out. The control system was difficult to deal with when managing multiple ships. I think it needs more development, especially on the stability side. Am running it on a Core i5 which handles the likes of skyrim at high graphic setting without crashing so I don't think it is so much a hardware compatibility issue.			"

												The difficulty curve reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics. Its possible, but it requires luck and perfect timing to get past some missions. There is also no shield recharging, once a ship's shields are depleted they'll never be shielded again. And you cannot repair bases. Your mining base loses shields and drops past 50% hp? It cannot be fixed. You must scuttle it and rebuild. The difficulty I could handle, but the inability to repair crucial things made me uninstall.			"

												Don't be fooled by the screenshots on the store page, the game looks barely anything like it.I didn't find it to be buggy, but i found it to be quite boring. This is the kind of stuff you'd expect a bunch of people trying to get into video game development and decide to make a proof-of-concept alpha for a publisher. I'm surprised i even got an hour of gameplay on it. I'd strongly advise not to buy it.			"
