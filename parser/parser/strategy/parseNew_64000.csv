												Men of War Assault Squad is the best WW2 real-time tactics game! I've been following this game series ever since the original 'Soldiers Heroes of WW2'. When I tried the demo back then, and realized that you can take the shells out of your broken tank to load a stolen anti-tank gun, and you can scavenge the fallen bodies for weapons and ammunition, and you can take cover behind virtually everything, and you can drive tanks through buldings, I was immediately sold. This amazing level of detail and authenticity is still present today, and it brings an immense level of control and different tactics that you can use. That comes at the expense of very much micromanagement and almost every key on the keyboard being assigned to some action. That makes it hard for newcomers to pick up, but once you memorized everything, you're going to have a blast. The multiplayer component is a bit shaky, because it uses an old GameSpy service. That's why I have very high hopes for the upcoming Assault Squad 2, which promises to have full Steam MP integration. The developers have been listening to the community a lot and have published several free updates with lots of new content, so I trust them on this one.			"

												Im on the back foot...Enemy infantry made it past my front line, a situation that comprimises my whole team, I purchase and sent out a Half-Track with mounted .50 caliber heavy machine gun to clear them up..  however on the way an the debries from a building hit by artilery hits happens to hit and take out the gunner..  Time for a bit of fast micro..  Upon reaching the area the enemy was last spotted there is no sign of them, they have likely scattered into various cover (all units in a squad can be indivudually controlled in fine detail or directly controlled) ..  I spot an enemy half track! The hole in my front line is bigger than I thought. I decide to play rambo with my driver, I dismount, detatch the .50 cal gun from it with my driver and take some TNT from the back. I command my soldier to only return fire preventing him from opening fire and giving away his location, I tell him to get down on the ground and crawl to a nearby bush. I know my empty half track presents an irristable target for the enemy to steal... the bait and trap set,  I switch my attention to re-enforcing my front lines, perhaps a sniper to spot and an AT-gun patch up the line, cant afford more infantry yet, I spread my lines a little thinner.I spot the red dots in my backline on my mini map, lucky I caught it!  Switching back to Rambo in time to see the enemy attempt to jack my halftrack. I put him in direct contrtol more, and take my time aiming a perfect shot at the enemy half track approaching, some men already disembarking and running for my bait..  FIRE.. ♥♥♥♥♥♥I mis-judged the distance! He's far enough away that my trusty .50 Cal cannot penetrate his armour, backup plan, I aim for his tracks as he turns to escape.. come on.. yes! I manage to break the track off the left side, disabling his movement. A man hops out to begin repairs...  I put a .50 Cal in his skull.. he won't try that again. I mow down enemy infantry spotted until I've run out of bullets. I switch to my pistol, move into an impact crator recently created, there I hide hoping to find an oppertunity to use the TNT to maximise damage. Rambo has played his part... but all the while I have been equally creative with any of the hundred odd units on the field....			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad is a real time tactical/strategy game that takes place in all fronts in World War II. The game is different from other World War II strategy games that relies on direct control (having the ability to actually control a unit), tank realism, and individual micromanagement. The game requires a strong ability of militaristic tactics such as flaking, taking cover, support, and other attributes. Assault Squad is a terrific strategy game in its own merits, but a few flaws might make you consider to get this game or not.One of the most greatest parts in the game is the importance of tanks. I reallly mean it. Obviously, tanks can shoot infantry and blow up things. In Assault Squad, tanks is, without a doubt, the main essential to victory. Nearly the majority of ""skirmishes"" requires the player to push and capture 10 control points. It is possible to take 10 control points with only infantry and support classes, but it will be very, very difficult to substain the enemy AI's counterattacks with medium and heavy tanks that will crush your forces. Tank damages is top notch and highly realistic. Assault Squad can be explained in one sentence: Infantry is the soul of your forces, but tanks is the body to move your forces to win. Another positive attribute is its immersion. The environment looks good for a 2011 game. It's not the best looking game in today's standards, but it does look pretty neat to look at. Most strategy games have a limit cap on how many units you can have, but Assault Squad does not have such cap. It's not unlimited, but you can have a lot of units under your command. Lastly, the direct control mode is really helpful when your squad cannot take out a certain position. It'll relieve you some stress in dire situations and turn these situations into your advantage. There are some flaws in Assault Squad. One of the major problems is the AI, the enemy and your forces. The enemy AI is not stupid, but it can be very frustrating and, occasionally, exploitive. The problem is that the AI would send in two medium and one heavy tanks and 20+ infantry every two minutes as reinforcement. Sure, it does not sound that bad, but Assault Squad requires the player to be ""aggressive"". You can take a capture point, one at a time, and just hold your position until the enemy stops (or slows) their counterattack against you before you can start taking another control point. However, this will only increase stress. The enemy AI is really, I mean really, smart on targeting the weak spots on your tanks. Prepare to get upset when the enemy destroys most of your tanks in one or two shots. In the other hand, your tanks is not very smart. They tend to show its sides to the enemy, saying: ""Hey enemy, shoot me in the back. I'm open"". Basically, the tank AI is not very smart. Another flaw in Assault Squad is punishing difficulty. There are four difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Heroic. The problem is that Normal Mode is not normal at all. Normal mode is really difficult for moderate players who have a decent amount of playing other RTS or standard strategy games. Hard mode requires very aggressive gameplay mechanics, but Heroic is the impossible. Literally impossible. The difficult gap is very wide and the enemy AI enjoys throwing very tough enemy units to rout your forces and probably requires you to conduct unorthodox methods to win. Assault Squad has no mission varieties besides of capturing 10 control points missions and standard defense missions (then control 3 enemy positions). Basically, no mission varieties. Unfortunately, the multiplayer in this game is dead because of GameSpy ceaes to exist so I wasn't able to play multiplayer to get the experience. The flaws in the game sounds very discouraging, but it's not a turn off. Assault Squad is a fine tactical strategy game and relies on strategic thinking and tactical methods. Men of War is not your standard strategy game and will appeal to certain audience within the strategy game community. Do I recommend this game to other strategy players? Yes, if you only play single player since multiplayer died. If you are looking for multiplayer, then you can get the sequel, Men Of War: Assault Squad 2 instead. It is best to only get the game when it is on -75% off, nothing else since the community in the first Assault Squad barely exist.			"

												If you have played World of Tanks, Battlefield, Company of Heroes and Call of Duty... you're gonna like dis.Because:If you like World of Tanks, you can have realistic tank battles with penetration, armor angling and nobody will call you noob if you use gold (apcr) rounds! :D Plus, Tiger actually has armor here! PLUS, here you can see what would have happened of WoT had infantry!If you like Battlefield, you can capture objectives and receive reinforcements! You can fly a plane, drive a car, shoot a bazooka, shoot a rifle, have classes, custom gear, kill cows and get a FULLY destructible environment! Yup! All buildings can go down! F*ck tickets... KILL THEM ALL!If you like Company of Heroes, you can control people just like in a RTS game! Squad control, tank control, Hold Fire, Fire at Will, Artillery strike, Cars, Smoke grenades, AT infantry, Snipers, Take Cover (specific! :D)... and you can HIDE FROM ENEMIES! :DIf you like Call of Duty, worry not my friend! Yes, you can enable direct control if you think that your idiot can't shoot properly (Which is a very annoying thing in some RTS games)! Exactly, now you can ""Be"" him and rush in guns blazing just like in CoD! Just take a Machine Gun, enable direct control, rotate the camera so you can see things in front of you and BOOM! You have an Action Shooter!1337/10 - ""Would kill Nazis and take their hats again."" - IGN			"

												**5/18/14 Update**It is reality, Gamespy will be shutting down as of May 31, 2014, When Gamespy shuts down, MP for Men of war , other than AS2 , will be dead. People mention 3rd party programs you can use for matchmaking after the shut down. That is not practical as those 3rd party programs won't be as safe. The issue has been brought up, why not just use Steamworks for MP? That's a very valid question, the reality of the situation is, the company that makes this, is lazy, and would rather force everyone to buy their new game. Truly unfortunate because Assault Squad 1 is one of my favourite strategy games of all time, heck, even one of my most favourite games of all time. To see a company do this when they had the chance to show they support their community and their games, is truly unfortunate. Who is to say they won't do the same thing to AS2 in a few months?**4/8/14 Update to Review**Recently announced, Men of War: Assault Squad, will not be playable in multiplayer after May 31st 2014, the game creator is ending it's steam support for MOWAS, aswell as the earlier versions of the series. Their explination seems to stem from ""We're unable to provide support, but, you can purchase Men of War: Assault Squad 2, and it will be fine"" , that in itself seems fishy, but overall I leave people's interpretation of that move up to them. The game review still stands, tis a great and fun game, but all in all, the company's descision to end multiplayer essentially kills the game unless you're willing to risk using a 3rd party software for MP. Telling your customers to simply ""Purchase the new game"" instead of continuing support of your recent products, is an unfortaunte situation for everyone that enjoys MOWAS1 , so buyers beware. If the company comes out with a new game in a year that's based on the Men of War series, you could be looking at this happening again. I personally am retiring from the Men of War series over this move. Very, VERY toxic business move.A very, very in depth RTS that is more historically accurate and well put together than games of the same Genre (IE Company of autists) , You will not be dissappointed if you're looking for a quality, well made RTS based around WW2 with a few extra easter eggs thrown in. (Christmas mission to defend against the grinch, ect.) Not for those new to RTS's but it does have a tutorial that will show you the ropes. Multiplayer can be a challenge as there are several instances of a little lag, and others not speaking english, other than that, MP offers 1 on 1 up to 8 on 8 matches where you can lay down some serious hurt. Squads can be broken up into 1 man detachments or anything in beetween, different level of infantry can mean the difference beetween conscripts equipped with pea shooters to elite troops with body armor and assault rifles and are fully trained. Vehicles and artillery can range from a simple machine gun or jeep, to a 60 ton late war tank or heavy artillery, how you field your army is up to you , use them wisely!			"

												     This game is an amazing game. It has hundreds of hours of play value between the Campaign missions and the Editor. Plus, mods such as the Cold War mod make this game even better. Although there are some things to be considered when buying.     Pros:               -Great WWII combat with in depth gameplay and hours of fun              -In depth editor that allows you to create maps and missions              -Great mods to add to the fun    Cons:              - No multiplayer due to Gamespy's shutdown (Unless through a 3rd party program)              -Graphics quality, while decent, is not as good as it could be     TBH, It is worth the $3 you pay to get it, but with a lack of multiplayer, it might be best to get Men of War: Assault Squad 2 for better graphics and multiplayer as well as new stuff.

												Men of War has always been ""the game"" if you want a somewhat realistic WW2 RTS.Its a tough game. You will lose many battles before you get the hang of it and even after a few years of playing you will find players who kick your♥♥♥♥♥in a heartbeat.MoW is not just about how fast you can click, its about understanding the terrain, the units and their features. A cheap unit can cause absolut mayhem and an expensive unit might get destroyed before it reaches the frontline.Luck is as important as it is in real-life and  imho (if you can handle frustration) thats why this game is still fun after hundreds of hours of playing.

It is like you become so war torn that your mind processes one thing, WE GOTTA TAKE THAT BEACH! The raft drops, You been through alot through the years and it's June 6, 1944. The raft drops it's doors carnage unleaches men have been torn apart by bullets and flesh fleshless. You are so scared but at the same time adrenaline rush is going through you, You see guys limbless walking about the beach. But the beach is only the beggining, As we pushed through 1 sherman hit then 2 then 3 then 4. We had to get those 88's all of a sudden I remeber hearing a loud roar BOOM  I was knocked out cold. I had awoken minutes later to see that we were pushing forward, I recall seeing this young kid proablly 17 killing 6 German prisoners. You can't imagine what I have went through  ""Men of War"".Just a made up little story I decided to write for the review for readers, But really I love this game it's great to go into dev mod and make your own missions and maps.

												This is a strategy/tatical game. I have always been sceptic to it. Probably because I never gave it a real shot. It can't be compared to Company of Heroes and shouldn't be. The game has a very realisitic damage table which means that an infantary dies just after 1-3 hits. Facing a tank can be a deadly outcome which can whipe a squad within seconds. I strongly recommend that you start off by playing the easy campaign to learn the basic and still be able to enjoy the game.+ Realistic damage + Slower, tatical warfare + Real WW2 weapons and vehicles. + Control units (WASD+Mouse) or run, walk, phrone, suppressing fire etc. - The missions are quite fun but they don't give you many units to play around with. The Germans doesn't have air support (famous stuka?) or any of their famous arty guns. - Missions are too similar. No big change in layout- AI are really buggy and stupid. You tell a vehicle to drive from A to B and it get stuck half way. - The resupply system could have done automatic. I'm talking about  letting a soilder go back and forth to resupply an artiliitery for e.g. This is something you need to do manually and having 2-3 arty's takes time to do. I don't mind that it takes time but you leave the whole battlefield open because you are busy to resupply guns. - Multiplayer could have been so much better developed. Overall I think this game lack of hungry developers. It seems lke they are happy about how the game runs or not runs. IMO if they actually spent money and time to come up with a new fresh multiplayer, fix the AI's. a better hotkey system (QWERTY) this game can easily be a top strat game. At current state 7/10 because it cost less then a dollar.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad is a World War II strategy game developed by Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Company and was released in February 2011. You, the player, play as different countries from WW2 in historically accurate battles and complete this battles by capturing a set number of strategic points on the battlefield. I will write this review from a single-player perspective by only playing skirmishes, as I did not play this game online or with friends. It will discuss skirmishes, the gameplay within these skirmishes, the graphics and performance, and the overall recommendation.The main feature of Assault Squad is an underwhelming skirmish mode. A skirmish is a play through recount of a historical battle that is chronological, therefore, there is no proper story campaign. However, there is a recount of the story in the loading screen prior to battle. The skirmishes are split into six categories of America, Germany, Japan, Soviet Union, Britain, and bonus missions, so there is a nice balance of skirmishes. The skirmishes are decent at best, but there is laziness in the mode. The objectives are identical in each mission and country skirmish, which is unfortunate because there is variety in the side missions that add to the skirmish tasks. I did not finish all skirmishes because the lack of variety does not add an incentive for me to complete them, hurting the overall playability of the game. But, I do like the accuracy of the history and the realistic environments within the campaign because the environment adapts as the battle rages on. For instance, if an artillery shell hits the ground it creates a nice and massive hole to showcase the damage. Overall, the skirmishes are a let-down due to the lack of variety.The gameplay is solid. I commend the developer for making small things count to add to the realistic nature of the game. For instance, a soldier can die in one hit. Furthermore, the gameplay has a very nice strategic concept as a vehicle out powers infantry, though the infantry can flank and destroy the vehicle. The game strikes a good balance between automation and micromanaging, as your soldiers run out of ammo so you have to go to dead bodies and collect ammo, which evenly distributes that ammo among the entire squad. This balance allows the game not to be bogged down by the micromanagement concept, as the battle is real-time and you can easily lose units. Assault Squad has limitations through the type of available units. For instance, each country has unique units, accurate with the historical counterparts, but there is not a wide variety of different units for the player to choose. While this does not overly hurt the game, it could have been expanded upon.Assault Squad compensates for an underwhelming skirmish mode by having strong graphics and optimised performance. The graphics capture the tone of WW2 through the environment, such as the smoke that arises after a vehicle has been destroyed. Further, the graphics are beautiful when showcasing buildings and the realism of them. Likewise, the performance is great as I run consistently at a 60FPS on ultra-settings.Men of War: Assault Squad is an overall average game. The skirmish mode is underwhelming mainly due to the lack of variety in objectives. The gameplay is solid in that it is very realistic, which it should be for a WW2 game. The graphics and performances are very good. There were not any notable issues, but the game did not wow me nor did I think the game was good. The lack of incentive to continue playing the game hurt my playability of it. However, there is enough content for others to play this for a long time. I played this game for 15 hours but there is enough content to play through to 30 hours, and with friends at least 60 hours of fun. I played the original Men of War and I liked that, but I felt this was a downgrade. I recommend this game on sale.Skirmishes: 4/10Gameplay: 5.5/10Graphics and performance: 8/10Replayability: 7/10Overall: 6/10Thanks for reading my review! If you liked it, give it a rating.

												An intense World War 2 strategy that stresses on realism.It feels like you are observing the skirmishes as they actually happen.The realistic engine of this game is second to none. It boasts a realistic approach on the ballistics of WW2 era machines and weapons. If you aim at an armored vehicles treads they will break, aim for the slits and the crew can be killed, aim for the turret and the barrel can be destroyed. This game brings a whole new way to play RTS.			"

												When you get right down to it, Men of War: Assault Squad is a tactical WWII RTS game for those who have mastered the somewhat easier-to-handle Company of Heroes. This is a challenging battlefield experience somewhat closer to a wargame than to a traditional RTS game and as such is geared to more of a hardcore crowd. It isn't such a great option for tank rushers who don't have a lot of time to spare to learn combined-arms intricacies. Be aware of these demands going in, and you will have a great time refighting this war.This review is ""For Uncle Sam!""			"

Men of War: Assault Squad Review - Rating: 8.2/10General ImpressionMen of War: Assault Squad is a nice strategy game. The graphics are nice, everything looks more realistic, compared to the older Men of War games, and also the textures have been improved. The atmosphere mostly happens in open fields, villages, cities, forests, and even other environments. The audio is pretty nice. I like the sound of the guns, tanks, etc. The music is nice, the ambient music turns into combat music well-synchronized, and it’s overall sounding nice. It sounds less patriotic than the older Men of War titles, but I guess times have changed. The voice acting is also pretty nice. The gameplay is complex, in each mission you have to accomplish some tasks, alike killing certain enemies, cleaning fields off enemies, destroying some units, reaching a point, capturing a point, holding off certain positions, etc. The story focuses on the Soviet, German, Allied and Japan forces during World War 2. The game has 6 campaign, the 6th one of them being the bonus missions. What I don’t like about the missions: they are repetitive. Most of the missions have the same tasks, just different enemies and environments. For some gamers, the missions will get boring after a while. For me, they didn’t get repetitive too much. But, in other reviews, many people have complained about the repetitive missions. The cut scenes of the missions are also pretty nice. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. I also like the overall design of it. The controls are pretty good, except with 1 thing: the rotations’ controls of the cameras. I highly recommend you to reset them with the arrow buttons. The engines, just like in every Men of War game, are not perfect. The game has rarely crashes, and when it crashes, you obviously lose the progress of your mission. Try and save the game as often as you can, in order to avoid too much progress lose. You don't want to waste your time by restarting the mission from zero, right? The mechanics are sophisticated, being pretty nice and everything moves well-optimized. Now, I’m going to talk a little about the G.E.M. editor. Just like in every Men of War game, you have a G.E.M. editor. You can create your own battles in it. It is complex and with a various number of functions. This game has brought it more forces from the Earth, more units per each country and overall you will have more diversified fun. Overall, this game is a nice strategy game which simulates the battles of the Soviet, German, Allied and Japan forces during World War 2.Positive PointsNice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and nice musicFun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the 6 campaigns availableInfantry, heavy guns, batteries, cannons, vehicles, tanks, airplanes, and many other units available 4 difficulties available (the heroic difficulty is new into the Men of War series)A pretty nice designed user interface, and some well-designed cut scenesSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsTrading cards would be a nice featureThe heroic difficulty should be easier, it is almost unplayableNegative PointsThe new types of missions are repetitiveThe multiplayer is not alive anymoreThere are some rare crashes, like in all the Men of War games "

The missions in the game are in 5 campains German,Britian.U.S.A,U.S.S.R and Japan all of them are quite fun but also short each of the campains has about 5 missions each adding up to 25 missions in total plus the bonus missions so their are lot of mission to keep you busy.

												It was cold, very cold, our orders were simple: survive. it was January and the russian winter was ending or so it seemed, our armored divison arrived 3 hours late, Mud they claimed but we knew it wasnt mud, no, not mud it was plain simple it was fear. The russians were infamous for jumping out of the treeline with rockets and molotovs a real pain for our tanks. As the snow begain to stop and my vison cleared it began. zooop! bullets rained around everywhere it was the russians one after another bullets flew past and screams became louder, this was it but why? why am i so scared? i signed up for this to fight for the Fatherland. Engines roared as the panzers drove past and the cannons blasted ripping trees and slinging dirt and debris into the sky  Waiting paitently with my sniper i look down my scope and see him, a boy 19 0r 20 a sad face, i understand him i.. i am him at this moment, but honor for my people kicks into my mind and i squeese the trigger. i hear a loud pop and see a body drop suddenly he is dead.. Pop... my ribs they hurt why? why do i feel so good? i look over to see a russian soldier with his Mosin aimed at me and i look down to see a crimson red in my  chest i look up and yell Fur das Vaterland! Now im cold and lost will you guide me to war? or have i saw the end to it? 10/10 Fun strategy Game.			"

												This game blurs the line between reality and fiction. I'm just kidding,it doesn't! But it does blur the line between a strategy game and a tactical shooter. The game's intro is somewhat difficult when you're new to the game, and I forgot the game WAS a RTS until about halfway through the battle. I had a lot of fun with it, sending a single soldier to break through the lines,only for him to become pinned down,then relieved by his squadmates. I saw that same squad pinned down,far ahead of the main force, desperate attempts at a armored counterattack,and wearing down the enemy's tenacious defenses. I hope that you get the same experience because this is truly a great game,and a great RTS.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad is a real-time strategy from Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Company. Men of War: Assault Squad is considered a sequel to the previous game Men of War.Men of War: Assault Squad retain the same element of gameplay from Men of War, which is micromanagement. But unlike the first Men of War, Men of War: Assault Squad offers a skirmish based mission rather than a story based campaign. This skirmish game is a capture the flag type game which you need to capture all the enemy flag position to win the game. New units and weapons has been added, and for the first time in Men of War series, Japanese faction has been fully added to the game with voice acting, vehicles and weapons of their own. The game also comes with an editor in which you can make your own skirmish based mission or make your new story based mission.Graphics of Men of War: Assault Squad has been improved. Explosion effects, sounds, weapons tracer, even the vehicles and weapons model are all improved. As the game being patched, new weapons and new vehicles are being added to the game. The game still runs pretty smooth with all these upgraded graphics. And Men of War series is the only game where you can hear an American soldier saying ""for the Motherland"".The multiplayer were a good part of the game, there are many game modes to choose from capture the flag, frontline attack and defense even the skirmish cooperative mode. But all of the multiplayer feature has been disabled since GameSpy has been shutdown.Men of War: Assault Squad is yet to be the best of Men of War series. Many features and addition makes the game more rich with content to play with in the editor. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												Who ever said war was easy? I totally recommend this game! This is one of the greatest WW2 RTS's on Steam! Men of War: Assault Squad is really hard and this adds a level of action and excitement. It adds fine control of your squads to the unit. You can directly control them where it's kinda like a shooter of some sort, or you can control them like traditional RTS. You can also manage their inventories. Did your tank blow up? No problem, just don't forget to take the MG! I recommend this game over any other WW2 game even Call of Duty: World At War or Company of Heroes. What I especially love in this game are the tanks! Who doesn't love tanks! The tanks in this game are so amazing! Tanks don't just blow up if the health reachs 0; there are multiple ways to disable a tank. Driving a tank gives you really false confidence because in the open, it is vulnerable to attack either by AT guns or bigger and better tanks.  One time, one of my tanks got stuck on a bridge and just tumbled off and ruined the engine. It was a bit annoying yet cool at the same time. Every unit in the game has a role and the combination of these units really helps your battalion/company/whatever. For instance, you can have a sniper supress the enemy while you move your infantry forward to attack. It's never that simple though!This game is really worth the money, get the second if you wish! I haven't tried the second but I will after I finish the Skirmish mode (Campaign).			"

												Just skip it entirely & move on to Men of War Assault Squad 2 which is better in every way.Now, that being said, MoW:AS is on a league of its own from strategical & tactical point of view. Mesh it up with the game's forte - ""realism"", and you get a rts where you actually have to really really use your brain. Boi, no room for blobbing!It's chaotic, brutal. unforgiving; make a mistake & death awaits. Micromanagment is the heart of the game, which may very well be a double edged sword. It's certainly a strong suit but can easily become overwhelming & convoluted for some.Now, the reason why I don't recommend this game is because how the singleplayer feels so bland & lackluster. Same mission objectives for every factions make it repititive; offers no variation. Surely, you can complete each mission in different ways but it gets boring nonetheless.Also, the unit control is pretty sloppy & the A.I. pathing is absolutely horrendous. Frequent crash just made me hate the game more!TL;DR: You have MoW:AS2. So, why need this one?			"

												50% of the time you troops will jog through enemy fire without so much as raising their weapons. This is not sprint, this is just really dumb AI. And god, the AI in this game are so terrible. Easy=godlike soldiers vs enemy army of developmentally delayed people. Hard=an army of paper dolls vs an army of Jedi with tanks and machineguns. Enemy vehicles on all difficulty levels are OP as ♥♥♥♥. A jeep (which has no protection at all, it can be destroyed by MGs and has no sides) can easily slaughter a squad of panzergrenadiers. The player's AI will not throw grenades back or duck out of the way. The enemy AI will use every grenade you throw at them to throw back and kill your troops. Player AI will not use antitank grenades on tanks, instead they will use it on a single enemy unit running across their line of sight, instead of using the fully-loaded MP44 in their hands. There is no campaign, just skirmish missions with the same 20 or so units for each faction and the same 2 support options. This game was made for multiplayer only and yet it has no multiplayer. It also HAS NO GEM EDITOR.TL;DR AI is broken, little content, do not buy			"

												This game is cheap as hell now. Buy it and check out this game. Then check out peoples mods, look how they make them, edit them also, just don't put out as own. Then make your own maps and mods. Battles are endless in the editor. I've made Massive tank battles that pushed my PC to the limit.Think at least 75 vehicles (All medium tanks and up need at least 3 tankers inside to be at acceptable operation, 5 for optimal. A lot different from most games.) on the map at once driving around shooting each other (depends on scripting), some destroyed and burning. Some just damaged sitting idle while a tankman tries to repair it. Took me long enough to put a review, but I think this game is worth it for the map editor.  It is a bit complicated at first but there are many youtube videos on how to do basic battles.  ""Getcha' Pull""			"

												This is a strategy game that doesn't seem to know what level of operational command the player is supposed to be simulating.  In theory, you are in charge of a combined arms force at roughly the company level.  Or thereabouts.  In practice, you are a Corporal who is on babysitting duty.  I am not the first person to say that there is a lot of micromanaging in this game.  However, I will point out that this game does not have a very good micromanaging interface.  I still don't know how to refuel a tank with a supply truck.  Yes, your tanks have finite fuel.  This sounds cool.  In reality, they run out after about two or so minutes of movement.  Then you have to refuel them.  Somehow.  The game doesn't say (not even in the Tutorial) and the answer is not obvious at first glance.  And I don't feel I should have to look up the solution to a basic game mechanic that wasn't necessary in the first place.  If you want refueling, make a game on a higher level of strategy and on a longer timescale.The needless micromanaging goes even further than that, however.  If your men become wounded and are bleeding out, you have to order a medic in the squad to revive them.  Honestly, what's the point of having a medic if they don't heal your nearby wounded on their own?  Of course, the medic is a standard combatant otherwise.  So, congratulations, you're a war criminal, even if you're playing the Commonwealth or US.  This is bad enought, but to make matters worse the medics are not even clearly marked at a glance.  In fact, they are quite difficult to find in a squad.  You have to click on squad members or zoom in to ground level to find the medic, then select them, then order them to do their job.  And that's assuming the medic didn't die.  Maybe they did and you forgot.  You've got so much on your plate in would certainly be easy to not notice one dead soldier amongst the carnage.  If you do notice the medic is dead, or bleeding out himself, then you have to use the above mentioned item trading interface, in all it's clunky glory, to have another man search the medic, take his medical bag, and then revive the medic.  You can give the medic his bag back.  Or you can let the other soldier keep it and act as medic from that point on.  It makes no difference in terms of performance.Of course, all this micromanaging to refuel, heal, and wipe after a bowel movement is just there to distract the player from just how awful the game is otherwise.  Ignoring various bugs and texture issues, the fact is that tanks are incredibly fragile.  At least against the heavier AT guns.  That only the computer gets.  The player has to make due with medium AT guns.  Which tend to not get the job done.  In effect, this makes your tanks completely worthless and the AI tanks rather sturdy.  This is a bit of a major point because the AI has AT guns and the like in large numbers.  In theory, you can amass a large number of tanks and push through, spearhead style, but that will take forever.  Tanks are expensive and are mostly there for infantry support.  To more effectively use them, the player must first neutralize the enemy AT defenses, which often involves just taking the capture point outright.  As such, your tanks are mostly just mobile AT guns that are brought up after taking a capture point to beat back the one or two tanks that are sent to retake it.  Infantry are also somewhat fragile, but at least you get a lot of them.Speaking of AT guns everywhere, every level is the same more or less.  Each skirmish map is designed with the same basic idea.  You start in a position, and have to capture ten enemy capture points.  These are always divided into three lines of defense.  The first only has infantry hiding behind some basic cover (sandbags, usually).  The second level of defense has infantry and basic AT guns.  Honestly, not too bad all things considered.  Then you reach the third level of defense.  Heavy AT guns and the like (the Americans usually have to face a lot of Flak 88s which aren't technically AT guns) are EVERYWHERE.  And near the final capture points, tucked in the back, are two Artillery pieces.  These range from  heavy howitzers, to rocket artillery platforms.  There are always two of them.  They ""cover"" the 3rd line of defense and protect the final capture points.  They are annoying.  The best way to defeat them is to use your faction's special ability.  Except for the Germans.  The Goliath is a joke.  Get ready to take a lot of casualties for Deutschland because the idiots who made this game decided to be cute and overly gimmicky.  There, I just described every skirmish map in the whole game.  Some of these maps are better than others (I actually kind of liked the ""Gibraltar of the East"" map for the Japanese) but all fit the description above.  All of them.I suppose I should elaborate on why the Germans got screwed by bad game design.  You see the Goliath is... a tiny RC tank that has an admittedly powerful bomb in it.  This bomb also has an incendiary effect which kills infantry very effectively.  This sounds good.  Until you realize that the Goliath ""ability"" is otherwise a unit and has to get to the enemy position before you can detonate it.  Which means getting through the AT guns and Artillery that are your target.  Pray the Goliath isn't destroyed near your men, or its bomb will end up hurting you and not the enemy.  This is a constant concern.  Especially given how annoyingly accurate the enemy guns are.  Even on Easy mode.  And the worse part is that the Goliath's bomb has the same basic payload as the American Airstrike, the British Artillery Bombardments, and a single round from the Soviet's special unit (I forget the name) which is just a really big piece of Artillery.  The Japanese special unit, two pieces of Type 100 Rocket Artillery are also roughly comparable in overall damage.  Except all of those get to deliver their payload across the entire map (or a long way across the map for the Type 100 and Soviet Super Gun) automatically.  The Goliath has to be carefully piloted across the map by the player.  Yes, more micromanaging.  In a game that already has too much micromanaging and most of it already unnecessary to begin with.  I get the Nazis were bad, but if you're going to make them playable, don't take it out on the player.Bottom line:  This game is terrible, lacks any real depth, make bizarre balancing decisions (see Goliath) that are also terrible.  The developers put up a smokescreen of micromanaging to distract the player from this reality, but the micromanaging ends up being a terrible reality in its own right.  A failure of shallow design covered up by a failure of overly detailed executions.  The Yin and Yang of bad game design together in one rancid package.  Buy this game at your own peril.  And be very wary of the sequel.  I imagine they haven't changed too much, though I admittedly don't know because this debut has scared me away from the entire franchise. "

												If you liked Men of War for it's brilliant campaign and want some more, then turn away.This might have it's name, but it's a very different game.The campaigns are very lazily made, with no story or thought put into them. Just a simple capture a point.It's more frustrating than difficult really. You can destroy any opponent using the ""direct control"" with ease, but if you want your soldiers to lay down to get some cover from enemy fire, then you better start praying to which ever god you believe in. Because chances are, it's not gonna happen.Just.. don't bother with this one.			"

												This one is a bit more forgivable than their later releases because it made some changes and went from a SP focus to a more competitive format, still resuses assets from the prequel Faces of War though.

												Men of War: Assault Squad is a World War 2 real time strategy game. I have logged over 100 hours on this game and I would like to say that I have had a pleasant experience with this game. I will admit, there are some slightly broken aspects of this game. Things like American Shotgun Troopers, some of the tanks *cough cough* Germany *cough cough*, and artillery in general. But overall, I have had a pleasant experience playing this games with friends. Speaking of which, the multiplayer of this game is somewhat shut down since it was formerly ran via GameSpy. There are several ways to combat this problem, but I used the Direct Connect method. This is where you and a friend(s) exchange IP's, add them to your multiplayer options, and then go to LAN. If you did this correctly, you should see each other in the lobby. To recap, it's a good game. Just be careful. 9/10			"

												This game is a very fun game when you first buy it. While i played through the missions I had lots of fun but once I beat them all and played them over I kind of knew whqat was going to happen. I still love the game even though I have played all the missions at least 5 times. I would recomend buying this game when it is on sale due to the fact that many players have moved onto the sequel.

												This game has a mod called ""Dynamic campaign generator"".This mod adds completely different dimension to the game as it will let You build Your force from the begining of hostilities and follow the war till the end of it on all fronts. Troops will acquire experience and their equipment will follow from one battle to the next (unless You choose to reset their invetories). My recomendations for a german side starting 1940 - bring Your 88 guns ASAP and capture as many Bren Carriers as You can. You can store a lot of equipment in those carriers. This will let You keep micromanagement to the minimum as ""reset all inventories"" will not reset captured vehicles yet You will not be forced to micromanage every soldier and every gun as they will have their munitions in each battle. There is no way to resuplay Your own tanks in the mod, for example, unless You reset their inventories.  And those carriers are superb for towing Your 88 flak guns around the battlefield - they have rather low profile and will let flak guns to fire over the carrier and they will provide a good MG cover against attacking infantry.I hope the creators of this awesome mod will continue with Assault Squad 2 and add more features in the future also.

												Some people might disagree because of bugs and how bad this or that is, but hey there arent to many good WW2 rts games (Other than Company of Heroes 1 and 2) and there are other good ones but this is a very great one it is old and not as good looking but it has tons of content and a very, very good modding community im betting the multiplayer if still up would be filled with people. Now then lets go to pros and cons Pros-A lot of content Great Editor Great Multi and Singleplayer campaignRealistic physics (sometimes buggy though)Great Modding community Cons Multiplayer closed (have to use third party to play)buggy Not so pretty Graphics No basebuilding (just me though) And i would recommend Men of War Assault Squad to those that are fans of the series and or rts games such as Company of Heroes or War game Series  "

												Well, everyone round here knows I love (or rather love/hate thanks to the many bugs) all of the Men of War series - and Faces of War. ""Assault Squad"" is no different. But I have to declare that gameplay wise, this one is the weakest of the series, yet technically it's one of the most sturdy and bug free (don't worry, many old favourite bugs even from FoW's day are *still* hanging in there)! The opposite to ""Condemed Heroes"" and ""Red Tide"" which had the best gameplay, interesting story and well designed missions, but teeming with bugs!One simple reason for the low gameplay score..... the most lazy, half-arsed scenario design I have ever seen!ALL 5 campaigns for each nation are just literally cut & paste copies of each other..... getting all the DLCs for MOW:AS is also a must - when they're on a good offer that is! They at least introduce a few new types of scenarios - including a special ""Xmas"" one!The other fault, and evidence of lazy programming, is the ""sod doing any more work than needed, let's just give the AI infinite respawns and infinate RPs"" attitude. This makes for some very long winded, exhausting scenarios - which you will have to play on permanent slo-mo mode just in order to keep up!The game is heavily biased toward LAN/Internet play and people who will build their own scenarios.There are no ""script heavy storyline"" missions like in the other MoWs!Taken on their own individual merits, these skirmish style are OK, but the repitition gets very, very old, very, very quick! Being a stubborn smacktard, I still went and worked through them all!""1C"" still have not been bothered to supply proper AI bots that can be used in LAN/Internet play. They've left that for Assault Squad 2, as a STUPIDLY overpriced DLC - which many report doesn't even work. What next, ""Pause Mode DLC"" for £19.99? Better not give ""1C"" any ideas - it's looking like they are all turning into David ""Robber"" Brabens!The best thing is, the modding community! There's tons of mods available, you are far from stuck with ""1C""'s repetitive scenarios! "

												One of the best strategy game in existence which only lacks in certain points. Taking direct control of units, the vehicle damage model, all makes this a very special game.However, voice acting in the campaign is... unbearable and the campaign in itself is not impressive. This game is clearly made for multiplayer.Though, the sheer amounts of mods that exist and are being created fixes most of these. Probably half my gameplay is of playing mods. I'd suggest Moddb for finding these.Should you buy this game? I would say yes, but if you can wait then i should wait till assault squad 2, which seems to improve a lot of problems. For me, definatly worth the buy. 10/10 "

												If Company of Heroes and Blitzkrieg made a baby, this is what you get. At first I loved the baby, but then I wanted to punt it, mostly because of the terribly frustrating enemy snipers! Here they are picking off my perfect defenses, and there isn't jack sh*t I could do about it. I would spend so much time just trying to find them, and by the time I would, half my troops would be a pile of splattered brains on the ground. So I left the game for a few days, thought about it, and then realized I was moving too slowly. Make sure you grab those resources quick and early, and maybe you'll have enough to survive when bad things happen! So, I just finished playing a Commonwealth Mission, Operation Torch on hard. No idea how long it took, but it was the craziest slug fest ever. At the ramps there was a stalemate for hours. The dead tanks meant I couldn't rush with armor, and their constant sniper attacks were keeping my men from advancing. Finally the key...tons of antitank guns, lots of my own snipers, supported by infantry, and the occasional morter. Final casualty count - Germany Casualties = 7445men and 439 vehicles. Commonwealth Casualties = 2511 men and 164 vehicles. I $#!@#%@# love this game!!! P.S. Anyone know how best to push dead tanks out of your way?			"

												Underatted but incredible.Picked this game up in the humble-bundle and conviced some friends to do it too... Had massive fun destroying them in 1v1/2v2/3v3/4v4 matches (each one seems like a completely different experience) as well as being destroyed by them and teaming up with them to fight against AI and progress through the map whilst getting rewards along the way.Looking forward to pick up Men of War: Assault Squad 2 as well as Call to Arms at some point too!Only downsides are that there is no obvious 'Free for All' type which means you need to have an even number of players for it to be a fair game (each player gets 100CP to spend on units, meaning the larger team always has an extra 100 to spend) as well as the fact that the system that was used for multiplayer having been shut down (the only ways to play multiplayer are throuh programs such as Hamachi, Gameranger, Tunngle or by just using LAN if you're on the same network).I would reccomend getting this game definitely, but if you have the money to spare then Men of War: Assault Squad 2 or even Call to Arms (although it's early access) may be a better option due to more features as well as a more expansive multiplayer system which will also allow you to fight with/against random players and not just your friends or people you know.Performance is a little iffy in terms of seemingly having fps that is dependant on how many units are on the field no matter what your PC's specs are (many units = lag, especially tanks or other vehicles)If I had to rate it out of 10 I would give it an 8/10, it's a great game but has a few flaws which are seemingly solved in the sequel.There are few games that I've had as much fun playing with friends than this.

												It's not that this is a <bad> game, it's just so unbelievably frustrating it's not worth your time. Your unit AI will need micromanaging down to the ammo they need to shoot guns. They are too stupid to pick up ammo from bodies automatically. If someone runs out of ammo they stand still and wait to die. Pathfinding is completly broken. For example: A squad needs to get into a trench, instead of jumping into the trench from the side they are closest to, they will run all the way around to the far end of the trench will there is a proper ramp, usually resulting in the entire squad getting gunned down. Medics need your guidance to heal thier mates. They will wait next to someone bleeding out, unless you take the time to select the medic and click on the downed guy the medic will not heal him. Tank movement needs constant micromanagement as well. If you want a tank to back up, it will decide on its own to do a 180 and expose it's♥♥♥♥♥to enemy fire.There is no story mode, the single player ""skirmishes"" are based on battles from history and (all the achevements are from singleplayer btw) are very cookie cutter, you start with one unit and take objective capture points one by one to unlock more tanks that can be called in as reinforcements.  Every skirmish mission is like this. Skirmish difficulty scales way to high very quickly. Your tanks often get oneshotted by seemingly inferior enemy tanks. Advancing with your tank is suicide as enemy AT guns are impossible to take out before your tanks are one shotted. Your AT guns? Usually goes like this: MISSMISSBOUNCEMISSGLANCING HITIf you decide to play this game kep the asprin close. And stretch your thumb and index finger for the ineviatble ALT-F4			"

												Very nice game . i have'nt play this game very much but i already like it. It's like Company of heroes 1 but improved.Like u have things like:Direct control: You can direct control your units. like sometimes the AI is stupid in games. so it's very nice to control the unit by yourself.Repair: you can repair Damaged vehicles, field guns, mortars. you can even repair damaged/abandon enemy vehicles. so you can play as US and still get a Tiger I.Inventory system: soldiers have inventories, tanks and APC's have cargospaces. so soldiers can pick up things like repaire kit, mortar shells, enemy weapons and even guns like M2 browning and use it. :Pto Summerize. Men of War: Assault Squad is one of the best WW2 stradegy games i have played and i will very likely buy Men  of War: Assault Squad 2			"

												NOTE: Normal MP for this game will have gone down when the Gamespy servers go down, but you can still play MP through GameRanger, or LAN. Hamachi works too, for obvious reasons. This is an amazing game, a strategy gem like none before it (except the other MoW games). Put your units into one man teams and micromanage their positions, or put them in huge squads and let them do it themselves. Take direct control over a unit and use it to provide accurate fire, be it with rifle, MG, tank canon or heavy artillery. You can be anyone, tell your men to do anything.The singleplayer is fun, albeit extremely hard and there is no dynamic 'hop in and play a random battle' mode, such as games like CoH have. The 'Skirmish' mode is really just three (or five with DLC), where you push forward and capture points, which allows you to call in new units to use on the unrelentingly hard enemy. Once you finally beat a level, you are awarded with the next, even harder level to defeat. The difficulty can be annoying and extremely frustrating but it finally beating it feels great.Overall, this is one of the greatest strategy games I've played, and while steam hasn't tracked many of my hours on it, I have a lot more than is shown. Improves upon the shortcomings of past games, and while opting for a more MP-focused format still makes SP fun. 8/10			"

												I have played all the MoW games prior to this one, and I recommend them all.  The MoW brand of military RTS is absolutely amazing... the emphasis is definitely on realism... with actual penetration and armor values, unit inventory, destructable environs, and limited resources.  The day I realized that I could loot a dead enemy's body for weapons, health kits, and rounds made me a believer.As such, MoW:AS is basically the same gameplay, with the exception that there is no ""campaign"" with a scripted overarching story.  Missions are skirmishes against the computer AI (some with limited scripting) and multiplayer human vs. human on a number of maps and using several different game modes.  Initial resources are granted as ""points"" which can be spent to buy units.  Additional points slowly trickle in... as capture points are seized additional advanced units become available for purchase.  Reinforcements appear at the bottom of the map and advance to the point you designate.I have played the skirmish modes for a number of hours now on easy, which is still challenging.  There are many factions... german, american, british, japanese... some good map variety and about 20-25 skirmish missions will keep you busy for about 30 hours.  The more advanced maps are very challenging and usually involve multiple phases.I only have a few complaints about this game:> It should be easier to re-supply troops with ammo from fallen enemy soldiers, or the resupply truck.  Automating that task would be a huge improvement.> Some maps feel repetitive... a few more scripts to add variety would be welcomeRelatively minor annoyances honestly.  If you are a WWII RTS fan, then get this game immediately.  Even better, start with the original MoW and play the rest of them first.  You will learn all the commands and gameplay tricks.  If you are a Company of Heroes fan, give this a try for a much more interersting challenge.8/10			"

												Do you like playing the same five missions over and over again?  Men of War: Assualt Squad has five different DLC packs.  Each one of them provides a new faction and 'story' to follow.  This is all well and good, but each faction is basically identical in mission type to each other.  If you are looking for an easy RTS than you have found it.  If you are looking for something that has a little more depth than a kiddie pool, then I suggest that you look elsewhere.  All you are going to find here is tedious repetition.  Don't spend more than 2$ on the entire bundle.			"

												The best RTS of all time. This game can be as indepth and complex or simple as you want it to be. I can not speak highly enough of this RTS. It is perfection, I recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging RTS and wants to enjoy the most indepth micro intensive game ever made. Buy it. For 35 dollars you get 15 missions that are full coop with friends and the best multiplayer combat in an RTS. BUY IT!			"

												Plays Men of War Assault Squad with friendPlays as Germany and makes defencesFills the trenches with machine guns, artillery and S.S TroopsMy friend sends a scout force composed of 2 squads of infantry and 10 tanks, my defences kill them like it was nothing....I've held my position for 50 mins, just 10 more mins until the match was over....since I was winning and there was 10 mins remaining...I got cocky...I've stopped caring about reinforcments so my units were in short of ammunition.Next thing I know he bombards me with 10 rocket artillery....then sends in 10 IS-3's (Most OP Tank in the game) and distracts my tanks...then sends in 600 infantry men and took over my defences in under 5 mins...10/10 would be rekt again and smash my keyboard in half.But overall this game is one of the best games I have had ever played.

												One of my favorite games of all time. If you don't care for multiplayer, I would really recommend getting this over CtA and even MoW:AS2. The few added features, while very cool, are not worth the price.This game has a ton of great things about it. An awesome editor, great game mechanics, destructable buildings, a detailed inventory system, and a vast array of gameplay options.You can repair and take over broken enemy vehicles, take ammo from both friendly and dead enemy soldiers, plant dynamite and mines, change out helmets, and a ton of other interesting things.Be warned that this game has a lot of micromanagement, but with that micromanagement comes a lot of depth.

												I am going to have to thumbs up on this game. The game itself is certainly a fun one; gets the brain working for strategy, and is rather realistic on its approach to a WWII RTS. To me it's like if Red Orchestra was turned into an RTS.The only thing that kills this game (and not the fault of the game or the devs) is the community. It's fairly difficult to find a friendly random to play with. If you don't have high levels, you will certainly get kicked from a few games before finally finding one, and some of the high-level players are completely dishonorable by choosing to fight weaker new players rather than those of their own callibre. There is also no random matchmaking, so you HAVE to find an accepting server if you want to play (and multiplayer is the core of this game)Basically, great game, but I would suggest encouraging a personal friend to also get the game, or gift a copy to him or her as well. This game is REALLY fun if you got fun people to play with.			"

												Best game ever.Sadly a downgrade from the original but gameplay works fine so its okay[No more campaign intros, no more story, no more music apart from a boring 1min track]However..The game is pretty great and has a heavily realistic combat that works fine, it has deepness but its not too confused and not difficult to get into, only issue is refueling/refilling, however that is only a problem on infantry and some mods got a script to refill that.I MUST RECOMMEND to get this OVER AS2. Assault Squad 2 is a far far more worse downgrade that cant handle itself, the devs literally gave up. I played 2k+ hours overall in the original, this and AS2 so you can believe me when I say this, also for the following reasons of course:Here you have always a smooth FPS, also in MP it works flawlessly (unless russian potatoe is your mate) while in AS2 the MP still has desync bugs and the game looks 10% better while running 200% worse and has NOTHING ELSE to offer at all.Many would disagree now becauseIT GOT STEAM WORKSHOP -> Well, too bad its garbage.AS1 mods: Go to moddb -> download -> drag/drop -> playAS2 mods: Subscribe -> download (chance to bug out) -> have an additional loading time when you start up??? (mounting steam workshop ressources, nice loading time for NO REASON) then activate it, overall takes way longer. Especially on multiple mods enjoy letting the game mount mods for a hour.BUT...BUT..THE MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD SO GET AS2 -> Its not.Gamespy died, LAN is working. Tunngle is a program to play over lan with other people. No difference from gamespy/Steam services and 100-200+ players always online and proper framerate, no lag, no desync error.AS2 offers nothing but these 2 ""features"" ..also an ammo script for infantry which is super cool but..yeah..that♥♥♥♥♥♥performance			"

												I've spent more hours on this game than I have on Skyrim. Nuff Said. An amazing game for any WWII buff (like me) or just strategy/RTS-game lover out there. It is a great game, and I think that the time and effort that was put into making this game was really worth it. I recommend that anyone interested in this game should buy it. Trust me, I bought this game a long time ago, and I'm still not bored of it!Plus, I have more hours on this than I have on Skyrim, so that's pretty self-explanatory.			"

												This is a very nice game, with nicely-flowing campaigns for every major nation in the war. The detail of combat is amazing, and reminds me a bit of my old Gamecube game, Battalion Wars, where you can take control of the most modest infantryman, or that badass battlestation (or in this game, the Tiger tank) and go to town with it.It's the first game I've seen in awhile that accuratly show how vulnerable tanks actually were. In most games, they're these killing machines that somehow take multiple shells, but here, with this game's tank armor system, almost anything can knock out a tank without actually destroying it, such a mine taking out a tread to render it immobile, or a well-placed shot that snaps the barrel of the main gun, or of course just blowing the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.This game also has a fully destructable map, where you can knock down a small wall, an apartment building, or even put ♥♥♥♥ing holes in the ground from motar and artillery shells.It alas doesn't well represent the mortality of man, where they are able to somehow take an 8,8cm Tiger shell straight to the face.But all-in-all, this is a very fine game and it's a great pick for a dual WWII/RTS intrest.---German Soldiers Mod Review---I really love this mod, it adds even more realism (like the mortality of man) and is generally just really freaking awesome. I especially love that it adds Westerwald Lied to the main menu's music.<3 German Marches			"

												TL:DR, If you enjoy realistic games, and you enjoy RTS games, this is great even if you pay full priceFirst off, if you played earlier men of wars and found the to be overly difficult and annoying, this fixes problems. I remember playing MoW Vietnam. The final kill counts were like me 600 kills, them 6. This game is NOT like that. They allow for a lot more renforcements which creates bigger and better battles.If you have never played, Imagine Company of Heroes but way more realistic. Every unit has an inventory which can be scavanged and depleted. If you have a tank in battle for a prolonged ammount of time you may find your self out of HE, AP, or the covited APCR(I will expand on ammo types and options in the next section). Machine guns can run black, and so can snipers. Every one is prone to running completely black on ammo. The cool thing is you can always scavange, many times in my American play I found myself picking up and MP40 when I felt like it may be more effective for the close range fighting that was happening. All weapons and all ammo drops when units die, and can be picked up, unless the unit is blown up. The game also allows you to buy a supply truck completely loaded with 1000s of rounds of ammo. Also each unit has many options as to weapons they can use, unlike CoH, you can actually have unit switch to a side arm, or switch to grenade, you have so much more control of each man on the field. Where this become most evident it with the armor, This game has some of the best tank physics I have ever seen, when you shoot something with an AP round, you can actually see the hole if it punctures, as well as it hits every on in its path just like a real AP round. It does not just blow up the tank, it blows a hole through it. That is if you actually get a clean hit with a big enough cannon. This is the best part of this game, tank on tank battles. I had a single Stuart take on anything the Jap army could send, That same tank was completly worthless against the germans. Super realistic and fun, and allows for complete control.My last point and best part about this game, is the direct control. If you just hit E on any unit it gives you complete control. You aim the weapon, fire it, and move with the WASD. Where as normally in an RTS you just right click to attack, in this you can move and attack, with the most possible control, especially with tanks. Moving into postion with a sherman and hitting a Panzer IV point blank with a 76mm APCR Is one of the coolest things you can do.From a game play standpoint, I got the whole thing on sale, with all the DLC. Which comes with 5 mission for each of the Russian, German, American, Japanese, and Common Wealth factions. Play slow and enjoying it took me 8 hours to beat the USA campagn. So a lot of paytime there. TONS of units!!Great fun, Cheap game, do it! "

												Clunky, budgeted, and sometimes brutally unfair thanks to luck alone, Men of War: Assault Squad is still a rock-solid title with its own unique attributes that set it apart from Company of Heroes and other WW2 RTS titles.What Men of War does best is its keen focus on mimicking the reality of war. There is no such thing as a bottomless magazine, an unlimited fuel tank, or a tank with more rounds than potential targets. There is no be-all, end-all weapon to any situation and every engagement demands its own proportionate response. Wasting troops, ammunition, or even just the fuel in a vehicle can cripple that unit in engagements to come or complicate matters beyond reason.Did you use up all the high-explosive shells in a tank and now have to face off against dug-in infantry? Good luck trying to snipe them with armor-piercing rounds. Did you fire off all your mortars in a team and now have to destroy an anti-tank gun or lose one of your expensive armored vehicles? Have fun waiting for a new mortar team or supply truck while your tank takes fire it can't respond to.Range, lethality, and mobility all play crucial roles; tanks can fire far and wide across the map and receive attacks from field guns at even further distances. Vehicles can and will be destroyed in a single shot from a position far across the map or left crippled and useless by a strike to their treads, turret, or main gun. Critical anti-tank infantry or machine gunners can be shot out from under you by snipers, artillery, or even just an unlucky ricochet off of a tank's armor, all happening in the blink of an eye.Even as brutal as Men of War can be, there are often moments of forgiveness to take advantage of. Vehicles left unuseable are usually left abandoned in a state that can be salvaged. Though time-expensive, all infantry can repair a badly crippled, seemingly useless heavy tank back into fighting condition and crew it. A single rifleman with luck and determination can be used to repair and steal a damaged enemy tank right out from under their noses and bring it back to base to be fully crewed and put back to work. Most infantry fall injured rather than killed outright and swift management of a combat medic can bring decimated squads back into the fight with minimal losses. Valuable weapons can be scavenged, stolen, and re-supplied in the heat of battle by any unit, allowing a dismounted tank crew to become a formidable close quarters assault team when the right tools are left to take.A solid foundation of realism and hard-hitting micromanagement make Men of War a game worth playing, but it can often be questionable in its aesthetics department. Sometimes bizarre, universally short unit responses, average or above-average quality music with little dynamic manipulation, and a sound system that leaves much to be desired, even as much as the sounds themselves are of good quality, all contribute to an uneven audio experience. Animations that can range from goofy to floaty to eye-catchingly strange hold down its otherwise surprisingly good model quality.Overall, from my short experience in the game, Men of War is a series I wish I had gotten into sooner. Its short list of failings hardly dent what is, in the end, a game well worth its price tag. As a warning to all who consider purchasing it, I would like to note that, with GameSpy down, multiplayer may be difficult to get into or even impossible for those with problematic connections; services like GameRanger are required to do more than singleplayer, as my own experience tells me.

												If you love RTS games that get really indepth in conrtol than this is the game for you with individual access to each soldiers inventory and soldiers as a single unit not just 5 guys in close intervals, the destruction aspect is great and almost any computer can run the explosives on good graphics with no problems. Plus there's the editor to create your own epic maps and battles, and theres pages of mods online that install easily!			"

												On the surface, MoW:AA plays like an RTS set during the events of WWII. However, what sets the game apart is the ability to super-micro manage all units.  Each soldier has an inventory and skill level with weapons, tanks need to be crewed by multiple soldiers, etc.  Additionally, each unit can be ""direct controlled"", in an almost arcade like fashion.  Success involves the use of real  world tactics such as effective use of terrain, cover, suppressive fire, line of sight, correct deployment of troops, and basics of understanding the ballistic effectiveness of armor and anti-armor units in various scenarios.  The game really shines in co-op and supports as many as eight players cooperating against a devastatingly effective AI.  If you ever pick it up, look me up for a game!			"

Japan sounds like an American gamer nerd....Russia sounds like an American not even trying to do the accent....Britain, meh...alright. Germany....they didn't even try on that one. Other than that, the gameplay's good, the mods are amazing. Especially the Cheats Mod. Very Michael Bay-ey. Gameplay's alright, Graphics are pretty good. The units could be better. All in all I do recommend this game. But if you're looking for a full-control game, try something like Empire: Total War, or Empire at War (Star Wars game).			"

												I bought this game on a sale for about 3 euros and it has been one of the best buys i have done, it is a very fun game while being still realistic. Really a good mix between simulator and fun game. things that make it so simulation-like are for example the fact that you can scavenge vehicles and bodies for good weapons or ammo for soldiers that lost theirs while being blasted away by a explosion form a tank. although the skirmish levels look a bit too much on each other, i still recommend it.Has a good multiplayer too.

												Brilliant game. It's realistic as can be and fun as hell.You can lob a grenade through the roof of a Greyhound and decrew it like a boss.You can ambush Nazi pigs like a boss.You can storm the beaches of Normandy like a boss.ORYou can just ♥♥♥♥ing obliterate everything with scorched earth tactics and ♥♥♥♥ing level entire cities like a boss.Hardest ♥♥♥♥ing RTS of life, But by far one of the most badass series' ive ever played.The ONE THING that gets to me (I've just gotta ♥♥♥♥♥ about this) Is how easily you can lose high value units. You can spend 1000cp on a Veteran Tiger and roll it on up just to have it get detracked by invisible commies throwing homing AT grenades. THEN BC HEAVY TANKS ARE SLOW they can just keep lobbing at grenades and ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥up.Flak 88's can destroy anything in one shot (Unless you're the luckiest SOB ever).AT Guns are very easy to decrew but if cared for you can win with just AT guns and infantry.Infantry goes hard. The MEN of Men of War are the key and by far the best part. It's almost like you're watching a real war. Finally, the GEM Editor is fantastic. If you like this game check out the Cold War mod (v1.5.7) and take it into the editor. It's a much better game with everything from M1A2's and Apache's to BTR-90's and T-90's to play with.Fantastically done. 10/10			"

												Clunky, budgeted, and sometimes brutally unfair thanks to luck alone, Men of War: Assault Squad is still a rock-solid title with its own unique attributes that set it apart from Company of Heroes and other WW2 RTS titles.What Men of War does best is its keen focus on mimicking the reality of war. There is no such thing as a bottomless magazine, an unlimited fuel tank, or a tank with more rounds than potential targets. There is no be-all, end-all weapon to any situation and every engagement demands its own proportionate response. Wasting troops, ammunition, or even just the fuel in a vehicle can cripple that unit in engagements to come or complicate matters beyond reason.Did you use up all the high-explosive shells in a tank and now have to face off against dug-in infantry? Good luck trying to snipe them with armor-piercing rounds. Did you fire off all your mortars in a team and now have to destroy an anti-tank gun or lose one of your expensive armored vehicles? Have fun waiting for a new mortar team or supply truck while your tank takes fire it can't respond to.Range, lethality, and mobility all play crucial roles; tanks can fire far and wide across the map and receive attacks from field guns at even further distances. Vehicles can and will be destroyed in a single shot from a position far across the map or left crippled and useless by a strike to their treads, turret, or main gun. Critical anti-tank infantry or machine gunners can be shot out from under you by snipers, artillery, or even just an unlucky ricochet off of a tank's armor, all happening in the blink of an eye.Even as brutal as Men of War can be, there are often moments of forgiveness to take advantage of. Vehicles left unuseable are usually left abandoned in a state that can be salvaged. Though time-expensive, all infantry can repair a badly crippled, seemingly useless heavy tank back into fighting condition and crew it. A single rifleman with luck and determination can be used to repair and steal a damaged enemy tank right out from under their noses and bring it back to base to be fully crewed and put back to work. Most infantry fall injured rather than killed outright and swift management of a combat medic can bring decimated squads back into the fight with minimal losses. Valuable weapons can be scavenged, stolen, and re-supplied in the heat of battle by any unit, allowing a dismounted tank crew to become a formidable close quarters assault team when the right tools are left to take.A solid foundation of realism and hard-hitting micromanagement make Men of War a game worth playing, but it can often be questionable in its aesthetics department. Sometimes bizarre, universally short unit responses, average or above-average quality music with little dynamic manipulation, and a sound system that leaves much to be desired, even as much as the sounds themselves are of good quality, all contribute to an uneven audio experience. Animations that can range from goofy to floaty to eye-catchingly strange hold down its otherwise surprisingly good model quality.Overall, from my short experience in the game, Men of War is a series I wish I had gotten into sooner. Its short list of failings hardly dent what is, in the end, a game well worth its price tag. As a warning to all who consider purchasing it, I would like to note that, with GameSpy down, multiplayer may be difficult to get into or even impossible for those with problematic connections; services like GameRanger are required to do more than singleplayer, as my own experience tells me.

												I would give this game 9/10, but it's difficult. Like really difficult. Hell, I'm not able to do first mission even on easy mode, after I capture first 3, the enemy sends in endless waves of soldiers and armoured vehicles, and I'm not able to hold it on my own. Also, the first mission for every country IS THE SAME. Capture about 9-10 checkpoints, then proceed to next misson. I've bad feeling next missions are gonna be the same.You can use enemy weapons for your soldiers, you can pick up helmets, carefully pick off enemies with sniper, but not really, because at most times, the enemy turns full ape♥♥♥♥♥♥after you complete several checkpoints in missions, so there's no time to do such things. If your tank(s) get destroyed, your crew jumps out, which is nice, since you can use them not only to repair your tanks, but to repair enemy tanks and use them. But then again, not really, enemy won't give you chance to do it.This game is just difficult for me, I don't know why. I can't do more than 2 things at the same time, control several units at the same time, but enemy can, ofc. Easy difficulty feels difficult, but you can't go lower. If you're good at these games, you're gonna absolutely love it. Graphics aren't bad, pretty good for this game if you ask me. If only there was AI help for every mission, just like in introduction, it would be so much better.I can't really give this game anything, since I haven't done even the first mission on any country and I'm not really gonna play this game any longer due to personal probs, but so far, 7.5/10.I mean, repair enemy stuff and use it against him? Hell yeah!			"

Hope this helped....Anyways, Highly recommend this game....Would recommend to ANYONEEDIT:After I played Men Of War AS even more, I ended up enjoying it more. I'd give it a 9/10. For a 10 out of 10 I'd say they need to work on the AI a bit more. Sides that, great game.END OF EDIT.			"

												I have played about 5 minutes of this game so far (just alt-tabbed to write this) and I can already tell that this is an awesome game. Sometimes you can tell that about a game very quickly. Men of War feels really user-friendly and fun-friendly. In this tactical 3rd person strategy/shooter you can pause the game, slow it down, speed it up, take personal control of individual soldiers or command the squad. You can use a whole array of tactics and units. You can basically do whatever the hell you want to achieve the goal. The only probelm for me so far is lack of custom scenario mode, but there are custom missions and mods that fix that issue.			"

												This game is so funny and great! I was very fortunate to get it for 3.49 in the STEAM sale.You can play an easy-to-understand campaign which is fun. You can choose which country you want to be out of Russia, Britain, Germany, Japan.The multiplayer has to be the best part about MOWAS. Me and a friend play Skirmish mode online and it is very good, especially  the way you can control your units, and call in badass tanks and weapons and yeah yeah yeah.Sometimes, you can find funny things happen such as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SAS truck driver decideds to drive over a bomb and drive straight into a trench into open fire while your soldiers sit comfortably in the back of the truck.Get MOWAS great fun and easy to understand!

												This game is amazing, it's hard but WORTH the money. Unfortunately the multiplayer has been shut down, luckily the games saviour l.a.n still works I will give a example of somethings that happens when I was playing lan with a friend. My friend captured a large and tank gun. Then I swooped in with a fixed and stolen American jeep, attached the gun the wisked the gun away to safety. Later in the battle I used that anti tank gun to blow up 6 tanks during the enemy's counter attack. Another time my tanks track got shot out and the tank was out of repair kits, so I got a guy to run across the battlefield to get a repair kit from a blown up tank. Finally I fortified a checkpoint with land mines and sand bags. This game is great value for 10 $ but I got it on sale for 2$ AMAZING deal			"

												Men of War Assault Squad is a game that put you in charge of the chaos of war in a wide diversity of missions, environement and factions.Assault Squad offer 16 skirmish missions that can be define as a struggle against wave after wave of enemies who are not only attacking you but are well entrenched to stop your advance.To achieve victory you will have to essentially tactically fight, destroy, blow up, fix deploy a largy diversity of equipement this game contain. The result give you an intense firefight that establish a delicate balance between the two side. You can go from a dominating position to losing all your tanks. This mean a skirmish mission can take you from 30 min to many days depending the difficulty.Now if that wasn't enough, the multiplayer adverserially allow you to test your tactical skill against other people in a huge diversity of map.To conclude this is certainly one of the best RTS released in a long time.

												I absolutely love this game. If you like RTS or RTT, games like World in Conflict or Command and Conquer this is a good game to get. The game has amazing vehical and infantry combat, awesome graphics and a massive varity of units, vehicals, and weapons. The game is pretty realstic and has a lot of depth to it. Yeah, the voice acting is a little ""meh"" but it doesn't take away from the amazing experiance the game offers. You can double or even triple your amount of fun with mods for example, the Fields of Honor, Star Gate, World War 1, and Cold War mods. If you like real time strategy or real time tatics games this is good choice. If your like World War 2 strategy games this is a good choice. If you are bored of all your current strategy games and are looking for a new one, this is a good game to try out.*EDIT* MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: Recently Men of War Assault Squad 1's multiplayer has been shut down due to Gamespy closeing. Instead of switiching providers like other games did (for example Arma 2) the owner of the Men of War franchise decided to only switch Men of War Assault Squad 2's multiplayer provider. Thus, forceing fans to buy Men of War Assault Squad 2, which is a horrible game. So the only way to play multiplayer on Men of War Assault Squad 1 now is to use Gameranger. It is still a great game but without knowing how to use gameranger and haveing some friends, it looses what makes it so unique. And, since Men of War Assault Squad 2 is litteraly, a piece of crap cranked to keep up with Company of Heroes, Men of War's rival. All in all, MOWAS 1 is a solid good game but has no multiplayer.

But this Men of war game stood out, this game is probably the best RTS i have ever played. Of course there are some bad parts about these games (CPU Intensive) the gameplay overall manages to put it back on track.10/10 I cannot wait for Men of War: Assault Squad 2!Also i would reccommend anyone who wishes to own this game to purchase a CPU with a GHZ around 3.0. I reccommend this game to anyone who plays RTS games and who finds WW2 interesting.			"

												Ever wanted to fight a war, more so a World War that too in real time,than this is your game.It is an absolute mammoth of a game.Men of war assault squad is not for the faint of heart, so weak of heart read it  at your own risk. Men of war assault squad is a game well crafted ,to suit the need of any five years old ,who ever wanted to or did or does play with toy soldiers.The game has more than one campaigns and you can play in the skirmish mode as any of the allied nations,the common wealth even Germany.You start off each game with a basic squad and as you progress through, you have to capture enemy flag points to gain more troops or bonuses.There is smooth progression through levels as you capture each check point.At first generally light vehicles are allowed,at the next point you get your hands on heavier automobile troops.Than gradually bombers and even ship bombardments.One thing that is going to attract any tactician is the fact that as you play as various factions you have to face different terrain types like tundra,farms,cities,towns,desert, and in each you have to adapt to a different form of war fare.In some snipers may rule the roost, in others heavy tanks and infantry.Likewise you have at your disposal every ww2 unit type, that was ever used in this war in the game.There are realistic commands you can give to your units like suppress fire,fire machine gun,heal a unit,or drive a car.Which adds an aura of realism.As you play through various factions, you are deigned to face various battlefields which they faced in the war.There are typically nine flagpoints to capture, to win a level or a battlefield and each checkpoint is vital for even leaving one out can force you not to win the battle and proceed to the next level.The game is atmospheric for as you play you face different types of conditions in which to not just keep fighting but to survive with the forces at your disposal.There are many pros to this brilliant game--------------------------------PROS------------------------------+ You get hands on experience of the war fought eons ago at the touch of a mouse + You get it at a pocket friendly rate+ You get to experience what it was like commanding troops in the war+ realistic damage+ You get to change history as in the way battles were fought within a rigid storyline frame work--------------------------------CONS------------------------------Cant think of any and the game deserves its popularity but notabily there are two- No morale for infantry units - graphics are a bit out of dateAll in all a complete game,7/10 .Its definitely worth the buy specially at such low prices and more so for people who like to play with or have played in their childhood with toy soldiers attempting not just to recreate history but to relive it.

												This is basically Squad Micromanagement: The Game - World War II Edition.Player AI is brutally stupid and requires constant attention to stop your own soldiers from killing themselves. Visual indicators for FOV of the soldiers is nonexistent and the cover system is non-intuitive and unreliable.I tried to like this game. Three separate occasions, I started up the game and slogged through the tutorial and first mission, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Nope! You really DO have to manage each soldier's inventory during combat to find bandages to heal a wounded squadmate who is bleeding out while under fire! It's not NEARLY as fun as it sounds, believe me.If you look at screenshots of this game without actually playing it, it looks promising. Tons of weapons and items, vehicles. a cover system, everything you would want in a WWII squad command game, right? Then you try playing it, and it feels like a chore. If your game feels like a chore, theres probably something wrong with your game.			"

												This is a RTS very similar to Company of Heroes and Dawn of War. However, each soldier has an idividual inventory, requires ammo, has weapon proficiency levels that affect accuracy, can lose his rifle from shock, etc. Every little detail of war is thought of, such as scavenging dead bodies for ammo and a new helmet. Also, there is tons of mods available for this game that add plenty of new units and options. Another great touch is this game includes a built in editor that allows you to build custom maps and battles. All in all, MOW is a hidden gem among RTS games and is a great for those interested in WW2.If you are a fan of RTS games, you can't go wrong with Men of War Assault Squad!			"

												Coming from someone who was a big fan of Relic COH and Warhammer series, this is definitely way better. Pro:Amazing detail and realism. All ballistics are modelled physically. There is no life bar on tanks instead it depends of physics and penetration, any parts that are damaged will result different effect. A lot of different tactics to try out.Environments are very detailed and battlefield changes dynamically, building can be destoryed, wreckage block tank's path and create new cover etc. No two game played out the same way.For me it's a pro, there's a lot of micro management down to the manually manage ammunition of each individual soldier and gas up vehicles manually. Some player might not like this though.---Con: Graphics are functional, but nothing to write home about. Audio gets repetitive after a while, all units repeat the same lines to acknownlege your commands.The game is very unforgiving, be prepared to save an reload a lot. Even the best tank can be one-shot killed if you are not careful. Sometime feels like a puzzle game where you are carefully removing enemies' defence one piece at a time. At the writing of this review only 8.4% of players completed the first mission on normal difficulty, so don't be shy to start out in easy difficulty.No stories to speak of, just go from south part of the map to the north that's about it. If you want story you should try other MOW titles.The game model the ballistic of every bullets, so you need a good CPU, instead of GPUs like other games. Even on my i7 3770 the game can slow down in very large battles. Not game breaking but you should be aware of this if you have older machines.---Conclusion, Hardest RTS I've ever played, period. It is so cruel... Anyone up to a real stiff challenge should try this. I'd give it 8/10.			"

												8.7/10Pros+5 playable nations+Large array of WWII era weapons, troops, vehicles, and equipment+Realistic feel in terms of damage, weapon accuracy, vehicle stats+Sort of doubles as a ""Third Person Shooter"" (You can directly control units individually)+Beautiful visuals+Extremely well designed maps+Tactical Multiplayer Cons-Very difficult at first-The voice acting is beyond bad-Offers only a few levels per nation -No mode where you can customize match settings and location-Vehicle AI can be dumb at timesThis is a game I really enjoyed. The allure, to me, is that they went in a different direction with the typical WWII genre. You have games like Company of Heroes where they play as an RTS. This game takes what COH does well, and expounds upon it. There isn't much of a story, not that you really need one, I mean, it is based in WWII and you fight in major battles. The style is very much like any other RTS, except that it doesn't have base building, and you can directly control each unit. This, combined with beautiful level design, realistic weapons/stats/damage, and intuitive game play, and you get a very well put together game.With that ut of the way, I do have a couple of critisisms that irked me the whole way through. First and foremost, This game only offers 3 missions per nation. That's right, 3 mission. More can be purchased through Steam, but it is disappointing to see that this game isn't very long when it comes to single player. It also bummed me out that it lacks any kind of match making verus AI, like COH, or any other RTS. I don't know if that was a technical limitation, or what, but it makes the game developers look lazy, which is a shame, because this game is so well put together. Something else you will find out is how hard this game is. You need to be slow and thoughtful in your approach to each objective, because enemies can out flank, or over power you if you aren't careful. This isn't nessecarily a bad thing, as it shows how well done the AI is in this game.And I forgot to mention how bad the narrator is. He has the same voice for all of the nations. It is laughable.Look, if you are like me, you buy games when they are on sale. This isn't a game you should pass off, but I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. It is a load of fun, even though that fun is short-lived. And despite some replayability issues, it offers a multiplayer experience that will keep you in deep thought. Consider buying it if you enjoy a challenging, yet realistic experience.			"

												It's my firm belief that this is the most well-crafted RTS to date. The sheer amount of detail is staggering: Fully destructable environments and morphing landscape, fully realised unit inventories (guns, ammo, grenades, sandbags, explosives, knives, bandages; it's all there and freely tradeable between your soldiers), smart unit AI, direct control over any unit in the field, the best RTS cover system (brick walls actually stop bullets, as opposed to providing a 'defensive bonus') and realistic ballistics and damage models. Starcraft 2 looks like babbies first RTS by comparison.While good micro is still important, good macro, field awareness and tactical thinking play a more prominant role. Did Colonal T. Awesome get sniped while gunning down Fritz with his 50. cal? Then get Private S. Meatshield to go grab that machinegun, and do his mother proud. Your comms officer get blown up while trying to lay down an airstrike? Lay down some smoke and go grab his flaregun to finish the job!			"

												If you like challenging RTS with a really steep learning curve, this is THE game for you. Do not get discouraged at first by it´s complexity and micromanagement intensive oriented gameplay. Once you grasp the basics and learn to play the game on, at the least, mediocre level, you will thoroughly enjoy it. I recommend you play it with a friend or somebody who can guide you through the initial stage. You wil get sweared upon for being a ""noob"", you will get kicked, thrashed and sometimes utterly crushed. The only way to overcome this is by learning the game and outplaying your opponents.Most of the community is rather unfriendly towards newcomers, therefore you should stick together with a friend. Even though and older release, you can get a game going fairly easily.If you are a casual gamer who prefers simple click-and-drag games and linear FPS shooters, stay away ! If you are a hardcore RTS fan who likes the challenge do not hesitate and buy this game at once. You will love it.			"

												This is basically Squad Micromanagement: The Game - World War II Edition.Player AI is brutally stupid and requires constant attention to stop your own soldiers from killing themselves. Visual indicators for FOV of the soldiers is nonexistent and the cover system is non-intuitive and unreliable.I tried to like this game. Three separate occasions, I started up the game and slogged through the tutorial and first mission, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Nope! You really DO have to manage each soldier's inventory during combat to find bandages to heal a wounded squadmate who is bleeding out while under fire! It's not NEARLY as fun as it sounds, believe me.If you look at screenshots of this game without actually playing it, it looks promising. Tons of weapons and items, vehicles. a cover system, everything you would want in a WWII squad command game, right? Then you try playing it, and it feels like a chore. If your game feels like a chore, theres probably something wrong with your game.			"

												This is a RTS very similar to Company of Heroes and Dawn of War. However, each soldier has an idividual inventory, requires ammo, has weapon proficiency levels that affect accuracy, can lose his rifle from shock, etc. Every little detail of war is thought of, such as scavenging dead bodies for ammo and a new helmet. Also, there is tons of mods available for this game that add plenty of new units and options. Another great touch is this game includes a built in editor that allows you to build custom maps and battles. All in all, MOW is a hidden gem among RTS games and is a great for those interested in WW2.If you are a fan of RTS games, you can't go wrong with Men of War Assault Squad!			"

												This game was fun, hard, harder, then fun again. Don't play this game unless you are use to RTS games. I am not talking about Star Craft like games.This game will make you mad and make you happy when you beat a mission or destroy an opponent.I believe the online play is gone now as well. I played it a long time ago. My CD Key for the none Steam verison was not capable of being used on steam. And I ended up buying this game when it was on sale a year or two ago with its expansion packs. Wanted to play online, put in a log in and everything with the new CD Key from steam, was told my CD Key was used on another Email address. Called some people, looked up some stuff. Blah blah, was told I would have to pay 10$ for a new CD key. Never did. So, I quit playing this game. I also have some of the other MoW games. Same thing happen. So, I never played online with the Steam Verisons of MoW. Played through some of the Single Player. That got boring.But, Gamespy went out of buisness and the game stop being able to be played online unless you went through a 3rd party. So, I don't feel bad for not buying a new one. Just feel bad that I could not experience the game online as much as I wanted.But, like stated above, this game was fun, this game had great visuals. It required quick thinking, along with the ability to adabt and have loses without going crazy and destroying everything you have on a stupid move.Get this game, play it on Lan/IP with a friend. But, its going to get boring unless you go through a 3rd party to play with other people.			"

												Ah, my very favourite.The sheer amount of possibilities makes this a tremendous joy to play. Micromanagement overkill, no doubt about that. But not a single RTS comes close.From inventory management to direct control to repairing vehicles etc etc.... Welcome to Commandos meets Company of Heroes, best marriage ever.1C-Company, youre my heroes for creating this series since Soldiers: Heroes of WWII.			"

												I really like this game! It has graphics, destructive environments, and direct control, allowing you to take control of the IS-2 you just ordered in to the battlefield and destroy that enemy Panzer IV in a beautiful explosion while the building next to it crumbles down over it and it's supporting infantry.Objective variation is not good, not good at all. All the missions are: Take the battlefield... Also, some, or most maps end with the enemy throwing next to endless waves of tanks and infantry at your face... No ""Blow that tank up"" or ""Destroy that building"" objectives or anything like that. Not even secondary objectives! But if you have a good imagination you can issue yourself your own goals to follow. It's not neccesary, but it could keep you interested for a little longer. Of course not something like ""Take that heavily defended Flak 88 within one minute"" But i think you know what i mean. However, with all the nations: United Kingdom, USA, Germany, Japan, and Russia there are definately enough nation specific weapons and troops to keep you occupied for some time. Also, the variations from map to map and one the map are also quite good, for example the Overlord mission in the USA campain where you have to first, push up through a small village and then through open countryside, or the jungle in the first or second Japanese mission i don't remember the name of... And there's also a couple of mods i know that are worth trying out, like the ""Unlimited popcap"" for multiplayer, or Sirhinkels Skirmish maps for single play, or Cooperation. For something harder, that's more 'Trial and faliure' you could try the Carentan mod, which just adds one campaign, with one map. There's different ways to go to complete it though.			"

												This is a fantastic military strategy game.  I highly recommend it for gamers well-versed in the MOW series, or just RTS games in general, because of its long missions, somewhat complex combat and soldier-environment interactions, and, on the harder modes, diificulty akin to ramming ones genitals into a brick wall to try and break through. Still, this game is a blast with enough patience. With dozens of missions and fun co-op multiplayer, this is a great jumping-on point for the MOW series.			"

												One of the best RTS games out there, and the best game for watercooler stories about how some man named Randy Cox took a captured panzer and drove it into an enemy 88, crushing it beneath his treads and opening up an alley of attack for your glorious hordes, making himself the true hero of America.

												Its quite realistic and fun..the only annoying aspect is resupplying your troops is a hassle but while i haven't played 2 i'm told this issue was solved. and is some what 'auto' resupply there. but that doesn't effect this game.troops generally take cover and move realistically tanks aren't invincible if you have any form of anti tank..though tanks are actually quite vulnerable .-sends tank up to deal with a small group of infantry, unseen AT gun blows tank up- the multiplayer can be a bit annoying your forced to share ""MP"" which is military points used to purchase units. so playing with multiple people can become a hastle. it supports up to 8 players but i've only played with one other person. and its hard dividing it up between two people , let alone dividing it up 8 ways.the campaign doesn't have much in the way of a story its basically ""a 5 second intro"" and then it simply tells you to go from this objective to the next. theres no time limit in missions.and due to the realism and the somewhat direct manner of the maps -you can only usually advance forward its not usually possible to go around  the sides of the enemy -the game can be a little difficult and is quite time consuming . you can't save during Co-op(Skirmishes) .  but you can save in single player. for me battles usually took around 90 minutes.  but i'm the cautious try not to lose any soldiers type.difficulty levels of the game go from Easy, Normal, Hard, and Heroic.Heroic makes the game far more realistic soldiers rarely survive one shot.  lower difficulties they are more RTS like able to carry on for 5-10 hits.  the AI is a little unfair with its MP especially on heroic, you'll be rushed by NPC tanks long before you have the time to produce your own.Your units usually aren't very good at priortising targets and will some time require baby sitting if you don't want them to be murdered.Tanks often get confused an won't stay focused on the area you send them to. same with AT guns so often AI tanks will approach and your tanks will lose even if there in the perfect ambush positions. the units are detailed nicely. but the game to me is really fun. because i like planning and trying to work through the objectives.the DLC are pretty much the same scenario with the different nations. well..really most of the maps are the same battle/scenario just with the different nations themes. I recommend it if you like planning things out an don't mind spending an hour trying to accomplish objectives.			"

												For out there the people that likes strategy:-Most Realistic game you will ever play.-Awesome Gameplay you can direct control everything.-When you hit a tank from track the track falls or The suspension fails.It is not like Company of Heroes,Blitzkrieg etc. -Balanced nations-It is hard to learn but easier to master.-Tactics!! Tactics everywhere.-Direct Control makes this game the best game ever.-Try Sirhinkels Mod. Its the best!!9/10!!! Try Men of War Assault Squad 2!!!			"

												This game is no Company of Heroes, frankly. There's a lot more micro-management and realism involved. Soldiers and guns run out of ammo, thus forcing you to go scavenge some. Tanks are more fragile than you'd expect, forcing you to keep an eye on them. Explosions will knock people out of vehicles, as seen when I missed a Jeep with a rocket and everybody inside of it flew out of the vehicle from the shockwave. Enemies will push you back if they think they can stop you at the right time. However, this is all worth it because it will give you a lot of crazy ♥♥♥♥ing stories to tell.			"

												Following the announcement of the demise of Company of Heroes: Online set for 3-31-11, many fans, including myself, were caught off-guard and left searching for a replacement with as many similarities or even the possibility of something better to sink our bayonets into. Men of War: Assault Squads has this potential and already surpasses CoHO in a variety of ways. Even if you're still tooling around with vanilla CoH or any of the expansions and are tired of the hack monsters when attempting to engage in a simple multiplayer match, never fear, the developers seem to have those concerns in mind as well.Check out Youtube or elsewhere for some player made videos and see for yourself. If you're not a stranger to the MoW series, then think of this title as the polished and enhanced version of Men of War: everything you've been waiting for under one roof, so to speak. So, if you're a fan of WW2 RTS games, you won't be disappointed in the release of this well supported game. :-)			"

												I wanted to write a big review... but lets just recommend it for being so extremely detailed with many features, you can do so much crazy stuff that no one would've thinked of, i mean ... you can unequip the fuel tank of a flamethrower unit (every unit has its own inventory with ammo & equipment) and put it on the street, just let it there then use a rifleman or a sniper and control him manually (yes like a 3rd person game) wait for enemy units to pass, not even real players will notice that tiny fuel tank, and then shot it, if you did that to a real player he will think you're a hacker and rage quit thats just so amazing and just 1% of the cool thinks you can do in this game btw units dont have large health pools like in CoH, they can inmediately die after a headshot			"

Posted: September 25, 2015
												IntroductionDue to my fascination of World War II era tanks I soon found on the internet a PC game which I thought would meet my taste for tank conquest.  Men of War: Assault Squad is a strategy/tactical game that takes place during World War II. The user is allowed to play just about nearly every faction, with each having its own uniqueness. Pros/ConsI first bought this game in the middle of July, with the purpose of finding a game more sided towards tank warfare. Having already logged 40 hours since purchasing, I consider myself an avid intermediate user. An Ideal user of this game would be someone who is fascinated with PC gaming and can handle a couple hours of sitting. While I wouldn’t recommend using the most basic computer available I did find it was supportive on most basic systems that are relatively new. My 3.5 star rating was comprised of three things:•	Difficulty•	Faction Uniqueness•	Tank IntegrationDifficulty – This game is very difficult to the new user. Perhaps almost too difficult if not on the right setting. It took me a couple hours just to get the mechanics of the game and how to play it effectively. Ultimately, though this is a challenge and as a dedicated gamer I can never say no to a challenge. Faction Uniqueness – This aspect of the game left me with my mouth open. Unlike most other games, every unit faction is somehow representative of its country in terms of performance and equipment. Especially with tanks I found this the greatest, as no two tanks were ever the same.Tank Integration – I was actually a bit saddened by this part. I initially was looking for a game that was more individualized to tank play. While tank play in this game is one of the most important keys, I found it to be a bit limiting with their use as the tanks are just one aspect of an army. Compounded with the micro control of every unit and the tanks seem a bit down played.ConclusionOverall I was pretty happy about my purchase of the game. Being a college student, I can’t afford a nice graphics card at this time, and found this game was able to meet my demands for gameplay and entertainment. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a challenging strategy war game.			"

												Just gonna start out saying that I have put in far more time than it says on steam, and this used to be one of my favorite games. That has changed a lot now.The gameplay itself is lots of fun for me, but I am hating the game as a whole more every time I play. (keep in mind that I just play solo, with some rare co-op)AI is terrible. Infantry will take the dumbest routes to get to a location, and all the time i will lose armor because it decided to stare at a single enemy off to the side instead of watching the road that tanks were coming down.Balance is broken. Enemy armor and field guns seem to have much higher accuracy than mine. Also holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is it hard to kill things like enemy StuGs, but they can take mine out in one or two shots.And trying to get through Commonwealth missions is like trying to kick yourself in the head. Sure you can do it if you really try, but it's just going to hurt. They lack any usable anti-tank infantry and even their high cost vehicles can hardly take out the StuGs that they mainly go up against.			"

												I wanted to write a big review... but lets just recommend it for being so extremely detailed with many features, you can do so much crazy stuff that no one would've thinked of, i mean ... you can unequip the fuel tank of a flamethrower unit (every unit has its own inventory with ammo & equipment) and put it on the street, just let it there then use a rifleman or a sniper and control him manually (yes like a 3rd person game) wait for enemy units to pass, not even real players will notice that tiny fuel tank, and then shot it, if you did that to a real player he will think you're a hacker and rage quit thats just so amazing and just 1% of the cool thinks you can do in this game btw units dont have large health pools like in CoH, they can inmediately die after a headshot			"

												This game is no Company of Heroes, frankly. There's a lot more micro-management and realism involved. Soldiers and guns run out of ammo, thus forcing you to go scavenge some. Tanks are more fragile than you'd expect, forcing you to keep an eye on them. Explosions will knock people out of vehicles, as seen when I missed a Jeep with a rocket and everybody inside of it flew out of the vehicle from the shockwave. Enemies will push you back if they think they can stop you at the right time. However, this is all worth it because it will give you a lot of crazy ♥♥♥♥ing stories to tell.			"

												This game is truly an amazing RTS which features a butt tonne of stuff and thangs. I have owned this since early december 2014 and at first I thought it was not very special and it was pretty short due to the fact all factions just have 3 missions each which I still think is disappointing and the fact that you can get more missions for money I also find dissapointing but as soon as my friend said there is an editor for the game I suddenly could not stop playing it, I made alternate history campaigns for all the factions I liked and then it just got better with the mods; The UNIT mod and the cold war mods (1978 mod and the modern warfare one) are my recomended ones which are fantasitc, I do dislike the fact that there is a serious amount of mods that are the same for example ones which just give you the cold war or nukes or a reskin that gives people the face of Hitler and then the good mods are either dead or still not out. Nevertheless if you look you will find hella mods that you will love. all in all I give this a 9/10			"

Major differences include the fact that you can take over movement and fire for individual units - which is fun. The other difference is that there are more unit options and seems to be a little more in-depth rather than streamlined. I'm not 100% sure on the historical accuracy but also seems more accurate. Nice destructible environments.			"

												The whole focus of Assault Squad is multiplayer and with the servers down there is literally no reason to buy this game. I don't mind a game with a good multiplayer but in this case this should be marketed as a multiplayer only game since the ""campaign"" is boring and tedious to get through and is not a campaign at all but a series of capture the victory point missions. In singleplayer, every faction has basicly the same exact units with different names, you have to capture victory points and win then go to another map that looks the exact same and repeat the process in a series of completely unrelated missions. I personally prefer every other men of war game to this one because they have a good singleplayer campaign.			"

												>> Worse than Men of War: Assault Squad 2>> Far too complex, requiring the player to make individual-level management in a company scale game.>> Mortars lack smoke.>> Smoke is not effective.>> Morphine (reviving mechanism) itself and its manual management is an issue.>> AI requires the player to take manual control to solve issues far too many times in the match, sometimes of multiple units.

												I like this game, I recomend this game unless you can get men of war assult squad 2 (which I will refer to as mowas2 from now on). MoWAS1 is a very fun game and adds the WASD camera movement and right click to most things. The issue is with  MOWAS2 now out this game is obsolete. First off, since this game is very micromanagement orianted, which is not a bad thing in my opinion in this case, the old way of showing soldiers with big boxes on the bottom left doesen't really fit well. MoWAS2 is a newer game with update controls, graphics, and workshop combatibility. Although I like this game, with gamespy dying causing it to not have internet functions, I cant recomend it. Im sorry but this game gets beat out by MoWAS2. If MoWAS2 didnt exist then I would recomend this but I just I cant. Get this if you have the money, or if its on sale,  otherwise just get MoWAS2.			"

												This game is so completely polarizing.. The infantry is so good, as well as the emplacements and the even the vehicles, but all it takes is one enemy tank to put it all down the drain. Once a day or so, I've come back thinking ""maybe I'll figure it out, I must be missing something."" But every single time it's just as ridiculous when your AT crew rund out into plain sight (because apparently they think that infantry AT weapons only had a range of fifteen yards) to kill a tank and gets mowed down because he thinks that he's a siucide bomber.. Even taking manual control, it will hardly ever let you fire, and gives absolutely no reason why. Everything else is great, but this AT model is a vital component, that spoils the entire work.			"

												I'm going to be brutally honest here. I thought I was going to love this game, but I really don't. Everybody in all of the other reviews say how hard it is, and they're right. It's insanely difficult, but for stupid reasons. Whenever you tell your men to get into cover, they might do it and they might not. Whenever you tell your men to move from cover to cover while you're under fire, they will stop halfway, stand right out in the open, and get slaughtered, every single time, no matter how many times you tell them to keep moving. An entire squad of men will die in an instant, because they didn't do what you told them to do. This could be all my fault, because there are so many buttons to use that they had to resort to combinations of buttons to do even more things. Trying to remember what all the buttons do, is like trying to learn a new language. If I were going to learn a new language, it would be whatever language this game was programed in, so I could add a new button. I would call it, just do what i say, and when I push it, my men would have to do what I say. I've only played this game for a few hours, and I don't even know how many times I lost, because my men wouldn't do what I told them to do. I can't even begin to explain how frustrating that is. I honestly had to go smoke, because I was getting so mad. I can see how a lot of people really like this game, and ten bucks is a good price for it, but Company of Heroes is also ten bucks, and it's so much better. SO MUCH BETTER. I recommend that instead.SUMMARY-You will lose, many, many times, simply because your men won't listen to you. It honestly felt like I was telling a kid to do their chores. It's just a losing battle.			"

												Bought this in the bundle, so I don't feel I've wasted too much money on this game.I know, the time I spent on this game isn't too much. I'm still trying to play it.The game feels nice at first, but after a while you see all the bugs and lack of common sense among your soldiers that you want to throw your computer through the window.Your soldiers did a good fight, but end up without ammo, what do you do?Micromanage your units to refill their ammo! I know, realism... But in realistic game you would just put an ammo truck nearby your squad, so they can refill their ammo, and your units would do it!The amount of problems with pathfinding among your soldiers is so huge, it really ruins the experience with this game.You want to move your mortar unit?Gah! They can't move through there!You got a brand new and shiny m8 greyhound straight from factory!Bam! It is stuck on the streetlamp! Points wasted cause enemy comes and destroys it!Micromanagement would not be that bad in this game if your soldiers had some common sense so you could leave them alone for some time.I remember, that in original MoW soldiers weren't too bright, but you were in the control of smaller squads, so could pay them your full attention.What is nice in this game?Japanese campaign!

												The Men of War series of games are the exact same game, with different units and maps. There is no real difference between them.  So it doesn't realy matter which one you get. I have played All of them several times, including vietnam and assault squad 2. HOWEVER when you have purchased one title, please trim your fingernails and ductape them, otherwise you risk scratching your own face of, out of frustration over this game.First to the things that this game does right:+ Direct control of a unit - To be able to take control of a unit is fun, efficient and a nice feature that enables players who are not into RTS to accualy participate in the game as a coop unit.+ Sounds and graphic - This game feels very much like a real warzone, the sounds, explosions, fire, destruction of terrain and especialy the vehicles are excellent and there realy is no title quite like it. + Vehicle and hit zones - All vehicles have different vulnerability at different parts of it (like in WOT). Different parts of the vehicle can be disabled and will effect the performance of it depending on which part. For example, take out the tracks = no movement, damage turret = turret can't turn (cannon can still fire)+ Mission diversity - Im very impressed with the engine, because the very same engine that runs the small stealth missions, is also handeling the huge battles. The mission have a huge variety which enables all the titles of men of war to be almost equaly enjoyable.Now to the bad things <:,(- THE STUPID♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI! - This is by far the worst downside of this game, all positive aspects of this game is dwarfed by this horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ babylike thing. It doesn't take long to realise that your units will almost NEVER complete the most simple of orders. so multiple duplications of the same orders have to be issued for them to complete one. Im not talking about advanced orders here like minelaying or rearming. Im talking about simple attack, movement orders. They will also refuse to do some orders completely and some of the assigned orders have been out of order (spread out which has been avalible for all titles) since the very first title, nothing accualy happens when you push the assigned key. Medics don't heal unless clicking every single unit that has been downed. the list goes on and on and ON! Men of War has by far the worst AI I have ever seen in any game in my entire life (and I played games for more than 25 years). - Too advanced controls - The ability to control every unit of this game to such detailness as in this game is a double edged sword. To deal with the stupid AI, it is necessary to have advanced controls. However it also gives the game a very hard learningcurve. and a very simple misstake with handeling your units can cost you the victory in an entire game, both multiplayer and singleplayer.- Optimisation - This game despite haveing an old engine tends to cramp up when too much things are happening at the same time in one screen. I do believe the reason for most singleplayer missions to be small is due to this game not being optimized. The physics enginee gets overheated quickly when too much is happening at the same time, this combined with freecamera rotation can make it possible to crash the game if you tilt it too much so it reavels to great of an area of the map.

												It's a very simplified RTS. There's some countering. There's some building a lot of tanks to overtake the enemy really quickly. A lot of cheesing. It's meh. Not very involved. Seems to be more fun for those that don't play RTS often, or just want something to kill time.			"

												Could have been a great game. I only really play for single player, and the campaign missions are really dull and unimaginative. It is literally a 'copy and paste' job:-Go take over 1st line of flags to earn points for reinforcements-Enemy send troops and a tank when you capture a flag-Enemy tank is usually SLIGHTLY better than what you can afford or recruit-Finally get enough points or decent reinforcements, gets destroyed and then you have to wait until your points rack up again-Clear second line of flags-Repeat the above process for each flagDisappointed that virtually EVERY single level I have played so far has been the same. I can actually feel myself droning when I see the map and flags load up. The only saving grace is the map editor, but even then, it's not much better than the original Men of War editor and costs £4 less, plus the missions were more varied!			"

												I'll make this review simple.  There is no bots/ way of training for skrimishes.  You want to understand how to play before you face people that have played hundreds of games, too bad and screw you.  You don't get something in half a second, screw you and die.  Don't understand how the cover system works when half your squad runs forward, while the rest sits back and chills, screw you.  Don't get how to heal your units, screw you.  The long and short is, if you are like me and want to play a game for a half hour and chill at night.  This is not for you.  If you are a raging 13 year old who communicates via TeamSpeak and other BS online methods who can play 24/7, maybe this game is for you.  As for the explanation that a computer AI is hard to make that would be enough for this game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, there second game has AI.  I really don't care if they stand around and♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves, just have something so I can figure out what the hell is going on.  So as a closer, I'd sooner play Company of Heroes and CoH2 than this.			"

												This game is Company of Heroes except inconvenient and imbalanced. The inventory mechanics were a cool idea, but do not work well with the actual gameplay. I recommend you buy Company of Heroes 1 instead, as not only does it have great mods, but it is balanced and has fun gameplay. I got this game for $2.50 on sale, so perhaps it was worth the money.If the game didn't feel so bulky it would have the potential to be pretty good.			"

												Terrible AI. Terrible R&G once the unit count goes up beyond a certain limit. Lost a Tiger and a captured Pounder gun to a single Firefly, despite the fact I had a defensive advantage, go figure. I guess the game starts making leaps in calculating hit chances, damage and what not once the engine can't reasonably handle the number of units on the battlefield. I bought this game based on the recommendation of a friend, that it was very realistic and a great combat simulator overall. Now I see its not the case. Multiplayer is dead and Singleplayer is pretty much a slugfest with the AI, it just boils down to who can spam better. Might give MoW AS 2 a try, though I heard its pretty much the same.  Anyway, I don't recommend anyone to buy this game. Buy the newer one, or buy something else, I don't really care. But know that if you buy this game the only thing you're getting out of it is a horrible AI and a dead MP, a carcass of a game. Nothing more.			"

												This game is amazing, but with the recent closure of the online servers it is hardly worth getting unless you have friends that you can play with on a LAN network. The singleplayer skirmishes are dull and arent that challenging after you have completed a couple of missions. Its repetative and you feel like you are playing against a very old and slow computer. The computer doesnt punish you enough to make it challenging. You certainly cant play just the singleplayer on this game. The greatest part of the game is the multiplayer, but since that has been taken out of the game it has turned the game to trash. I cannot explain how much they destroyed the game by closing down the servers once MoW AS 2 came out. Dont get me wrong, I did enjoy playing this game a lot with mates. It is a laugh and can be some epic battles. I would absolutely reccomend this game if you have a bunch of friends that you see regularly. If you dont have mates that would come around to play, dont worry about getting it as it needs multiplayer to be enjoyable.If you absolutletly wanted a game like this then buy MoW AS 2 because this one just isnt enjoyable for long periods of time like it used to be.

												While it's an interesting game, there is a very steep learning curve. For someone who loves RTS games but sucks at PVP, this was a sorry disappointment when I learned I could not play cooperatively with a friend.The interface is wonky. It's difficult to select squads of troops and common controls like shift-click to select and deselect individual units do not function. The campaigns are incredibly frustrating even on easy due to very narrow maps an inability to flank your opponent. Furthermore the campaign is scripted and tedious even when you beat your opponent. It's a relentless process of bulking up your forces and smashing the enemy's defenses head on (because you can't flank) and then waiting two or three hours with no fast-forward while scripted enemy attacks send predictable waves of troops and tanks at you. That isn't strategy. That's turtle tactics followed by spam.Multiplayer options are harshly limited. There's no CPU players. Manpower points (currency to buy units) are extremely unclear. I don't know how to view how many you have or at what rate you gain more. Command points (value of units you are allowed to command) default to 80 which is barely enough for a couple of tanks, much less troops to support them. The max, which I think is 160 or 180 or something, still limits the size of your army more than I like. There's only one game mode and it's capture the points. What happened to bases? I'd like an enemy base to go destroy and experience a real feeling of victory. Not sit on a flag until the timer runs out in a glorified King of the Hill RTS.Men of War 2 is allegedly going to have cooperative gameplay. I look forward to this. Don't get me wrong--the concept of the game is a good one. But, don't spend your money on this unless there's a good sale going on. Otherwise maybe the sequel will be better. This one is interesting enough for me to be interested in the sequel.			"

												Interesting game, with lots of possibilities. Right up front, this game establishes itself as a hybrid RTS/Third Person Shooter allowing players to take control of individual units - tons of fun.This game utterly fails in that it forces players to micromanage their units constantly. Individual Soldiers will often get weapons shot out of their hand, and will not automatically pick up a new weapon. Players must constantly manage resources as well (fuel, ammunition). Vehicles have insanely unrealistic fuel consumption rates which forces players to scavenge fuel from 'dead' vehicles. I think I understand where MoW was trying to go, but I feel that the micromanagement piece just takes too much away from the fact that this is a combat strategy game. Combat should be the focus not exorbant micromanagement of all of my units.			"

												The game is very cheap and fun but It doesn't add much in terms of features compared to the original men of war.

The main reason to get this game over others is because the multiplayer actually works outside LAN and the modding community.			"

												The goal of this game is to see how long a man covered in gasoline can survive behind enemy lines, as he waits for his comrades to charge. Sometimes he will want to fix tanks but you have to coerce him out of it, because he doesn't actually know how to fix tanks, which is why it takes so long. Also sometimes he can pick up heavy machine guns and 5,000 rounds of ammo and goes rambo mode on some fools.			"

												I played the Demo of this first which included the first level and I absoultely fell in love with it. The realness and the ability to shoot through objects . The physics, cover , the AI level. The tools they were all perfect and just bought it after that. After which I have played the hell out of the campaign of this game. The only drawback that I could find is that it's rather short and I find myself getting bored of taking over the same maps over and over again and the multiplayer isn't as fun as I'd hoped.			"

												If you really want a Best Strategy game of WW2 or close to it, than this game its the best choice. unlike Company of Heroes, u can kill enemy from far away not when your troops face to face with the enemy and they still miss and take time to kill any solider from both sidesi will best start what you can do in this game where u cant do in other games and those are 2 things !!!1) you can create your own map, customize, create your own battles, and do a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥2) you can control each soldier and make him shoot anywhere you want. also if the enemy in the building, you can make your man to thrown it right in to the window. if the enemy in the trenches, and your man throw a grenade, the enemy will run away, so you can throw the grenade with few seconds delay.also this game doesn't LAG and its has only few bugs which will not make any difference at all in the game.this game looks much more realistic than any game had been created. you can realize that rush with bigger number of troops can still make you lose every thing, so its important to build line of defense and destroy enemy strong positions before assaulting againthere are 3 times of ammo for soldiers: rifle ammo, automatic rife ammo and machine gun ammo. if your soldiers wasted all his ammo, he can search for ammo in the enemy's bodies, allies bodies or share with another soldier. there are also special weapons like snipers, flame throwers, Molotov, rockets and anti tank guns. there are 2 type of grenades, anti infantry and anti tank.

												Best game series ever. See a building? Blow it up with a well placed artillery/tank shell. No? How about ramming your ♥♥♥♥ing tank into it, taking it down with any other person inside? What about shrapnels? Do you like shrapnels? I ♥♥♥♥ing love shrapnels. All explosions are not based on the laughable spherical ""blast radiuses"" but on flying razors that can cut your men 7 ways to sunday. If one of your unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s happens to be having his head over the trench when an artillery shell hits his position or a grenade hits the top side, you better ♥♥♥♥ing hope he's wearing a helmet and ducking or else you're going to have to scoop that♥♥♥♥♥♥for a brain of his off the ground. Disabled an enemy tank? Oh my, well did you know that you can open its inventory, take out that machine gun and ammo, then blast the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the enemy? What about the fact that you can repair it on the field and use it as your own? What about the fact that EACH tank and vehicle has REALISTIC armor, sloping armor (that actually worK), and vital spots (ammo storage, fuel storage, etc.)? You can blow off their ♥♥♥♥ing tracks, turrets, and barrels for crying out loud! The vehicles do not operate on the basis of the Company of Heroes ""health bars"" but on the basis of reality. Soldiers do no damage with their rifles. Tanks get damaged based on where they hit with parts breaking down, hulls being pierced, and hulls being blown to bits.The game puts Company of Heroes to utter devastating shame. Get it. Men of War: Assault Squad is the most refined of the series with the ability to call in reinforcements and so on. I prefer the older ones (Men of War, Men of War: Red Tide, etc.) as ammo and infantry are scarce, you are forced to scavenge, repair, and loot dead bodies for cartridges, tank shells, fuel, and so on. Good micromanagement.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad is a very good game. The single player campaign is very short and doesn't compare to the other campaigns in the series but what it lacks in single player it makes up in multiplayer.  Battle with players from all over the world as: The Soviet Union, The Commonwealth ( UK ), The United States, Germany, and last but not least Japan. Men of War: Assault Squad is one of the best strategy games out there, I would recommend this game for anyone a fan of World War II or a strategy game lover.			"

												I think its important that you undertsand that i REALLY wanna love this game, it has so much depth to it, but i just can't. What am i talking about? Well lets just get down to it.The game focuses on a ""reinforcements"" system like waves in a horde game, where you can buy reinforcements for the points you get from the flags on the map. These flags also unlock new toys to play with, and turns the point in your favour, giving you turrets and such pointing in the opposite direction. There are several ""clans"" to choose from, each having their own 'special' heavy weapons. There are the USA, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, The Japanese, And the Common Wealth, each having their own levels and obstacles.The game focuses on 'realistic' warfare, though i will say its much more realistic than Company Of Heroes, as each soldier has a bag pack with ammo, helmet, shovel, you name it. They can be divided into smaller or bigger squad of units or be controlled by the player in a simplistic way if you find that the soldier's aim is off. They have their own health bars and can do anything themselfs without relying on their squad to follow them, so you can take the rocketeer out of your squad, take manual control of him, run around your position, and blow up whatever that was pinning you down. Soldiers will even keep their head low while under heavy fire and sometimes heal themselfs in mid combat *Something that is allways useful when you're busy micro managing*.smaller Anti fortification and tank machines like mortars are also dynamic, as you can damage several parts of the map to clear a shot for your soldiers, or break a certain part of a tank. Is a tank Plowing down your formation? aim for the trackers. Is the gunner constantly cathing your soldiers? Order your soldiers to aim for the gunner turret. Not only does it feel amazing, its also neccesary to keep your waves up. Now... For the bad things. Remember how i mentioned the Ai is quite dynamic? Yeah, that's 30% of the time. The other 70% they will stand and glare at you before actually opening fire, or they will stand still INFRONT OF A TANK waiting for the 'throw grenade' animation to start. SPEAKING OF WHICH! One of the most important parts of the infantry is the ability to quickly get around or get rid of Armored targets, well somebody at 1C COMPANY must have had a good time when he decided your soldiers wouldn't be able to make up its own bloody mind when you send it to throw a grenade at a tank, leaving them 80% crawling slowly towards it while you furiously click on the 'stand up and charge it' button, leaving them open for a gang r^^e by turrets.Remember i mentioned this game is dynamic? Yeah, its so dynamic it dosen't even tell you what's good against what. Oh suuuure it gives you a in-depth look of how big the gun is, or how thick the armor is on the left side of what you're viewing, but if you don't know anything before hand about WORLD WAR 2, you're basically left to guess as to which tank is good against which. So you better whip out those WORLD WAR 2 war books kids, or else you'll be fu^^^^ harder than the Japanese fleet when they first fought the Americans.I really do think you can have a great time in this game, and there are a LOT of hours to be had here, but the AI problems and the lack of tutorilization on all the Panzer just leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I will however reccomend the game to you if you have ever wanted the Big Name countrys from world war 2 to band together and destroy some evil snowman tanks, or make a steak for the summer peace festival.

												Played this game for a long while. Even love it. Great experience. But as of July 16 GameSpy servers are down and it cant be played online. This game is not made for single player and does not contain a compain. So I would not reccoment buying it. Next best thing is Man of War: Assault Squad 2 which is identical to any of the Men of War titles (excluding Vietnam). If you want to buy later wait till the sale. It does not worth 30 bucks. 10 to 15 is the maximum reasonable price.			"

												This is the best WWII strategy game ever. If you ever played Soldiers Heroes of WWII or Faces of War - Men of War is their child. It's even better, it's fun and it's realistic in a way. Add an awesome editor to it and the replayablility value is endless.			"

												This game embodies the best formula for a strategy game to date. The gameplay allows for the greatest flexibility of any army, allowing for the maximum replayability and some of the most intesnese multiplayer skirmishes i've played.A simple well-placed infantryman can take out the heaviest tank with a single AT grenade. This is a good example of how the game lets you utilize units in the best way possible. Direct control allows the player to take command of any unit on the battlefield. Take a machine gun in order to better suppress the enemy, or command a panzer in a daring flank tactic.All in all this game is amazing, and one of the best game's ive played.			"

												A very good RTS title. Sadly, the multiplayer is full of try-harding russians. Obviously, most of the servers are russian too, so be prepared for a lagfest. But the singleplayer missions are very fun and even playable with friends. They get a bit repetetive though after a while.If you are willing to take a beating from angry russians and to once in a while play a laggy game, than this is definately a game to buy. EDIT: As there is already Men of War: Assault Squad 2 released, there really is no mre reason to buy this anymore. Everything what this game has, has been done better in MoW:AS2. You can even play real multiplayer games against bots, a feature that was long overdue.			"

												My opinion of Men of War: Assault Squad. I want to first start by saying that this game is well made. The game developers really took their time to evalute what can make this game a great title for the genre. I believe that a game like Company of Heros has nothing on Men of War as MoW has much more to offer. Pros: Variety of units to choose from. Game depth. From Squad command to individual control.Graphics and depthness of field.The physics are good for this type of game.Really well-made game in my opinion.Replayability. Which I think is the most important.Cons:Being a mainly Multiplayer game it should have a better multiplayer interface than gamespy.Once you complete the AI skirmishes, not much to do except buy DLCs, in terms of Computer vs Player.The AI itself isint the brightest. Could be better.Other than these cons there are a few smaller ones but I do not think they are worth mentioning.With the Part 2 comming out shortly, I hope that some of the kinks are worked out in the game and there is even more varied content from unit control to variety of units. With a new Multiplayer interface being the most important improvement I would make on a game like this. Especially some kinda offical server or matchmaking.I do recommend this game having about 200 hours played as of this review. Good clean fun. "

												The goal of this game is to see how long a man covered in gasoline can survive behind enemy lines, as he waits for his comrades to charge. Sometimes he will want to fix tanks but you have to coerce him out of it, because he doesn't actually know how to fix tanks, which is why it takes so long. Also sometimes he can pick up heavy machine guns and 5,000 rounds of ammo and goes rambo mode on some fools.			"

You can even use the buildings as a means of a surprise attack, with the field of view mode. Taking tank through the building and then killing troops on the other side is always fun!

												Buy this if you enjoy hardcore WW2 RTS action. The Editor alone is awesome if you learn how to use it, you can create your own battles and play them in the editor while still being able to place units/objects. Noteworthy is that the battles can go for aslong as you want if played on easy and to some extent normal, if your a slower-paced game. Though this game is very hard and you will find yourself using real tactics. Assault Squad is easier than the original because its not a campaign but more a sequence of battles where YOU control the types of units you have. Wait for 10 panthers or charge russian style with infantry, totally up to you. Very very fun game and LOTS of units to choose from.			"

Also has some great features and silly ways to destroy the enemy like throwing hand grenades into open top tanks to hit the ammo. No unit is invincible, yet some if not many do not fall easily to frontal attacks.Plenty of variety, has modding material, 40+maps, DLC is cheap, it's a great buy.Worth having in your library.			"

												This is one of the better RTS games I've played, the singleplayer isn't all too great but multiplayer is good. The game features realistic damage, ammo, fuel, repairing disabled vehicles, and other technical things. Though it's an enjoyable part of the game as it does not feel tedious to maintain units which will rarely live long enough to use up all their ammo or fuel.The only problem is most people who play this very realism-heavy game have less patience than a three year old, they don't dare stay in a game lobby for more than a minute. And when you do finally start you're lucky if you can play through a match without half a team rage quitting.Good game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.			"

												If you really want a Best Strategy game of WW2 or close to it, than this game its the best choice. unlike Company of Heroes, u can kill enemy from far away not when your troops face to face with the enemy and they still miss and take time to kill any solider from both sidesi will best start what you can do in this game where u cant do in other games and those are 2 things !!!1) you can create your own map, customize, create your own battles, and do a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥2) you can control each soldier and make him shoot anywhere you want. also if the enemy in the building, you can make your man to thrown it right in to the window. if the enemy in the trenches, and your man throw a grenade, the enemy will run away, so you can throw the grenade with few seconds delay.also this game doesn't LAG and its has only few bugs which will not make any difference at all in the game.this game looks much more realistic than any game had been created. you can realize that rush with bigger number of troops can still make you lose every thing, so its important to build line of defense and destroy enemy strong positions before assaulting againthere are 3 times of ammo for soldiers: rifle ammo, automatic rife ammo and machine gun ammo. if your soldiers wasted all his ammo, he can search for ammo in the enemy's bodies, allies bodies or share with another soldier. there are also special weapons like snipers, flame throwers, Molotov, rockets and anti tank guns. there are 2 type of grenades, anti infantry and anti tank.

												A very good RTS title. Sadly, the multiplayer is full of try-harding russians. Obviously, most of the servers are russian too, so be prepared for a lagfest. But the singleplayer missions are very fun and even playable with friends. They get a bit repetetive though after a while.If you are willing to take a beating from angry russians and to once in a while play a laggy game, than this is definately a game to buy. EDIT: As there is already Men of War: Assault Squad 2 released, there really is no mre reason to buy this anymore. Everything what this game has, has been done better in MoW:AS2. You can even play real multiplayer games against bots, a feature that was long overdue.			"

												I will say that after playing countless hours of this game, it is one of the best RTS style games ive come across, provided you are willing to use mods or create your own mods to supplement its lack of proper single player missions and fix some of the minor bugs that still exist.  While i just got a steam version (as the other retail one ive been using broke and i lost CD), so my hours on here may not appear like ive played this much despite having teh game beforehand.Unlike almost all RTS style games, this features direct control, and just like SHOWW2, an exceptional game for its time, makes combat alot more interesting then the usual point-click to tell a unit to go somewhere or attack a target.  You can manually engage cerain targets, drive yourself with WSAD, and control aspects liek reloading weapon, switching shell types, ect all manually.The armor damage modeling is great, and while a couple bugs do exist, with the rare tank that refuses to die to anything but dynamite, overall tanks behave like you would expect them to behave in say games such a WOT or WT (although even those arent 100% realistic when it comes to shell properties and penetration).  There are a few minor inconsistencies, here and there, and weakspots arent modeled, but overall great.With modded missions (or ones you make yourself) the game is truly amazing.  Many custom missions use units from teh game that are never deployed by the standard missions (for examle panzer 1, archer, jagdtiger, ect).  Some also are true campaign maps, such as the MoW 1 campaign port, and others.  The base game is exceptional when it comes to tools and resources it provides, but its default set of missions (even the DLC missions) tend to be rather repetitive, and aside from a different map, most of them feature the exact same set of units.The squad mechanic is very nice, units within a squad share ammunition, and will resupply evenly when picking ammo out of trucks or dead guys.  Its also possible to disable this squad featurem, and have the selection system function more like the old SHOWW2 with individual soldiers separate from each other.  There is one particular bug that was present since the original MoW game, and apparently has never been ""officially"" fixed.  The tanks do on occasion get stuck refusing to target anything until either manually controlled, or given a direct order to fire at something.  Its a quick fix with a mod i made, but its kindof sad to see a bug that can be fixed by anyone who bothers to actually open up some game files and look at the targeting code to fix.  One single .cfg file that repairs this issue.  Another minor bug (again fixable with a 1 minute .cfg edit) if the flamethrower infantry refusing to attack anything outside of manual control.  Perhaps this is intentional, as fully AI flamethrowers tend to ignite anything in between them and their target, but id still say their blatant refusal to fire is a bug.Finally, while not technically a bug, the AI in the game is rather primitive.  Dont get me wrong, with a few hours in teh editor ive managed to make the AI much better, but it would be nice if the devs actually spent a little bit more time improving AI, especially pathing on some MP maps (how annoying is it to send out a AT gun, and find it stuck up a tree near spawn when you needed it the most).  Also, with proper scripting in the missions, AI is able to repair damaged tanks, retreat and regroup when their squads are mostly wiped out, be agressive and defensive with the right situations, and just be a much bigger threat, but these things all need to be manually scripted into missions, and these arent automatically done by the AI, and many things like waypoints need to be tweaked on many maps to keep tanks from driving off staircases and flipping upsidedown (looking at 1st russian skirmish mission).  AI could use a major overhaul, and after trying AS-2 on a friend's machine, i have to say it hasnt improved at all in a game that at least on paper is support to be a true sequel (more like a large patch/DLC that shouldnt be more then $10).The default missions are rather repetitive, and even that is an understatement.  For example the USA campaign's 1st 3 missions are carbon copies of each other, every mission you get the exact same lineup of tanks, the exact same infanrty options, the exact same AT gun, ect, and the enemy is always the same, every mission you face the exact same german tanks, and the exact same infanrty at any given difficulty.  Yes the maps change, and one of them happens to have winter camo on vehicles, but aside from some maps being more open, and some being more urban styled, every single game is pretty much identical.  Now with mods, this can change, personally i run custom modded missions that vary the unitset, and actually add more unit options for friendly reinforcements, making the game less stale, and making each mission different, with some being more tank based, others infantry based, and also all of them having historical unit sets, with things like the sherman firefly removed from africa missions (firefly according to my knowledge wasnt ever deployed in africa).  With mods, the game is great, but without mods, not so much.Finally, while a minor thing that is fixed with my mods, the difficulty settings dont seem to scale that well in this game.  Easy is a complete joke, and normal isnt that easy, but seems to cut out all the somewhat hard to kill tanks.  Hard/Heroic are more my level, but the biggest issue ive found on these difficulties is so called infantry spam, where you literally have to deal with so much infantry a Wirbelwind will more or less be shooting non-stop, assuming it doesnt get killed by the tank rushes.  The difficulty ramping is alot a little bit out of whack, on hard/heroic, the missions are extremely tough initially, with the enemy having access to their top vehicles right from the start.  Expect alot and i mean ALOT of reloading saves on hard or heroic difficulty, as this level makes loosing just one tank lead to defeat.In conclusion, the game provided a very good toolset and baseline for many mods, but sadly, the default missions are a little bit stale, especially if you expected a true single player game that like its predecessors has some storyline, or varying missions that are different from each other and other nations.  The amount of bugs is very minor, all of them fixable with mods.  The AI is above average, and while they arent scripted that great in the stock missions, they are still a challenge, capable of swarming a position you left unguarded, or defending the spot that you are assaulting fairly well.  The direct control and vast array of units are why ive always enjoyed the entire series all the way back with SHOWW2, a truly great game, that this massively expands upon in so many ways.  The squad selection and better inventory management is a great improvement from SHOWW2.  I strongly reccomend this game, even over Assault-Squad 2, when its on sale.  75% off, its around $4, and its so cheap, that anyone who is interested in this series shoudl start here.  AS-1 features many mods, has been around long enough that the majority of bugs have been patched out, and is in my opinion teh best game in the series.  If you are looking for online MP, then i have to say you must get the sequel (err overpriced DLC), its the exact same game minus like 3 or so new vehicles, a couple HD models, and some reskins for soldier camo (which anyone with MSpaint can make in 10 minutes).  LAN gaming or direct-IP connections still work, so if you have friends, MP still functions, and is arguable less buggy then the so called sequel.  FInally, i suggest against getting the game of teh year edition as the missions there arent needed for using mods, where imo all the fun stuff is at.  The only reason i got it myself is for modding resources.			"

												Since i have started to play this game more now, i have found a lot of positive things but some negative things also so i want to start off with a small review here.POSITIVE:+ Good graphics, doesn't lag at all with everything on ultra+ Nice animations and the game engine is also good+ Realistic tank destructions+ Good at multiplayer, but unfortunately they closed the servers for this game...+ A lot of missions, weapons, soldiers and vehicles!+ Big maps and very detailed ones also, i personaly like the desert maps more+ Giant nations from WWII as the game is focused on: USA, Commonwealth, Japan, Russia and Deutchland+ Bonus mission if bought from steam!NEGATIVE:- The AI sucks and AI vehicles get stuck in every little stupid positions-Sometimes your own guy can't even jump over a sandbag...- Not many gamemodes, the game is mostly about attacking different checkpoints and when capturing checkpoints the game gets harder and bigger armored units will spawn and attack or start to defend.. At end of the game on any nation you have a gamemode about defening positions & later on attacking the enemy positions! But could be more for example more objectives and such...- Servers closed = No multiplayer- A tank crashed to a small wall and my tank flew to air doing a barrel roll landing upside down killing my crew, wtf logic?- Glitches as said above ...I recommend you to buy this but since Assault Squad 2 came, i recommend buying it instead :)			"

												I bought the GOTY edition awhile ago for $9 I think. I'd reccomend waiting for a sale to buy this game. It's not really worth full-price.Pros-Gameplay has it's own taste in RTS-Graphics are nice and eye-pleasing-The dialogue of the narrations are a bit dodgy but the in-game dialogue of troops is very immersive-Sound effects are immersive and clear-The game isn't hard on machine specs-There's a big community behind the game and lots of fun mods are out there-The special missions: the summer BBQ and the tower-defense styled Christmas maps are very fun to play, especially with a friend on LAN-I haven't run into any significant bugs, although sometimes troops might get lost beyond the border of the map or vehicles might bump into an obstacle and magically get stuck to them.Cons-Singleplayer missions can feel repetitive-No multiplayer servers after MoW 2 was released-Not worth full price IMO, I bought the GOTY edition for $10-Spawning in more units can make the game a bit choppy. A good CPU would be recommended for smooth gameplay throughout the gameOverall, the game makes a good stand and I've enjoyed most of my time on it 8/10 swag			"

												This is one of the best RTS games I've played to date. It has very realistic battles, and you can lose an entire squad in few seconds if you aren't careful. Unforgiving and frustrating, yet I keep coming back.This game doesn't look as great as Company of Heroes, but the trade off is the environments is very interactive, and reactive. Everything can be destroyed, and I mean everything. The gameplay is where the money was spent, and it is a refreshing take on how to make a game.There is a feature that lets you take control of indivudual units, infantry, tanks, etc. This feature make it unbeleiveably fun to play. You can take control of a tank, aim for an enemy tank's gun barrel, and damage their barrel so they can't fire anymore. Or track, or engine.... strategy runs deep with this game.Overall, extremely satisfied.  "

												I have a love/hate relationship with the Men of War series in general.  On the one hand, if you are looking for an accessible World War 2 RTS that focuses on tactics and realism there is really no other option.  On the other, the game can be such an unbalanced mess with dumb AI that it will make your head spin.The main issue with MoW: AS is that the developer can never seem to get the game quite right in terms of balance or content.  It feels as if they just had a bigger budget or better research the game would be amazing.  As it stands the game only really shines if you mod it and there are quite a few good ones out there.  I would only recommend MoW:AS if you are already a fan of the series and are willing to mod the game or you find it on a Steam sale and want to try a World War II RTS other than the ""arcadey"" Company of Heroes.

												A mortar is an indirect fire weapon that fires shells at low velocities, short ranges, and high-arcing ballistic trajectories. It is typically muzzle-loading and has a barrel length less than 15 times its caliber. A mortar is relatively simple and easy to operate. A modern mortar consists of a tube into which gunners drop a shell, which is usually referred to as a bomb. The shell contains a quantity of propellant. When it reaches the base of the tube it hits a firing pin, which detonates the propellant and fires the shell. Some larger caliber mortars have a string operated firing pin instead of a fixed one. The tube is generally set at between 45 and 85 degrees angle to the ground, with the higher angle giving shorter firing distances.			"

												Great game with some sandbox features that you can use with the editor that it has.Furthermore the in-depth action and the reality of the hardcore warfare with it's physics and graphics that really stand-out in game.The dialouge from the charcters creates more immersion while playing and the explosions (evry1 loves explosions) are fantastic.Nonetheless to be able to pick your own country go through it's campaign then save the mission go to another and besides that theres not actual real objective while playing except you have to capture command posts.The modding community is awesome too.With various ranges between futuristic stuff all the way to ww1.I'd reccomend this game to a person who would take alot of time with it and mod it.Otherwise this game is just amazing and it will always be because of the communitys.

												My opinion of Men of War: Assault Squad. I want to first start by saying that this game is well made. The game developers really took their time to evalute what can make this game a great title for the genre. I believe that a game like Company of Heros has nothing on Men of War as MoW has much more to offer. Pros: Variety of units to choose from. Game depth. From Squad command to individual control.Graphics and depthness of field.The physics are good for this type of game.Really well-made game in my opinion.Replayability. Which I think is the most important.Cons:Being a mainly Multiplayer game it should have a better multiplayer interface than gamespy.Once you complete the AI skirmishes, not much to do except buy DLCs, in terms of Computer vs Player.The AI itself isint the brightest. Could be better.Other than these cons there are a few smaller ones but I do not think they are worth mentioning.With the Part 2 comming out shortly, I hope that some of the kinks are worked out in the game and there is even more varied content from unit control to variety of units. With a new Multiplayer interface being the most important improvement I would make on a game like this. Especially some kinda offical server or matchmaking.I do recommend this game having about 200 hours played as of this review. Good clean fun. "

												Amazing! I love this game so much,The game goes a little more in depth then most games do. Troops, tanks etc can run out of Ammo and fuel. There is a massive sense of front line fighting in the game too.The destruction is amazing! Hiding behind buildings, walls and trees or even high grass can not save you from Artillery! You can even use the buildings as a means of a surprise attack, with the field of view mode. Taking tank through the building and then killing troops on the other side is always fun!

Your units behave as you would expect them to and you aren't brought out of the experience by silly stuff all the time. There is a ton of options available from inventory management to repairing captured enemy vehicles.There is a nice variety of maps and i greatly enjoyed the fact that you could play as so many differents nations in so many different locations. Overall it was just a really nice game with a ton of content in it. I had some framerate issues here and there but it didn't have any major impact on my experience.			"

I have alwayse enjoyed this game, but if you want to aswel you must know the AI Both is MLG and complete crap, they will sometimes not shoot the guy in front of them or 360 noscope him, literally. Another good part about it is watching an infantryman with an AT grenade chase down a tank, then take a HE round to the chest, then get up. It is honestly a fun game + it is ten bucks right now.

												Yes yes yes a million times yes, this game provides nigh infinite replayability and is built very solidly if at first confusingly. furthermore it provides a very realisitic experience and plus it has a GEM editor which allows you to create your own battle maps units ETCETERA, alll in all, one of the best games i've ever played.

												Okay, for a small review for people who just want a short overall review, I give this an 8/10 due to its realistic workings, but buggyish AI and performance issues.But if you want, I will tell you a bit more in detail.Men of War: Assault Squad is a game that is oreinted around multiplayer(Although I wish it had a bit more work for the skirmishes and possibly a campaign). Its in WW2 and it has 5 factions. USA, Soviet Union, Germany, Japan and Commonwealth. Japan is the new faction introduced in this game. Overall, the game is realistic to the max, with lifelike workings and atmospheric battles. The only things that make up cons is the somewhat buggy AI and performance issues.Pros:Realistic battles.Atmospheric battles.Large skirmish campaign.Decent multiplayer.Decent amount of factions.Overall great RTS experience.Cons:Somewhat buggy AI.Performance issues.No story campaign(Although I know its not oreinted around it, but it would of been nice).For examples on the AI, I was on the first Soviet Union skirmish battle and I got one of the APC things. I moved it to a bridge and then tended to some units across the bridge. I came back to it and found it hanging off the side of the bridge. Tried to move it, didn't budge. Then I ordered the units to get out onto the bridge. It took me around 10-15 minutes to get them all out, and one of them went the totally opposite way and jumped off the bridge. Ive had some other misc. AI problems, but those are just common little problems. Thats why I said somewhat buggy AI, not completely buggy or bad AI.Hope this helped, and you should buy for sure.8/10Well, between 8/10 and 8.5/10.So basically, I recommend to get this if you can handle a bit of lag and slightly buggy AI.

'all stealthy'... didn't work.. game up and went with the 'commander/general approach'... meaning.. I was just generating artillery an assigning to my friends I was playing with, this enabled them to concentrate on the game while I was giving them what they needed. I could look around the map and see were things were coming from, have a tank appear close to were the main enemies were.			"

												One of the best strategy games of all time. This gives the player the most control and demands a formidable amount of micromanaging. From stealing tanks, switching helmets, taking guns, and going into direct control mode this game offers so much. The map editor is excellent and there is a great modding community. I bought Men of War when it first came out, and have put many hours into several of the games. The Steam versions of the Men of War games run so much better than discs and pirated copies. So purchasing is worth it.			"

												This game is good. Sure you may need a decent computer to run it, and you really need it for the editor, but if you do then it is a good game. it looks nice and has some very uniqe RTS gameplay (at least with the RTS's ive played). The Editor is not an actual option at the main game which is a little wierd. You have to go to the games directory to get to it. The Editor is also very hard to use. I couldnt even load a map without looking up a video. All in all good game, some bad things like framerate for computers not made for gaming, also the game can be very frustrating at times. And the editor just eats your framerate. AND THIS IS A WARNING FOR THE EDITOR! DO NOT SET OFF MORE THAN 1 NUKE UNLESS YOU HAVE A BEAST PC! I have a more than Decent PC and my fps drop to 2 from 130fps SO BE WARNED!			"

												It's basically a Company of Heroes clone but with a bigger focus on realism and it has really cool destructible environments and a ton more options for controlling units, but there's no base building (you just call in units from outside the map and stuff which isn't as fun as building a huge base but it's not the worst thing ever either). You can even control units directly and the game becomes like an top down shooter game.It's kinda buggy sometimes like the pathfinding isn't the best and you gotta just babysit units occasionally to make sure they even get to the right destination and it's kinda basic and bare bones with the options it gives you when setting up multiplayer matches too.Basically it's okay and still fun and you'll probably like it if you like Company of Heroes or WWII RTS games.

												Okay, so i didnt buy this game on steam, but i own it. The problem im having, is since i didnt buy it with steam like most people, i cant play on the multiplayer with my friends, or at all. If i had bought it with steam, i could have. This is REALLY annoying, because im not spending 20 more dang dollars on it again.Other than that, 8/10. The gameplay is awsome, everything looks cool, but it could do with a little more realism. For example, i have a squad of soldiers, and a tank shoots them. Their helmets hit the ground, bodies disappear, a little few blotches of blood. A tank would send you flying in diffrent directions. Grenades too, RPGS's, any explsoive really. So the blood and gore factor could be better. Thats about it, i really love it other than that. Also, some buildings have ladders on it, yet my men cant climb them. Some buildings they can though.Othe rthan that is great!			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad is a brilliant game. Unlike most RTS games, where numbers are the way to win, MoW:AS doesn't do that. To win a battle against a Tiger tank you'll need more than a bunch of Sherman tanks, you'll need 1 guy with a bazooka instead of wasting tons of your own tanks against it. AS requires gamers to think quickly and act fast because the lives of your men count on it.the GEM editor is also SOOOO fun to play around with and many good mods are out there for this game.The A.I. also is not very realistic in its tactics but it is deadly and knows how to shoot!Gameplay- 9/10A.I.- 7.5/10Overall- 8.5/10			"

												I have played many RTS games and this is definately one of my favourite. It may only be my favourite because I havn't played an RTS of this style before (been playing things like Command & Conquer and Warcraft). This game pushes more towards micro-managment than spamming in loads of troops to destroy your enemies which is why even though the multiplayer doesn't work (however I have heard of things that can let you play on multiplayer) the campaign will give you many hours of gameplay and if you are a fan of the RTS genre then I definatly recommend this to you.

												Assault Squad is pure, gritty, and often unpredictable, battlefield strategy. Tank combat is seriously satisfying and the ability to directly control any unit opens up a degree of precision not possible in other titles. However, the learning curve is steep; the gameplay principles and mechanics will initially feel unnecessarily complex, demanding an unprecedented level of micro-management and awareness. The plethora of units to choose from, overwhelming and mistakes are unforgiving. Past that curve though, lies a deeply rewarding experience where the realism and intricacies of the game become extremely immersive.			"

												Great game, but definitely not for competitive players. By that I mean if you're like me and you hate losing, you should look elsewhere for your wargaming. The AI is apparently managed by The Amazing Kreskin because they know exactly where you are at all times and exactly which units you have. If you make a move, they react immediately and without hesitation. This usually ends with a total failure in 90% of your missions. You will be restarting over and over for hours on end. Oh did I mention this is on Normal difficulty? I'm not sure why they would even include the Hard or Heroic difficulties because I can't imagine it being remotely fun. As far as I know, on Heroic the enemy would have pocket nuclear bombs, laser guided missiles and stealth bombers. During WWII. There are certain missions where you will literally gasp at how completely you get beaten by the AI. There is no time to dig in because the longer you wait, the more tanks they bring out. I have never seen the AI run out of tanks either. On the campaign mission 'Overlord' for example I had 33 enemy tanks and tank destroyers on the map. Yes, 33 of them - I counted because I didn't think it possible. Granted they didn't get 33 out at once, but they had that many in reserve and until the very end of the mission they kept rolling them out two at a time, every few minutes. You will have enough Reinforcement Points for at most 10 tanks/tank destroyers, and that is only if you last long enough. The real kicker is when you complete around 80% of your mission objectives the AI will throw everything they have at you, and each soldier is a military genius. Seriously, any AI grunt unit in this game would make Erwin Rommel look like a mental midget. Not to mention It takes just one single grunt to run up to your capture point and the game is over, mission failed. There is no ""turnaround time"" or anything. You either have the capture point or you don't. There is a ""flag raising"" animation when you capture or lose a point, but it's just for show and is not a timer - If the flag begins to move, it's over for either you or the enemy (99% of the time it's you).

Seriously.-Vehicles can be repaired after taking damage, but don't expect to have a quick repair, at least not after any kind of serious damage.-Vehicles can run out of fuel, adding a huge tactical element (Dang it Germany, Y U NO USE JAPANESE CARS!? )-Well populated map with lots of nooks and crannies to explore and setup mortars and other Defences-Awesomely huge fighting when it turns into an infantry-based battle, with ALOT going on.-Real sense of accomplishment when you complete a long, intense, battle against all odds-Runs on Windows 8/8.1 without any issues-Great ingame music-Very well optimized, even for lower-end, aging machinesCons:-A battle on harder difficulties can last 4-5 hours towards the end of the game, so this can go either way-Can get campy-ish towards the end of a mission, due to the AT guns and the trenches,etc..

												By far the best game editor i have ever used. Massive numbers of men, tanks, cars, and even planes are at your disposal to wreak havoc upoun those who dare to oppose you. epic battles that are spun way out of porportion are fun to play and make. the only downside is that you must have a rather good computer if you want large battles.

												Assault Squad is only skirmish based in singleplayer mode. But belive me its good fun playing it.This one of the best series of RTS ww2 games i have played (( Men of War )) Collect them all if you enjoy ww2 rts games you will not be disapointed.Gfx and music is great and the sfx is fantastic. Using the games enhanced mode controll is good fun and extra enjoyment to the game. All of Men of War uses this controll method.One thing that disapointed me is that this game uses GAMESPY wich is now closed down. So no Multiplayer online without extended tools. But Lan and singleplayer is a blast with our without friends. If you want online support you should buy Men of War Assault 2 wich has steam online support.			"

												This game is what all stratagy games should be. You can manage a single person and their ammo. You can take a .50 Cal off of a jeep and use it or repair enemy tanks and use them for yourself. This game is missing nothing the only thing that sucks is that multiplayer is down due to gamespy not being a company anymore. You could use other alternatives like hamachi or port forward or other things that will allow you to play with others. This game deservers more than what it has been given and the fact that it was made in 2010 and it still beats other stratagy games. But thats my opinion.			"

												I have a love/hate relationship with the Men of War series in general.  On the one hand, if you are looking for an accessible World War 2 RTS that focuses on tactics and realism there is really no other option.  On the other, the game can be such an unbalanced mess with dumb AI that it will make your head spin.The main issue with MoW: AS is that the developer can never seem to get the game quite right in terms of balance or content.  It feels as if they just had a bigger budget or better research the game would be amazing.  As it stands the game only really shines if you mod it and there are quite a few good ones out there.  I would only recommend MoW:AS if you are already a fan of the series and are willing to mod the game or you find it on a Steam sale and want to try a World War II RTS other than the ""arcadey"" Company of Heroes.

												MOW:AS (pronounced MO' A$$) is a fun and action-packed RTS game. You are able to command forces from Japan, Germany, England, the USA, and Soviet Russia through the campaign or against other players. Movement and deployment of units is intuitive and can be done from the perspective of the general or the unit itself. The one thing that's frustrating is when the enemy who you are attacking has artillery and especially anti-tank guns, when this situation arises it is almost impossible to resolve unless you are playing as Englend in which case you have the power to take those guns out with your own heavy artillery. Russia also has heavy artillery, but it is not as good.			"

												MoW: AS is a very tough RTS. You have the ability to control anything from a single soldier to an entire platoon. Combat is intensely realistic as a platoon of infantry in the open can be cut down in seconds. Tank on Tank combat is excessively realistic to the point where most players learn why many strategists would only use tanks with infantry escort. Tracks can get blown off, guns can get destroyed, crew can get sniped from inside of the tank, and ammo racks can detonate, all depending on where a shot is placed. If a tank is damaged, it can be abandoned, or the crew can leave the tank to repair it and get back in.Aside from Tank on Tank combat, Infantry combat also feels very fleshed out. Units can and will be suppresed (however, there will be no alert, they will all simply just fall to the ground and crawl to the nearest waypoint you set for them), as well as realistic logistics. No unit has infinite ammunition supplies, and if you're running low, your best option is to loot an enemy's corpse for extra ammunition, as ammunition types are universal amongst weapons with examples such as: Rifle Ammo, Pistol Ammo,  Shotshells, Machine gun belts, ect. This may not be completely realistic, but it's enough to keep the game steamlined just enough to keep gameplay fun, but not mindless.My only complaints are:- There is no Players vs. AI settings in the game- Server connection is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will constantly get a message saying ""Connecting to server"" every fifteen to twenty second. It lags the game for a half second to two full seconds, and is definitely enough to ruin the intensity of a big firefight.- Units are hardly autonomous. Unless you purposely want units to sit in a defensive position, you have to intensely micromanage your troops and vehicles. If you leave any unit sitting idle for long enough, it WILL be killed.- In multiplayer matches, there is no ""deep striking"" infantry unit (like American paratroopers in CoH) that can spawn where you click on the field. 173rd Airborne and Fallshirmjager are just basically elite infantry units, and hold no strategic value over your typical run-of-the-mill G.I.'s or Grenadiers.Overall the game is great, but the lack of the Player vs. AI option kills it imho. I'd recommend this only so a friend can have a taste of what a true WWII FPS should feel like, only to go back and play with what MoW: AS had failed to compete against.			"

												Game develpoers are a joke, I expect the 2nd games will be just as bad. If you enjoy a game that has an AI that makes any sense and difficultlies that are not punningshing to your ability to overcome obsticules than this game is not for you.Examples:1. As a seasoned RTS gamer I figured that stating on Normal Difficulty I would have a bit of a challenge and be able to learn the ins and outs of the game, I found that most of my time was spent creating new units to replace the old ones that had been destroyed by enemy forces. Now this isn't uncommon but when this happens after every advance i made into enemy terretory it creates for a very slow game play.2. After managing to gain a foot hold on enemy ground, I was counter by an anti infantry vehicle, the WWII version of a BTR. This unit absolutly wrecked my units, so I sent in a tank to deal with it while my infantry cowered behind cover. Once I got the tank in a made quick work of it, but then meir seconds later a enemy rock hits my tank and destroys it. This is common on how the games AI seems to work, after I spend my very limited resorces to deal with an obsticle the enemy seems to just get luck and destroy my now big advantage.3. So after all this I decieded to turn the difficulty down and try again on these leves, all this did was increase the time it took for the enemy to react to my decision. Resorces, starting units, unit intellegence, and difficulty was still the same.A good AI would be adaptive, responding to what I do and most inportantly not god like. I shouldn't be punished everytime I advance and overcome obsticules, especially when I have limited resorces to use.All in all I found this game to be unfun because of these points.			"

At end of the game on any nation you have a gamemode about defening positions & later on attacking the enemy positions! But could be more for example more objectives and such...- Servers closed = No multiplayer- A tank crashed to a small wall and my tank flew to air doing a barrel roll landing upside down killing my crew, wtf logic?- Glitches as said above ...I recommend you to buy this but since Assault Squad 2 came, i recommend buying it instead :)			"

												Okay, for a small review for people who just want a short overall review, I give this an 8/10 due to its realistic workings, but buggyish AI and performance issues.But if you want, I will tell you a bit more in detail.Men of War: Assault Squad is a game that is oreinted around multiplayer(Although I wish it had a bit more work for the skirmishes and possibly a campaign). Its in WW2 and it has 5 factions. USA, Soviet Union, Germany, Japan and Commonwealth. Japan is the new faction introduced in this game. Overall, the game is realistic to the max, with lifelike workings and atmospheric battles. The only things that make up cons is the somewhat buggy AI and performance issues.Pros:Realistic battles.Atmospheric battles.Large skirmish campaign.Decent multiplayer.Decent amount of factions.Overall great RTS experience.Cons:Somewhat buggy AI.Performance issues.No story campaign(Although I know its not oreinted around it, but it would of been nice).For examples on the AI, I was on the first Soviet Union skirmish battle and I got one of the APC things. I moved it to a bridge and then tended to some units across the bridge. I came back to it and found it hanging off the side of the bridge. Tried to move it, didn't budge. Then I ordered the units to get out onto the bridge. It took me around 10-15 minutes to get them all out, and one of them went the totally opposite way and jumped off the bridge. Ive had some other misc. AI problems, but those are just common little problems. Thats why I said somewhat buggy AI, not completely buggy or bad AI.Hope this helped, and you should buy for sure.8/10Well, between 8/10 and 8.5/10.So basically, I recommend to get this if you can handle a bit of lag and slightly buggy AI.

												very good every thing you do has a counteraction by the AI and it can be very unforgiving when it does so. you can play for hours on one countries campaign and then do it again on another one and it doesn't get old because the AI always does something new			"

For who Men of War: Assault Squad is best suited : - World War 2 enthusiasts who enjoy a more immersive gameplay experience; players who find Company of Heroes to be way too casual; and PC Strategy gamers who aren't afraid of a challenge. Quick Summary: - Tactical, strategic, detailed, complex, challenging, and realistic style of game-play where battles actually feel like war, troops feel like individual soldiers, and you will feel like a great general coordinating it all. Very refreshing since most RTS games on the market tend to boil down to a simple blob-based brute force combat system. Not here! - Features extremely impressive cover based (best I've ever seen), destruction, and combat systems superior to its direct competitor (Company of Heroes) with a graphical engine that can be considered its equal if not greater due to a more pleasing zoomed out camera in Men of War. - Comes with a decent but far from perfect user-interface. - Doesn't feature a true single player narrative campaign, but rather a ""skirmish"" game-mode when it comes to single-player. In that sense it can be considered a more of a multi-player centric experience (either against other humans; coop with friend(s) against the AI; or you taking on a single AI solo). - Probably its only true weakness is the game suffers from some unnecessarily complex resupply mechanics. Really, its too complex and tedious for a real-time strategy game on this scale. It seems to be a left over relic from the earlier Men of War games which were based more on small squad oriented gameplay (like the Commando's series.) Final Thoughts: What 1C was able to create here is a truly impressive feat and I highly recommend at least giving the demo a try. It features one of the single-player skirmish maps and will give you a great sense of what Men of War Assault Squad is all about.			"

												this game is super fun and if u are looking to play multiplayer on this you cant unless you give your friend your internet WAN ip.And they do the same. If you want to know how to find the right ip to do direct connect, (search what is my Ip) and it will pop up.1. get ip2. go to options, then multiplayer. then put in friends Ip and tell your friend to put yours in 3. Have someone or you start a match and make sure its a LAN match 4. go to LAN and you should find your friends match with some luckKeep in mind this dont work all the time but its worth a shot			"

												. Pros:Easy and simple controlsfun play at your own pacedecent graphics for the system requirementscons:Lack of content ( no single player just a handful of skimish maps for each playerable nation)Misleading ad , the game is very small and the DLC dont add much content and are just a way for the devs to take your money. overall the base game is worth buying for the price its at but the DLC are a waist of money and add almost no content.its similar to ""company of heroes"" not as good as ""command and conqure"".

												It's basically a Company of Heroes clone but with a bigger focus on realism and it has really cool destructible environments and a ton more options for controlling units, but there's no base building (you just call in units from outside the map and stuff which isn't as fun as building a huge base but it's not the worst thing ever either). You can even control units directly and the game becomes like an top down shooter game.It's kinda buggy sometimes like the pathfinding isn't the best and you gotta just babysit units occasionally to make sure they even get to the right destination and it's kinda basic and bare bones with the options it gives you when setting up multiplayer matches too.Basically it's okay and still fun and you'll probably like it if you like Company of Heroes or WWII RTS games.

												If, like me, you've been looking around for a brilliant, satisfying WW2 game, which is not really bias, and reasonably realistic, then look no further friend.Men of War: Assault Squad, was a sale bought gem which, finally, sated the void that Company of heroes left. In RTS games nothing is more infuriating than watching your soldiers shoot down a health bar, like something out of bloody runescape. Not in this game, no sir. You charge a machine gun with your squad? That squad is 99% certain of being mown down in seconds. Instead this game does what most RTS's don't, it forces you to learn, adapt, and become efficient at managing multiple units accurately. Unlike company of heroes, when they talk about needed combined arms to advance, they really mean it here. You'll need to learn the best ways to knock out anti-tank guns, which is usually done by tank rushes, mortars, or massed infantry assaults, (the middle is the best way i find). You'll need to learn to deal with a constant flow of enemies, both entrenched and counter attacks.And best of all is the tank combat. MY GOD, have they done it brilliantly. Gone are the days of watching tanks playing AP ping pong until a health bar dissapears, now you can lose you tank in one shot from an anti-tank gun. You can also wreck said anti-tank gun with a well placed HE round. This game has so much to worry yourself about, and you'll love it.Battles are stressful, but addictive, loses are a certainty, getting good at this game will simply keep them to a minimum, and if you're looking to see something portray WW2 as an era of time thats not just ""Germans had tigers and Americans were the best"" then welcome aboard.You can only play single player, as the developers have sunken all their energy into the new game, which I guess isn't bad, and the only drawbacks I had was the lack of maps for Skirmish. Each factions has 4 or 5 missions, and as I want to only play as the commonwealth, which really should be called the British Empire ¬_¬ that doesn't leave a lot to do. But this is a game where even easy mode is challanging so I've plenty to do. You don't need a top whack PC to run this, which is great. All in all, a very satisfying game, especially when you take into account the ability to repair vehicle wrecks, the inventory system, the fluid combat system, realisitc combat and amount of thinking you need to do.

												So, I picked this up for around 1$ during a steam summer sale. At the time i had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little laptop that could run csgo on medium settings with about 30 fps. I was able to run the game at all low settings with low fps.so ill list the pros and the cons:pros:- You can play it on most hardware- The editor is awsome- The gameplay is all ways engaging- You get the big five to play as (U.S, Britan, Germany, Russia, and Japan)- Infantry combat is one of the best parts for me, creating squads, and sending thim into battle- The textures are not bad for such an old game either - The modding commuty is amazing such as the Galaxy At War mod (A Starwars mod)Cons:- The multiplayer is dead, I mean you cant play multiplayer at all- Some models are quite, well, not good (Such as the faces)- Have to download seprate software to play with others (Such as Hamachi) - Dont even get me started on the single player missions - This game was ment to be played multiplayer, and you cant play multiplayer- The damn demo had better ""missions"" than the acutal game!If you have a better computer than a♥♥♥♥♥♥laptop I suggest getting Men Of War Assault Squad 2(BTW my computer is not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop anymore cool right?)

												Although I am not much of a game critic, I must say this game is ♥♥♥♥ing phenomenal. The unit selection is very wide, with many different tanks, and support vehicles for every faction. As well as different variations of infantry, ranging from cheap rifle squads to elite infantry teams. The artillery in this game works ♥♥♥♥ing amazingly. Every time one of my howitzer rounds lands on a large group of infantry I feel a rush of satisfaction. If you are a fan of large scale rts games, especially realistic ones, and if you like micro management this is a game for you. I personally have an obsession with WW2 and have always wanted a game where I could command large groups of soldiers and tanks on the battlefield. And I have finally found it.I recommend this to any stratedgy lover with every fiber of my being. Just a little tip to anyone newer to the game, if you are having trouble figuring out how to play this game effectively, I recommend either reading up on the different unit stats, or just looking up some basic military stratedgies because this game is very reliant on historical accuracy of the different weapons and vehicles used in WW2. Every unit in this game has specific uses so if you don't understand how to use each of them proplerly you aren't going to last long whether it be against the AI in skirmish mode or real players in MP. Speaking of multiplayer, be sure to download gameranger or a similar client available, as GameSpy(the original multiplayer server host) is no longer in use.I hope this was helpful :D			"

It's the most brutally rewarding game i've ever played and a true challenge. Not for the faint of heart. I've cheered at the top of my lungs, I've cried in rage and frustration. I am absolutely abysmal at the multiplayer and I don't even care. The greatest RTS of all time.			"

A lot of missions for each country (UK,US,Germany,Japan and the Soviet Union (like 10 each and 1 lasts up to 2 hours)_______________________________________________________________________________________Cons:1.Well there is some glitches like you will be shooting at a German who is floating in the air trying to trun but he is just running in place in the air.2: Sound can get glitchy and repeats itself like a static sound.3. Not the BEST voice acting but still nice.Great Great Game 9/10			"

												This is one of the better RTS games I've played, the singleplayer isn't all too great but multiplayer is good. The game features realistic damage, ammo, fuel, repairing disabled vehicles, and other technical things. Though it's an enjoyable part of the game as it does not feel tedious to maintain units which will rarely live long enough to use up all their ammo or fuel.The only problem is most people who play this very realism-heavy game have less patience than a three year old, they don't dare stay in a game lobby for more than a minute. And when you do finally start you're lucky if you can play through a match without half a team rage quitting.Good game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.			"

												Okay, for a small review for people who just want a short overall review, I give this an 8/10 due to its realistic workings, but buggyish AI and performance issues.But if you want, I will tell you a bit more in detail.Men of War: Assault Squad is a game that is oreinted around multiplayer(Although I wish it had a bit more work for the skirmishes and possibly a campaign). Its in WW2 and it has 5 factions. USA, Soviet Union, Germany, Japan and Commonwealth. Japan is the new faction introduced in this game. Overall, the game is realistic to the max, with lifelike workings and atmospheric battles. The only things that make up cons is the somewhat buggy AI and performance issues.Pros:Realistic battles.Atmospheric battles.Large skirmish campaign.Decent multiplayer.Decent amount of factions.Overall great RTS experience.Cons:Somewhat buggy AI.Performance issues.No story campaign(Although I know its not oreinted around it, but it would of been nice).For examples on the AI, I was on the first Soviet Union skirmish battle and I got one of the APC things. I moved it to a bridge and then tended to some units across the bridge. I came back to it and found it hanging off the side of the bridge. Tried to move it, didn't budge. Then I ordered the units to get out onto the bridge. It took me around 10-15 minutes to get them all out, and one of them went the totally opposite way and jumped off the bridge. Ive had some other misc. AI problems, but those are just common little problems. Thats why I said somewhat buggy AI, not completely buggy or bad AI.Hope this helped, and you should buy for sure.8/10Well, between 8/10 and 8.5/10.So basically, I recommend to get this if you can handle a bit of lag and slightly buggy AI.

												Assault Squad is pure, gritty, and often unpredictable, battlefield strategy. Tank combat is seriously satisfying and the ability to directly control any unit opens up a degree of precision not possible in other titles. However, the learning curve is steep; the gameplay principles and mechanics will initially feel unnecessarily complex, demanding an unprecedented level of micro-management and awareness. The plethora of units to choose from, overwhelming and mistakes are unforgiving. Past that curve though, lies a deeply rewarding experience where the realism and intricacies of the game become extremely immersive.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad builds upon several excellent games, bringing you one of the finest real time strategic combat experiences there exists. Several balanced factions to play with and a multitude of units available combined with the depth in the ballistic system and the destructible environment provides the players with a playground that enables some truly unique combat experiences. The skirmish single-player is very lacklustre, previous titles in the series provide much better campaigns on that front, but on the multi-player side the game is truly unmatched.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad is a very detailed RTS game. This game demands alot of your time and brain. What makes Men of War so fun and different is how much you can customize your playing style. You will not be building bases or collection resources. Rather you will be fighting battles in World War II. The main goal of the missions is to capture bases and destroy the enemy. Sounds simple enough, but the catch is that you can only call in reinforcments with Manpower. Manpower is points you use to call in different types of units and support. Different units mean different prices. 1 squad of soldiers will cost 120 MP, while a tank will cost 300 to even 900 MP, depending on the tank. Every single soldier has his own name, inventory, and health. You will have to maintain your army and it's squads. This can be hard to keep up to date with the inventory of every soldier but thankfully there are ways to give out ammo easier, and soldiers will heal themselves with packs when injured. Also, the extreme amount of things you can customize can really change how you play and give you hundreds of new ways to play. Tanks also have a realistic damage system, which too also brings a great and powerful gameplay change from most RTS games.Maps are truly massive and it creates the feeling of truly being a general leading armies to defeat the enemy. Holes from shells will be created, trees fall, flames spread, sandbags being place, and far more carnage awaiting.Sound and Graphics are truly beautiful but the voice acting can be meh. The main complaints I have about this game is that there is no normal skirmish mode. Just alot of missions to play Single player, but no true campaign. with the servers gone and the medicore single player around I really do not suggest a buy unless you enjoy the gameplay and do not mind playing missions over and over. Missions are massive and can take hours to complete which is a plus, but once you finish them all, nothing else remains. However a huge plus is LAN games are still possible and huge fun, and that can truly make this game fun to play and give  alot of new experiences. If you are a RTS General willing to learn alot and have a very detailed RTS game. I suggest this game to you. If you are new to the RTS genre or play casual, I suggest something else.			"

												Completely boring and unrealistic. Every battle you start with a handful of infantry against a ♥♥♥♥ton of enemies of all types. Each time you are outnumbered 5 to 1 no matter what battle and which side you're playing. The campaign has no depth. You have to micromanage every single aspect.  It takes a lot of time to call for reinforcements and you get only a pitiful force (imagine the russians launching an offensive across a river with two tanks). No artillery cover, no air support. The mission editor is pathetic. The only good thing are the graphics. This game is no fun at all.			"

												This game man, The tanks, an hour of relentless fighting and bloodshed and chaos and a few tanks come in to push your forces back to spawn. Massive charges get mowed down by MG fire Defenses blown up people groaning in pain. Bullets flying everywhere one minute your perfectly well defended at a strategic point the next there are three panzers and dozens of enemies attacking you. You get to watch as people yours and theirs get cut down one by one. You get to learn how to mourn the loss of just one squad because that squad may have been playing a key roll in an engagement.  You get to watch as buildings crumble under the awesome power of the artillary strikes. Watch as chaos unfolds before you. Make one wrong move and that could cost you the battle.			"

												Me of war Assault Squad is a fantastically well rounded and polished game. i think they have finally found the correct balance between units, the resource points is a great idea and builds up at the right speed. The 50/50 chance that your tank will be destroyed or fixable is a good balance since the previous men of war titals were either too easy to fix them or completely scrapped after their first hit. they finally got a good balance in the game and im quite happy with it. Even better in multiplayer with a friend.			"

												This is the most realistic strategy game I have ever played. However it requires a lot of micromanagement and patience. Only downfalls I think are that there is no multiplayer, you don't get access to many units in skirmish missions, skirmish missions are pretty much all the same and the resupply system is pretty bad. But other than that it is awesome.			"

												The fonts of the game feels like its been rushed. Gameplay is similar to Company of Heroes, but a bit more in-depth. I like the complexity of the micro-management system, being able to control a single unit like a 3rd person shooter sort of. (top down perhaps). Missions were repetitive though, but fun. 9/10. Not as good as Company of Heroes, but it has mechanics CoH doesn't that makes it good.			"

												The game is well one of the best WW2 rts games out there i would recomond buying anyother men of wars other than veitnam and maybe as2. All the others are basically older and have less content but cheaper so. The game is fun campaign is fun for all countrys but can get old after a few months but you get a editor to create your battles on making maps its amazing truly fun alougth it can be tricky to figure it out. I do not recomend this to someone whos looking for turnbased or anything other than a rts if you dont like ww2 there are mods not on steam but on sites like moddb.com or many others that can make it more moderen or ww1 even the revolutionary war etc. Overall i think its worth the money and a really fun and replayable but multiplayer is shut down			"

												Although I am not much of a game critic, I must say this game is ♥♥♥♥ing phenomenal. The unit selection is very wide, with many different tanks, and support vehicles for every faction. As well as different variations of infantry, ranging from cheap rifle squads to elite infantry teams. The artillery in this game works ♥♥♥♥ing amazingly. Every time one of my howitzer rounds lands on a large group of infantry I feel a rush of satisfaction. If you are a fan of large scale rts games, especially realistic ones, and if you like micro management this is a game for you. I personally have an obsession with WW2 and have always wanted a game where I could command large groups of soldiers and tanks on the battlefield. And I have finally found it.I recommend this to any stratedgy lover with every fiber of my being. Just a little tip to anyone newer to the game, if you are having trouble figuring out how to play this game effectively, I recommend either reading up on the different unit stats, or just looking up some basic military stratedgies because this game is very reliant on historical accuracy of the different weapons and vehicles used in WW2. Every unit in this game has specific uses so if you don't understand how to use each of them proplerly you aren't going to last long whether it be against the AI in skirmish mode or real players in MP. Speaking of multiplayer, be sure to download gameranger or a similar client available, as GameSpy(the original multiplayer server host) is no longer in use.I hope this was helpful :D			"

It's the most brutally rewarding game i've ever played and a true challenge. Not for the faint of heart. I've cheered at the top of my lungs, I've cried in rage and frustration. I am absolutely abysmal at the multiplayer and I don't even care. The greatest RTS of all time.			"

												This is a strategy/tatical game. I have always been sceptic to it. Probably because I never gave it a real shot. It can't be compared to Company of Heroes and shouldn't be. The game has a very realisitic damage table which means that an infantary dies just after 1-3 hits. Facing a tank can be a deadly outcome which can whipe a squad within seconds. I strongly recommend that you start off by playing the easy campaign to learn the basic and still be able to enjoy the game.+ Realistic damage + Slower, tatical warfare + Real WW2 weapons and vehicles. + Control units (WASD+Mouse) or run, walk, phrone, suppressing fire etc.  "

												This game is breathtaking. It's a visual stunner; you notice every detail as you are creeping through a forest with an M18 Hellcat and using the trees as camoflage. Every nook and cranny of everything in the game is detailed to perfection. Your ears will ring as a high-velocity AP shell smacks into the mantlet of your Tiger. And nothing beats the fiery inferno that is unleashed when you attack an Elefant tank destroyer from the side with a Daimler APC and use an Armor-Piercing Composite Rigid (APCR) shell to take out it's ammo. The explosion is so gratifying, that it alone is worth buying this game.			"

												I have been playing this game in skirmish mode for quite a few hours now. I have stayed with easy and normal difficulty. It is a great little game and easily worth the price. The games start simply and with easy objectives and grow to totally intense battles. I would have liked to see a couple of variations on the available tank types but at the price it is excellent. One thing that has annoyed me with all of these games lately is to do with the tank's gearboxes. Tanks need a reverse gear! There is no use having all that fore plate if you bare your behind when you try to get away from an enemy machine.

												Realy great RTS game, very realistic gameplay, game still look nice and is very hard, you need use many tactics to defend enemy and know what type of units you now need to work your tactic. I realy like this game, and still when i send three tank to one little enemy tank i lost all three (god i`m so $@#*). 9/10			"

												All the Men of War games are worth a mention, some are great, some not so much, but Assault Squad is definitely the high point of the series. It's the most brutally rewarding game i've ever played and a true challenge. Not for the faint of heart. I've cheered at the top of my lungs, I've cried in rage and frustration. I am absolutely abysmal at the multiplayer and I don't even care. The greatest RTS of all time.			"

												This game is the most challenging, fun, realistic and makes me rage the most. Men of War: Assault Squad allows you to play as UK, USA, Germany, Russia and Japan throughout three missions for each country (you can add more missions via DLC.) Each counry has their strong points such as Germans rule with tanks, USA's availability for air strikes and dropping airbourne and Japan's light tank rush. In terms of realism, the tanks actually use tank physics so your crew can get damaged, indivdual tank parts can be damaged and become unable to use (unable to move around or shoot etc.) until the tank is repaired by any infantry unit. Speaking of infantry, you get a medic as apart of your army and he is essential if you want to win a lot easier. Your units actually carry ammunition so you have to be careful on how many shots they fire and or waste, otherwise you'll need to capture an enemy checkpoint for a small amount of ammo or bring in an ammo truck for your units. This game is fun because there are different strategies for you to use during the mission and you have to really consider the strengths and weaknesses of each unit alot during the mission. One wrong move and your unit can get destroyed or killed. The game uses MP which you gather slowly to call in units such as infantry, anti-vehicle artillery, HM guns, mortars, tanks and special abilities like parashooting down airbourne and getting a little remote-detonated tank.What makes me rage at this game so much is the amount of anti-vehicle placements that the enemy starts off with. If you try to bring ANY unit up they'll get demolished and since your tanks have mediocre accuracy, even if they shoot first they still get destroyed. Another thing is that the enemy keeps bringing in tanks and troops and if you leave a captured checkpoint unguarded, they'll recapture it and you'll lose the unit you can buy when you captured it (like a heavy tank or medium-tank.) Another thing is that your units sometimes won't fire at the enemy despite being in range and have some ammo to spare. It reallys gets annoying and you have to move them closer and the next moment your unit is killed by anti-vehicle. For missions, you are given the same objective no matter what country you play as. You have to clear three lines of defences (3 centre checkpoints and 6 optional ones) and finally capture the last checpoint which is near the end of the map. It is repeatitive and it gets boring for long peroids of time  that each mission will take you about an hour to do so it's better for one mission at a time and and have a break.If you're a multiplayer type, don't get this game because the online provider, GameSpy, shut down it's servers some time ago and you can only play on a LAN connection. While the online mod has no AI to face apart from campaign missions, you can still play co-op with a LAN buddy and do the misisions which are called ""Skirimish"" for no reason when it isn't and three other game modes against each other. In all this game is challenging, even for the easiest difficult and if you're fan of realism, you'll love this game. If you're not the strategic type and just prefer to crush your enemy with tanks and brute strength, I recommend you don't get this game because it really needs planning and for you to react to disadvantages accordinly to counter-attack the opposition. For this game I rate a 8/10.			"

												TL;DR: This game shines for it's editor and Multiplayer. Don't get hyped over the campaign.Forget the Singleplayer skirmish/campaigns(unless you want to get campaign mods/missions). The Editor is where it shines. You don't even need to know how to script to use the editor(I ended up learning alot of scripting and stuff because I like flushed out missions). Being able to create a huge offensive is insanely fun. And, it is VERY easy to make the maps you develop/edit available in Multiplayer. If you come here for the Singleplayer campaign, you might be dissapointed. The missions are repetitive(they're all the same). Each mission is a map with about 3 rows of 3 objectives. Each nation also has one ""stealth"" mission, you still have to take the objective, and one defense mission. It is fun at first, but it gets to the point where it is too repetitive. Also. Check out a mod named Dynamic Campaign Editor. It really freshes the game up a bit, or a lot I should say. I have over 45~ hours in that mod alone. Great mod.			"

How do you order reinforcements?  I was playing the campaign and beat the first US mission without any and cleared 3 capture points on the second map and after taking wave after wave of enemy reinforcements i couldn't order any of my own... Can you not order instant reinforcements?  how do you order reinforcements?  Well since i can't figure it out i only played for about 1 hour.  Thought the concept was excellent, taking cover and cover fire was very cool. Just needs a better tutorial versus none at all.			"

												This game requires so much attention to be played correctly. In many RPG-styled games you would control one character and manage his/her items in an inventory -- In Men of War, every unit you control has an inventory. So, that means you should make sure each unit is equipped with the right gear before assigning orders. Helmets can fly off your soldiers' heads and be picked up again, their weapons can be dropped after being stunned by a grenade going off near them.. So many things can happen. You, as the commander, need to not only focus on the battlefield but MUST pay close attention to each unit. People often compare Company of Heroes with this game, I think that's quite stupid. They are completely different games. Company of Heroes offers tactical combat as well but it is more fast paced and you need not think so much about the units individually (no inventory etc).. There are many more mechanics in Men of War that Company of Heroes could've used to achieve realism, but we are talking about games here so realism shouldn't be the main concern.If you like games set in the World War 2 era, this is a must play. --- It's most enjoyable with a friend, as stated in other reviews the AI are very difficult. You can work through the co-op with your friends and still get the achievements for the missions.Matches are usually quite lengthy, so don't expect to rush your opponent.The only problem I have with this game is the voice acting. It is the worst I have ever heard in my life and the dialogue is really pathetic. Since when do American people shout ""FOR THE MOTHERLAND!""!??! .. It really ruins the experience for me. Easily fixed though, turn off voice volume and play with your own music. I play to the OST from Fury and other movies. Or better yet, change the language of the game.. Because I play in Russian the voices sound much more authentic than they did before hand. (Warning: Changing language means everything will change xD not just the voices, but the interface... Everything)Last but not least, this game has a lot of ""replayability"" due to all the mods available for it.Overall, I rate this game: 8.5/10			"

												Easily one of the best RTS games out there. Great destruction system awesome gameplay, decent graphics and great skrimish feature. I think this is the best Men of War game because of the singleplayer . I know that some people think that this game really lacks a good campaign but the skirmish feature allows you to play battles a whole lot of different ways . The multiplayer doesn´t work since the game spy servers shut down , but i don´t really care about mp in RTS games . If you are bored of playing the same maps in single you can still open the gem editor and have hours of fun with it . This game also has some great mods such as cold war mod , which allows you to play with modern units , so if you´re into modern combat you should definitely check the mod . There is also Men of War AS2 but it is nearly the same as this one but it costs much more . I totally recommend this one so if you are a RTS fan you should definitely play . The game is really cheap so there is no reason to not buy this one .			"

												This is a great a great RTS game, where you can take direct control of soldiers, mounted weapons, tanks, vehicles, etc.(not planes though.) Each Scenario(5 countries to play, about 5-8 scenarios each) has you start with one or two squads of units, usually infantry, and you go out and accomplish the objectives. As you do, you earn MP(Military Points I think) which you can use to call in more squads of units(Infantry, Flamethrower, Anti-Tank, Tank, Artillery, etc.).Each unit also has their own inventory, and you can take the weapons, ammo, grenades, hats, medkits, etc. from fallen enemies, cars, and you can even call in a Supply Truck with more stuff with MP. You don't have to micro-manage though, because if someone needs ammo but doesn't have, and someone near them does, they'll automatically pass some to them.This game has a lot of strategy, and units take realistic damage, so Infantry will go down in 4-6 shots, and tanks can annihilate squads in seconds. Pretty much anything can be used as cover.I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys RTS games, Strategy games, or the Company of Heroes series.			"

												MOW:AS (pronounced MO' A$$) is a fun and action-packed RTS game. You are able to command forces from Japan, Germany, England, the USA, and Soviet Russia through the campaign or against other players. Movement and deployment of units is intuitive and can be done from the perspective of the general or the unit itself. The one thing that's frustrating is when the enemy who you are attacking has artillery and especially anti-tank guns, when this situation arises it is almost impossible to resolve unless you are playing as Englend in which case you have the power to take those guns out with your own heavy artillery. Russia also has heavy artillery, but it is not as good.			"

												Great game with some sandbox features that you can use with the editor that it has.Furthermore the in-depth action and the reality of the hardcore warfare with it's physics and graphics that really stand-out in game.The dialouge from the charcters creates more immersion while playing and the explosions (evry1 loves explosions) are fantastic.Nonetheless to be able to pick your own country go through it's campaign then save the mission go to another and besides that theres not actual real objective while playing except you have to capture command posts.The modding community is awesome too.With various ranges between futuristic stuff all the way to ww1.I'd reccomend this game to a person who would take alot of time with it and mod it.Otherwise this game is just amazing and it will always be because of the communitys.

												A mortar is an indirect fire weapon that fires shells at low velocities, short ranges, and high-arcing ballistic trajectories. It is typically muzzle-loading and has a barrel length less than 15 times its caliber. A mortar is relatively simple and easy to operate. A modern mortar consists of a tube into which gunners drop a shell, which is usually referred to as a bomb. The shell contains a quantity of propellant. When it reaches the base of the tube it hits a firing pin, which detonates the propellant and fires the shell. Some larger caliber mortars have a string operated firing pin instead of a fixed one. The tube is generally set at between 45 and 85 degrees angle to the ground, with the higher angle giving shorter firing distances.			"

Every Nation has some form of Light Tank that is evenly matched with one another.-It is difficult enough that it requires you to take the time to win a mission.-Tactics and micromanagement can keep you focused on one area, letting the enemy focus on an area you're not watching.All in all I would reccomend this game. The graphics are beautiful and I just love the tactics. Even more micromanagment, hope this helps.			"

How do you order reinforcements?  I was playing the campaign and beat the first US mission without any and cleared 3 capture points on the second map and after taking wave after wave of enemy reinforcements i couldn't order any of my own... Can you not order instant reinforcements?  how do you order reinforcements?  Well since i can't figure it out i only played for about 1 hour.  Thought the concept was excellent, taking cover and cover fire was very cool. Just needs a better tutorial versus none at all.			"

												Great WW2 military strategy game and great fun with friends.There is no bot mode beside the singleplayer campaign.To play with bots you need some mods.			"

												This game has been a whole lot of fun. Graphically beautiful, great environment, sounds amazing. Everything about it is fun. I was disappointed finishing the last mission, but I'm going to try playing through on the 2 hardest difficulties, then getting the next installment. Highly recommended.			"
