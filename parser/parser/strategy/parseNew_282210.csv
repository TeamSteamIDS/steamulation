												**UPDATE** - This review was written with the game running on ""Hard""This is the worst game I've played that bears Sid Meier's name.""Surely it's not that bad"" You say.I'm afraid it is.In the build up to the release of the game there was little doubt that it was going to be a less involved game to play then the typical Sid Meier fare, more Ace Patrol then Civilization 5. When developers were discussing the game, that was pretty clear and I have no qualms with that.In fact I was quite happy with the idea of a strategy game designed so I could play over an evening after work.The 3 hour play time of this review was playing a game to completion on a ""large"" map.Initial impressions are poor. The game launching in a tiny window and into a bare, personality-less main menu that could have been ripped from any sci-fi title (it reminded me of the Sword of the Stars 2 menu). I sought out the settings menu and within that I found volume controls and ""Windowed Full Screen mode"".I'm sorry what?I know the game was being made for tablet as well, but this is Firaxis. I asked another friend playing it ""Am I missing a settings menu somewhere?"" bemusedly. ""Nope"" He replied ""It really is that sparse""Oh well. Not a great first impression, but not necessarily the end of the world. I setup a game.Setup lets you pick a faction and a leader. Each faction gets the same leaders, with slightly rejigged artwork. Which comes across as a bit lazy. The factions have a unique bonus with the leaders adding an additional bonus of their own. I was a little bemused at what the various bonuses meant as I only knew about one aspect of the game (crew morale) from previews nothing else made a lot of sense and there was nothing to explain the benefits of a choice, no tooltips, nothing. The lack of tooltips persists throughout, with a general lack of accessible information.I setup my game, stabbing blindly in the dark at things that sounded useful The galactic playing field looks alright and I wait for the useful tutorial to kick in and explain things to me over my first few turns. I get nothing. I understand there's an info button to click but I don't understand why there's a lack of tutorial and I fumble around the first few turns getting to grips with the games systems.As the game is all about moving a fleet around space bringing disparate planets into a federation you'd expect load out/designing of the ships to be one of the most involved aspects of the game. Instead, you're presented with a list of things to click away at to upgrade or downgrade (removing components nets you some resources back to spend elsewhere) different aspects of each ship.My fleet consisted of three ships throughout the course of the game, starting as corvette's, ending as battleships through upgrades and the games automatic ship classification. All 3 focused on speed, one was paticularly tough and loaded with close range weaponry. One was less tough, also had close range weaponry and could cloak. One had longer range weapons. The limitation to what you can actually do with ships meant all of them had max speed, and were stupidly tough by about mid way through. But this simple setup felt game breaking. I could defeat any mission or enemy fleet, outside of the missions where you have to defend an outpost that can only survive two hits with fast enemies that just head straight for it.The empire building aspect of the game is no more involved. ""Click this to make numbers go up, because numbers"" about sums up this aspect of the game. There's no interesting trade off between balancing metal, food or energy. Get lots of whatever you can, click stuff to have more stuff.I actually beat my game accidentally. I was working my way from planet to planet, building one ludcriously over powered wonder after another because why not, then a conquered a planet which also had a wonder and triggered the wonder victory.Well victory nets you a much more rewarding end then it does in Beyond Earth at least. You get 10 seconds of video which is better then a text box. But does it really matter when the rest of the game is so unengaging?Overall, it's an ok game to have on a tablet, nothing stand out, even where there isn't much competition. But on the PC there's tons. Weird Worlds in Infinite space did something similar but better years ago and it's Early Access sequel likely will to. There is no reason to buy this game for the PC, and very little for a tablet.			"

												I decided to give this game a few hours of play, and a couple of days to judge if my opinions about it were sufficiently objective, and I've deliberately avoided reading other reviews so as not to colour my judgement.At a very cursory glance, it's an ok, fun, civ: beyond earth themed mini game, that will provide a slightly different way to  sink a few hours in to a game for a little bit.I tend to think of games in terms of wether they ""break even"" for me or not - am I going to get sufficient gameplay out of a title that the cost per hour played is less than or equal to an arbitrary value.  For me, I tend to consider this value at a nice easy £1 per hour, pretty much the price of a cheap cup of coffee... if a game beats that, it's broken even or possibly even done a lot better. If it works out higher than that, the cost to own is too high and not worth the expense.On those terms, this title doesn't even come close... as I doubt I'll play beyond the 3 hours or so I've put into it so far, leaving me at a cost to own of over £3 per hour...I'll try to embellish more below.Do you remember the free companion app for Mass Effect 3 that was released a few years ago? Called Mass Effect: Datapad, it allowed you to play a basic mini game on a tablet or mobile device that could influence events in the main game.Simply put, Starships is the ""next gen"" version of that.  There game is a little more complicated than Datapad, but in essence all there is to it is a vehicle for delivering unlockable content in Beyond Earth, which from the initial unlocks I was able to make, are pretty basic, and add a few slightly different starting options for civ's in any new game you start after the unlock (eg a ""sponsor"" option when setting up your civ to start with ultrasonic fences, instead of the vanilla options)  Unlike datapad though, it doesn't add the Beyond Earth equivalent of ME's codex, and does nothing else to really expand on the game or the overall experience.When you consider that, as mentioned, Datapad was free, albiet a little more basic, it brought a lot more to the game universe it represented than Starships accomplishes for £11/$14 - and that in itself, really draws the value of this title into stark contrast.Don't get me wrong, it is a fun little distraction, but there really isn't all that much to it beyond a distraction.  Every mission map is ostensibly the same... a randomly generated asteroid field with a couple of flavour target decorations in suitable locations.The galaxy map, where you take part in all your diplomacy, upgrades and travel, is pretty miniscule, even when set to ""extreme"" size, (I counted approx 20 systems in my last extreme map, for example) which is pretty poor and clearly designed around rushed, dirty play.  Similarly unit limitations in missions (up to 15 whole units at once... wow) is a pretty clear indicator of the intended audience.... tablet users, with PC and Mac users obviously catered for purely as a bonus extra revenue stream.The game, currently, has no tutorial, and requires users to integrate both Starships and Beyond Earth with a 3rd party accounts system (which isn't all that obvious to find) in order to benefit from any of the inter-title unlocks.The advertised ""starship customisation"" feature is pretty poor, and is simply a case of pumping points into a specific attribute to beef it up a bit.The ingame AI is pretty abysmal where scaling difficulty does nothing to changing AI tactics, and instead seems only to make them more able to soak up and dish out damage. As soon as you've worked out that it's possible to spam your way to success pretty easily, all the real challenge is lost, and it simply becomes an exercise in chosing the most economical way to collect all the ingame systems.Sure I hold my hands up, I had different expectations of the game when I preordered it, and from the demo's and trailers I saw, I was kind of expecting a turn based 4x strategy title.  I was disappointed when I realised this wasn't the case, and I cannot say strenuously enough, this is not a 4x strategy game, but I tried to keep playing and experiencing the game regardless, and have tried to judge it on it's own merits rather than how it didn't match up to my expectations.Is it a fun little minigame? Yes, as I said at the start, it is an amusing distraction for an hour or two.  However, I have played similar games in flash based web games, and I've downloaded far better, and more involved or complete, games than this for free on my mobile devices, and have had varying levels of satisfaction from them.I found the subject of ""cross compatibility"" a little bit of a misnomer too... Where Datapad could impact on how prepared the galaxy was to deal with an impending threat, or where Assassins Creed allowed you to affect the economy and environment in which you played, all Starships offers is the ability to unlock gameplay options that would previously just have been included as standard.Seen in that light, it's little more than a rebranded DLC pack for Beyond Earth, which demands not only your money but also your time in order to unlock the content you've paid for (and by all rights, should have had access to in the first place)In light of all that, I simply cannot in good concious recommend the game to anyone at it's current retail price. Taken as a DLC, it's easily double the price it should be for the features it brings to your Beyond Earth experience.Taken as a stand alone mobile app, it's probably closer to triple the price of a title with similar depth.Taken as a stand alone PC/Mac game, to be honest, I've paid less than a 10th of the price for indie titles that were far more robust and deserving.Add it to your wishlist, and wait for it to be added as a bonus game to a humble bundle or something.  Spend the £11/$14 buying lunch for a couple of homeless folks, you'll get far more satisfaction in the long run, and someone far more deserving than the developers behind this title, get to have you buy them a meal.

What The Game Is NOTI suspect many of my fellow reviewers simply saw Sid's name on it, and expected a large and complex 4X game in space.  Which, if they had paid even half-attention to anything the developer said prior to release, they would have realised was never meant to be the case.This game was never meant to be something like Endless Space, or Galactic Civilizations, or Master of Orion.  Firaxis was quite clear about that during the development process, in everything they said to their fans.What The Game ISStarships is a light/casual strategy game, suitable to playing when you have a few spare moments - during a lunch break, for example.  It's less about grand strategy than it is abut tactical combat with a small fleet.  And within that framework, it is a very, very good little game.  Just, lighter fare than most of my fellow strategy-game enthusiasts will be used to.Moral of the Story:Never buy a game just for the title, especially, just for whose name is on it.  Always take the time to at least learn what it's publisher claims the game is supposed to be.To all of those people who bought this, expecting a dep and complicated 4X game requiring multiple hours, and hundreds of turns, just to complete a single playthrough, I say:  CAVEAT EMPTOR; the only person to blame for your poor experience, is yourself.Next time, do your homework, and at least learn what the game itself actually claims to be, before setting yourself up for disappointment when it turns out not to match your unfounded expectations.

												Starships is a game with a lot of potential, but falls short of what it could be. The game lacks a decent tutorial outside of standard tooltips, but the gameplay is fairly shallow without too much curve. Most of the non-combat gameplay is simply buying improvements/investments for better resources, which you can use to buy improvements and investments.The battles themselves are largely a matter of flying in and out of cover, shooting targets from behind/the side and randomly crippling their abilities while they do the same to you. Torpedoes can be used to created delayed explosions, granting you a degree of control over enemy movement, and there's some shenanigans with cloaking and radar. The maps are very similar, with the main features being shifting asteroids and portals that randomly teleport you to other portals. The former are very simple: red and green circles let you know that every turn, a path will be opened or closed. The latter is more of an annoyance than anything, due to the random aspect and the game's willingness to send your ship through one if you don't carefully plot your movement across individual hexes.The game is connected to Beyond Earth, itself an iffy prospect at the time of writing. Completing tasks in BE will unlock bonuses in Starships, and vice versa. The BE unlocks are generally underwhelming, save for Pioneers. You can also choose to ""continue"" a BE save in Starships, playing as your chosen leader and maintaining the same diplomatic relations with AI leaders, though this is pointless with Starships being a step down from BE.Ultimately, Starships isn't a particularly deep or intriguing game. The visuals and music aren't bad, and the missions have decent variety, but everything else is lackluster and the options are barebones. There's no multiplayer, no option to continue after winning, and no real depth.It might be worth a look on Steam sale, particularly if you don't want to get a BE mod or mess with XML files to unlock the bonuses, but Starships can't break from the orbit of its iOS port origins.

												Short version:  This game should NOT be purchased at this time. Wait 2 or 3 months for 2K to either abandon support or actually finish testing this game.  This game is NOT in Early Access and should be a finished and tested product. However, most of the Early Access games I have played were far more stable. Longer version:I've never written a review on a Sid Meier game before and it's a shame that this has to be the first one. The bugs that are inherent in this game indicate that very little testing was done prior to launch. In an attempt to stem the tide of negative posts, one of the 2K devs sticky'd a thread to try to capture all technical issues. I don't think he's actually replying to anything there. This thread has been out since 3/12 (today is 3/16) and is up to 32 pages so far and growing. I entered a support ticket on the 2K page after reading their FAQ/Known Issues thread.  I'm suffering from two of the frequent issues. The game doesn't play fullscreen for me -- the Windows taskbar always shows up. The FAQ said that if I hide my taskbar in Windows, this would resolve it. Really?  Why the heck would I do that? Shouldn't they just write the game to overlap it fullscreen?  You know, just like every other game developer already does?  The other issue is far more irritating though. The game crashes after the second set of logos... just about 4 or 5 words into the intro. 100% of the time despite an uninstall/reinstall. So I've not watched the intro yet. The only way to get past this is to spam the Escape key as soon as the second set of logos comes up. I don't get the intro but I can play the game... for a while.  Yes, dear friends, the crash-to-desktop bug persists into the game itself.  Randomly, the game just shuts itself down with no error messages. Not so bad if you save frequently but later into the game when you have control of a bunch of worlds and a decent-sized fleet, it gets to be a real PITA to save just to go from one world to the next then save and move to the next... But you have to do this if you want to store your progression because you never know when you'll be dumped right out.  When you enter a ticket on this at the 2K support site (which I heartily recommend as they need a swift boot to the tail for this), you'll notice that if you select ""crash"" as an option, they even already have drop-downs for ""crash after second logos"" and ""crash during gameplay.""   This game should have never ever ever launched in this state. These aren't minor bugs to be worked around -- they are show-stoppers.Now on to the game itself... It feels more like a tablet game than a Windows game.  The price point is about right -- this isn't a deep simulation or world builder. You're not in-game to get invested and watch your planets grow (except for maybe your homeworld).  The combat is what the game is all about. It's relatively simple and straight-forward in the basic mode.  I haven't tried hard mode yet since I haven't been able to sustain the game long enough to complete a normal campaign. (see the paragraph about the perisistent crashing above)   "

												This is a hard game to recomend. Unless they make some improvmens to the game, I have to say do not buy this unless it is on sale.You can think of Sid Meier's Sarships as a 4x Light turn-based strategy game.  The best thing I can compair it to is a Simplified iOS version of Endless Space. Even the 4 resources look and sound like Endless Space.  You have Food, Science, Metal, and Engery. Each turn your planets give you all the resources that they have produced based on their population and improvment you built.  There are only 5 improvment to build, one each for production of each resource and a Planetary defence one for the fifth.   You move your fleet of ships from planet to plant completing quest they give you to get influince with them until they become one of your planets.  You only have one fleet and it starts with two ships. Each turn you can use your enerigy to improve your ships or build a new one to join your fleet.  You never seem to loose a ship, if it is destroyed in battel, it will be back in your fleet at the end of the battle. You can also link this game with Sid Meier’s Civilization: Beyond Earth using the My2K account. Playing this game will let you unlock some things in Beyond Earth. There are parts of the game that I did enjoy.  The simplified version of the 4X game means the game move at a fast pace, focuing mainly on battles. My main problems with the game is that you can tell they put all their focus on the iOS version, and left out a lot of standard featurs you expect to have on a PC game, especially from a Firaxis and 2K game. These are not small Indie startups making their first Greenlight game. Right now the main problems I have with the game:-There are no resolution options and no Fullscreen. There is what they call Fullscreen Windowed-You can set victory conditions, but the AI ignors them and can win any way it want. So victory conditions are just a way to handycap yourself.-There is no way to rebind keys and there are no hot keys.  Right now they only keys that work are they arrow keys to move the map, and the ESC that lets you exit the game. -No multi-player.  I can tell this game is going to get old realy fast. multi-player was something they were going to put in, but decided not to for some reason. I hope they change their mind on this.  Had I bought this on iOS, I would say it a great game and have a lot of fun with it, but as a pc game it feels off some how. Like we have a really good Beta, but you are just waiting for them to finish it now.			"

												To me, this game is simply a stain on Sid Meier's name. I can't imagine he had any interest in the project, and it feels like the producers simply pinned his arms to the desk until he signed over permission to use his name for a overly-glossed project that probably didn't take them very long to develop.This game tries to 'feel' a bit like Master of Orion, but it fails to deliver in pretty much every category. I played it for two days and finished it on epic size. Every planet, faction and technology is the same, no random events happened, there are a short list of ""missions"" for every uncolonied planet which are all very much the same. It is to MoO what Empire At War was to Supremacy: take a good concept, cut it down to its most bare elements, and slap a price on it.There's almost no diplomacy, not in the sense that you feel there is real politics taking place as happens with Sid Meier's civilisation games - the AI is neither bold to attack nor is scared of you when you're powerful. Alliances are empty. The game feels as though it has no soul to the purpose but to play through the simple rules, you are fully aware you're just clicking to interact with a simple ruleset, no immersion in actually ""being a part"" of a story, not even on sandbox level.The graphics ""are nice"" but feels like pretty paint on something so simple and simply boring. The game forces you to watch ships explode in its terrible animation (which is, flashes here and there, while the camera shakes galore, focusing on the ship with no choice, then it disappears, this animation when repeated actually made me a bit ill) so, when you take out 5 ships with one torpedo (which is pretty necessary to get through the game without spending too long in the boring battles) you just check your phone while you wait for it to go all ""oh look shaky screen in space, isn't space cool??"" No. It's not cool.This is the space-4X equivalent of Farmville. It's only worth getting if you need to keep your son quiet in the evenings, but even then, in my opinion, it's also a waste of his time.			"

												Alright, so, I finished one playthrough and tried to start few new games with different settings, here is the impression so far: Gameplay:+Simple to understand resource management+-Some super basic diplomacy that creates a light feeling of space empire game, although, you can break peace and attack your opponent the very same turn which kind of completely defeats the point of a diplomacy+Few different ways to build up your ecocnomy\strength+Fleet upgrades are very flexible and allows for some interesting ship specialites+Fights are decently strategicalthough:-(huge minus, I ragequit the game few minutes ago because of that) Asteroid moving system(unless it is a bug). So, let me make an example: I hid my fleet behind a formation of really big asteroids, launched a few fighters, checked my LOS and every ship on the enemy team was untargetable. Clicked Next Turn. First thing I see is that an asteroid that was right in front of my fleet dissapeared and now 5 enemy ships are shooting me with 100% damage modifier. Now. If it is a system, there has to be some form of an indicator of which ones are moving(not necessary the location, but just an idea of which cover cannot be reliably used). If it was made for preventing people from defensive camping - good, but in this case you might remove all the asteroids as there is no way to predict your enemy's next turn(it is a strategy game , afterall). If it is a bug - GOD, this has to be fixed as soon as possible. I am EXTREMELY interested in the point of view of any developer\community manager on that topic.UI:+planetary management is simple enough and UI does it's job-No HP/Weapons/Modules indicators (that I've seen) on enemy ships aside from the info on a pre-mission briefing. How can I tell if the ship is going down soon? How can I tell if that ship is stronger at close combat? Which ship should I target? -Line of sight is really hard to manage, there is no visible indicator if the ship is in range of attack OR if the ship will be able to attack after the move (again, it is a strategy game not an aracde shooter). Defeats the idea of tactical movement, you just HOPE that your lasers will reach-No Indicator of which weapon will be used at the certain distance, Would be great to see a tri-colour targetting arrow that shows which weapon will you fire at what range. I think it is a simple to implement and yet very important feature(again, we are trying to make tactical decisions in a STRATEGY game)-Diplomacy screen is super-simple(also, very small for some reason) and a bit hard to understand from the first glance, and I am used to the complex screens of CIV and other 4x games+Global view gives just enough information to the player, very functional and not cluttered. Graphics:+- Functional, nothing to praise, nothing to complain about-No options. I want to skip\speed-up animation on a global view, same in the battle screen. Every CIV game has it...Overall:I REALLY want to like this game, I was excited from the moment I heard about it. I have done the pre-order and... I think it was a mistake. The game has potential, but it is buried behind tons of questionable decisions. In ideal world it is a fun, fast, strategy game, that can be finished within an hour. As it stands, I have very little desire to start a new playthough after I learned some of the flaws. I helped design\QA some UI for Network Software and I am genuinely surpised how most of the things I mentioned as a negative were missed\not mentioned during the development process.You might have a different experience than I did, maybe it is just a matter of personality.Regards, Dark Sun			"

												And in the seventh day Firaxis and Sid got tired...I want to love this game. Really. Spaceships and planets! Exploring with your fleet and investigate different civilizations! Sounds a cool concept, also the maps looks amazing. I did not expect a really complex 4x game, but rather something with fun rules, easy gameplay but challenging enough. And possibly, hopefully Starships executes that... but there is no real way to find it as the game full with bugs (and no, not the bugs from Beyond the Earth). It crashes for many people with the current built, so honestly I can't advice to anyone to buy at it's current state. Wait a couple of days to see what will happen.Civ: Beyond the Earth was somewhat a disappointment and I am sad to say but Starships seems to go to the same route. A could be great and fun game who never fullfils it's promise. Please prove me otherwise Sid.			"

												Sid Meier's Starships (SMS) is NOT Civ-in-Space, as many people hoped, but rather, it's as if ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" (HOMM) had a baby with ""Strange Adventures in Infinite Space"" and transplanted into Sid Meier's CIV: Beyond Earth universe. It somewhat resembles the Civ Series in that it involves growing star systems, managing resources, and has multiple victory conditions including tech, diplomancy, population, and so on, but all the parameters are either preset or simplified into ""levels"" rather than micro-management choices that delighted Civ fans. And rather than building as many units as you want, you have to make do with a single fleet (which can be a swarm of smaller ships, or a few uber powerful ones) that you must continually upgrade as needed. As a result, it's a bit of ""neither fish nor fowl"". It's not as complex as Civilization series (certainly not that this price point) yet it's deeper than most games at this price level. SMS limits you to a single fleet, which started at 2 corvettes, but as you continued to upgrade them they became larger, stronger, more heavily armed, more heavily shielded and armored, faster, better sensors and/or stealth, even more fighter bays. You can also add ships if you can afford to do so. Prices go up as component ratings go up. And given the various fields you can upgrade, you can customize the ships to fit almost any strategy. Enjoy hit and run? Long range torpedo attack under stealth? Long range laser bombardment? Sending fighters to pick apart the enemy? You can do it in this game. SMS starts you off with one world, and as you move your fleet you will discover more systems, each of which will have a mission for you. Could be as simple as fleet action (where you need to destroy the other fleet) to hold on for five turns, to escape in 5 turns, and so on. Each world also produce resources (energy, food, metal, science, etc.) which can then be spent on planet upgrades, ship upgrades, research, and so on. Each planet upgrade, much like the city structures in Civ, have tangible production benefits. Perform enough missions at a system and you can pull that planet into your sphere of influence. SMS lets you interact with other political entities as you find them, and they, much like civilizations in Civ, will greet, threaten, cajole, sign treaties, and more. SMS lets you setup various map conditions from tiny to huge in size, different starting positions and tech levels, and more. Even the win condition can vary, as you can go for domination, or get wonders, science, diplomacy, and other victories. You can only have one fleet, whcih is why this game drew a comparison with the Heroes of Might and Magic (HOMM) series, where the hero with his stack of creatures move around the map, to various action points on the map to do combat with either defenders of a castle or other important locations. As one conquers each castle one also needs to spend $$$ on the castle as improvements, much like in SMS one must buy planetary population or planetary improvements. If there's combat, then your units will do combat on a hex-map of the system where there are various wormholes, asteroids (small and large), planets, and other structures, as your ship(s) will fire lasers, plasma cannons, and/or torpedoes at the enemy ships, as well as send out fighter wings to conducting harassing or direct attacks. Whoever left standing is the winner, but depending on damage suffered it can be a pyrrhic victory. The idea generally is put yourself where your fleet can concentrate fire on one enemy ship while staying out of range or firing arc of others by hiding behind asteroids and/or planets. Graphics are ""fine"", as it's sci-fi-y look but quite clear and concise. The map scrolling takes a little getting useto as there is no free rotation (there is, but it snaps back into place as you release the mouse) and there is no edge scroll or keyboard scroll which surprised me somewhat. OTOH, the ships, the protagonist of the game, are interesting as everything you add has an immediate visual effect. Ships get longer, bulkier, with visible weapons and other modules added, and what was a wimpy corvette will eventually morph into a full battleship, and you'll visually see the differences. All in all, SMS is NOT Civ-in-Space, though it has a similar feel, but it's far more related to HOMM or Infinite Space series than Civ. As long as you keep that in mind, enjoy the strategy-lite game.			"

NO Civ or Usual PC-StrategyStarships is a Fast-paced, Turn-based, tactical and strategical game aimed at modern players, who prefer a short campaign with a strategical depth that they can grasp while playing it casual.Something that a Fan of Sid Meier, Civ, Firaxis and PC-Strategy just isn't used to. And therein might be the reason for most negative reviews: every feature is reduced to its bare essentials to provide a dense and fast strategy experience. It doesn't want to fill your evenings! It want's your small chunks of spare-time, entertaining for 30 to 90mins at a time. Your trip to work, your break, or that 40mins that you can steal away while your kids watch their favored show.Unusual Design Decisions(Things you should get accustomed to, to enjoy it)Just one FleetStarships strategy core is to use your one fleet most efficient. Your effectiveness at the meta-gameplay is defined by accomplishing as much as possible with this one fleet each turn. No matter how big your empire, your turn has always the same amount of moves and actions. No uneventful early turns or tedious later turns.Every turn counts!Tactical MovementThe tactical combat is all about movement: range and angle for the shot but most of all cover, mixed with some divide&conquer. Unusual for a spaceship game, but it ensures that how you move is always more important than the strength of your fleet!Simplified ProgressionStarships has 4 paths of progression: The Fleet (invest energy), Research(invest science), more Planets(conquered), and Production(invest food and metal). where each part of progression isn't much more than a counter with increasing price for every point. But everything is well crafted into one big progression circle. The progression is simple and easy to comprehend, but exactly the right amount for a fast strategy game like this.Closing WordsI love strategy games, no longer hardcore, but ""normal"" ones like Civ. And yes, this game isn't for me, at least not for that part of me. It can't fuel a strategy addiction with dozens of hours, but Starships never wanted to! It tries to offer tactics&strategy to casual and short-time players; Or old ones, who can only relive the old days for one hour or two at a time.It deserves a place on the gaming market, but right now it is drowned in negative reviews of players, who expected something else.Please understand, that Starships weaknesses are a strength to a lot of gamers out there. Give them a chance to find it!			"

												I like to say this first I have never done a review before so please be nice . (for those of you who things this is going to be a sid meiers verson of galactic civilizations you will be disapointed )Now I do like the game its a good little expansion on the Civilization: Beyond Earth but it should of been on a tablet not PC as it lacks a lot in areas most PC sid Meier games don't.""Tactical Space Combat: Encounter unique tactical challenges in every mission"" not really you just face 2/3 ships at most which  just charge you so all do you is get fighters then swam them instant win also there's no fog of war so you see every step they do  and so do they which means  cant ambush them, flank or do any strategic movements BTW don't worry about losing all you ships as all that happens is they send back to a non enemy planet and just needs repairing  ""dynamically generated maps""  consist of about  few dozen asteroids hex in a random cluster in groups  here and there that only take a small % of damage away from the attack, a planet which does nothing but block your shoot , worm holes that's not needed really as you cant go through them and use the asteroids as cover since they allow the shoot anyway and a passage way through asteroids  that no point in using as there's little benefit for using them. ""victory conditions"" are the same 4 as always domination, population , wonders,  science  BTW if you want to do no victory conditions you cant and  you have to pick one and if you want to keep playing you cant its returns you to menu. ""foes""  did 12 battles before I got bored which  10 of had the same ships and 2 had the same but with one extra new type of ship but little was different same lets charge tactic same weapons and modules just looks different.""Fully Customisable Starships"" no I say wouldn't say fully as all you do is choose modules that constant of 9 things engines, shields, armour, lasers(long range,) plasma(close range),  torpedoes, (that are useless since they take 2/3 turns to get where you want but by then your target has  moved far away and cant change path to him them) sensors, stealth, fighters (which are all the same ) and you cant paint  them  or rename the ships and there's little different when you upgrade the modules they just get little bigger . Also all you get is corvette that have different names and start stats such as fast corvette that starts with a little boost to speed""Diplomacy"" for not major factions are all the same kill/protect this for this rewards and  influence so that they join your federation for major factions is very stupid you ask them about their cooperative and they tell you their population the ships they have which modules they have so you can very easily keep a eye on what they r doing with no spies ask them about their territories they tell you what planets they are targeting what they have in both resources and planets then you ask them what they done they tell you everything from what research they done to what repairs they done and  then its I like you lets be friends and then end call there's no treaties that I found after 20 turns  ""Strategy"" I do this for the galaxy map.  You have only one fleet  so attacking in multiple areas is a no so you just pick a target that you can move to so that you can win .  ""Exploration"" is not possible as it works on planet jump system where you go from planet to planet which  when  ever you go to a planet you have to do a mission they set or you go back to the last planet you was on ""Expand the influence of your Federation and gain the trust of the citizens of new planets."" do 4 missions they join you that's it ""Use the unique abilities of the each planet""  are just higher production in one area not amazing and basic need for a game such as this ""Fight pirates, protect colony ships, destroy rogue AI and more"" can be summed up as  fight the same ships, protect same ships  form a faction from the same ships of the pirates , destroy a ball that looks like a eye and repeat""Multiple Paths To Victory"" there's 4 to shorten the review its a  pc game that will end up being a tablet game by then end of next week			"

												I hate to say it, but this game is simply too simple.  It is the strategorical equivalent of Monopoly.  Yes, it's light, it's simple, and the tactical battles can be a little fun.  But there is no real resource management or troop management or build management.  Everything you want to build, is built instantly on your turn.  New ships, ship upgrades, planetary upgrades, cities, even wonders.  If you have the resources, you could win by building a ton of cities or wonders in a handful of turns.  There are no tough decisions about building 5 small units or planetary upgrades instantly or building 1 large unit or wonder that will take a few turns to generate.  All of my turns devolved into - have energy, build/upgrade my fleet - DONE!  Have food?  Add cities.  Have science?  Research something - BOOM, added to all your ships or planets.  It is way way too simple.  If they ever add multiplayer, it might might give this some more potential.  As it is, skip it if you truly enjoy 4x games.  I feel I get more strategy from Clash of Clans than Starships...and for a Firaxis and Sid Meier title, that is a deplorable thing to consider.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but in this case I needed to make an exception.97 minutes.Yep, that's how long it took to start up the game, futz around with it a bit looking for settings, reading the options for your new commander and then win.I know - it's a bit slow, but in my defense, I did actually read the initial missions thinking there would be something deeper there.  There isn't.Get enough energy to build your ships up to battleships, take enemy home planet (which gives you instantly everything they own) and rinse / repeat for however many players there are.  No need to build wonders, cities, or anything else meaningful (though I did waste at least half of that 97 minutes doing just that thinking it would matter.)Makes you wonder as to the replay value, though I suppose if I'm truly bored I can try a variety of the missions just to try them out.Sorry, Sid.  For as much entertainment your games have provided me over the years - this one just plain stinks. "

												Pros: It's a cheap DLC package essentially.Cons: The games are so short when playing against the computer, it almost makes no sense. It's mind-numbingly repetative tasks and very little in the way of actual gameplay. You basically have a small, static technology tree that you invest credits into. You have planets that you perform very basic tasks with and you essentially fly around the galaxy map as quickly as possible to friend or conquer as many planets as you can to win the game. The game seems very broken too. EPIC maps are fairly small and picking a victory condition seems to have no bearing on the ending at all. I've lost a number of games now where I picked domination as the victory and computer players have beaten me building wonders or having large populations despite not controlling most of the galaxy. Games rarely last 30 minutes or more. When you capture a number of planets, there is no central management screen, so you have to hop from planet to planet to build new cities or other improvements. It's really not what I expected. If you want a starship game, with control of resources, ship customization, civilization customizations and deep technology trees, then find Master of Orion III or Endless Space. This felt like a really cheap, unfinished knockoff of past, great titles and thankfully I only spent $14 on such a disappointment.			"

Unfortunately, what I purchased was theoretically a 15€ PC game from a major PC game studio.The game, per se, isn't too bad. But it is definitively not worth the current price.

												2 hours is long enough for me to know that you should spend an extra $5 and buy Star Ruler 2, which is a far, far better game in every imaginable way. $15 for an extremlely simplistic and shallow iOS game ported to PC is just too much. If you need space 4X, buy Star Ruler 2. It's $20 now before it releases in a couple weeks. Support an indie developer, instead of Firaxis, who has obviously become unaware of how to make a fun game any more.			"

Posted: January 20, 2016
												In the long line of Sid Meier sticking his name into game titles comes ""Sid Meier's Starships,"" a hexigrid turn based galactic strategy in the vein of Civilization. The twist here is there are planets to join your galactic federation and turn based starship battles with your armada against an opponents.  Building your armada and competing in battles is by far the most fun of the game. I'd say it is the real game and everything else is just fluff. You can buy vessels, then upgrade engines, shields, armor, lasers, cannons, torpedoes, scanners, stealth and fighters.The world is never enough and the universe is yours to conquer, purify or unify. There are several victory states such as domination, population, building wonders or scoring the top tier of a few science fields. While its nice to have all these ways to win, it feels like the game is geared toward conquering the galaxy. There's an entire space battle system in place and its silly to overlook it and play diplomatic. The only real way to ensure that I'll have a science or wonder victory is to make that the only type of victory allowed.Battles take place on a hexigrid map, which in a way is illogical since space has a Z axis, but whatever. You can make use of heavy asteroids, planets and moons as cover. In a way its laughable that planets are as wide as four vessels. Smaller asteroids give less cover, but you're still prone to attack, but take less damage.If a vessel is hiding behind cover, you can fire a limited amount of torpedoes that will breach cover. The only catch is you need to detonate the torpedo one turn later, so that gives your foes a chance to move. You get to see your torpedo fly and then push the button to make it explode. Its a great dynamic to have. Even when I'm out of range, I'm firing torpedoes just to do something. Torpedoes are limited to the number you have upgraded on that star ship.Each ship gets a turn with a movement and an action in either order. During an action it depends what the vessel has upgraded. You can attack, impulse an extra move space, cloak hide, scan for cloaked vessels and release ships. If you chose to move, you can attack as you move you move between two cover points, but I never felt a need to get that complicated. Releasing ships adds a small cluster of fighters with long range movement, little health and no shields.Vessels have shields, so if your weapon's attack power is less than the shield, its ineffective. Once shields are down, then you can do some big damage. The armor rating amounts to hit points. The more upgrades you have to a ship, the slower it moves, so you'll need to upgrade engines. Then there's stealth that conceals a ship unless an enemy is near it and upgraded scanners will compensate for finding stealth enemies. Its a good dichotomy.Other notable features on a map include anomalies that when you fly into them, you appear out of a different one. Its good for speeding things along if there's one ship left, but your comrades are across the map. Even if you pop out in a random location, its still closer and a chance to flank enemies.Battles have a victory condition, a map condition and a card. Most of the time you earn victory by annihilating the opposition. Other times its defend an outpost, escort a vessel to an outpost, guard warp gates, destroy a single vessel or get a ship of yours into a warp gate. The maps feel generated and the map conditions are things like enemy torpedoes are undetectable, more asteroids, less asteroids, shields are less effective. It adds some diversity to the battles. Then there are the cards which feel forgotten about. You get one or so cards during each battle and its a gamble when you use them. I wish I could say more, but in seven hours of playing, I never made use of them beyond a curiosity.The idea of the game is that your entire armada flies from planet to planet. After these battles win or lose, you keep all your ships, but you need to repair them for the damage that they've taken. So a major loss requires you to repair everything. Well if your armada wrecks the armada of a competitor that leaves that same competitor open for more attacks on the same turn. Blood thirsty players like myself will keep pushing through, but to prevent the entire universal conquest on a single turn, your crew's efficiency goes down with each battle. Once its as low as it gets, you're forced to take a shore leave and end your turn.Like a lot of these hexigrid games, you're competing and aligning with other competitors. You start the game by visiting planets, gaining their support which seems rather easy. Just win a battle and you're halfway there! Take a shore leave on a planet that you have 50% devotion with and you can gain an extra 25%. Some planets end up contested where four competitors can have a stake in it.Once you've taken quarter of a planet you can spend food to plant cities; I'm sure that's how it works. Cities increase workers I guess. I was never too sure. The game just told me to build cities, so I did.From there there are upgrades to a planet. Upgrades cost metal and give you more resources across various types that never felt of any consequence. Other planet upgrades include planetary defense craft, giving you a home field advantage with an extra vessel if an enemy ever attacks. Constructing a warp gate can bring your fleet to a planet under attack.Spend science points on technology upgrades that will boost armada stats by 25% of a single category. Plenty of planets will reward you with a technology of your choosing. Even if you are about to enter a battle with someone, you can negotiate and they will give you technology or food to leave the planet. If you agree, that's some sort of a peace treaty right there. Other times if you have a 95% chance of winning, the game lets you have the planet without a fight.It feels like I managed the bare minimum of micromanagement and got away with it. Rather than clicking on each planet to build this or that, I just clicked on one and upgraded until I was broke. There is an information icon to click on that will advise you what you should do, but it should just be on the screen without me having to click something. Perhaps a hide button would be better for players that want to play it their own way. Even with no guide and little to no tutorials I still managed to get through it.When you start a new game, you select map size, up to six opponents, difficulty and victories. Enormous still felt small, but I suppose on normal took me four hours to conquer the galaxy while easy took only three. Easy mode is laughable. My first time playing, none of my vessels were ever damaged, let alone destroyed. Its a good way to get your feet wet, but about an hour in, there was no challenge. Normal felt like a good challenge, but there are still two difficulties.You have a selection between twenty-four characters, eight within each of the three motivations for supremacy, harmony and purity. Each one has their own stat boost. One character has a 25% better this or that. Sometimes less cost, other times more of whatever. Some start with an extra vessel.I feel less stress and more joy playing this game than I do with Civilization games. Those other games feel like there's always a cold war and you need to prepare before the invaders come, while I feel like here I have my destiny in my own hands. I'm smart enough to win battles even when the game tells me that I have a 25% chance of winning. Its also a small game. When other publisher and developer are 4 GB large, this one fits on a CD at 650 MB. Must be all that blank space rather than terrain.			"

												I don't even know where to start with this one. I bought this one being a space-game junkie and a Sid Meier fan. I don't know what I expectedLet's start with the menu options. Namely the settings. Is there a resolution setting? There is not. Is there a LOD setting? There is not. Is there Vsync, or literally ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER to optimize graphics? There is not. The only settings you can change is the volume. Unbelievable. Let's talk about the gameplay. This is so very obviously a mobile title hastily ported over to PC/Mac. There is no avoiding it. The simplistic GUI/gameplay mechanics drive this point home. Most of the core civ mechanics are there, like... building improvements and wonders. And resources.Another thing I found odd (probably a holdover from it being a mobile port) is that you(or AI) can only control one fleet at a time. Greeeaaaat. The combat is fun but not very solid. You upgrade your ships with energy that you get each game turn. However, as the game goes on, combat becomes exceedingly easier. Capturing a capital causes you to annex the ENTIRE opposing empire. Not a percentage of it. ALL of it. Meaning that you can achieve victory VERY quickly. My first playthrough on hard only lasted two hours(!). My quickest Civ 5 playthrough EVER was 6.Also of note is that my computer crashed twice while playing the game. Not the game, the actual computer had a kernel panic. My final, most egregious sin that I found in this game is that it is a Sid Meier game without a ""One more turn..."" option.I canot recommend this game in any way. It is a pure cash grab.			"

												A board game set in space with Sid Meier's name attached. As far as board games go it's decent, if repetitive. But as a game bearing the brand of Sid Meier... well, it's lackluster. It doesn't have the strategic depth of the Civilization series nor does it have those little details that draw you into the game world being portrayed, like Pirates did. Starships felt like something an indie studio would have done and I would have been pleased purchasing this game as a $4 iPad app. But with the expectations of a Sid Meier game, well, it left a bad taste in my mouth.

												Overall I would recommend this game, not without a couple of warnings though.The game is fun to play and I'm sure to play it many more times... but there is also the first problem. It is a very short game. Personally I prefer the long drawn out building style or grand strategy games. This game can often be brought to conclusion (win or lose) in less than two hours, which for my personal taste is about two or three hundred hours too short ;) You are limited to one fleet which also makes it a bit too easy (no need to choose where precious resources are used)The other problem that ties in with the above is that it then also tends to get quite redundant quite quickly (which does not mean it cannot still be fun! - I do have a lot of fun with it). There is a limited number of missions, which although randomized by the terrain do tend to be ""always the same"".  There is always a ""Pirate Homeworld"" and a ""Marauder Homeworld"". And since there tends to be very limited time you can't really get much into planing long detailed ""reasearch paths"", because the game will be over long before you reach your goal. Part of this can be alleviated by playing a domination game, but even then time will still be very limited.So in conclusion:Fun to play (thus the thumbs up).But way too short. "

												Not sure I'd spend the $13 again.  It seems like the start of a good game, but the gameplay mechanics are quite a bit mroe simple than what a couple of friends could come up with after playing Twilight Imperium for a weekend.  Tech trees are incredibly shallow, starships are not visually customizeable, and a few of the wonders are honestly a bit too wonderful. Dual Commands breaks pretty much everything, and the move-while-stealth one turns stealth into a gamebreakingly good mechanic.  I beat the game with untouched starships by just pumping my stealth up to the max and moving around plasma cannon-ing everything without any sort of retribution from the AI.If you choose not to break the game, by ignoring the wonders, then the gameplay can actually be tactically rewarding.  Even so, while a board game like Twilight Imperium might have a dozen such space battles over the course of the game, literally every mission is a space battle and it gets very repetitive very quickly.  There are a few different types of space battle missions but there could be far more and, honestly, there could be more diplomacy as well.  Diplomacy in the game boils down to the other player giving a simple ""take it or leave it"" offer... no haggling, no asking for Planet X and I'll leave you alone, nothing.  What if they've got tons of metal that you need, but all they offer you to keep out is energy?  Well, guess you'll just have to go in and take it by force, because you can't even ask for it.This is the first game I've played that I really felt had a ""Sid Meier Markup"".  If the game was just called ""Starships"", it'd be a $3-$5 tablet game.  Unfortunately, it's ""Sid Meier's Starships"" so it's a $13 game.  I almost felt the same way about Civilization: Beyond Earth, which feels very flat compared to normal Civilization games, but I stopped somewhat short because, honestly, a lot of that is a lack of ""history"" giving a real feel of advancement as a society rather than advancement as a tech-tree.  But with this game, I definitely feel it.  No strategic depth, no real incentive to pursue most of the technologies, and Wonders that make the rest of the game take a back seat in importance, and quickly push the tactical gameplay toward an undefeatable super fleet.  If you're looking for a good space empire sim, this isn't it.			"

												A 1080p video review of Sid Meier's Starships:


YouTube™ Video: Sid Meier's Starships (PC) Review 

			Views: 441		

			Sid Meier's Starships is a recently released spin-off of Civilization: Beyond Earth. A turn-based strategy game in space where you explore the galaxy and create your own federation.		

Sid Meier's Starships is a recently released light-4X turn-based strategy game. It takes a stab at integrating FTL-like space exploration, Heroes of Might & Magic-style combat, and minimal 4X strategy elements... but is extremely lightweight in all regards. This PC version is a mobile port that's seen less than the bare minimum amount of effort put into it: 30fps limit, no fullscreen, no graphics options (not even resolutions!), UI designed for touch devices & small screens, and dated graphics even by mobile gaming standards. The gameplay proved interesting for a few campaigns, but quickly fell apart.See the video review above for more details - and some visual examples of what I'm talking about.RecommendationIf you'd like to play a lightweight 4X space strategy on the go... then you might like the mobile version.There's nothing here that should appeal to PC gamers with an interest in the genre on PC.Despite its low price point there are many superior alternatives at even lower price points:4X strategy in space: Galactic Civilizations 2, Sins of a Solar Empire, Sword of the Stars, etc.Space exploration: Faster Than Light, Space Rangers, etc.Technical Droning120Hz - No60 fps - No, it's limited to 30fpsFullscreen - NoBorderless Window - Yes, but badly implementedGraphics Options - NoneTexture Quality - Low			"

												It's essentially a mobile game ported to PC and an offshoot of Civilization:Beyond Earth. From the settings, over the game setup down to the entire gameplay concept the game feels very light in terms of substance. You control a fleet and send it around the map to take over planets via tactical combat. You develop planets and do research. There is diplomacy, a market system and different victory conditions.You may now think: This is wonderful! Exactly what I am expecting from a turnbased strategy game! Unfortunately, since it's a mobile port, the game lacks in all mentioned aspects. The AI in tactical combat is not very clever and can be easily outmaneuvered, leading to repetitive combat making it, due to the lack of auto-combat, appearing like a chore after a while since scenarios differ very little. This cannot be offset at any time by the fact that you can customize your ships even though even that feels a little bland as it's more or less pushing weapons and speed to the maximum of level of 8 for each ship. Your ships also do not get destroyed per se but only suffer from repairable damage and based on random chance may also level up. Planet development is based on four resources (metal, food, research and cash). Each resource has a resort function, food allows you to spam cities which in return allow higher production of all resources, metal allows you to build a select few different buildings up to an amount of 8. Research allows you to tech certain aspects of your ship up to a level of 6 while cash is solely used to upgrade different modules of your ships whereas ship class is almost meaningless as each ship has exact the same amount and type of modules.The diplomacy system is as deep as billboard and the market system at some point a pain to use due to static and low exchange rates.Even though overall gameplay can be further tweaked through selection of affinities, victory types, difficulty level, map size and number of opponents I find its replayability degrading quickly. You are in fact better off playing a better space combat sim or just BE(RT).Overall the game can be quickly summarized and in terms of essentially being a mobile game: its gameplay depth and replayability is far lower than say Fallout Shelter is and that one, despite also being a different genre, is free. I don't expect much depth from a low-budget PC game but there are better choices for 14.99 €. I suggest not to buy it outside special sales events at a maximum of 7.49 €. If you are a hardcore TBS player I would skip it really unless you really feel the need to unlock those traits for BE(RT).Firaxis can do better but this game is really not adding anything positive to the genre, at least not on PC.

												I really wanted to like this game.I have loved every previous Civ game released.Sid Meier's Starships wouldn't be worth downloading if it were an app for an iPhone.No multiplayer, no replayibility, and a massive waste of my $15.I don't even care that I threw away money on this waste of time, I'm just disapointed given what it could have been as compared to what it was.I suppose this is what happens when you are naive enough to purchase a game based on previous brand goodwill alone.

												The other negative reviewers have it right. The mechanics of the battles are very simple and don't provide much need for innovation or strategy and it quickly becomes a grindfest after 5-10 hrs. of game play. Similarly, the tech trees are all very linear. Races don't feel different. Your play style will remain largely the same with each. Those hoping for the thrill of the Civ games in a space/tech setting will be disappointed.			"

												The connectivity to Beyond Earth as a joke. There seems to be a few achievements in Beyond Earth which gives you an advantage in Starships. That’s it.The actual game is really simplistic. It may be good enough for a tablet game, but a good add-on to Beyond Earth would have been better.When you have to made the decision between Civ:5 complete and Beyond Earth/Starships, definitely take Civ:5.

												Short game with limited replayability. I still enjoyed it. I wouldn't pay full price for it but if you can get it on sale for $5.00 or so then I would recommend it for sure. It's not a bad game, but it lacks depth in my opinion.The game continues the story from Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth, where the original colonists of the planet have advanced down three possible paths. You get to choose one of the same three paths in Beyond Earth in this game as well, only in space this time with spaceships. This affects the cosmetics on your ships as well as a few other things. You are also able to choose from a variety of different leaders which give a unique starting bonus. One of these bonuses that I love is the one that gives you a second starting ship, since you only start with one.After you choose your starting conditions and possible victory conditions (there are many ranging from population, to even domination.), you then jump into the game. It's quite easy to win even on hard difficulties. The player takes their ship to a neutral planet in an attempt to make the planet join their side. After a few missions (that you have to pass), they join you, but don't think you can just go and take it with no competition. Your ship/ships have limited movements, so choose which planets you want to take wisely. Other civilizations will try to compete against you for the neutral planets until there are basically none left, leaving only one way to expand. Domination. Or you could just win a different type of victory by then and have the game end, it's quite possible. Combat is quite easy, as long as you don't throw all of your ships into the grinder to get shredded apart. Your ship can use a variety of different methods for combat such as hangars, long range weapons, short range weapons, and other utility items such as a cloaking device or a scanner. The problem is that if you have enough supplies to upgrade your ships to be overpowered, then you will be unstoppable. Resources are quite easy to get too, so that means overpowered ships are as well. So you could just win the game with one ship if you really wanted to, instead of making a ton of ships. Do this by getting a max level hangar and spitting out little fighters to wreck your enemies.There is also diplomacy in this game, so feel free to explore that option as well. You can befriend others and team up to take down another, or force others to give you resources or ship upgrades. Last but not least I will mention this: each planet has upgrades that you can do to increase resource production, population, etc. Most planets also have great wonders you can build that give (sometimes overpowered) upgrades to your ships depending on your playstyle. Some upgrades could be useless to you if you don't want to use a certain thing.Basically, if you aren't a fan of easy games I'd avoid this, but I still enjoyed my experience with it. I'd give it a 5/10.			"

												Sid Meier is a name synonymous with the fine art of destroying a person’s free time, one social event after another. His influence is known throughout the stars as one which’ll have you glued to whatever screen is nearby. His recent attempt to devastate social circles was a salvo of Civilization: Beyond Earth. His love-letter back to the days of Alpha Centuri was well-received but lacked a little something special. We wanted to battle across the stars and gain supremacy not just colonize a rock. Luckily Sid Meier’s Starships has come along to fill that role.Sid Meier’s Starships takes the narrative of Beyond Earth off into the stars using — erm well, starships. Before dipping into a game, you’ll be asked to pick a Leader and an Affinity. There are eight different leaders on offer with each bringing their own minor benefits to gameplay. These vary from the long-term benefits of increased resource gains to quick-start perks like an extra ship or technological upgrades from the very beginning. For those concerned about this making one leader more powerful than the others we should quell your fears. These all pan out to be equally matched, focused more on augmenting the players personal play-style than any sort of quick victory scheme.Another way in which you can customize your own forces to work in a way best suited to you is through the selection of Affinities. These come in the flavors of Purity, Supremacy, and Harmony, each one with its own benefit to further allow you to mold your fleet into the shape you feel best. No square pegs in round holes here. The array of options on offer is plentiful enough for everyone to carefully create exactly what they desire mechanically from an interstellar civilization.These two work in unison to build a galactic playpen of sorts where you’re invited to try different combinations to change up the gameplay. Thankfully, Sid Meier’s Starships makes this even easier by cramming each full game into no more than a couple of hours for the most part. That’s thanks mainly to its variety of challenging yet welcoming victory conditions. They’re nothing different when compared to the 4X conditions we’re used to seeing every day, not that it makes them any less worthwhile or satisfactory to complete.Drifting around this playpen is turn-based but not in the totally traditional sense. You don’t move from Bootis 54 to Celarin 69 only to be forced into watching opponents zip around the map. Every flight from world to world reduces the morale of your crew. When this starts to fade they’ll become less effective encouraging Shore Leave. This is literally where your fleet stops and the others get going. They couldn’t make it another End Turn button since there’s already one in the battle portion of Sid Meier’s Starships.Collecting the resources or necessary population to get the victory screen, which comes with a short ending cinematic that always seems to feel like the ending to Return of the King in that it gets longer every time you watch it, revolves around your ability to gain Influence on planets. Your first jump to a world is almost always greeted with some sort of mission or calamity that you must overcome for a modest reward and Influence. It’s in these short battles where the majority of Sid Meier’s Starships plays out and where you’ll enjoy yourself the most.Before going into these, you’ll have to get your fleet together. Each of your vessels is totally customizable in terms of the weapons it can bring to bear and how powerful every one of its subsystems is. Using “Energy” you can buy new ships or upgrade your existing ones with more powerful weapons, higher armor statistics, or even the oh so satisfying ability to stealth.There’s a lack of visual modification that comes directly from your input though. For one, each Affinity is blessed with a singular basic style of craft. This does change while the game progresses and you add huge laser batteries or cover ships in armor, it just doesn’t always feel like your fleet because the overall styles remain the same. It makes sense in a multiplayer game but in this single player title, a few more personal options would have been welcome.The reason why this deserves a mention is that when you’re actually giving your fleet’s individual members more powerful cannons, the ships themselves grow in size. It’s actually an awesome thing to watch when that spindly little Corvette you started out with becomes a bonafide bad♥♥♥♥♥ship even the Battlestar Galactica would have trouble facing down. Laser turrets sprout from expanded bulkheads head of multiple engines used to propel these machines of death across the stars and into your opponent’s face.Controlling your ships in battle on the hex-based arena is much the same as out on the larger map. You and the enemy take it in turns to maneuver in order to complete your missions. There are actually a surprising amount of mission types that spring up in Sid Meier’s Starships. Attacking a fleet’s home world and escapes through maze-like asteroid fields do stand out from the crowd, but even the more basic missions which task you with essentially killing everything have enough depth to hold your attention.Completing these missions nets you an instant reward and a little more Influence. This Influence is vital because the more planets you have under your control, the better your chances of winning stack up against opposing forces. You can essentially take over the planets of your enemies by force should you wish. Frankly that’s the most fun way to go as, unlike the parent titles of Sid Meier’s Starships, options outside of conflict are lax at best.It would be true to say that there’s still a value to building cities on planets you’ve assisted or improving their capability to produce materials. It would however be false to say that you can effectively play Sid Meier’s Starships as a complete pacifist. The game’s very nature of giving you missions which all require some form of combat destroys whatever hope you might have had for a political victory. Politics in Sid Meier’s Starships can literally be summed up in one sentence. Politically you can form peace treaties, create alliances against enemies, and declare war. What, you wanted more? Well sorry but for that you’ll need to go to the larger 4X games out there on the market.There are problems with Sid Meier’s Starships though. Now I don’t know how it plays on iPad but on PC it plays like an iPad game. No that doesn’t mean greasy fingerprints on your monitor. Sid Meier’s Starships actually controls pretty well to say you only ever really need to use the left and right mouse buttons, a simple and yet blisteringly intuitive system which fits everything during gameplay Where this becomes a bone of contention is in the interface and its resulting scaling.On a 23 inch screen with the game in full-screen mode on PC, I found that most of the text was hard to read without taking yourself out of the action. That’s not a deal-breaker in itself really. It does however reveal the crack which runs through Sid Meier’s Starships on PC. This game wasn’t built with PC gamers in mind. It was built for tablets until someone decided it would be a cool idea to put this on PC.For a mobile device to PC conversion though, Sid Meier’s Starships is pretty damn good. It looks nice enough to not offend your eyeballs and plays incredibly well. If you’re still on the fence about the game don’t think of it as a tablet port. Think of it as a game you leave running in a background window while doing other stuff.Sid Meier’s Starships does away with all of the research tree and diplomatic hard work that often comes with a 4X title, replacing them with some brilliant turn-based strategy combat and just enough world conquering to keep any evil genius happy.

												This game is classic Sid Meier's - its not Civ - nothing like Civ.  To me, Sid did not disappoint with this title.   I probably should have played Beyond Earth first (bought them in a bundle), but for now, I'm having too much fun with this game.  Overall: Lovely little game.Play time:  Few hours per game - sometimes it finishes before I'd like.Complexity:  Pretty simple.  Learn the few basics and you are good to go.Replayability:  Can see it get boring fast.Graphics:  Nothing spectacular.  Quite immersive at a 4K resolution.Multiplayer:  None.  I wish there was.Glitches/Bugs: Next to none - the screen shakes too long when your ships are destroyed.  That's it.Stability: Perfectly stable for me.  No hangups or crashes at all.It should be called Sid Meier's Starships!  (with an exclamaation).  The simple game depth and design reminds me more of Pirates! and Railroads! ... all quick little games that are great fun.			"

												You cant walk into this game with the expectation that it is going to be an expansive 4x game in a space setting. It's not. It feels almost like a mini game. It's something to take the edge off when you're jonesing for a 4x game but dont have nearly enough time to get into one. I feel like 10-20 years ago I would have hated this game, but when work, family, and other social obligations make it impossible to do 8 hour session of Civ or Total War, this is a ""lite"" alternative. It really feels like it would be most appropriately played on a tablet.			"

												As others wisely said (sadly, after it was too late for me) Avoid this pitfall of a game. This has got to be by far the dumbest-downed Sid Meier's game in history. Let me just list some things this game lacks that are just inexcusable in this age of gaming, no matter the price:1. Any form of Diplomacy or for that matter, interaction with other factions and AI players.2. The tutorial is hilariously lacking, even as a Civ 5/BE player with well over 1000 hours I struggled to understand what all I had to do and how to control the game both in battle and out of battle.3. Customization of your units by picking Harmony, Supremacy, or Purity at the beginning of the game ends there4. Basic information in tool tips is non existent5. Graphic Settings. Yes, that's right, there are absolutely no graphic settings. No resolution, no v-sync, heck you can't even change the brightness of the game. The only setting is full screen or not.6. Auto-Saves. Yep, there is no autosaves in the game, and no options to turn it onLoading from an In-Progress game. Made a mistake and want to reload? Sorry, exit to main menu and reload.7. Balancing is non-existent. On hard mode, factions will declare war with you within 5 turns of the game starting and will have ships that do ten times the damage yours are capable of. They will also take all of the planets possible, leaving you no resources to upgrade after your first turn.  8. Settings in general are missing entirely. No key bindings, no controls explanation, no sound adjustments beyond volume level, no game customization beyond Race, Bonus, and opponents. Honestly, Beyond Earth stripped away dozens of features and I thought that this game was thier answer, that this would plug the gaping holes in thier most recent 4x Game. Unfortunately, they stripped it down even further to it's barest of bones, literally leaving you with a game so very simple that you can play with one hand on your mouse as you beat your head with a hammer held by the other hand for buying this game. Do not buy this game unless it's in the $2-$4 range, I'm not kidding, it's that terrible.  "

												I have followed (and enjoyed immensely) Sid Meier games from the very first one in the early 1980s and I must say that StarShips is my first major let down.At a glance, this game looks like a hybrid between Civilization Lite and Ace Patrol. After playing a few games, Starships fails to live up to either one of those titles; it is an unbalanced mess with very little replayability. The only reason to replay it is to unlock perks in Civ : BE. (Scroll to the end of the the review for info on this feature).An iPad app at best, Starships is devoid of personality, customization and meaningful choices for the player.Ship upgrades could have been this title's saving grace but after a certain point, all your ships will have impenetrable shields, lethal lasers and cannons and enough fighter squadrons to avoid combat almost entirely. For a game which is supposedly centered on tactical gameplay, this seems like a pretty major flaw.Sadly, after a few rounds, brute force seems to be the only way to win the game. Once you have built a few key wonders and expanded your empire beyond 3-4 systems, the game becomes one of patience as the player waits to see his galaxy coverage slowly reach 51%.Pros : - Great Art for mission summarys. Might not be your cup of tea but I really like it.- A full game session from start to finish can take from an hour to an hour and a half.- Playing Starships unlocks new perks/loadouts and maps in Civ : Beyond Earth.Cons :- No option to play fullscreen. The settings menu makes it painfully clear that this is a port of a tablet game. For a company like 2k/Firaxis, this is inexcusable.- Most of the textual descriptions and ""story elements"" are nothing but flavor text.- Diplomacy only serves to artificially lenghten the game.- No customization; you cannot rename starships, planets or change the colors of your spaceships. Funny as this is one of the bullet points on the game's store page.- The end game often occurs without player input. More than once I've won the game because the AI did something which triggered something else which gave me victory. No way of knowing what exactly happened.- Sound guy annoyance : A capital ship explodes and the sound it emits is that of a single person screaming in agony. Rookie mistake.To sum it up, the game feels unfinished, untested, unbalanced and unpolished. I have nothing against shorter games or games with more limited scopes (Ace Patrol was a great example of this) but this just feels rushed. There are many ways to better spend 15$.A note on My2KThe connectivity between  StarShips and Beyond Earth is one of the redeeming (I use the term verrrrry loosely) values of this game. Achieving certain things in either game will unlock content in the other. The downside is that there doesn't seem to be a way to know what the requirements are for unlocking content, forcing you to play blindly and hope that you eventually unlock something.Note that if you are currently playing a game of Civ : BE, a new option in the menu will allow you to <Continue Playing in Starships>. This saves the current factions, their affinities and alliances and allow you to start a new game of Starships with these parameters. Cool idea but it makes absolutely no sense in either game's narrative.			"

												Game ran well for me. I pre-ordered and started playing 5 minutes after it was enabled on Steam.I am a huge fan of 4x , TBS and Sid Meier ...but this game is not worth 15 EUR . A price tag of 5 EUR would be ok for it and advertised as a DLC for CIV: BE . As a standalone game it sucks and is the first Sid Meier game that completly lacks 'One More Turn' effect :( .My First campaign was a fiasco. I had 40%+ domintation and suddenly an AI did a wonder victory. I don't know how, what a wonder victory means or how it is achieved. The game gives you no information on stuff like that. Also there are no options inside the game. Overall it feels like a crapy game. I have seen better games done by advertising campaigns for some random products.			"

												Was fun, but way too simple. Completed 2 games over 14 hours of gameplay...where's the Civilisation week-long investment?A common complaint these days, games just feel rushed out without time to think the gameplay experience through.Mid-end game combat ends up a walk in the park, and so I found the only tense moments are in the first dozen turns...and the diplomacy system is laughable - just 'war' or 'not war'. Where's the tech exchange? Treaties? Backstabbings? Alliances? Trade? Nope just that on or off switch...When only 0.7% of players have had their homeworld attacked, you know something's gone wrong.(there's an achievement for it ...and it actually shows only 0.7% of players have been awarded it)			"

												Review from Whiskey Reviews[wskosc.blogspot.co.uk]Sid Meier's name has become a stamp of instant approval over the years, ever since Pirates! we've accepted it as a seal of quality on Civilization games. Beyond Earth was hugely disappointing, so can the follow-up mend Sid's damaged appeal or is it time to hit end turn? Follow the link to find out.Lets be upfront; Starships is a huge disappointment. Like a good PC gamer the first thing you'll want to do is hit the options button and change resolution and bindings and the like; good luck getting any of that. The game is simply full screen or windowed, though you can resize the window it has the feel of playing a tablet game on your PC - and I've looked favourably upon many a tablet/phone port in the past but Starships stinks of lazy.It's not a bad looking game, resembling Civ 5 on medium settings but tough♥♥♥♥♥♥if your PC can't handle it because there's no graphical quality options to tinker with.While we're being upfront, there's no multiplayer either. If you're mainly a Civ multiplayer person then you'll probably want to skip right to the score and replace whatever number I pick with a big fat zero.The most thrilling Starships ever gets.That feeling doesn't subside with the actual gameplay either, you have one fleet of starships that you can upgrade and move around a randomly generated map. You can build more ships but they always go into this one fleet and no matter how much you upgrade them they're always one of a couple of classes and strategy is rather basic.Like Civilization combat takes place on a hexagonal grid, this time littered with asteroid fields of varying density that you can hide behind and which will lower the power of or block your shots entirely. Unlike Civilization 5 weapons have gigantic ranges of half a dozen tiles or more and more than one unit can occupy the same tile, eliminating what few tactical advantages the hex grid system had.There's no point building a flimsy cruiser loaded down with torpedoes because the enemy can just shoot its long range lasers past your friendly units and take it down, for example.Your two main tactics come in the form of asteroids and stealth.Asteroids as previously mentioned will lower a shots power or block it entirely. It's not always a perfect solution but you can hide weaker ships behind partial asteroid fields and launch fast but flimsy fighters or torpedoes from safety.Stealth meanwhile is a game breaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t button. Hitting the stealth button puts a ring around your ship, enemy ships have to get into this ring to detect your ship and fire upon it. It doesn't take many upgrades to bring this down to a one-hex or even half-hex size, making your ships almost entirely undetectable since the AI seems to forget sensors exist.Coupled with long range lasers, or even powerful short-range plasma weapons and you have a recipe for domination no matter what the odds. Throw in a wonder that allows you to enter stealth at no cost, activating it for free when you move which allows you to remain invisible and fire at the same time and you've got an instant win that'll allow as little as two or three moderately equipped ships to rampage across the galaxy freeing planets from your enemies influence often with no opposition as the AI attempts to preserve resources by not facing you for fear of being dominated.Remember that options screen from earlier?Some flavour is added to the combat via each encounter's random modifier, for example you might not be allowed to move directly right (referred to as ""east"" in game) or asteroid fields might disappear as the battle goes on, or shields might not work as well. They're minor, sometimes annoying and calling them flavour might have been a bit too generous because after four or five matches you'll stop reading them and just hit next.Second on the flavour menu is battle cards, again random effects that buff your fleet for varying effects; perhaps adding an extra shield level or allowing you to move two spaces further or even repairing your ships or damaging the enemies. They're useful in the right situation but I've gone whole campaigns without even using one, mainly because my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t stealth fleet was untouchable. Ooh! Choices! Those are the default selections by the way.The metagame is likewise light on stategy and content; you have crew morale/fatigue and that limits how many times you can move your fleet each turn. The idea being to jump between planets and secure influence to bring them into your empire in order to gain their resources and benefits.You do this by taking part in randomly selected missions for rewards. Having them randomly selected is nice but the serious lack of them, I think there's only about 7 or 8 in total, makes for a lot of repetition even in a medium sized galaxy let alone over multiple games. The missions generally come in three flavours; blow something up, run away, or play king of the hill with an AI too stupid to capture more than one of the points.One mission type I particularly hate, to the point that I let AIs actually take that planet and start a war to get it back later is the maze type. You either get limited sensor range or a limited number of turns and have to navigate a dense asteroid field set up like a maze, sometimes with enemies chasing you too. It's boring and stupid and if I wanted mazes I'd be playing a better game like Rogue, or Shining Force.Gameplay: Still not that good.Resources come in four flavours and have a single use each:Energy allows you to upgrade your ships or add new ones to the fleet.Metals allow you to buy planetary upgrades and build wonders.Food allows you to build cities, improving the resource generation of planets.Research allows you to research things (duh).Credits, lastly, are for buying the other resources via a Sins Of A Solar Empire style market.While I can't complain about the simplicity of the resource system, it does turn into a checklist of things to do every turn, since there's not much point holding onto anything because the diplomacy system might as well not exist so you may as well just dump everything into upgrading your own empire as soon as possible.The only resource you'll really put any thought into is energy, because it's used for repairing damaged ships you'll want to hold a little back each turn in case of a disastrous defeat or, more likely, a ding in the paintwork.Research is similarly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Wonders make a return too, not every planet has one but many do and they're expensive to build but confer a powerful and ride ranging set of bonuses upon your fleet, and only your fleet.Bonuses range from the almost useless Torpedo Boosters (extra torpedo move speed) to the must-have Cloaking (free and automatic stealth) or Fleet Tradition (fatigue doesn't lower your crew's performance), making your third battle per turn just as easy to win as the first.The problem with wonders is that they're also a victory condition, having seven of them is an instant win so if you're late grabbing territory the AI can score an easy victory over you but this also backfires spectacularly as you can just let them build the wonders then go in and start stealing them out from under their noses. Of course, it wouldn't be Starships if they didn't manage to ♥♥♥♥ up the implementation somehow. Wonders aren't the only victory condition, but you'd be forgiven for thinking they are because it's so easy to accidentally win a wonder victory. For example, if you're going for a domination victory (holding 51% of all the planets) you'll have to grab enemy territory and their wonders along with it which leads to accidentally hoarding seven of the bloody things and winning via the condition you didn't want.Too long for Steam: Read the rest at http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk "

												I think people were expecting a lot more from this game than what this game really is. It's just a little twiddle exploring one of Sid Meier's ideas. I can beat an ""epic"" difficult campaign in a matter of hours - my 26 hours as of this review has already put me through multiple campaigns. And in XCOM or Civilizations, I'd normally be maybe halfway through. And it's a spinoff of the Civilization Beyond Earth games - which are okay in their own right but thankfully the real Civilization games are still being actively developed.- Graphics? What graphics. They get the job done, though, and the engine's fairly optimized (Not completely stable, but optimized) so even paper PCs will run it well. And there's no finnagling with the UI, for the most part.- The ships are interesting at first until you understand just how simple they are. It's easy to learn, easy to pick up, and easy to exploit - perhaps too easy.- Combat is really simple - if you don't splurge on turn-based strategy games it might even be interesting, intriguing. There are a few options available to you - long-range laser sniper, hive mind swarmer with fighters, or close range facepuncher with plasma cannons. But compared to a game like XCOM, which has many small intricacies and almost nothing is certain (everything is certain in Starships, believe me, the only random action in a fight is whatever the AI does), Starships really does fade in comparison. You always know what's going to happen, and it happens the same way every time. It really hurts the replayability when you know the same thing that happened last campaign will probably happen again, even on the harder difficulties.- I consider the difference between tactics and strategy as follows: Tactics is being able to whoop someone's♥♥♥♥♥ whereas strategy is putting yourself in a great position to whoop someone's♥♥♥♥♥ That being said I think while the strategy level is just as simple as setting up your ships, the actions you take in the galaxy have a direct and tangible effect on the battlefields. For instance, you can't really be a great carrier swarmer without having Tight Squeeze, Hyperlaunch and Dual Command wonders built and AI modules researched to make the fighters worth something instead of just bait. You can't cover your ships in plasma cannons, engines and shields without having the planets to produce your energy, or which specialize in building said equipment for cheap. So the benefits to good strategy are there. But, like almost everything else, it's just really simple.It's difficult for me to recommend this game, it really is, because of what people will want and how simple this game is. I'm half-convinced that the main target platform for this game is the mobile platform - this would probably be a great mobile game, and it's just so underwhelming for a PC. But for what it is, it's a nice little gem to me, worth a few dozen hours. In the end I won't try to dissuade you from buying it, particularly if it's on sale. Even though feedback is bad, I want a bigger, badder, more complex version of this game that we can really sink our teeth into. Something that can stand proudly by Civ and XCOM. Even if it does have to sprout off Beyond Earth.			"

												Maybe for 5 dollars on the iPad I'd give it a thumbs up. Maybe. But it simple doesn't have the depth or features one would expect with  the name Sid Meier attached. Cool concept, but overly simple and lacking in character. Very very repetitive, with limited features. Clearly designed for tablets and not a true ""PC"" game.If this is your type of game, I'd look at Endless Space (especially on sale) or something similar first.			"

												I rarely write reviews so that should tell you a bit about the emotion I have for it. This is one of the most INCOMPLETE games I've ever played. There are some pieces of genius within this system, but they are hidden by a completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fleet management system, a stripped down research and upgrade system, a planetary management system that is just ""for show"" and a tech tree/wonder system that could be entirely missing and have the same impact on the game as this one. Don't even get me started on the victory system. While this isn't as bad as the abomination that was the spreadsheet simulator MOO3 - this is close enough to bring it up within this context.Clearly there was a lot of thought going into the creation of this game, but it just never comes together in any cohesive way. If you thought that Beyond Earth needed work or never delivered on its promise, stay far far far away from this demoware/proof of concept masquerading as a game. I'm surprised Sid Meier let his name be associated with it.			"

												I've been playing Sid Meier's games for a long long time. They ARE basically what I look for in a PC game and have brought me years of enjoyment. Now we have Sid Meier's Starships, which I'd been waiting for excitedly after the surprisingly great jump to space in Beyond Earth. Unfortunately this game is absolutely horrible. The game lacks that compelling desire its predecessors have to play and defeat it in all ways possible, or even explore the game or the world(s) within, because the interface is awful and the ""story"" throws you into space to do unexplained busy work. I can't begin to explain how this shook the foundations of what I believe to be the fundamental truths of the video game industry. This is coming from a fan who continued to play your games after my brother fell dead at his computer, due to a medical complication, and it just so happened he was playing Alpha Centauri when he passed. I never brought myself to play Alpha Centauri again, but I'd be real sad if he had died playing this pour excuse for a game. I hope you think real hard before putting your name on any product again. I think your time may have passed.Sincerely,Formerly one of your biggest fans,Steven R. Carr			"

TLDR:Fast-paced, single-player, turn-based game.  More like ""Galactic Civilizations"" lite, than ""Alpha Centauri"" or any of the Civs.  Graphics and music are ok, gameplay is fun enough, but the user interface sometimes leaves you swearing at the monitor in an alien language.  I like the game, but was surprised it was a Firaxis title (lacked their typical depth and polish).Pros:+ Unique features add a nice twist+ Decent AI in the game's begining+ Some story and mission variety+ Immersive graphics and music+ Dynamic strategic/tactical mapsMids:* No tutorial (but not hard to learn)* In-game help (encyclopedia) is eh* Limited to 1 fleet (max 8 ships)* Not really a 4x - lacks real control* iOS port; VERY limited settingsCons:- Interface limited and frustrating- Some weird graphic glitches- Diplomacy is a joke - war/peace- Almost no data, lists, or charts- Big mid-game ""steamroll"" effectConclusion:Can't say I don't like the game, as I have enjoyed playing it.  I am however glad that I didn't pay much for it (I'd easily recommend it if you're able to grab it on sale for $7.50 or less).Kinda surprised this was a Firaxis game.  It's fun and all (graphics and music help to make you feel the way you'd expect to when playing a space game), but there is SOOOO much more that could have been there but isn't (list of planets and cities, charts showing ships, ability to make more than one fleet, less kludgy interface, etc.).Consider this a mildly enthusiastic thumbs up (would probably be  ""Thumbs Sideways"" if Steam allowed for the option).

												TLDR: A neat little game with some cool ideas, but mobile-game production values and a lack of long-term depth don't justify the $15 asking price. Worth picking up on sale or if you're desperate for some bite-sized light strategy, though.Store page description aside, Sid Meier's Starships is a turn-based strategy game wherein you try to conquer the galaxy. There are multiple ways to do this, but they all essentially boil down to building an unstoppable battle fleet and destroying your enemies.The game is divided into two layers. On the greater strategic layer, you see the galaxy itself, taking your fleet from planet to planet and performing missions to convince the inhabitants to join your empire. The tactical layer puts you on a hex-based battlescape and maneuvering your individual ships to do whatever needs to be done (and almost always involves the destruction of enemy ships). Complete a mission to gain influence with the planet's population. Gather enough influence and the planet will join your empire wholesale. Of course, your rivals will be doing the same thing in their section of space.The first half of Starships is basically a race for territory and resources, like in any classic 4X. Players will try to expand their empires, pulling in neutral planets and building infrastructure to fuel further conquest. Eventually, borders will start pressing up against each other, the galaxy will run out of neutral planets, and from there, it's a matter of the major players fighting it out to settle who will become space overlord of humanity. This is where things start to fall apart, as massive power swings can come out of nowhere and end a game without warning.There are four victory conditions. Capturing all other players' homeworlds obviously wins you the game, as does maxing out three fields of technology, controlling seven wonders, or governing over half of the galaxy's total population. The big swings come out of the way homeworld battles work. When a player captures another player's homeworld, the losing player's empire is immediately turned over to the conqueror in its entirety. A player with 15% of the galaxy's population can shoot up to 40% or more in a single battle, or zoom past the seven-wonder victory threshold before anyone knows what's going on.The actual starship combat is simple and easy to learn. Lasers have long effective ranges, while plasma cannons boast superior firepower once you can bring them to bear. Firing one means not being able to fire the other that turn. Torpedoes have a delay before they can be detonated, but are effective at area denial. Cloaking technology can make ships untargetable if there's no sensor-equipped enemy nearby to reveal them. Strike craft are weak, but they're fast and they can be replaced and repaired for free. Attacking a ship from the sides or rear generally provides hefty increases in damage done, and doing more damage increases the chance of scoring a critical hit and damaging the effectiveness of a ship's systems. Controlling various wonders, as usual, allows a player to break some of these rules.The economy side of the game exists purely to support the combat side of the game. You will not be building fantastic monuments and converting heathens to your banner using the power of your culture. You will not unlock the mysteries of the universe that bring your people to a new stage of enlightenment. You will research bigger guns, heavier armor, and more efficient engines for the ships. You will build ships, or you will build factories that build ships, or you will build factories that build factories that build ships. All roads lead to ship. The ship is love, the ship is life.Speaking of the ships, customization here is kind of weak. Rather than picking and choosing modules that change the way the ships function, you simply pick a category, choose a rating from 0-8, spend the requisite amount of ship-specific currency, and move on to the next. There's a certain amount of technique involved in weighing tradeoffs between speed and armor, or pure firepower versus stealth capabilities, or fighters versus torpedoes, but if you're looking for omnidirectional shields, stealth torpedoes, point defense cannons or any kind of customization that's any more complex than making one number larger than the others, you'll have to hope that there's a wonder that'll serve your purposes.Sid Meier's Starships was released simultaneously on PC and iOS, and it really shows. The UI is clearly designed for a mobile crowd, and it values clean visuals and uncluttered space above all else (including, at times, functionality). The ingame options menu is a joke, consisting of volume sliders and the options to turn tutorials and fullscreen mode on or off. There are no resolution or detail settings, which might be for the best because there's not a whole lot of detail to be had in the first place.Installing modules on a ship changes the model itself, but those changes don't exactly carry into the battles themselves. A battleship bristling with weaponry won't show off all of its guns firing with separate particle and lighting effects, just a slightly-larger salvo of lasers inexplicably curving in space as they approach their target. The backdrops and leader portraits have a painted look that washes them clean of finer details. All leader audio has been lifted from Civilization: Beyond Earth, and the only other voicework ingame consists of short combat barks along the lines of ""critical damage"" or ""nice shot."" Completing the game, regardless of method, affinity, or faction, yields the same unskippable victory cutscene (yes, a PC-centric developer released a game with unskippable cutscenes). If another player wins, their victory is announced with a quiet pop-up before the game unceremoniously dumps you back to the title screen--a title screen that lacks a proper exit button.Sid Meier's Starships boasts connectivity with Civilization: Beyond Earth, but you have to sign up for a My2K account to take advantage of that connectivity, and I'm not interested in juggling yet another set of login data. I doubt that it's a game-changer for either game, but I could be wrong. Either way, it's the cherry on top of the Bad Mobile Port sundae. As a proof-of-concept, Starships is great, boasting several ideas that I hope can be refined and make their way into future games (flanking-based damage, one randomly-determined wonder per city-equivalent, mission-based diplomacy), but it's all buried under a huge pile of the stereotypical money grab (content gated behind company-specific login, subpar production values, halfhearted PC port, gameplay that bottoms out within three hours). It really feels like an iOS game that got ported to the PC as an afterthought, and for $15, you might as well catch a good movie instead. Starships is a decent guilty pleasure, but I'd only recommend it if you can catch it on sale.			"

												having played all the other SM Civ games I was pretty hopeful for this game.  The first thing that bothered me was no fullscreen mode.  The best there was, was to change my taskbar settings to autohide which was a bit annoying but at least it worked.  Picking which faction at the beginning doesn't seem to make too much of a difference; to be honest I don't even remember which I picked so it's completely forgettable. Diplomacy really didn't seem to add much and I completely skipped building cities and improvements on planets.   I played on normal and did not feel challenged at all; and beat it within about 90 minutes.  It might be a good game when it's on sale for like $7.50 but I wish I had saved my money.  On the plus side I didn't experience any bugs, but then I didn't play for a long time either.			"

												If you're looking for an epic 4x space strategy game like Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations 1-3, or something else, this is not that game. If you are looking for a game with spreadsheets and lists, this is not that game. If you're looking for a game where you command hundreds of ships divided into multiple fleets, this is not that game. If however you're looking for a lite 4x space strategy game that includes tactical combat and can be played start to finish in a few hours, then this might be worth consideration.The unique element of this game is how it's focused around your single fleet of ships. In the beginning of the game, the fleet is not very strong. However given enough resources it can grow in size (up to 8 ships) and strength to become a formidable force in the galaxy. You'll be faced with the decision of choosing between engines, shields, armor, and different weapons. Do you continue to upgrade your existing ships or buy more ships to add to the fleet? Do you choose speed over armor? Do you build out your ships for specific roles? What tech do you research to compliment your upgrade strategy? Then there are wonders which further enhance your fleet and can provide huge advantages. You'll also find battle cards which provide bonuses during missions.Another fun element of the game are the missions. When you visit other planets you'll be faced with missions that range from escorting transport ships while protecting them from pirates, escaping with sympathizers aboard your flagship, defeating waves of attacking ships, and so on. Successfully completing missions will provide influence or other rewards.As for the complaints about this being a tablet or mobile game, it is true that the options screen is missing some common options available on PC games, the game isn't a true full screen in that the taskbar isn't hidden, and the screen doesn't scroll automagically when the mouse hits the edge. However none of these things have prevented me from playing the game. The map can be moved with either the arrow keys or the left mouse button. The taskbar can be set to auto-hide if it's that distracting (or just deal with it). In regards to price, I do think that PC gamers unfortunately do end up paying a premium over the mobile platforms. This isn't the first game and it won't be the last.Finally, in regards to expectations, I think people saw Sid Meier's name along with this being set in space and left their expectations unchecked. First, the low price point should have been a major indicator that this wasn't going to be anywhere near the scale of a Civilization game. Second, a Sid Meier games doesn't automatically infer an epic game. The past few years 2K/Firaxis have had smaller Sid Meier titles such as Ace Patrol, Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies, and Civilization Revolutions which were on the mobile platform.			"

												Very cool idea, very boring execution.This feels like it was supposed to be ""Civ in space."" In reality, it's not even close. This isn't even Civ lite. The idea is cool. Instead of cities, you have planets. You send your eponymous starships on missions to help the residents of various planets in order to win them over to your side.The glaring problems:You get one fleet. The game is built around only having one fleet, so it kinda works. Just doesn't make any sense. Why would a space-faring civilization artificially limit themselves to a single fleet of eight warships? If this game didn't have Sid Meier's name on it, I wouldn't mention this. If it wasn't obviously meant to be viewed as ""Civ in space,"" I wouldn't mention it. Want Civ in space? Go play the ""Final Frontier"" mod from Civ 4's Beyond the Sword expansion.Diplomacy is stupid. It's a ridiculously stripped-down version of the Diplomacy mechanics from Civ. You're always either at war or have a peace treaty with every other federation. If you're not at war, you can't move onto one of their planets. You must first declare war (using the diplomacy menue), then the move will be allowed. Here's the stupid part. Try this:1. Declare war.2. Conquer one planet belonging to enemy faction.3. Move to second planet belonging to same enemy.4. Accept bribe.5. War is over. ""Enemy"" will not attack you on their turn.6. Repeat.Battle AI is stupid. Enemy ships tend to stay in groups of at least two ships, making them very susceptible to torpedo attacks. Even if this wasn't the case, the AI hardly ever uses torpedos or stealth, making your opponents boringly easy to dominate.Conquest is the entire game. There are apparently other victory conditions but I can't see why you'd pursue them, since this is a game about spaceships fighting each other for control of planets.Battle tactics quickly become about filling the map with as many torpedos as possible to make sure you take out enemy ships without having to get lucky. You could certainly swarm the enemy with fighters instead, or pump the crap out of your plasma cannons and stealth units, getting in close for the kill. The point is: any ""tactic"" you choose simply works. The AI provides no challenge whatsoever.I'll admit that some of these things might be the result of me only playing on ""Normal"" difficulty. I'm going to go try it again on hard but I'm not hopeful that I will meet a much greater challenge or that I won't be able to loop a war with one opposing faction at a time.TL;DRAfter playing Doom 3 or Colonial Marines, go back and play Wolf3d or Catacomb Abyss. Starships feels like a 1991 PC game that should by now have 4 sequels, each one a bit more complicated than the last (like Civilization). In reality, it just feels undeveloped. Not unpolished or incomplete; just featureless and bland.			"

												Really disappointed.  For the price, I would be happy with it as is, if the few gameplay settings they provide actually did anything to change the game.  I set Victory Conditions to ""Domination"" only, changing it from the default, 'All' setting.  I expect to be able to play until I completely conquer the AI players.  Why then, does it tell me that I lost the game, with 74% of all planets, to an AI Player who achieved a 'Science Victory' with only about 12% of the planets.  It happens that way no matter how you try to set up the game.  There's never a warning of any kind, just suddenly, BOOM, game over.  I don't want to say I wasted $15, but until they correct this, playing the game is pointless.  Without being able to set it up how you want to play, there just isn't enough here to justify it.  Very poor quality.			"

												After reading quite a few reviews of this game, it seems as if it is the reviewers expectations that missed rather than the game itself.  As a few others have said, if you want a big sprawling 4X then go play Civ or Beyond Earth.  This is exactly the game I wanted, sort of a Gilligan's Island (or How I Met Your Mother for the millenials) - mindless entertainment to let my head decompress after a day at work.  Yes, it has all of the complexity of an arcade game, but that is what makes it work.  The game controls are simple, the task is pretty obvious and there is just enough strategy to keep you playing time and time again.If you want a fun game to give you a 45min to 1 hour break from the world, you have to look a long time to find one better than this.   I just wish it ran on my laptop, but that is my problem, not the game developers.			"

												No, no, no. Sid. You're better than this mate.Don't have an immense amount of time to write a review. But I will say this. When Civ V came out, many people (myself included) saw it as a dumbed down and lesser version of Civ IV. Then they largely fixed this by the time of the last DLC. When Beyond Earth came out it was and is a dumbed down reskin of Civ V with no relation to Alpha Centauri like we were all hoping. Only time will tell if they fix that.This...I can't even draw a comparison to previous games. Its an insult to Beyond Earth that it is in any way tied to that game just as much as Beyond Earth was an insult to Alpha and Civ V.Terrible, terrible game. Glad I got it at a reduced rate but I still feel like I have been ripped off at £8. Please do avoid this. If Sid continues to add his name to anything he can 'cash-in' on then we're going to be left with a poor legacy indeed.			"

												*sigh*  I've played several games at this point and feel that I have a really good handle on the AI in the game.  I *do* find the game enjoyable as a general time-waster, but the game is basically unfinished.  I really, really, really wanted to be able to recommend this game....  I honestly did, but as it stands right now the game is far too buggy, its rules too simplistic, its tactical combat far too imbalanced, and that results in an experience that is frustrating and extremely shallow.  I've been playing on easy and, as expected, the AI hasn't really surprised me.  In 10 hours I haven't lost a single battle.  However, I've also lost every single game.  How can this be possible?!?  Well, it's because the victory condition system is horribly broken for the type of game this is (similar to how it's horribly broken in Beyond Earth, only worse).  In every single case, I've been defeated by a Wonder victory.  ""Disable Wonder victories and just allow a Domination victory then!  Problem solved!""Yeah... that's what I've been doing, and it doesn't work.  So I decided to shift my tactics and aggressively go after building wonders... which worked until I got 65% of the galaxy and the rest of the enemies all spontaneously decided to join up together, resulting in a collective Wonder victory.I am literally cleaning the floor with the computer AI and it just declares victory with ... math.And that's possible because at its' heart, all this game is ... is a linear resource race.  Every. Single. Aspect of this game is a linear resource race... and victory would be entirely guaranteed if the Victory system wasn't totally broken.I really wanted to like this game.  I had really high hopes upon reading it and, like I said at the beginning, it's a fantastic time-waster... but the game needs more than bug fixes to solve its' issues.  It needs a rules and mechanics redesign, so I really can't recommend it.  I guess at least I don't feel cheated.  I got almost 10 hours out of a $15 game and something should be said for that.  I think the people who worked on this game honestly cared about it, and I think the same is true for Beyond Earth... but ultimately I feel like I just keep dumping money into this franchise because Civ 5 was so darn amazing.  Unfortunately, Firaxis has been basically unable to live up to that triumph with both offerings.I hope that both Beyond Earth and Starships go through an overhaul to fix these massive issues... if that happens, I'll happily return and rewrite this review.Until that happens, I can't recommend Starships.  It's far too broken right now to do so. "

 No Intruduction graphics look like: made by me :D Is there an explanation for many things ?   why the hell are the prices for research ~doubled after some time.. and nothing happens before ??? if you upgrade something: maximum is 8   But you can get canons and lasers cause of some reasons and have even more than 8 Always focus on ship during moving, even when you want an overview of something else Prices at market are frozen very often (after you visited a ""trade"" planet..)    you sell everything => prices are getting low    then fly to a trade planet => prices are frozen    buy everything back => OP There is no way to go back 1 step..   If you mod your ship and pressed something wrong,   then you have to start from the beginning again   Same with buildings / technology / everything [Esc] button is  ONLY  working like [back] when you are in the overview before a fight   If you want to access the menu here    you are losing turns to fly again  // trolls made this game Never trust your chances to win... easy to outplay the AI anyway Battles are always the same Possibility to shoot a torpedo with a ship which has none (bug, just change ship during aiming) No map in battles (just search through everything to find something) No map everywhere If you watched other planets and want to find your ship again, search it... And of course you can only see which planets are connected if you are flying over one Stupid AI as always    multiplayer of course not possible    => volume of the hole game is more like a free mobile game Possibility to see which wonder a planet can build after ""???""   If it is already built you can still see that you can build it  You have chosen an specific win reason?   Beware of the AI to incorporate and win cause of their population ???  If you load a game after some time  you have no idea what options you have chosen -.- Be careful when you start or win the game..    the sound options are changed to maximum, possibly destroying your ears there is nothing good to be told about this game it is a game, nice to try for 2 games.. (then make a review how good it is ;) ) professionals helped with the story, audio and the marketing video the hole game is about guessing the rules :DThe hole game is like a free game, don't be so blind and recommend it...it is bad...  only good if you are blind or don't care about: User Interface Interesting game (/battles/buildings/wonders) graphics challenge bugs -.-I watched others playing and they laughed very often :Dmore cause of the bugs ...


good job... (it worked)

Right as you are getting really drawn in with the game, really starting to enjoy it.....  its over.  Boom, no more.  Game over.  Each play through once you figure out what you're doing (which takes 2-5 play throughs) takes at max 1 hr.  The potential for this is great.  The reality is a tease.... and I VERY much want to like it, but I feel dirty everytime I play it.			"

												Very shallow and buggy. Crashes often on start or when winning. There's really just a hand full of different unit types, and realistically you ever have access to three of them. The integration with Beyond Earth is a neat idea, but it really adds nothing of real gameplay value. Some buffs, etc, but it doesn't make the game any more interesting, just easier, which it doesn't really need help being. Diplomacy is limited, as is what you can do with planets, so there isn't really a diplomacy ""win"". Most planets have a wonder, which makes the ""culture"" win objective really easy. Most of the objectives are rather easy now with how extremely streamlined this game is, with population being at 51% (you can pump up the population of your planets infinitely with city upgrades) and conquest being the regular old ""kill everyone"", which is now by far the hardest objective to aim for what with population boosts from taking over enemy federations.A lot of AI behaviors are locked off behind difficulty walls, so if you play normal or whatever you'll usually never see AI get aggressive enough to invade your homeworld. I kept digging looking for some sort of ""rare"" encounter, planet, etc, but it seems like no matter the difficulty or size you'll probably see most of everything.I've definitely played worse strategy games, but I feel like the Sid Meier name gets affixed to titles that tend to have some depth. I came in thinking this would be something like a ""Civ lite"", but it's more like ""Civ barebones"" with just the most basic of gameplay elements left to the Sid Meier name, almost to the point where it looks like a halfassed attempt to clone the Civ franchise.

												I will not write an extensive review of this game for a few reasons, one being that the problems with this game are already being vocally expressed, and secondly because I believe the game in it's current state is very incomplete and has the potential for change over the coming months if the developers are open to feedback and implementing it.I will probably just focus on the one thing that bothers me most about this game and that is Immersion.Civilization 5 is already universally accepted as being a great success in the Civ franchise, while lacking in some of the hardcore elements of the previous titles, it still makes for an enjoyable and immersive experience from start to finish, with engaging mechanics and DLC.Civ:BE - A game I wanted so much to fall in love with, being a huge fan of SMAC, lacked in new and engaging mechanics, and felt slightly hollow, despite it's somewhat empty nature I still found my experience with Beyond Earth to be fairly immersive, and this immersion is what drives me to commit a few hours to enjoying the games content.Now onto SM: Starships, unfortunately the immersion for this game ends not long after you've chosen your leader and faction, and gained your first territory, after that you begin to realise the game offers very little after that in terms of a feeling of progression, success or any kind of immersion in the world.I like the mechanics of how the missions are fought, I like turn based strategy games played on grids so I enjoyed these aspects somewhat, but found they were not very challenging or interesting enough to remain immersed in the action and cause of the game.The AI at this points seems fairly dead, they will make their presence known and then afterwards there isn't much diplomatic use for them. You will find at some point you're either going to have to betray your allies or make peace agreements with them which completely block you from travelling into or through their territory to reach new unclaimed planets, this can lead to you getting completely isolated and unable to progress.The game needs a lot of work, it has the workings of a great game, but it feels as if it hasn't been worked on enough yet, the UI needs to be more engaging and helpful, think back to Civ 4 and 5, while Civ 5 did not offer as much as Civ 4 did in terms of the advanced customization of how you can play the game, both titles gave you enough to build yourself an engaging and immersive experience. It seems the developers have been limiting that customizable freedom which has been such a defining feature of the Sid Meiers Franchise, starting with Civ: Beyond Earth and now with Starships, I hope the devs are able to look back to the past and remember what made their games so successful and work on keeping their reputation alive.One of the main criticisms of this game right now is that it feels more like a mobile app which is what it has also been released for, and right now it seems as if it has been limited more for the mobile app platform, rather than developed as a fully functioning game that can stand the test of time on both platforms. While smart to break into the booming market of mobile applications and mobile gaming, I feel they should of perhaps decided on either releasing a standalone mobile app, a desktop exclusive release, or simply put more effort into developing the game mechanics and elements further.At the moment I cannot recommend it, for the very simple reasons that I don't believe you will get much enjoyment out of it for too long in it's current state, and is certainly not worth it's current price in what it offers.I look forward to following where this game goes next, and what the supposed cross-game functionality with Beyond Earth will offer (it seems to me that whatever that feature is has not yet been released), but for now I'll be letting this one sit in my library.

												If you think of the Civ Series ""Beyond Earth"" as the ""meat and potatoes' of Sid Meier's 4X games, you can think of Starships as the ""snack food"" equivalent. Most people have had a beef with this Sid Meier spinoff game because it doesn't look or feel like any of his similar 4X games. This one is built for speed and playability, but still has depth if you want to go deeper on the building and resource explotation aspects. Most fans of the regular Sid Meier games who expect something like it in Starships aren't going to find it here. However, if  you take the game for what it is, a 4X lite game where you can jump in and finish a game in under a half-hour when you just want to jump in but don't want to play something that's going to suck you in for hours, it's quite satisfying.  It does have some downsides, the integration to Beyond Earth is kind of a throw away feature that seems like a a good idea never brought to fruition. In any case, I would still give this one ups if you want a ""Sid Meier's Light"" game in your collection you can play with a non-gamer cousin.			"

												Overall, this is a good mobile game, 6/10 for PC. Unfortunately, it is not worth $15.00. I would pay maybe $5 for this.I'm just including the negatives, I had a good time play/learning but I don't think I'll be investing too much more time into this as it doesn't have the ""Yes I've won"" satisfaction of other strategy games I've played even though it has a really fun combat concept (execution was a bit off but you'll read why below). The ""grand strategy"" portion was very mobile-y which is okay since it never claimed to be anything more but a man can dream...What I didn't like:The game features only 8 leaders. The affinities from Beyond Earth are there but I didn't really notice a worthwhile impact of including them when it comes to gameplay.No tutorial, just ""this how things do"" page before the start of a game.Customizability of the ships is awesome but not reflected in gameplay (lack of clarity of weapons/shields, vision not really helpful).The wonders offer diverse spread of gameplay modifiers, however some are way more powerful than others and the planets determine what wonder is available so there is a luck factor involved (not bad, but annoying).Price scaling on techs/wonders didn't seem logical at all to me.In terms of combat gameplay, there are a few graphical glitches that were distracting but not hindering.No obvious tell of what weapon I would use in what situation, so I kinda just upgraded both (lasers and plasma cannons).Scanners and stealth didn't seem that relevant in combat unless the always active stealth wonder was owned.The lack of pre-battle deployment was the biggest negative of the combat. Sometimes my ""carrier"" type ship would be spawned on the frontlines with my ""corvette"" type ships in the back. Or the wonderful spawning of my destroyer with asteroids on 5 sides.			"

												This game would be a poor effort at a stand-alone game.  Frankly, it's a pretty poor effort at a mini-game spinoff of a stand-alone spinoff of a good game (Beyond Earth and Civilization V, respectively).The real problem that I have with this game isn't the stripped-down options, the modest graphics, the periodically-uncotrollable game volume (I'm serious - have your hand on the volume when you win or you'll lose hearing), or the clunky and insipid AI.  No, none of these broke the game for me.  What broke the game is that when you capture an enemy capital you suddenly control the entire enemy empire.  Ta da!  It's like a game show bonus round worth more points than all of the previous game show rounds, making them a complete waste of time.HOWEVER, if you really enjoy Civilization: Beyond Earth, Starships does have some really neat unlockable content for that game.  The new goodies are two new maps and two new customization options each for starting ships, settler attributes, and cargo when you start a new Beyond Earth game.  That alone was kind of a consolation prize as I worked through the achievements for Starships.There's a catch, though.  These games, although running through Steam, do not track each other's achievements through steam and require a 2k account (free, linked on the title page of Starships and Beyond Earth) for the games to ""talk to each other.""  That is not at all clear and I only discovered it later as I tried to figure out how to get the Beyond Earth save achievement for Starships.  The achivements are not awarded retroactively - I had all of the Beyond Earth achievements before I linked the games through 2k and so had no unlockables for Starships.  Frustrating.Unless you're a fan of Beyond Earth, pass on this one.			"

												Unless they vastly expand the content (for free), stay away from this one unless it's on sale for $5 or less.  It's got the depth of a tablet game, and a casual one at that, not a modern PC game.  You also can't change certain starting parameters like Victory Conditions for the AI, only yourself, so even the ""huge"" maps (which are actually very small) will only last a couple hours even if you're trying to draw out the game through a domination victory.The initial gameplay is actually quite fun, and the battles interesting, but you'll achieve everything possible within a couple hours at most and as soon as you realize that there's nothing new to discover about the game that initial excitement quickly fades.I squeezed 6.3 hours out of it and I'm not sure I'd play it again unless something changes.

The turn based combat sections are ok, fighters are overpowered for their cost and the bits that occur in between the so called ""exploration and building"" sections are weak at best.

This game is more like a little game you can play when you have a break or when you have some spare time. Its not a big 4x game and most people would know if they paid just a little bit of attention to what the devleopers said before its release, but i do still like the game and its funny so i do reccomend it.

												I played for .9 hours. Im not being sarcastic but thats how long my game lasted. I accidentally went to war, won a battle or 2 but was not quick enough to pull a ""suddent-death"" population victory. It was that quick. Certainly not worth 14.99. I would have liked and expected something more indepth- social engineering, ship design options, a Federation-esque council, an interface that reflects my affinity, maybe even a full screen presentation. Yeah, the Civ series was never one to show awesome graphics in units. The tradition still carries on with Starships. The ship designs look more like sprites from an old 2000s or late 90s game. Eitherway, its not detrimental. Its just I would have expected to see more in that arena of a game with the title ""Starships"". Like other Civ games, opponents are placed way too close to me. Most interesting was that I was placed in a corner in Starships. Where is the buffer- the exapnse of space/planets that allow me some peaceful expansionturns? I know this is a civ simulator, war is going to happen but I always wonder why the AIs are spaced out but I am placed right nextdoor to an AI. Diplomacy and/or War Room screens, like BE, are paintings. Nice to look at but offer nothing in terms of universe immersion. I can overlook the short game, the bland UI or cartoony ship models. But I am tired of seeing paintings. Give me a reason to care about my people, show me videos for Wonders (What is the Dadaleus Ladder?), show me more background on the faction leaders- do something! Please! For 14.99 (on top of the original 50 for BE), I have Chessmaster X in Spaaaaace. As someone who loves to get engrossed in story (and hearing that the fiction for this universe is kept at Firaxis), this not something I am overly happy about. Perhaps its a bug or maybe its by design:At default, the game opened up in Windowed Mode. Going full screen still leaves the Windows Start and Task Bar visible.			"

												Sid Meier's Starships is a terrible port of a mobile game. To start off, the game's options are lackluster - there are basically none! When you select to fullscreen the game, it's fullscreen windowed and the taskbar is still shown. Also, there is no Quit Game button so you must hit escape of Alt+F4. The gameplay is very one dimensional, you have 1 fleet that goes around to different planets to accquire them by completing a mission. The missions are tedious as your ships have to slowly move around to destroy the enemies. There's almost no strategy involved and with no auto-complete option it's a chore. At the macro level, all you do is level up your planets and fleet - that's essentially the game in a nut shell so it's a very slimmed down version of any Civilization game.			"

												The game is interesting, but shallow. Like most reviews says, it's more and IOs game than a PC One and even if the gameplay is interesting at  first, I feel it will become very repetive soon. So, I guess the replay value is rather weak.Yes, there's more than 40 differents missions( fighting, escort, prevent escaping, labyrinth, etc), but they all have the same core mechanic. so they are not that différent. For a 5$ to 10$ game, it would be fine and I would recommand. BUT, the real problem  is the incredible amount of bugs. I believe no beta testing were done at all. After reading some reviews and comment, I felt luck I can launch the game unlike so many other. But I can't save, and I've had some graphics issues. So, the game is good: no more, no less.Probably too repetitive, so it'll lack replay value.And have way too many bugs  so I can't recommand.			"

												I started on an epic galaxy with six computer players.  One of them spawned on either side of me, and both of them took influence away from me on the first planet I visited and gained influence.  Then I took a mission where you had to escort a colony ship to a jump gate, and every move took 2 HP away from every ship.  There was no way to heal, and there were too many spaces between the ship and the gate for it to survive.I cannot believe how dumb this game is.  I was expecting a 4x game, like a Civilization in space.  Instead, I got an epic failure of a game.  I was very excited to play it, and now I'm completely turned off.  This all happened in about 10 minutes of gameplay.  I don't even want to give it another chance, because it's not even the right type of game.  It looks like a 4x, but wow does it fail.Also I want to add that the user interface blows.  I expected to be able to interact with and rotate planets when I was zoomed into them, but no.  However, you can slide the top of one of the lists up and down in a klunky, unnecessary and superfluous way.Sid Meier made one of the most brilliant games ever in Civilization.  He's cloned that model so many times now, that it seems he has forgotten what a fun game is.  He got money from me this time purely because of his name, but he won't again.  I'm bitterly disappointed.			"

												I just played a large map with 4 opponents. I finished the game in 7 turns, getting 13/31 achievements. I'm not seeing much replay value. I liked the 3 sound effects for weapons fire (one for each weapon). The game seems really...rushed. I really did not like that I had to exit the game to load a saved game, though 25 years ago (around the time Civilization came out) that would have been normal.I'm still a bit in shock that this is a Sid Meyer game. I'm sure it will hit me in a few days, and I will start crying.			"

												As a huge civ fan, when I saw Sid Meier in the title I thought this was gonna be a great 4x strategy game like civ. Unfortunately it is just a simple mobile game that left me very dissapointed. There isnt very much strategy to this game at all, you just build a bunch of spaceships and shoot the enemy spaceships. I do not think this game is worth $17, and I would not even recommend buying it on sale.			"

												Interesting concept, like a turn-based Empire Strikes Back however the game is over simplified. It does have the level of complexity and intrgue as Civilizations (not even as complex as the very first one). If you thought Civilization: Beyond Earth was dull and simple compared to other Civilization games, you will definitely hate this. But for the price of this game, I guess you get what you pay for.

EDIT: I have tried, and i mean tried to get on board with this game, i just can't, everything from lack of settings, basic uninspired gameplay and what i can only describe as lazy developers have seemingly chosen tablet gamers over PC, instead of giving us what we deserve and expect from a Sid game we get a half baked experience.i would do a pro/con list, though i feel at this time its just not even worth my time typing in regards to this game.Dear Firaxis, please reconsider and develop the game again to the standard to which we expect to see from a Sid game, at the very least, open it, so that the community can fix it for you.

Cons: 1. i only played for 30mins but i already seen all what the game can offer. 2. It's confusing... the interface is pretty simple but not neccessary easy to understand. at least in Civ V there are some bult in guides and wiki. when you enter combat you have these icons and different terran type but there aren't any hover text to tell you what f**k they are. 3. they could have stream line the game by not showing the bridge scene and just display those information at the map itself. Try Xcom instead of this game or Galactic Civilization II (not three) Too light weight for 15.00 dollars.			"

												Don't get me wrong, its a great game and consept, but the way its presented, is poor and can be at times, easy! I believe the consept is great, its good to have a civ game where the focus are on planets and rulling the galaxy! But. its just to bare, and I believe it could be more like a pure civ game, wheres it more about tactics and, dare I say it, more complicated!The vast majority of this game is all about war, (Which, in my oppion is the best part in civ! :P ) but there is no way to forge allys and cordinate your attacks. Negoations and Diplomacy is the strongest bit in civ games, which can decide the game and be the difference between Victory, or Death off you civilizations! (Which is normally the latter with Domanation!) But the one MAJOR flaw, is that it has NO multiplayer! Which many games strive on, which has proven to be a major asset for this series!Still, for the price, it is good for people who want a quick game which has great pick up and play value! For those who like  simpler games, its great! In my oppion, it would benfit greatly on mobile, as it has the great potienal for it! In conclusion, its great for people wanting to get into turn-base and resource management, but its just to simple! I would advice you to save up for another civ game, Civ 5 if you can!			"

												This game feels like a Beta.  It offers no true full screen resolution; switching to ""full screen"" mode in game streches out the screen and causes graphical errors.  Leaving it in windowed mode cuts off the bottom of the screen with the task bar, cannot read the bottom of the screen.  Even moving the taask bar does not help with this.  Seems this game was favored for Tablet over the PC.  It is currently unplayable for me.  From reading the other reviews it also sounds like the game is too short and/or simplistic.  I bought due to SM's reputation and becuase of the potential future connection to Beyond Earth without doing my research first.  Shame on me.  They really pulled a fast one on us.  Here's hoping I can help you from making a purchase you'll regret.			"

												This is a great game.  It has a connection with Sid Meier's Beyond Earth.  I've never played Beyond Earth.  I bought Starships because everything I read reminded me of the best parts of SM Railroads and Civ Revolution, in terms of presentation and style.  The play is split between tactical turn-based combat with a handful of ships and empire management.  All aspects of the game are simpler to carry out than in a full-fledged 4x game.  But this is not a 'casual game' any more than Advance Wars or Master of Orion were casual games.  The game has elements in common with both of those icons of pc gaming.  More on that later.  Shipbuilding is quick, easy, and elegant.  A simple table shows your ships and their abilities (of which there are eight or ten).  Just click on the box to upgrade X ability for Y ship.  It's one of those panels that could be dull and lifeless.  It isn't because the UI is friendly and well-made.  The combat is so streamlined and straightforward, I can look at those boxes and see in my mind the maneuvers and tactics I can pursue.Is combat too fast and easy?  I suppose it depends on difficulty level.  This is one of those games that wants you to not just win, but to win without getting hit.  To win with style.  You can destroy every enemy ship, but if all your own fleet goes limping back to the shipyard with gaping holes, you will fall behind the building curve.  I mentioned Advance Wars above, an very simple tactics game that involved zero luck in combat:  No such thing as a miss or a fumble, and no damage roll.  All the values are fixed.  Starships is like that.  Combat among the asteroids is a game of cat-and-mouse, and it's fun!  It's actual strategy.  When the enemy ship moves right up behind your ship with its plasma cannons, you know you're dead before the weapon animation plays.  Now, there are elements of luck - a warp point (teleportation square) could drop you exactly where you do (or don't) want to be; you could end your move near a cloaked ship and see it too late to do anything about it; a severe hit could cripple your engines.  Things like that.  But all attacks hit always, and with fixed damage, unless modifiers zero out the damage completely, such as firing through too many asteroid fields or from too far away.On the imperial side, the game's diplomacy and construction takes just the right amount of time.  Enough to engage you but not enough to drag you through tiresome clicks and endless notifications.  Strategic turns end when you grant the crew shore leave (almost like dividing the treasure in SM Pirates).  Empire management is quick and easy, and it all makes sense.  I feel compelled to repeat that:  It all makes sense.  No arbitrary or clumsy features at all.  And the possibilities are legion.  You can have a couple of uber ships or several lesser ones.  There is a lot to experiment with.  Empire and fleet mirror each other in a sense - each has to fit the other's strengths.  The other empire leaders and admirals have just enough artwork and personality to give you the sense that the galaxy is alive and populated.  Dialogue lasts just the right amount of time - not very long.  You can examine the shps you will be fighting, and you really should to avoid nasty surprises.Really, SM Starships is a computerized board game, just at the border of a full-blown pc strategy game but not going over the line.  It is clearly a game, not a sim of anything or an attempt to capture the whole universe in a gigabyte.Many games offer a thousand paths to victory, all of them dull.  It's hard to put a finger on what it is that makes a slew of possible strategy all sound appealing, but Starships succeeds in that, with bright colors and bright ideas.  I feel in charge of all my fleet and empire's doings, with no compromises just to make the game or the dev's  happy.  It's about me.  Or you.  SM Starships is good stuff.			"

												After playing this for a while it's been fun, but a bit of concern on how the developers pushed this out without fixing some key issues.*No actualy ""exit"" button. Really?*Poor performance issues after 20 minutes of playing. (Memory leaks?)*Steam-overlay integration causes the game to crash, be warned. (You can disable the Steam Overlay by right clicking the game in your library and going into properties.)*No decent options to customize the the settings like for instance, actual FULLSCREEN, unable to change RESOLUTIONS.*Multiple reports of no sound issues, luckily I did not have to venture down that road.As is, it's fun, but come on. How can you release this at all? The game seemingly just crawls at points to where it takes the AI 10 minutes alone to do their turns. I cannot recommend buying this at the moment. Way too many issues need to be addressed and fixed.			"

												Its a bird? its a plane??? NO ITS... a bunch of space hippies in green ships planing on stealing my planets... darn... at first glance this game is something to be admired. It takes Civ BE, and expands the story into space and allows you to unite planets colonized by humanity during our exodus into the stars into your federation. So i thought ""WOW COOL ITS LIKE CIV... BUT IN SPACE!!!"" i was quickly given the idea of galactic Civ games, with a touch of that good old Sid meier's magic. and who wouldnt want some of that magic!?! Those damn space hippies thats who!Then i was hit with a game i can only describe as a briliant and stunning idea... that was hastily designed with the sole intent of making a quick buck based off the name brand...  this game would be perfect... if it were for Iphone IOS or the like. The only justice it does to the sid meiers name... is that it has the name ""sid meiers"" in the title. while visually decent, the animations for combat (I.E. explosions, weapon firing, movement, missiles and ship destruction and what not) are just... no... to call them bad is giving them too much credit. The voice acting for the combat senarios are just as bad. Every civ leader from BE who has been ""expanded"" in this game all share the same dialog with their predecessor. and the game just tosses you into the map with a horrible ""tutorial"" if it can even be called that, with an equally bad user interface... the tech tree is very strange at first, the way you gather resources and spend them was confusing, and from my very small amount of play time all i have seen are the same ships with different extentions on them, nothing different or new, just different shiny objects on your already similar body ship.it makes me sad writing this review... i want to give it a thumbs up... because i have never thought bad of any sid meiers game... I want to like this game... i really do... I am a huge fan of the sid meier's brand and absolutely loved Civ V and even BE, to an extent (personally i feel like they need to add more DLC's for BE creating religion and a united nations like body like the expansions for Civ V did), but this... this just made me a little sad. maybe in time with some patches and tender love and care, this game can truly blossom into something beautiful like it should have been. but it seems sid meiers has fallen into the ""lets dish out as many ""games"" as we can and profit from them because our fans will pay anything for our ""products"""" pit just like ubisoft with Assassins creed, and the publishers for Call of duty. I hope this was just a test run for an idea, and that they will expand this game... or at least expand BE... because ive been waiting for that for a long time and it doesnt seem to be going anywhere. All i can say is that if you want to put forth the money for this, go ahead. Maybe you will enjoy it? and i hope you do because that is what i wanted for myself. however, as of now i have to say im truly dissapointed in this game in its current state. maybe in a month or two il come back and see a picture of what it should have been, and i will change it to a thumbs up... but for now i just see something that could have been the greatest thing ever, and fell so far short of its potential. like when god gave me a llama farm, and yet i cant ride one as my trusted steed to school. life can be so cruel at times :/			"

												I think this best way to sum up this game would be to simply called it ""pocket/mini sized strategy.""Starships comes at a weird time Firaxis and 2K games.  Beyond Earth left many consumers wanting more and genuinely confused.  Why did they charge for a full price game that amounted to nothing more than an expansion pack for Civ 5?   SO what do they do?  They make a game even smaller in scale than BE and charge much less for it.  I assume the strategy now is: ""the price should match the experience"" and what you get with Starships pretty much feels like a $15 game.I'll get this out of the way immediately: this is a mobile game that happens to playable on the PC.  What does that mean?  Well, it means that a lot of the complexity of the Civ series is stripped out and the player is left to make spot decisions and map movement choices.  The interface was clearly designed for tablet touchscreen.  The buttons are in weird places and the menus/screens are stripped to the bar bones essentials.  That said, there is an enjoyable strategy game to be played here.  Let's take a moment to talk about it...The gameplay:Players familiar with Civ 5 will immediately recognize the hex grid format.  The player starts on the grid with a small fleet of starships and a planet.  Each ""turn"" basically boils down to this pattern:- Spend Resources on starships, planets and various upgrades- Move your war fleet to a new planet- Complete the mission on that planet (aka combat, more on this in a moment), thus gaining influence over that planet- MAYBE move again and do a new mission on a different planet- End Turn (aka Shore Leave)Let me touch on the combat scenarios (missions) on each planet:When the players arrives on a new planet that isn't already in their empire, the citizens of the planet will request help in the form of some type of starship mission.  This is where the real strategy of the game comes into play and the theme of ""starships"" really plays out.  Whatever war fleet the player has assembled is now used in a turn based mini strategy game.  It is important to note that SOMETIMES the mission doesn't use the player's war fleet but instead presents some type of puzzle.  But most (>70%) of the time the player must use his/her forces to defeat a squadron of NPC starships.The battle scenarios are most similar to ""war"" in Civ 5.  Each mission is played on its own hex map (separate from the overworld map) where the player manuevers their starships and fires various weapons to destroy the enemy NPCs.    Each starship is its own character on the map so if the player has five starships in their fleet, they now can battle with five ships on the combat map. This is defintely the BEST part of the game.  This is where all the time spent buying new ships and upgrading them pays off.  The player can choose to stay back and use long range weapons to try and get up close and personal with fighters or close range weapons.  If the player is successful, they ""win"" influence over the planet and eventually it folds into their empire.The players wins the entire game when they control most of the overworld map (or lose if they fail to do so).  I *think* its 70%. (Update: There are several victory conditions present but in my play time, so far, I have usually won by accidentally acquiriing 70% of the map.)  When playing on easy mode it is very easy.  Medium and Hard present much better challenges.The truth is that the game isn't very deep.  Upgrading planets and ships usually involves just buying everything.  There aren't really any penalties or drawbacks.  Even if the player concentrates on, for example, energy production, eventually it all evens out.  And that's where Starships is arguably very weak.  This is not a deep game.  The best part of the game is the combat and the starships.  Everything else is nothing much more than a big map the player simply uses to move and drive the game.I found the $15 is worth it.  The strategy of the starship combat is fun albeit not engaging.  The game does retain the ""one more turn"" type gameplay but that's where it ends.  The overall, 4x strategy simply isn't present.  Bottom line?  This is a $15 strategy game and I recommend it based on the starship combat.  If you want a bigger strategy, with more depth, look somewhere else.Final Score: C			"

												If you're looking for your typical civilization game, you won't find it here. However, if you've come for a fun tactical space adventure, you're in the right place. The game is very simple and easy to learn, has great ship customization and intuitive turn-based strategy battles. Not a very big game, but not very expensive either. A worthwhile buy. "

												From what I've seen of Sid Meiers Starships, I have to wonder why it wasn't just a DLC for Civ Beyond Earth. It's pretty basic.   In fact it feels like it was designed for the Commodore Amiga  30 years ago... If I had played this game 30 years ago I probably would have thought it was brilliant.It's missing many of the things that we take for granted in PC games, like fully adjustable graphics options and the ability to run in full screen.  The mouse controls are clumsy and you can't scroll by moving to the edge of the screen like in other Sid Meier games.At least if it had been a DLC it would have been able to use the in-game display settings of the base game.Sadly I cannot recommend this game. It's the first Sid Meier game that I'v ever been disappointed with...----A quick addition for people who think this game could never have been done as DLC:It wouldn't have been hard to get this to work as a DLC.The game may look different, but it uses the same basic engine (albeit greatly slimmed down). All they've really done is replace the flat terrain maps of Civ with a star field and planets and replaced the normal ground and water based units with space ships. It's basically CIv trying to give the impression of space when it's actually just a 2D hex based RTS like all the other games in the series. Basically the ships aren't flying through space, they're moving along an invisible ground plane, or the equivalent of, with a star background replacing the terrain we normally see. With all that in mind, it wouldn't have been all that difficult to add the maps, units and other features to the main game. There's nothing in Starships that couldn't have been accomplished in the base game. It could have been an add-on for the base game, and added new gameplay features, in the same way that The Sims add-ons often add in new features that weren't built into the base game, but expand upon the original game mechnics.

Yes their is no tutorial in this so you already start on a pretty high learning curve but its not that hard to know what you need to do. It seems to me that this game wasnt built for a PC but (as others have mentioned) on tablets or laptops. At least the game isnt full priced and its not too bad value for money...but is it worth it?

												It looks and feels like a mobile game. Graphics and options (no full screen) are ridiculous. Way too easy even on hard difficulty / epic map. You need 1-2 play-troughs to fully understand the game mechanics as it is really simple but there is no tutorial or proper tool-tips. You can beat it in no time if you just attack enemy home worlds after spending some energy upgrading one of you ship to be ""the damage dealer / taker"" and the other to be a ""hit and run"" ship. So if you want some challenge, do not attack enemy home worlds and disable all victory types other then domination as you will achieve them while just wanting to have some fun. I enjoy playing it, but it does not worth £10.99 as a PC Game.			"

Posted: March 15, 2015
												Overview:A decent turn-based strategy game that doesn't require days to play through. However, after about 4 hours, the fun is starting to wear off for me. There's more cons than pros for this game. I'm really on the fence about recommending this or simply saying skip it. On the one hand, it's fun for a few hours, on the other it gets repetative and isnt very immersive. I'll only recommend it if you want a change of pace and have the $15 to blow.Pros:Strategy-based gameplay is fun at first. You have to plan your moves around asteroids, debris fields, etc. You have to pay attention to which way your ship is facing, manage your weapons systems and keep track of enemy movements. Once you get past the initial learning curve (there's really no tutorial aside from some ""advice"" boxes) it's easy to play through. Upgrading your fleet and managing your systems is easy (perhaps too easy).Early on the game is challenging. Go into the wrong system and you might run into a fleet of carriers while you only have three cruisers. However, there is no shortage of ""easier"" battles to build up your fleet.Cons:It's repetative. After you expand your fleet and upgrade your ships, every battle becomes repetative and very one-sided (in the player's favor). I was pretty much destroying every fleet I encountered with little resistance (this was on the medium difficulty setting). I have a feeling regardless of the difficulty, once you reach a certain level of upgrades and fleet size, every battle turns into move ship, destroy enemy, repeat.System management. You can upgrade each planetary system by building cities, and resource generators (food, energy, etc) but again, as the game progresses it becomes unbalanced. Every time I won a battle, I had enough resources to pretty much build out each system with every module (food, energy, metal production). At that point there's no challenge to resource management.Enemy AI is not aggresive. I dont think I ever saw an enemy attack one of my systems. Again, this makes the whole game too easy and too one-sided. Since the AI never takes over my systems, I just continue to expand and build my fleet.Ship upgrades are confusing at first and too simplified. You basically increase the number of lasers, cannons, torpedoes and fighters. This isn't clear at first and I was left wondering if upgrading my weapons increased damage output or range or some other spec. Lasers or cannons are automatically chosen based on range - which I guess is ok but not very immservie. Increasing fighters gives you more fighter groups to launch. As you upgrade your ships, they also automatically change class (frigate, cruiser, battleship, etc.)Torpedoes are way overpowered. Put a torpedo in the right place and you can destroy any number of ships within the blast radius in one shot.Very little in the way of a tutorial. Some basic advice like ""upgrade your fleet"" or ""research this technology"". Aside from that, there are no real details on how weapons systems work, etc. Even the in game info section is lacking.

												*sigh*I wanted to like this game dispite what the masses were saying on how it was not what was expected. Mr. Meier, I really wanted to like your game. You and I have been doing business for many a year now, but Starships made me sad.Maybe it was the lack of options when choosing a leader (It seemed pretty redundent). Perhaps it was that I was able to win in less then 30 minutes and then instead of being to just roam and explore (as your other games allow) I am forced to start all over again. To the Development Staff, The game is awesome looking. You did make sure that the game is smooth and very eye catching. Thank you for that. But maybe if you don't feel the need, you could maybe let this game open up so we can have the people step in and add to the game, open it up for more possiblilties. Like I stated before, I would personally like to see more of a playability then 30 minutes. Set my enemies further apart. Allow allies and alliances maybe? Trading? etc...Hard mode, 4 players on an Epic sized map... All 4 were bunched around my planet.. for an epic map? Please Mr. Meier Keep your money, I feel I got what I deserved for not listening to others. But do me a favor? Put that money to good use making an even better Civ VI!Thank you			"

												I bought this game based on the Sid Meier's branding. I guess my expectations were too high for a $15 game. It plays like a game you download for free on your cellphone and then quickly tire of when it starts shaking you down for money. Everything about the game feels cheap, nothing screams AAA title, then again, I did not pay a AAA price. The game fails to deliver, in my opinion, or live up the Sid Meier seal of approval. I'm somewhat shocked that this would be the follow-up to what many people would consider a disappointment in Beyond Earth (which I happen to quite enjoy). It's difficult to talk about specifically why the game is terrible. The entire thing is simply lacking. I'm guessing that the PC market was not the primary aim with this game. TLDR; I would not recommend Sid Meier's Cellphone App.			"

												I initially didn't like this game. I thought, ""This isn't CIV!"" Well, that's right! But after a recent replay of it I really saw the appeal of it. It's a bit like a mix between Civ: Beyond Earth and Rome Total War. You control a single fleet that is your army and yet you still control your empire's planets, building cities and buildings that increase output. However, battle is centered around staged visits to planets and is a little more fast paced. It even uses the traditional board in a completely new way, in battle style reminicent of Master of Orion I & II for the DOS people out there. Anyways, I think it's best played after a playthrough of Beyond Earth and using that as your character for Starships, but that's just my preference.			"

												Yet another flawed game under the Sid Meier name, once a mark of quality. Now it seems to be used to shovel out poor flawed unfun products, that may or may not be fixed somewhat by later DLCs.This game manages to feel pointless, meaningless, and leaves the player with a sense of total disconnect. Inferior to Star Control I, and that's saying something. It tries to look good, but doesn't have any fun factor, or depth. Its pretty disappointing when you understand all there is to know about a 4x game in your first one. This game is very primitive, and you'll get bored with it quickly. The tech is simplistic so is the economy. The tactical combat is tedious and predictable. There isn't really one aspect of the game I thought was worthwhile.			"

This game itself is really fun to play - it's not that complex you may experienced in Sid Meier's games but I really like that because it feels like an add-on for BE. First you settle in BE, start diplomacy and then switch to Starships and take your way up to the stars to other planets.The fights are very well done. It's like a tactic shooter. After some time it gets a little repetetiv at the end because you can't defeat another players fleet completely. So they move after loss to another planet a start defending the next colony if you attack a second time.			"

												When I first heard about this game, I was pretty excited. I really liked Civ V and the idea of a less complex, faster to play strategy game made me very curious. Eventually I got the game and have spent 14 hours with it. They really did strip down a lot of complex features. In theory, removing unnecessary stuff is a good thing to make the experience smoother and in this case less time-consuming. But for me, they also stripped down the fun part of the game. You have one fleet of ships that you can progressively upgrade. The upgrades don't really allow for specialization. The upgrade system of the planets is even less interesting. The initial thought of the game is still very enticing but the realization doesn't appeal to me at all...			"

Even on ""impossible"" difficulty the game is easily beatable because of the stupid AI that constantly runs it's ships into my torpedoes.

												A lot of people expect this to be some sort of Civ clone, when it frankly isn't, and shouldn't be treated like one. Starships is a small 4X game, which I guess you could say is like a Mini Stellaris. It takes 1 - 2 hours per game, but doesn't feel like a slog neither a really rushed experience. It is quite balanced in that matter.  It is a nice game to play if for example your internet is having a rough patch and you want something to pass the time thats quick, and isn't like a full blown game like Civ V is.There are obvious problems though. The first is a lack of workshop, dlc or any further updates to the game. What you buy is what you will forever play in Starships, which is a massive shame as it could really work.It also lacks a tutorial, but it is easy to pick up, graphics settings (though it is pretty lightweight) and biggest one: Multiplayer. Now for some this is fine, but they did miss a chance to build a decent multiplayer, that doesn't go on like Civ  ones to.In conclusion, I do reccomend this game. It is pretty fun to play, but does lack certain things. If you hate 4X/Turn Based Strategy Games, this isn't for you. But if you do, this may be a good pick up, but wait until a sale as the £11 price tag is a bit too big personally.			"

												I am a fan of Sid Meier and FTL: Faster Than Light.I thought this game is a mixture of Beyond Earth and FTL and preordered it with this dream (actually I dreamt it would be a mixture of FTL and Master of Orion but I'm sure most of you don't know/remember the best 2 MoO games).Actually, well it is. But it's a lesson called ""How you can ruin the mixture of these games"".Honestly BE has many flaws but it's a fun game overall. The fun facts are; 3 tendencies have a meaning, the story is cool,  science means a lot, logistics mean a lot, and it's a challenging game.FTL on the other hand is a small budget, short game with bad graphics. The adventure concept and clever micro control (over crew, weapons and economy) are what make it shine.Now first off take FTL - substract choices. Substract micro control. Substract clever battles. Substract any interesting encounters you may follow. Add stupid, meaningless battles. You move from system to system as in FTL but all you do is to click yes and blow stuff up. Add huge amount of resources that breaks ship development.Secondly take BE. Substract any meaning of factions (bonus wise and storywise). Substract meaning of leaders. Substract challenge. Substract story. Substract science (there is science in this game but it's the same thing with ship development, nothing new comes out of science except ""your shields work 25% better). Substract logistics - cities are only additional source of income, they don't mean anything at all.Imagine a Sid Meier game that anything, including tech, wonders and  buildings are done instantly with a single click - no planning is needed.Even worse, imagine a Sid Meier game that looks ugly. A Sid Meier game that wonders (or anything) you build has no visual, at all.But worst of all, imagine a Sid Meier game that shows no sign of intelligence (pun intended).I am sorry to say this but I have played better 1$ iOS games... There is absolutely nothing attractive about this game except the fact that you can literally rip your opponents apart in 3 hours in Normal mode (Not that it's a hard game but undetectable torpedos wonder break the game too bad).So, if you MUST try this out, wait until it gets 90% discount. It's not worth more.I kept the worst thing to the last: There are no aliens in this game.			"

												When I saw the prview for this game I got really excited and preordered right away. Upon waiting all day at work to get home and play what I was expecting to be a fun and engaging game I was rather dissapointed. What I got instead was a rather bland reskin of Ace Patrol. While it has some novel features over all you can play it once and you know exactly how it will play out every time. The tactics are bland and the missions blander if that's even possible. The game feels empty and for what it costs its overpriced. Its a neat idea but it would have been bettered served with a story or campaign. As it is right now it feels like it should just be a mini game in Beyond Earth.			"

Also the enemy expends his/her terretory. Also because the game is developed to also be played on tablets gives some bugs you could say;-there's no worthy full-screen-the menu has 3 buttons and thats itThere are some things that have potential in this game, like the upgrade menu for your ships.Unless they give a good update wich fixes all sorts of things than i wouldn't reccomend the game			"

												I waited over a month for this game after hearing that it would be released.  I was eager for it. As a fan of BSG and Mass Effect, I felt the idea of a nomadic fleet finding purchase on cooperative starsystems would be a unique experience.  After just an half-hour playing the game I can say it is a feeble attempt.  I expected more from Sid Meier.  This game is a shallow, flimsy attempt to expand on the Beyond Earth franchise.  The resource management is rudimentary. The story is nonexistent. The language is belittling (I feel it's condescending and dumbed down). There is ultimately no difference between choosing any of the affinities as the leaders all give the same rewards no matter which affinity one selects. This is a sad, sad iOS port to PC.  It's a vapid shell.   The starbattles are tactically childish.  I might have some challenge with the game if I were 10 years old and suffering from some kind of brain trauma.  Starships is a poor title as a few minutes of playing the game is sufficient to eliminate any exclamation the player might have expected.  Meier must have lent his name and his name only to this hunk of junk, but frankly, a man that I have idolized for years as a trend-setter and revolutionary designer has seriously let me down.  I would never have attached my name to such a trivial, casual game, not that casual games themselves are bad.  Just this one.			"

												This game has such a bad rep, because people see the name Sid Meier and assume 'Alpha Centauri 2!!!' You're wrong. It's a sci fi spinoff from Civilization: Beyond Earth.The galactic conquest and expansion side of the game plays in a similar fashion to the Civ games, albeit a very simplified version of Civ. The tech tree consists of 8 or 9 different fields of research, which can be upgraded from 0 to 8. Planets you conquer can have cities added to them, as well as a number of structures built to improve planetary resource income. These structures again go up to level 8, although there does not seem to be a limit on how many cities you can have.Each planet also has the possibility of being able to build a Wonder. Unlike the Civ games, these Wonders do not increase income or resources, but instead have a direct impact on your fleet.The fleet is the main part of the game. As with everything else, upgrading it is simple. There are a number of different options depending on what you want your ship to be good at, and the upgrades go up to level 8. You can also have up to 8 ships in your fleet.Space missions and encounters are the main part of the game. To bring new planets into your Empire, you need to do missions for them. They may limit you to a single ship for the mission, or you can take your entire fleet. Missions range from escape, to protect a colony ship, to defend from pirates, or capture an escaping fugitive.These missions take place in a fairly large area of space. The planet in question forms the centre of the map, and the mission takes place around it.  They are fun, easy to learn, and mistakes are rarely fatal (not at the normal difficulty levels anyways).One last touch I did like was when I was going for a domination victory. I defeated one race, leaving only two left on the map. Both of our Empires were pretty big, having split the galaxy almost down the middle. The next turn, I got a message from the NPC controlling the enemy faction, saying ""There's just the two of us left. It's been nice having peace with you for all these years, but what do you say we now find out which of us has the best Empire?"" Very friendly-like declaration of war. It's not about the conflict. It's about the honour.			"

												10/10  Yes, that's right ney-sayers, I repeat 10/10.  [Notice that I have a fair number of games, but I don't write a lot of reviews and almost all of those are negative.]I noticed a consistency when I read the other reviews for this game.  The players who tried it more than 10 hours recommend it, the others don't.  And why not, because it isn't Civ V, plain and simple and they went into it ready to not like it and bash it.I don't understand what people don't like about this game.  It is not Civ V, so what?  Who cares?  It is a totally different game, and exactly what the devs said it would be (not Civ V, so get over your selves, you whiny bytches).  And guess what?  It is brilliant.  Let me repeat that, it is brilliant!  It is easy to get into, quick to understand, quick to play, and down right fun.  It brings back memories of the first Masters of Orion (MOO).  Really.  Seriously.  Try it, you will like it.It is a very simple 4x game, but it is not Civ V, which is a much more complex, detailed-oriented, resource managing, city and army building, click-fest, that in my opinion was fun for one play through, but then... who has time?  So it beats me why they want to compare the two and then be bummed out it isn't the same? This is a simple, straightforward, fun game with nice UI controls, nice graphics, no bugs, etc.  You have a fleet, you move it to planets, you fight various types of battles, you win the hearts and minds of the local planetarians, they join your Federation, and you move on to the next system rinse and repeat until all of the free systems are taken.  Then you duke it out with the other expanding empires.  Once you conquer a planet, you build cities and upgrades on your planet (each system only has one planet, so again, it is very easy and fast to manage your planets).  You build wonders.  You invest in research (a very simple science tree of maybe 10-12 categories which increase your ship powers.  You can buy and sell a few commodities like science, metal, fuel, and food, all of which are needed though to build cities, ships, upgrades, etc.Building ships is the fantastic part.  It is dead simple.  You use metal to add points to your defenses (hull and shields), engine, weapons, hangers, tubes, sensors and stealth, and that is about it.  You can upgrade your ships to super dreadnaughts, or create lots of smaller ships to swarm the enemy.  You can add fighter bays and launch fighters.  You can add long range lazer weapons or short range kenetic weapons that do a lot of damage up close.  You can also add torpedo tubes.  At first I didn't like them, now they are my go-to weapon.  I sit back and launch spreads of torpedos, watch them run, and then manually detonate them when they get into range of enemy ships (if you aimed accurately).  I built 4 battleships that were well rounded and I was able to conquest a medium-sized galaxy in a couple of hours on easy mode.  You can too!  Try it today (or at least the next time it is on sale).  For $15 it is worth is straight up, but on sale, it is a no brainer.  Good luck, have fun!  My tip to the biginner, start with the ruler who gives you 3 ships, not 2.  ;-)Sid, guess what, I like this ""lite 4x"" version more than your big fancy games, lol.  You knocked this one out of the park.  What a joy to play.  I am going back in now to play a bigger, harder universe, now that I know the basics.  =)   10/10			"

												If you're expecting an In-depth game of intrigue, war and complex resource management, prepare to be disappointed. This game is diet Sid Meier’s.  It has the resources you expect from playing Beyond Earth and even ties into the game nicely giving you the ability to continue your political chess match into the stars after you have conquered the land. All the Alliances and wars you had follow you.  I think that’s cool.  Just don’t expect the same amount of subtly and finesse in this game as there was in Beyond Earth.  This game is almost casual in its approach to strategy.  Each time you go to a planet you are given a scenario and if you complete it, you get a reward and you gain some influence over that world.  Do enough for them or just loiter around long enough and they will join your team. GO TEAM! There is research but it’s purchased with points.  There are buildings but they are also just purchased with points.  You can grow your colonies on the planets you control but… you guessed it. Purchased with points.  There is strategy involved but it takes no patience or time to play this game, especially on easy.  One thing that I do find annoying is that there is no load function in game.  You can save all day long but you have to exit to the main menu to load.  But that’s just a minor inconvenience, really.  The main reason this is an issue is that, like all of Sid Meier’s games, this one can be quit unforgiving especially in the beginning.  If you don’t make the right decisions earlier on, prepare to be left behind by the AI and hopelessly out gunned.All in all though, this game is a decent time sink and easy to pick up if nothing else.  It can be a little unforgiving but it’s easily to lean and if you manage to spawn in a good location, you can beat this game in an evening then play a new game as someone else tomorrow. "

												This is a tough game to boil down to a simple Yes/No recommendation.  It's not full Civ.  I wouldn't even call it Civ Light.  So what is it?  Imagine you took all of the hexes that weren't cities out of a Civ map. Then convert those cities to planets and change the background from surface map to a star field.  Now, eliminate all of the units from the map except for one.  On your turn you may move this one unit (which is actually composed of multiple starships) from the planet it is on to an adjacent planet for a ""crew exhaustion"" cost. Once it arrives you will engage in one of a handful of templated battles: destroy the enemy fleet, survive for 5 turns, escort a ship to a warp point, prevent an enemy ship from reaching a warp point, capture the resource point, and so on.  You'll see exactly what you are running up against in the mission preparation screen.  When you succeed in the mission you will receive between 1-4 ""influence"" with that planet.  Once you've reach a full 4 influence, the planet aligns with you and becomes part of your empire.  You'll typically have enough ""exhaustion points"" to engage in at least two missions per turn.  The missions themselves are turned based tactical battles.  You can upgrade your existing starships with features like torpedoes, improved long range lasers, short range weapons, deployable fighter ships, stealth cloaking, and more.  The more features you load on a ship the slower it gets, so you'll also be pumping points into your engines to keep your range up.  You'll eventually want to purchase additional ships, but don't go overboard because not every mission will allow you to bring your full fleet.  Once the mission begins you'll find yourself on a new hex field cluttered with planets and asteroids that block movement and weapons, ""Narrow Passages"" are gaps that toggle open and shut between some asteroid sections. There are also warp fields randomly littered around the mission area, and random is truly the word because if you move into one you will be warped to the location of another random warp field.  This can be really frustrating, as you have no control over where you come out, and you can sometimes step on one when not paying attention to your ships pathing.  Each ship will have a set number of movement points and may take one action per turn, whether that is firing a torpedo (which is a special type of timed weapon), shooting directly at an enemy, engaging a cloaking field, or detecting cloaked ships.  Battles quickly become repetitious as you maneuver behind a ship, fire, and move away.  Planets you have influence with you may modify.  You can add more cities to improve their population and production. You may build improvements which increase production of certain commodities: science, energy, metal, and so on.  Planets within your empire can have Wonders constructed which provide unique advantages.This probably sounds very similar to Civ, and it is.  However, in Civ, especially on harder difficulty levels, you can easily improve a city into weakness.  You have to carefully balance your improvements, purchases, science, and so on.  In Starships you would need to make an effort to build your way into weakness.  On the contrary, the game seems built to provide unbalanced advantages to you.  Unlike Civ where you can only reach higher tiers on tech tree after fulfilling a set number of base technologies, in Starships you are free to Min/Max the techs.  Want to quickly annihlate your opponents? Spend all of your science points on upgrading torpedos and outfit your ships with multiple torpedos.  Each mission will be a breeze.You declare victory in the game in one of four ways: Population (over 50% of the total galactic population is yours), Domination (last player standing), Science (have three Lvl 6 techs), and Wonder (control 9 wonders).  Population is definitely the easiest of the conditions to meet.  Once you win, you're done.  There is no ""Just one more turn"" option.Starships lacks the depth of a full Civ game, intentionally so.  So where does this game fit in your game library? Steam often has sales for Civ V that discount the game to $5, so I can't recommend Starships at full price with a straight face. On sale for a few bucks, though, and Starships might have a niche spot.  You can play a campaign in just a few hours without spending too much thought on it. Have a long conference call that you need to be on? Starships in the background would be a fine distraction.  It doesn't replace full Civ, but it also won't keep you up until the wee hours of the morning.			"

												Review as a standalone game:Let's be honest here, it's probably not worth the $15 (or about $20 AUS, as the exchange rate goes). The combat is kinda fun, and the simplistic universal overview is easy to pick up. That's about as far as it goes. It is reminscent of other tactical space-combat games like Star Wars: Empire at War. Despite space being 3D, your ships can only move in 2D. The objectives are always some variation of ""destroy target, get ship from A to B, or survive for x turns"". Ship combat is sometimes satisfying, but otherwise plain and unoriginal.Empire expansion has no real downside. You have a number of different resources which are used for different things. Energy customises your fleet, food lets you expand the population of a planet, etc. You gain resources at the start of every turn. You only have 1 fleet, and it's actions are limited by ""morale"". Morale is one of the only limiting factors in the game; once you're out of morale, your fleet cannot take any more actions this turn. Morale is consumed by moving or by instigating combat, and is fully replenished each turn. Lower morale makes your crew less effective in combat. Empire expansion is done planet by planet, and there is no downside to expanding your empire.The key interesting feature of Starships is the fleet customisation. Ship classes are solely dependent on what customisations they are given, and every ship is 100% customisable witht the same base stats. You can experiment with what works and what doesn't, and come up with some interesting combinations. Ship size is dependent on it's maximum HP. For all intents and purposes, there is no cosmetic customisation options. What your ship looks like is determined by what your starting affinity is, and the stats you give your ship. I've enjoyed making different roles for my ships, from slower and tankier carrriers to fast, hard-hitting stealth assassins.All in all, there are some interesting elements, but nothing that hasn't been done better in other games. If you're looking for a tactical space game, buy it when it's at least 50% off.---------------The other review:Sid Meier's Starships is, for all intents and purposes, an overpriced standalone DLC for Beyond Earth. It's main purpose is to unlock content in BE, and likewise BE can unlock extra content for Starships.It's an interesting take on an expanded BE game, and people who enjoy roleplay and immersion might enjoy continuing games of BE in Starships (yes, you can do this). The unlockable content for BE might even be worth it.If you're looking for a breath of fresh air for BE, you might want to look into this game (treating it as a DLC). However, I would recommend getting it at a discount.			"

												Well this is the 2nd review I have ever done on Steam and I got to say. I would have not bought this game if I had a 2nd chance. I hoped for more depth, while all I got was something that feels like a tablet game ported to PC. I felt there was more to the Civ game on the Xbox and Windows phone than this.... I would have been happier with a modded version of Beyond Earth that was like the Final Fronter mod from Civ 4. If you want a game that might be good on an Ipad or Tablet, this is your game. You might not like it for PC.			"

												I picked this up in a Humble Bundle and I don't regret it at all. A bit easy on the normal difficulty and the ships don't offer a lot of special qualitites but the simplified Civ style  combined with turn based tactical space combat is very enjoyable and never feels unfair. Decent value  at 15$  despite short playtime 10$  is the really recommend price as it won't feel like a rip off even if you are a one and done person.5$ is a no brainer buy.			"

												Can't say that I can recommend anyone this title, and the time I played should easily testify to that. It was simply not a SID game for computers. Had I encountered it on a tablet first - maybe as a tablet/phone game but for PC and playing SID games - it is bloody joke, and the joke is on you. Had they called it something without trying to connect it to the other games - I might not be so upset - but know it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I think of it - so do yourself a favour and check it out extensivly on YouTube and read about it if you are thinking about getting it. If you know what you're getting into - maybe you will like it. I'm pretty sure with all the names and woha's that you will be dissapointed.			"

												I love Civilization series, so I've decided to give Starships a try. Bad decision.I suppose this game performs quite good as a mobile game on iOS devices, but as a PC game it disappoints. A lot.The game is just too simple, too small and too easy. After 2-3 hours of playing I've seen everything, been everywhere. There is just too little variety of ships, planets, towns, upgrades - in just one game scenario you can see and try everything. There is no ""one more turn"" syndrome - because every turn looks exactly the same.  And that's a shame, if only the game were bigger and more complex, I'd really like it. But at this point it's totally not worth the money they're asking for it.4/10			"

												I wanted to like this game, and on the surface, it seems like it should be a decent casual strategy game. On the Surface Pro 4, on the other hand, it's impossible to read. The stock settings for the resolution of the game are incredibly low, and the only option you have is windowed full screen. It makes my head hurt trying to read the text at 2736x1874. I realize it's a mobile port, but they could have put at least a modicum of effort into making it a good port with something as basic as the ability to change resolutions. This completely ruins the game for me.			"

The game is simple to play and that makes it easy to jump in and out of. However, the simplicity of the game hides a deeper game that can be a bit frustrating and takes some time to figure out.For $10 or less this game is definitely worth the money, but full price is a bit steep for this game. Will be interesting to see how this game gets supported and what patches, if any, change as well as if there will be any DLC.			"

The maps for conflict are visually unappealing, the combat dynamics are sparse, and the subtlety of other Civ-franchise games in combat--the room for real strategy--is absent.Disappointed.

												Overall, it's a good game.  But I do wonder if this is a pet project under one of Sid Meier's proteges. Strategy and negotiation are bit limited for space faring races battling for domination. While it is a good idea to keep the screen readout in a technical/tactical format, the graphics leave a few things to be desired.  They're not bad, but for a Sid Meier's project, I expected more time and effort and definitely smoother eye candy.  I like the idea of controlling planet economies with food, metal, science, energy but I couldn't tell if I had a true effect nor how to make an effect.  The only way to distinguish yourself is choosing Superiority, Harmony or Purity.  But even then, I couldn't see any true benefit other than changing the character's profile or ship designs.IMHO:  It doesn't engage the player to want to be a part of any side in particular.  Again, I couldn't see any advantages or disadvantages to choosing a particular affinity.  Perhaps what's missing here is more to the Beyond Earth story? Bottom line:  This is certainly worth a look if you're into the strategy/space/sci-fi/turn based strategy sort of thing.  Consider waiting for a special offer. "

Sid Meier's Starships is a game wherein you use ships that travel between planets (and presumably stars) on a map to do missions where you shoot lasers and torpedoes and other spacenaval things at other craft that ply the space trails. There's also some lightweight empire management in the shape of upgrading planets and making your ships shootier/faster/have invisible torpedoes, but 90% of your gametime is going to consist of: going to a planet, kicking in the teeth of anyone who looks at you funny, repeat until there are no more people who need to be kicked this turn.It's definitely not a very complex space game—it's an iOS port, what were you expecting?—but it's pretty fun as a hex-based Battlefleet Gothic. Without firing arcs or the accursed cannon table. Or much inter-faction variation. But it''s got the torpedoes! By god does it have torpedoes.Good: Lightweight, Hexagonal Space Combat!Bad: May not be crunchy enough for the embittled space grognard.Reccomended for: People looking to ease themselvesinto the inky void of space, People who play Civ:BE and want Ultrasonic Emitters[civilization.wikia.com] "

												A simple game where you use a single fleet of ships to conquor the universe. If your looking for a long, well thought out game where you masterfully plot galatic conquest through a combination of diplomacy, military strength and technological superiority you'll have to go elsewhere. If your looking for a simple strategy game that offers more than one path to success and can be finsihed in less than 6 hours this might be for you.One of the things I like most about this game is the multiple upgrade paths for the ships. Every weapon has its strength and is a valid path to take to victory. Both focused and broad upgrade paths are viable. Wonders can make a strategy go from good to overwhelming. Which path you choose to follow can be heavily influenced by the worlds you have access to. All in all, it is very much a ""light"" version of civilization. What it lacks in depth and polish it makes up for in easy of play.I haven't played the hardest settings in the game yet, but one definate flaw is the enemy AI. The AI is fairly simple and after a while mostly predictable. It does occasionally do something I wouldn't predict but generally how it moves is perdictable. Also there is a wonder to allow you to move first, but I find that I'd rather go second most of the time as enemy ships usually start behind cover and their first move exposes them.			"

												So I've played this game a few times now and I have a love-hate relationship with it.Things I love:1. It's relatively easy to learn how to play2. The controls are straight forward3. It's a quest like, planet upgrade system based, sci-fi starship combat game4. You can customise your ships with a range of weapons and/or defenses5. Turn-based tactical combatThings I hate:1. Ship upgrades have absolutely the bare minimum of information attached to them.  Want to know how much damage an extra point of ""lasers"" will do on your ship - sorry, that's just too much information for you to handle, so no.  Want to know how much damage a point of shields can handle - ""you want to know the truth? well you can't handle the truth!""Shield upgrade information says ""damaged shields regenerate each turn"", but during combat you have no idea what the strengths of the shields are or  by how much they've been damaged.The truth is that there is about as much information on things like shield strength and weapon strengths that they may as well have said that this weapon upgrade will improve your firepower by three bananas and a pineapple and that would still have been more information than you're currently given!2. The tech tree is very simplistic, and every time you buy a tech, every other tech goes up in cost - there's of course no information that this is going to happen or by how much, because information is a dangerous thing in the wrong hands!3. Ship combat - well, suffice to say that I have found the path to victory is fighters - upgrade them to the max and equip a couple of fighters on each ship - by tech level 6, they're deadly and you can literally spam them out in sufficient quantities to overwhelm your foes without ever really risking your capital ships to any damage.  Of course YMMV...4. Wonders...they range from meh to OMGWTFBBQ!  And the great/sad news is they all cost similar amounts.  So if you're lucky enough to get the ""two actions"" wonder early on - congrats, you've probably just won the space race!5. The diplomatic options are so underwhelming, it's like some kids from kindergarden got together to try and form the UN and then realised that politics is just way too complicated for them and decided to go back to just playing cops & robbers.6. No multiplayer options :(Overall I rate this game about 6 out of 10 for the style more than the substance.  If you're looking for something deep, this isn't the game for you.			"

												I really enjoy playing most if not all of the Sid Meier's titled games. Starships is a lot of fun. Short 1 to 2 hour games. I just wish there were more options and a little more replayability. If they had a Steam Workshop the game could extend its playing cycle.  Considering I got the game on sale and it cost me $7 I highly recommend this game.  So if you like other Sid Meier titles try this one out.			"

												im a huge fan of sid meier and his games, but in all honesty this felt not only lacking in content, but lacking in any form of feeling, the leader scenes arnt animated, their is almost no explanation about anything (litterally drops you into the game without any instructions) and it lacks any sort of diplomocy (the ai goes ""well ive been at peace for 3 turns, might as well declare war on everything else"" and the maps are very tiny, and very controlled in terms of what you can do. I might rate it higher had I played on a ipad and only payed 3-5$, but this is a worthless shame on sid meiers reputation as a pc title.also just a quick thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, the ai won out of nowhere on a ""population victory"" it didnt take a single planet from another faction, nor did it max out tech or all of its ships, it merely built a few dozen citys and won WHILE I WAS AT WAR WITH THEM! so even the slight aspects of strategy are thrown out in this title it would seem.all in all, dont buy this until its 5$ or cheaper, other wise your just wasting money, and trust me, go watch a playthrough of it, youll be out 1-2 hours of your life, but youd basiclly get the same experience as playing it			"

												Well, it's fun. It's a good, if simple, turn-based small-squad starship combat game. Graphics are nice enough, sound is OK, but it crashes all the time.    I've started 7-8 games, and it's crashed me out of probably 5 of them.To be honest, if it wasn't for the crashing, I'd consider this to be a nice little time-waster. It's certainly not a deep tactical/strategic game, but it is fun.I can't recommend it because of the crashing however.

The game itself is just... it had potential, if there was more to it. But it's got too few mechanics and too little content that there's just not enough in it to allow room for strategy. It's mostly about trying to figure out the best upgrades in the strategy level, then in the tactics level just about trying to get into the best positioning.			"

 A neat, small-scale gameSid Meier's Starships is a simple, quick, fun little strategy game. Don't go into this game expecting a 40-hour campaign and hours of careful planning, because that's not what this game is made for.Starships feels and plays like a very casual game-in fact, everything from the UI to the simplistic controls and systems screams that this game was built for a tablet or phone rather than a full blown PC. This isn't exactly a bad thing as the UI is clean and easy to navigate, with oversized text and icons.Combat is on a 2d hex grid, with various objects(asteroids, planets, etc.) either blocking vision and fire, or reducing the damage dealt when firing through them. Positioning, shields, and weapon types all factor in as well, giving just enough depth to combat to keep it from getting too stale.There's not really any alien species, just different flavors of humans. All the ships have similar looks and feel, though you can upgrade their weapons and systems in anyway you want, which is neat. I'd have liked more variety but what you get is servicable.You can only have one 'fleet' on the campaign map though, which is a bit annoying.Really my biggest gripe with this game is in the achievements, as you need Beyond Earth (or at least a save game from it) to perfect it. Final Verdict:Decent buy, especially on sale. Scratches that strategy itch without needing 40+ free hours.			"

Posted: October 14, 2015
												I was excited for this game after I saw a Quick Look video for it on Giantbomb[www.giantbomb.com]. This game looked, to me, like XCOM, but in space!And it is. Sort of. When you're in combat, anyway, and most of the time you will be. Your starships exchange fire with enemies while darting in-between asteroids and moons, effectively using them as directional ""cover"". Space, it seems, is simply packed with asteroids (which I will admit is a little unrealistic), but nevertheless these debris-strewn starfields provide you with dynamic (and occasionally, changing) battlefields to fight upon.Aside from that, combat mechanics themselves are quite simple. Mostly you will be attacking enemy vessels, and there are four ways to do it: With lasers (long range), plasma cannons (short range), torpedoes (area-of-effect), and fighter jets. For defense and utility, you have cloaking devices and sensor sweeps. That's it! These six mechanics provide the primary functions of your ships. While this may be too simplistic for some, they nevertheless provide enough complexity to allow for emergent tactics.The only other way to change how your ships work is to build ""wonders"" for your civilization, and each one will grant your fleet additional powers. Usually this is fun, as the powers are interesting and vary widely, but unfortunately, it is entirely random as to which planets can build each type, and if a civilization gets lucky and acquires the best wonders early on, you will find that they have a distinct advantage over everyone else.I was a little disappointed that there weren't any customization options for the starships. Your ships will change shape when you add new modules to them, but there are no purely cosmetic options whatsoever (like paint jobs, etc). While that should be a minor gripe, it can actually become problematic when you are fighting against enemies that have ships that look almost identical to yours, and this happens a lot because there are only three types of ship construction, and a proper game has eight players.The other main thing you do in this game, aside from fighting battles and building your ships, is manage your colonies. This part of the game is reasonably fun, but it mostly just boils down to looking at menus and spending your accumulated resources. There isn't a lot of depth here, and it seems to just serve as a bookend to the combat missions.The diplomacy system isn't all that deep, either. Aside from declaring war and making peace, there isn't much else you can do - there are no trade agreements, no cease-fires or non-aggression pacts, really no minutae to speak of. This area of the game is sorely lacking, and in some ways does not even feel finished.Which leads me to my next point. Polish! This game sorely needs it! I found plenty of spelling errors in the text, and the clunky animations in combat (particularly when ships explode) left something to be desired. It almost feels like the game was released too early, or perhaps the project was prematurely abandoned.There's also a marked lack of features. For instance, there is no multiplayer! Why? This game would be a lot of fun against a friend, but instead you're stuck playing against the lackluster AI.On that note, I think I should mention that this game is REALLY, REALLY EASY. Even on ""impossible"" difficulty, I found the game to be ridiculously easy regardless of the chosen win condition. The enemies are simply too easy to outsmart. Occasionally they will even take stupid actions on their own, like firing a torpedo point-blank into a planet or moon, causing area-of-effect damage to themselves and their allies. The AI seriously needs work in order to feel complete.Finally, this game is short. You're looking at only a few hours per playthrough, even with eight players and an ""epic"" sized galaxy. Certain win conditions can extend it, but the basic win conditions of ""all"" or ""population"" victories will end in extremely short order. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it means that this game is a more casual experience than you may be used to, especially if you're a Civilization fan.I know what you're thinking. I've trashed the game quite a bit, so why am I recommending it? The answer is simple. It's fun. The combat is solid and the empire-building is too, even if it's a little on the simplistic side. It's a great game to play when you've got a few hours spare and, perhaps, don't want to commit to starting a huge, long game of Civilization or Beyond Earth.I enjoyed this game, and I hope it will continue to receive support and updates so it can become the great game that it should be. For now, though, all I can say is that it's worth the money - If you get it on sale.			"

												I like the idea behind this game.  I like that it is simpler than Civ.  But it's a little too simple.  It needs a little more depth and variety.  I played once on a small map with easy settings, once on medium settings, and twice on highest difficulty.  Not quite as exciting after the first game and realizing how simple the game is.  However, I did enjoy it for what is was.  I don't feel it has anymore playablity after beating it on high.There are not many settings beyond picking one of three civs and 8 leaders. No gameplay options. Windowed or fulscreen and sound volume are the most exciting settings.I do like the basics of the game.  It just needs a little more depth for extended playability.  (but not as much as Civ - I think it is intended to be a lighter game.. it's just a little too lite)Fun for a couple of days.On sale it sells at a low enough price to be worth a day or two of fun.The store page said something about interconnectivity with Sid Meier's Beyond Earth.

No tutorial really, just tooltips, but with those it takes around 30 minutes to figure the game out so it's not really a bad thing. The game definitely could've gone further, but for the price on the Winter Sale of about $8CAD it's definitely a great purchase.

												Civilization in space this is not but what it is a great wee game. There's not a lot of nuance to the game but then, I think, that's the best time. It allows you to pick up and play without spending lots of hours figuring out research trees or particular bonuses. Sure each planet has a wonder you can build and a resource they'll produce more of but, if I'm honest, you don't need to pay that too much attention. The battles are the fun part and whilst the maps in which they take place are a bit repetitive they're fun, engaging and the part of the game I look forward to the most.In the end Starships is a game for a quick session. If you set the difficulty level down you can thrash out a game in around an hour or so and moving up the scale, obviously, makes things harder. Either way if you're expecting some kind of 4X competitor to the likes of Sins of a Solar Empire you'll be disappointed. However approach this as a game to just have fun with and you'll have a ball.			"

												8.5/10Overview: I recommend this game because it has a surprising amount of strategic and tactical depth yet is simple to pick up. Steam's returns policy makes it well-worth trying out and returning if you don't like it. I am not a huge 4X fan; but I enjoy Starships because while it provides a light introduction to the genre it also, IMO, provides a satisfying degree of strategy at the map level and tactics at the system levels of the game. Some people don't like the game because they claim it lacks depth, but I believe they haven't tried to play on tough enough difficulty levels. One of the things I've noticed about several 4X games is that there are a lot of turns where you don't do anything, you simply press the End Turn button and let things develop. There is NONE of that in Starships; every move and action count.The game requires you to balance your ship capabilities with your play style. Do you like to use lasers at long distance? Or do you build ships and armor and Plasma cannons to mix it up in close? Fighters and Torpedoes can be cannon fodder and simple barriers to your opponents movement or, properly built, can be decisive scouts and salvo weapons that can devastate your enemies. The hex grid at the system combat level makes it look like a board game, but that is a refreshing change IMO.Balancing resources appears simple, but at higher difficulty, you have to build the right improvements on the proper planets to get maximum resource benefits. You should also connect your planets with Warp Nexus' to allow movement with no morale point penalties. Strategically, you can assault your opponent's planets to take Wonders away or deprive them of resources; or you can drive accross their empire, cutting off their fleet and allowing you to defeat the AI in detail.In all, this is a simple introduction to the 4X genre, and on the Mac, where options are a bit limited, it is a good start.

												Soooo, helllo guys first,Let´s begin with the Bad things of this game,  at first you need to know that in my knowledge of the Cid Meier´s Series I found this game realy to short, in Sid Meier´s Civ. 5, and Beyond Earth u had the possibility to play only 1 savegame for hours and hours, researching Techs, Exploring the world, Trade, make war and also things, and now you have Sid Meier´s Starships, you start with your little fleet on your home planet, and you fly from one planet to another, doing some missions for the other Civilizations/People on the planet becoing their friends, some one declare war to another , and then it End. My first game ended after 90 Game minutes, 90 ! Just because one Bot controled 51% of the Map, i found this extremly short, my first Civ 5 campain took me 3 days (with breaks don´t be afraid), i found this REALLY shortly for a Sd Meier´s Serie Game, so thats the first ""bad"" point the duration.Secondly I found it kinda bad that you can just and only have 1 Fleet with Max 8 ships, I mean their are pretty strong at the end, but it makes the battle during some very long  time witch is borring at all because the ennemy just make himself Invisible, and ten you can have some fun for Catching him !For the fleet i guess that it would be kinda usefull to be able to make a second and third one, so, 1 for Missions , 1 for Defence or something like that, or i also dont like that if 1 of your ship get destroyed in battle, that after it it ""comes""  back to your fleet and just need reparations, i mean it´s usefull at the begining when u only got 2 ships, but at the end, i had to fight and take like 10 planets and all the ships (mine and the one of the bot) were all max level, and it was very boring at all to do 10 times the exactly the same thing .!Another Bad point which i guess is gonna be the last one, is the THAT THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER !!!! I mean for the sid meier´s Series it´s somehow a very shameful Ending !So now the few good things;-Graphics-Missions (they dont repeat to much and are not similar at all)-Ship design which make the ships look like pretty cool !So guys that was it from me,I hope you enjoyed it!Ps: I´m just gonna like it because I like alot the Sid Meier´s Serie !

												I waited to buy this game when it was on sale because of the mixed reviews but I was pleasantly surprized at how much fun the game is.  There is depth to this game in many key areas.  While not MOO, Masters of Orion, it manages to create its own niche in this genre.  What I really like is how you can customize each ship, even within the same class.  For example you can have 2 corvettes, one a long range attacker and another a carrier.  There are many more options available to you.  Also planetary upgrading is fun and important strategically as well as tactically.  There is a lot to be said for this game that is positive.  But suffice to say, that you should not wait for it to go in the bargain basement to get it.			"

												Ok so i want to start off by saying THIS IS NOT A CIV GAME. I would like to imagine that it is a dumbed down Starwars:EAW that highlights space combat. The game takes place after Civ:BE and focuses on ruling the galaxy you can add cities to planets as well as upgrade the facilities on them. Rather than focusing on leveling up your tech to out tech them in combat you need to out manuver the enemy. Saying this game is a stain on the Sid meiers name is wrong it is a well made game and serves more as a time sink. it was not intended to be a civ game			"

												I enjoy this game as it takes an hour or two.  For people expecting an in depth strategy or a long game plan this is not for you.  Also if you're a save-aholic its not for you (makes it too easy) -- I play and live with my decisions so if I lose a battle it makes the game that much more interesting rather than reloading.  The homeworld claim (get all enemy turf) makes the game easy to win, however the AI can surprise you with a population win as the AI can grab other AI homeworlds unexepectly to win.  All and all its worth the money to be able to play a game after work in a causal manner. "

												If you liked Civ 5, and if you loved Civ: Beyond Earth, then get ready! This game will likely dissapoint!Seriously, if you're gaming on a Windows Surface, you may find this a good time waster for $15. But if you, like me, are on a real PC and interested in a fun 4X experience, then know that this game greatly fails to live up to the Sid Meier name. It is repetative, essentially relying on a singular game mechanic where you pilot a single type of ship through about 5 puzzles. There is a maze, a capture and control, a hunt, etc. The ship types are naught, you get a ship that has a largely linear upgrade path. While I could have plenty of fun on the bus with my tablet, on my PC this game feels like solitaire plus. A let down. Now, while this doesn't cost as much as a landmark game it still could have more flavor. The civilizations feels like different theme colors, and the technologies and cash have a more passive feel than I'd like.			"

												I would recommend this game whole-heartedly, with the caveat that this is NOT a full 4X game.Rather it's a diet 4X game for when you want those warm fuzzy feelings that come from seeing your empire expand and grow, without all the time and setup of a full 4X session.What is the main attraction of this game is the Starships (it's in the title). From fighting off pirate attacks, to storming the capitals of enemy civs, the spacebattles are the real meat of the game. And to be honest, there's nothing as satisfying as seeing one of your ships blast a Death Star knockoff to smitherens in a single blast.Biggest con: the menus don't scroll to let you see all the options. Firaxis, would it have killed you to take a day or so to fix that?			"

												So... new Sid Meier game and as usual I was first out of the gate. Like many reviewers before me have said - I really wanted to love this game. It combines the world of Civilization with more sci-fi elements and what could be wrong with that? Well, sad to say just about everything. The game is built around ""mini-missions"", but they hardly ever change from escort, seek and destroy and survival. You have a game world comprised of star systems! Use them! The replayability, a mainstay in Sid Meier games (hey, I have almost 1 100 hours of Civ 5 on record... and that's just single player), is just not there. And for the price of 15 friggin Euros I expect a lot, lot more. The only Sid Meier Civilization themed game to date I can not recommend. I feel ripped off.			"

												I never learn.I told myself after Civ: Beyond Earth that I wasn't going to pre-order any more of Sid Meier's games, that I was going to wait and see how they were recieved first and then make an informed decision. But the lure of Firaxis is not so easily resisted.Sadly, in this case it should've been. The sirens have once again lured us all onto the rocks.Now, full disclosure, I am writing this review with less than an hour of play time on this game under my belt. It honestly doesn't take all that long to get a feel for the game, I'm afraid. The entire thing was obviously designed for the mobile platform release first, and then reverse-engineered for the PC relese as an afterthought. It was bad enough when this was being done with console games...The interface is a joke. The game starts off windowed, has no graphical settings to change other than setting it to ""full-windowed"" (And when IN ""full-windowed"" mode has no way to exit the game other than reverting to windowed mode or alt-f4... seriously, there is no ""exit game"" option on the menu.), and everything inside of the game was designed with a touchscreen in mind. And then there's the gameplay...If you ever wanted a ""simplified"" version of a civ game, this is it. Tech tree? Nope. There's a set list of technologies, and you just level them up from one to six. If you get three of them to six, then you win a Science victory. Because you're smart. But what about unlocking buildings? Nope, there are set buildings (""Improvements"") that you can make on planets. You build them, you upgrade them, they make more of resources as they're upgraded. You can build Wonders, if you stockpile a ton of Metal over a lot of turns, and then if you have enough of those you can win. You can win by standard Domination, but if you're playing against the AI be prepared for it to be its standard cheating self-- don't bother using cloaking devices. It will go straight for your position every single time even though it supposedly can't see you. (...why no, I'm not bitter.)Planets have cities, cities produce metal, food, energy, science. You spend science to research tech. You spend metal to build improvements. You spend food to build new cities. You spend energy to build and upgrade ships. And... that's it. Everything else is going from planet to planet and fulfilling ""missions"" with your ships.Oh, and they even managed to put one more annoying mobile thing in-- a limited amount of stamina! Yes, your fleet has a ""morale"" limit. It goes down each time you do missions, or travel. When it goes down, your crew becomes less effective. This keeps you from taking your potentially awesome ships of awesomeness from mission to mission, getting every planet to join your federation, all in the same turn.Oh, wait, it's not really a turn. You don't hit ""end turn"", you hit ""shore leave"" in order to end your turn. It refills your morale. That's not made entirely clear, but that's what it does.There's more I could bring up, but really I think you get the gist of it by this point. This is not a game worth spending $14.99 on. This is a mobile device time-waster that should be on an app store for $5 or so.I suppose we can at least be glad that they didn't put the name ""Civilization"" anywhere near it.			"

												It's a nice minigame! Nothing more, nothing less.This game is about your fleet. Caring about every ship. Caring about every move and turn. I really like the aspect, that you can upgrade your ship, step for step. So that your initial small ship grows to a mighty battlecruiser. In order to do that, you need ressources. Planets. To get them you have to do initial missions and later on you can plain conquer them from other people.There are some ways to vitctory, but most time is spent on the hexagonal battlefield. Playing a few games there is fun, but after some time its start to be repetive because you don't have much options to varify your strategy. Its like playing chess, but only with towers and pawns.Nevertheless the game makes a lot of fun, especially if you want to play a more laid back game, than in other strategy games.			"

It amazes  me a company can Produce a golden hit like XCOM - a game by which all other games are compared,and then crank out a defective game like BEYOND EARTH and STARSHIPS.  BEYOND EARTH is playable now, after many updates...But STARSHIPS is just ... no.Don't bother.It is a frustrating waste of your time.Simply Stated:  Good Idea, in Alpha prototype condition.  Ideally, you could actually merge Beyond Earth planet files, your Civilization Earth File, and Starships and actually play as the Federation of Planets, or the Commonwealth, or the Empire Galactica... I would love to see Beyond Earth Planets integrated into Starships.This game as it stands, is  Version  0 .4.   I would wait for version 2.2...  Cross integrate XCOM into Beyond Earth - where the aliens are attacking one of your planets, and you play XCOM on your own Beyond Earth Planet - that would be AMAZING!			"

												This is a quick, lightweight game, but is amazingly enjoyable. For the cheap price, even when it's not on sale, I would recommend getting it. It brings the strategy of turn-based games we love not only to a galactic campaign of expanding space federations but also to tactical space battles above planets that introduce detailed elements of combat that you might know from non-Civilization Sid Meier's titles. Games can be short, but it's easy to jump into another one.			"

That said, it has crashed on my system a time or two, usually while rendering an explosion.  I run an older AMD video card in a gaming laptop.			"

												Are you a fan of Sid Meyer?DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Are you a fan of Zynga and facebook games?BUY THIS GAME NOW.The better metaphor i can come up for this game is Mettalica recording a Miley Cirus cover album. It have got ZERO strategy depth, NO MEANINGFULL CHOICES, and is easy as hell. Really. No Sid game was so shalow ever before. It is a mobile game in disguise. Ultra casual, no strategy system worth mentioning. God i would like to have my money back.			"

												<Too Lazy To Read; Read This>!!! Close this page and spend your money elsewhere, seriously !!!This game doesn't deserve Sid Meier's name...are we even sure Sid had anything to do with this game?And to add salt to the wound, this game is made by the people at 2K Games and Firaxis, great people who are responsible for one of my favourite games, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, is an utter disgrace. The game feels like it was from an indie company, it plays, feels, looks, sounds LIKE an indie game. As a matter of fact, an indie company would make an even better version than this Android/iOS hack game!Trust me when i say this, it isn't worth the money, isn't worth the bandwidth nor electricity bill, even if it was for $0.99!This is the FIRST time in my life i regret buying a game....I wish i could get a refund.

												The game looks good and runs smoothly but there are things wrong with it. Trying to upgrade my fleet is impossible. It says I can buy upgrades but it doesn't register any of my clicks therefore my fleet is incapable of getting anywhere. The tutorial isn't really a tutorial but if you know how civ works then you don't really need it. It isn't as big as any other civ game but it is a nice little game. Controlling your ships in battle is a nice touch in the civ series because you get to control how the battle will turn out instead of attacking a unit and letting the AI determine the outcome.If they fix the bug where the fleet can't be upgraded then I will give this game a positive recommendation but until then I can't recommend this game.

												I liked the game play a lot, but after a few hours I realized just how shallow it is. Every second mission looks the same, all just random unconnected events. Everything looks like a cheap port from the iPad. Mushy textures, low polygon count, and NO HOTKEYS. There is no tutorial, but a single page with screemshot and a short description what to do. This game is not polished, it is executed without any love for detail and just looks very cheap. Kind of sad, because it has so much potential. I think, I'll just go back playing FTL: Faster Than Light, which I find is better in almost every respect.			"

												It's a decent game with simple ways to win or lose.Pros:+Map Environments change with each battle.+Strength of you and your opponent can depend on many factors.+Each leader has a certain bonus to them and a more advanced portrait in their Affinities.+Missions can constantly change on one world outside of borders and not on Pirate and Maurauder homeworlds.+Each planet has it's own special category of populace and can boost certain things.+You can be heavily outnumbered and still pull a victory.Cons:-Even if you set only one winning setup, the game will still accept the rest from other empires.-I feel like diplomacy is half baked or still in a doughy form.-Idk how or why empires of different affinities can come together, makes little sense.Overall it's pretty good, it's meant to be a short little side game after Beyond Earth.It's got the quality, but it has a few unwanted and confusing perks in it.

												""Sid Meier's Starships"" was nothing short of amazing for my first 10 hours of playtime. However, the game got repetative and dull with the same combat and overall gameply that higher difficulites (i found) made no improvement upon. It is only my honest opinion but i would enjoy seeing more updates towards battles, their scale in size, andm maybe even 3-way encounters. Multiplayer of some kind would be nice as well.			"

												This is the worst game to bears Sid Meier's name.""Surely it's not that bad"" You say.I'm afraid it is.In the build up to the release of the game there was little doubt that it was going to be a less involved game to play then the typical Sid Meier fare, more Ace Patrol then Civilization 5. When developers were discussing the game, that was pretty clear and I have no qualms with that.In fact I was quite happy with the idea of a strategy game designed so I could play over an evening after work.Initial impressions are poor. The game launching in a tiny window and into a bare, personality-less main menu that could have been ripped from any sci-fi title (it reminded me of the Sword of the Stars 2 menu). I sought out the settings menu and within that I found volume controls and ""Windowed Full Screen mode"".I'm sorry what?I know the game was being made for tablet as well, but this is Firaxis. I asked another friend playing it ""Am I missing a settings menu somewhere?"" bemusedly. ""Nope"" He replied ""It really is that sparse""Oh well. Not a great first impression, but not necessarily the end of the world. I setup a game.Setup lets you pick a faction and a leader. Each faction gets the same leaders, with slightly rejigged artwork. Which comes across as a bit lazy. The factions have a unique bonus with the leaders adding an additional bonus of their own. I was a little bemused at what the various bonuses meant as I only knew about one aspect of the game (crew morale) from previews nothing else made a lot of sense and there was nothing to explain the benefits of a choice, no tooltips, nothing. The lack of tooltips persists throughout, with a general lack of accessible information.I setup my game, stabbing blindly in the dark at things that sounded useful The galactic playing field looks alright and I wait for the useful tutorial to kick in and explain things to me over my first few turns. I get nothing. I understand there's an info button to click but I don't understand why there's a lack of tutorial and I fumble around the first few turns getting to grips with the games systems.As the game is all about moving a fleet around space bringing disparate planets into a federation you'd expect load out/designing of the ships to be one of the most involved aspects of the game. Instead, you're presented with a list of things to click away at to upgrade or downgrade (removing components nets you some resources back to spend elsewhere) different aspects of each ship.My fleet consisted of three ships throughout the course of the game, starting as corvette's, ending as battleships through upgrades and the games automatic ship classification. All 3 focused on speed, one was paticularly tough and loaded with close range weaponry. One was less tough, also had close range weaponry and could cloak. One had longer range weapons. The limitation to what you can actually do with ships meant all of them had max speed, and were stupidly tough by about mid way through. But this simple setup felt game breaking. I could defeat any mission or enemy fleet, outside of the missions where you have to defend an outpost that can only survive two hits with fast enemies that just head straight for it.The empire building aspect of the game is no more involved. ""Click this to make numbers go up, because numbers"" about sums up this aspect of the game. There's no interesting trade off between balancing metal, food or energy. Get lots of whatever you can, click stuff to have more stuff.I actually beat my game accidentally. I was working my way from planet to planet, building one ludcriously over powered wonder after another because why not, then a conquered a planet which also had a wonder and triggered the wonder victory.Well victory nets you a much more rewarding end then it does in Beyond Earth at least. You get 10 seconds of video which is better then a text box. But does it really matter when the rest of the game is so unengaging?Overall, it's an ok game to have on a tablet, nothing stand out, even where there isn't much competition. But on the PC there's tons. Weird Worlds in Infinite space did something similar but better years ago and it's Early Access sequel likely will to. There is no reason to buy this game for the PC, and very little for a tablet.BTW - SOMEBODY ELSE WROTE THIS REVIEW, BUT IT SUMS UP THE GAME FOR ME			"

												EDIT: As of today there are 41 PAGES of technical issues about this game. The issues thread was set up by a 2K moderator so that the community could help each other but there is no official developer presence on the Steam forums. When I mentioned that it would help us if 2K would at least give us a word about a possible patch I was told quite tersely that 2K devs do not READ the Steam forums.I have profound respect for Sid Meier, but, that said, if the developers are not being made aware of 41 pages of crash issues about this game and we are told that we should submit a support ticket to 2K, then what is the purpose of the issues thread? Indie developers have a much better sense of customer satisfaction and 2K/Firaxis could learn a LOT from them.--------------The game plays well for some but there are some things prospective buyers need to know. There is a thread in the Community Hub for this game that is of this writing 33 pages of posts most reporting that this game will not launch or else it crashes after the logo splash screen. A minority - including myself - are reporting severe memory leaks. The game IS a lot of fun AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT EXPECTING A 4X. This game is a tactical game reminiscent of Amarillo Design Bureau's classic Star Fleet Battles but obviously due to licensing is not set in th Star Trek universe.Most people cannot launch the game, some of us CAN play it but is suffers a severe memory leak, others have had to adjust their mouse polliung or disable certain features in theor sound cards. To be fair, some folks aren't experiencing any issues at all.Buyer beware. The game has been out for 12 days as of this edit and no patch or hint of a patch is fortcoming.			"

												I think that this game suffers mixed reviews not because it's a bad game, but because it comes with the Sid Meier label and gamers have come to expect that Sid Meiers games are deep, filled with management options, and usually long. This game, however, has streamlined management, a shallower tech tree, and can be very quick (over and done in 40 minutes on regular settings.)Despite the mixed reviews I bought it, played it, enjoyed it, and thought it was well worth the 7.95 I paid for it. I found it was good for about 8 to 10 hours of play.			"

												Imagine Civilization Beyond Earth as a tablet game about spaceships, and you have this.It's not bad, it's just shallow and lacking in areas that make a Civ game so good. Normally I would spend hourson this but... it's too simple. I understand the 'simple to get hard to master mechanic', but here its simply ' easy to get, moderately annoying to understand'.The leaders are not animated in any way, there are very very few voice files, so expect to hear the same things on repeat.The combat is an extension of Civ V's system aplied to spaceships, and not much else, some battlefield obstacles mixed in perhaps.I'm glad they only charged £11 for it, because this isn't worth £15, let alone a full game.If you take it as a concept mini-game, it's great. As a standalone, you'll be done in a couple hours, easy.			"

												At first impression the game itself is not bad, a streamlined space 4x that shares Beyond Earth setting. Altough it's not a mobile port and the PC UI works fine, the simple nature of the gameplay makes it more appeling for Pads. Of course I didn't play long so I don't know about long term game balance and replayability. For sure it's not the new Fireaxis ""Big Game"", and doesn't want to be complex and ultra deep, although all the typical 4x elements are there.So despite all the hate it's getting the price tag is fair, it does not have major issues, and I suggest to buy it for tablets, but if you don't own one it's also pretty enjoyable for the PC.Note: the only initial ""weirdness"" is that it doesn't go completly fullscreen, the taskbar stays there. This does not influence the gameplay in anyway, and you can also hide the taskbar to have a complete fullscreen. I wouldn't destroy the product for this, i saw other Fireaxis launches way more crappy.			"

												As with all things, what you think about this game is really down to expectation management. I've read alot of the negative reviews and they focus on how they were expecting the game to be different in various ways. More or less related to Beyond Earth, more like a full game, more polished etc... For my part I purposefully didn't learn alot about the game, I have enough faith in Firaxis to get their products without copious research, X-COM and Civ being the standup gems that they are. For my ignorance I was rewarded with a surprisingly enjoyable experience. The game isn't deep but it has emergent complexities in play. It isn't as customisable or strategic as Civ but that's what Civ is for, this is something different. In a way it brings the fresher innovations in game play some of us hoped Beyond Earth might bring. If you wanted something different you can't help but be dissapointed, and I get that, but I guess my advice is to be open minded, go in with a clear head and experience the game for what it is, an interesting little adventure that won't require the hundreds of hours to master that Civ does. If you're interested I'm doing a Let's Play on youtube: https://youtu.be/_ggv6so0sGk?list=UUVAUBrmofKasUbNIm0E2ktw Check out what the game is like!			"

												I think a lot of the negative reviews of this game may be due to people expecting a MoO/Civ hybrid, which this game certainly isn't.  However, it is still an excellent game in its own right, much faster moving and with better depth than Sid's Pirates, which is also a game I enjoyed.This game is really quite reminiscent of a tabletop miniatures game combined with an extensive campaign system.  There really are three parts to the game:  resource development, resource allocation, and tactical starship combat.  The first two are accomplished during those times when you grant your crew ""shore leave"" -- a fancier way of pressing the standard Civ turn button -- and watching the enemy players go through their turns.  You have to upgrade planets, develop galactic wonders, repair damaged ships, conduct diplomacy, and research newer and higher levels of technological advancement.  At any point during or after this process, you can send your fleet into combat by attacking another system.This, to me, is the most engaging part of the game.  The tactical combat has a distinctly tabletop feel.  If you've ever played Starmada, Full Thrust, Star Fleet Battles, Battlefleet Gothic, etc., this will be very comfortable territory for you.  The tactical play is straightforward but engaging, with you maneuvering your ships through asteroid fields and around planets trying to both find a clear shot while trying to hide your ships from return fire by using those same obstacles to your advantage.  The maps with asteroids aren't static, either;  the asteroids float about between turns, so you are constantly having to keep an eye on how the tactical situation is changing.  The graphics are absolutely stunning.There are only three weapon types -- a short-range plasma gun, long-range laser, and slow but extremely powerful torpedoes (which can often kill a large ship in one shot).  I find that to be a little disappointing, as I think it would be great fun to design your own weapon systems, as can be done in Starmada.  Still, it gives enough variety to require you to think carefully and plan ahead as to how you will upgrade, employ, and protect your ships based on your resources and intended style of play (charge in, stand off and snipe, torpedo volleys...?).A few other things I wish were different:-- You can only have one fleet.  I'm not sure why this is, as I would far prefer the more realistic model of having fleets assigned to various sectors to reduce reaction times or enable pincer strategies and whatnot.-- It's easy, if you don't stay up on diplomacy and allow the AI players to gang up on you, to become quickly overwhelmed, as your planets are captured faster than you can recover and repair your fleet between combats.-- The diplomacy options could use some fleshing out, and I would love to see some espionage incorporated in the game.Overall, I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 on my own ludicrously non-scientific grading scale.

												Nice game. I see a lot of people complaining that it's too short (might be a positive thing also if you don't want to spend 40+ hours to finish a strategy game) and that it's too simplified or dumbed down. I haven't finished a game yet but I will so I'm not sure how long it is. It's nice though if it's relatively short also. And sure it's a bit simplified compared to 4X games, because I guess that's what people compare it to. I would rather compare it to Heroes of might and magic or King's Bounty but in space actually.Also there's the price tag. If this had been a 40€ game or such I guess I would have demanded a bit more from it. But as it is I really like it.			"

												I figured this game would be a nice addition to Beyond Earth...I was wrong. In addition to the fact that the game is quite limited in scope, it doesn't particularly add quite the connectivity to BE as expected and it falls short in the enjoyment arena too. For instance, the largest map available in this game is call EPIC, but should have been named EPIC FAIL. The time that it takes you to get through the game itself is short and that was a disappointment as well considering the amounts of time that you would spend on prior Civ games.If you're a fan of Sid Meier or want to add on to your library, then go for it. Personally, I'd wait until the price were cheaper (or even free) or until the potential may exist for DLC's to this game to expand upon it.			"

												Is this Civ 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? NO, however I like this game. It took I have played 6 times, completed it in 2 or 3 hrs 4 of the 6 times. so it short, kind of like railroads usually can play that game in 1 or 2 hrs. if you what the videos they released before the game and make your decision on that, I think you will be happy with this game. It's short but makes you think, when you play. that is what i like. Play the game at hard or better, much more enjoyable.....			"

												Basically Civ Lite - you have only one unit available, but the unit is vastly customisable and upgradable - becoming very powerful.  The unit is used in missions, which give influence with the various planets you visit; and when 4 points of influence are accrued, the planet in question will join your federation, giving you access to all it's resources.There are several ways to win the game:  domination, population (controlling 51% of the population of the galaxy), science, wonder (building 6 wonders).  You can choose to have them all available, or just one.There are a good number of leaders available, each with different skills, and with three different versions of each leader to choose from, allowing yet more customisation.Despite all this the game feels a little unfinished and clunky, and is frankly in need of a decent tutorial level - as it can be a little confusing to start with.  There's also no real warning when the AI's about to win, which would be nice - so something could be done about it, like in Civ 5.All in all, I'd give this game 7/10 as once you get to grips with things it's a fun game.  I'd like it to be longer, but you can't have everything.  I consider it worth the money.  Took me about 25 hours to complete it on the hardest difficulty, which made it about 50p an hour.			"

Where is the game of famous Sid Meier with “please, one more turn” and 100% replayability? Civ I was much better! It’s the second unfinished game you selling to people:1)	Absolutely unbalanced (purity against other bonuses);2)	No description of damage mechanics;3)	Strange science prices without any explanation (“+25% shield” 25% of what? That’s the base value?)4)	Idiotic AI without any diplomacy;5)	Overpowered torpedoes;6)	I can write 10 items more.Uncle Sid, please, send me the link for the real Game! "

												To some people it is a good game, and to others it is a bad one.I, myself, find that it is a rather good game to spend a couple of hours on battling your way though astroids and fleets of starships launching torpedos and scrambling fighters.I think I find this game entertaining mainly because of the battles. In most, if not all, of my Civilization games I end up being the passive diplomat whether in history or Beyond Earth but because of focus on battles and fighting in this game I can enjoy the otherside of conquest that I fail to meet under the white dove or neutrality.However the game does come with a few flaws to those expecting a huge 'triple-A' title. Each game is short and missons do get repetative if you replay each game on the same difficulty. I believe there are a few minor bugs in the diplomacy and which leaders relaliate too who owns what planet (which is not fully governed by a single 'Empire')However if you are looking for a quick Hex-based spaceship battle game you are in luck!Otherwise just give this one a pass; There is no reason to moan at the developers for creating a game that some people like and some people just want to cry about like two year olds with tantrums.

												The game certainly isn't worth the money being asked for it as it's only fun for an hour max. Once you get into it everything is a repeat that and repeat this and do the same all over again next round. Also the game crashes an awful lot on the PC. Maybe it's better on a tablet but there are far better games for less money available.After the disappointment of Beyond Earth this is the final nail in the coffin. Games carrying Sid Meier's name and being published by Firaxis are on a no buy list effective immediately.			"

												I wish I knew what I was getting before I actually paid for this.  I have played Sid Meier's games off and on over the years, but this is one that is truly sorry in execution, playability, development, everything.  First experience:I played what was defaulted small,Easy, 4 AI, All victory conditions.  The game lasted about five minutes with it laughing in my face saying: going through the tutorial noob...  oh wait there is no tutorial, or any of the sort of helpfulness to get into the game.  I gave it another go: Epic map, conquest...  my bad, I mean domination.  I had thought I had to mean conquer your enemies and all their territory...  Nope.  Just take over 42% +/- of the map.  this includes waiting for your galactic neighbors to become nice and ripe and take over their homeworld and all their space becomes yours...  and the A.I. knows this too...  and is horribly imbalanced.  An AI corvette can kill an AI battleship no sweat.  Which by the way, it should take a bit more work to conquer an enemy homeworld or enemy space.  Sure striking their homeworld could hit their moral, but an AI shouldn't just up and give up all their space at the loss of their home planet.			"

												I like most aspects of the game except for 1, I don't get to play it enough. I love the combat system, even though once you realize that maxing out fighters pretty much wins every scenario. The big gripe I have about the game is that you can't keep playing after you win, and there's no victory condition that will let you play the game out long enough that you take over the whole galaxy.  I get attached to the empire I've built and I get miffed when I win just as I've formulated a plan for taking out those damned greens! I know this is meant to be a game played quickly and often as opposed to over the long term but I wish I could make that choice rather than having it forced on me.			"

												First let me get down and dirty, I dont think this game is worth anymore then $10.  few point,1) you can beat the game in about 5 hours2) basicly it feels like an animated minitures game3) the thrill you get from ""OMFG CIV WITH PLANETS!!!"" disapates as soon as you figure out its just a hub warfair.There are some good points I have to hit as well.  It has ballance for factions and leaders down pat.  Also you  dont feel rushed to expand and control as you can just (what seems endlessly) upgrade your planets to become strongShips do max out so specilizing in one aspect per ship (long range artiliery, carrier)  ends quick but you do have more power for that type for early game.One thing I do have to say though is that this game will have me coming back to it once in a while when I just want some good old cover tactics battleing.  Other then that, stay away from this game unless they make it more meaty in content.Recap:- Games too short - Focuses on too little- you cant even control more then one fleet+ you do get to import your civ game+ has some dam good tactis mechanics (even if you can see if you will kill them or not)  Only wish I could undo a move if I didnt get what I thought I would (like how sometimes you dont see what blocking you, or think it wouldn't have yielded that low of damage)well enjoy for those that get it, and stay away if you dont like quick in your face battle games			"

												I have read a number of reviews that have already been posted here.  I understand why there's a lot of mixed feelings about the game, that's to be expected when you slap Sid Meier's name on something.  Many came expecting a deeper game, albiet not as deep as a full-on Civ.  Others came expecting more choices and options.  My main gripe is the lack of the everpresent tooltips we've come to rely on in other Sid Meier games.That said...this game is awesome.  If you're looking for a quick, fun, tired-as-hell-after-work-all-day game, this is it.  Games can be a fast 2-3 hrs, or you can drag it out on very hard difficulties for a nice weekender puzzle.I'd have liked more fleet management complexity.  For example the automatic ship class upgrades.  I'd have preferred to have a choice of hulls and paid more or less to have bigger or larger hulls.  Smaller hulls having a maximum upgrade level or some such.  I'd have liked being able to split my fleet into 2 or more fleets, especially as controlled space got larger and harder to defend.  The diplomacy is a little weird.  I tried to figure out how to form an alliance with someone, and there's....nothing.  It just somehow *happened* anyway as the game went on.  I found myself at war with an empire I'd only just discovered, and there was no way to end it diplomatically.  I had to just waltz in and annihilate them to get it over with.Research is almost pointless.  Even with getting tech as fast as I could via research points, I had only a couple techs to level 2 (of 8?) by the end of the game.  Grab what techs you want/can, and move on.  Your fleet's upgrades are much more important.Also, once you've collected a few specific combinations of wonders, your fleet becomes virtually invincible.  I had extra actions, auto-stealth, and a couple others that made my shields invulnerable to lasers and torpedos...toss up a fighter screen in the first turn, and the enemy will NEVER see your ships, and waste themselves on your massive fighter screen. All-in-all a good game, but there are places where they clearly oversimplified it.  It could have been more complex and engaging and still been a hit for PC as well as tablets.			"

First things first, this is a 90% positive review! I loved it!A damn good little game...As a huge fan of the Ace Patrol games, Starships was right up my alley. Quick, brutal, and lightweight, it hits all the right notes for hex based combat with none of the clutter, something far too few developers seem capable of. What it lacks in the aerial flourish of Ace Patrol's dogfights, it makes up for with strategic depth, provided by the galactic map on which the player completes missions, sways planetary systems under his or her influence, and chooses either war or peace (war, let's be honest) with his or her neighbors. All of that, though, is contained in an easy to learn, easy to come back to little package of simple game mechanics we all know and love.Still, some things feel missing...The game promises modular shipbuilding and doesn't really deliver. What you get is a simple fleet of ships (of which you can only have one) with a handful of stats to be individually raised. Ship look is determined entirely by your choice of the Harmony/Purity/Supremacy triad of Beyond Earth. As stats are raised, the relevant modules on the ship will beef up and become more characteristic. That's pretty much it for modularity. I played around with specialization of particular ships (destroyers, carriers, etc), but as long as the empire is stable and able to produce resources, all your ships will end up a little same-y.Additionally, the lack of any kind of story or scenario mode isn't glaring, but it would be welcome. Ace Patrol had real wars to draw from, granted, but this sets up like a Civ game without being as deep or engaging in the long term. Even just more control over the rules or map generation would go a long way.Why it's for you...->You've been itching to play a lightweight hex based game->You played both Ace Patrols instead of doing real work until you ran out of game->Starships are coolWhy it's NOT for you...->You're looking for another 4X->You'd like to spend the next 10 hours glued to your desk chair->You, for some reason, think starships are not cool. You'd be wrong, weirdo.			"

												This game is WAY, WAY, WAY to easy. I think its because the resource gain is to high. You can get energy very fast and with that you can level you ships in 2-3 round so that they are unbeatable by the KI - after that you just fly around and get any system you want.The problem with that is that you also can try out every module you want very fast - in games i saw and tryed everything and i dont really feel like playing a new round would be fun... thats sad.If the resource gain would be lower, so that you can buy one or two modules each round it would be much more fun - because you would slowly get stronger and could try out much more stuff. With the given settings the game is barely replayable.If a mod support would be integrated the game could become something really cool - but i dont think they will add it.			"

												Ive been contemplating how to write a reveiw for this game. Simply put this is an extremely simplistic, mobile game, with the desire to be something more. Truely this game falls on its face once you start, you will immeditly notice how much of BE/Civ 6 has been recycled. I would have prefered an expantion to BE than this. it a nice concept but it lack almost everything to do with CIv, other than idea of having similar names. If this had multy, i may have been swayed towards enjoying out chessing my friends. This is a single only game with very predictable AI, making the torpedos broken as ♥♥♥♥. many of the wonders in this are useless because they provide benifits that would only fool a human and not the computer. The wonder victory is too easy to win as well, I inadvertantly won just by building 5 wonders on the impossible difficulty. needless to say it is an easy game too.Out of all the people to select, there are all the sponsors from BE with the addition of one more person, many of them are pointless as there are some that are just simply more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than others. The afinity system is back, but only as a shadow. Unlike in BE the afinity system is a passive mechanic that something that does nothing to change how you play.........TL:DR......... Worth $2-$5 MAYBE...... At $15 i feel like i wasted money.Mobile game quality.Single only.Stupidly simplistic.EASYWorth about 3h of play before you forget this exists.			"

												After playing an half of an hour, I can say that - at the current stage - it's not worth buying.A lot of serious issues on the PC version. There is already a guide available how to bypass/workaround the most issues, but some of this won't work for me. For example:1. Borderless FullscreenThe game offers a borderless fullscreen mode to play. When you activate it, you still have your Windows taskbar visible. You can workaround this issue by using the tool ""Borderless Gaming"". This really works good.2. Not able to save the gameIn some circumstances you won't be able to save the game: special character in steam user name, not running in admin mode, running the wrong executable (i.e. 32bit on 64bit). Most of this is not working for me. I really don't want to change my user name to be able to save in a game. That is weird. They should be able to fix this, other games (also Beyond Earth) works fine with saving. Also in Steam Cloud, so why?3. Game is crashing in the introThe workaround described in the link below is not working for me. I need to just bypass the intro by clicking left mouse. If you forget to click, game over.For me it seems the game had absolutely no testing at all. That would explain the price. My recommendation is currently to wait for a major patch that addresses the most issues. If you still decide to buy this game, then make yourself aware of the workarounds:http://segmentnext.com/2015/03/13/sid-meiers-starships-errors-bugs-crashes-full-screen-save-game-and-fixes/I will update this review once a patch is available and the game would maybe playable for me. Currently it's not because saving is not working for me.			"

												Kyu's Review for this game, Sid Meier's Starships:Me:  I play way too many games, almost all the time.  I grew up on RPGs and turn based strategies, but I would play everything given the time and money.  That being said, I mostly stick to strategy, rpgs, fps, arcade, rhythm, ccgs, lcgs, board games, fighting games, etcI am going to tell you how I boiled the game down, and win relatively easily.  I don't have a sample size of 100 games, but I am 3 for 3 on easy, moderate, and hard, with max players, small and epic sizes, all 3 affinities, etc.  Impossible is the only mode i have yet to touch.#1 strat:  Fighters.  The names may not be exact, but here is what you need:Dual Command Wonder -- allows ships to perform 2 actions per turn (but cannot Fire twice)Hyperlauncher Wonder -- allows your fighters full movement when launchedUpgrade as you normally would, engines, armor, shields, primary weapon.  Get more ships, 5 or 6 is a good strong fleet.  Then, get 2 or more fighters on every ship.Here is why 1 starfight is not good --> If you turn is to move ships up, and launch a fighter from each, opponent can move up, and destroy them easily.  So nothing is gained, your fighters are dead, effectively a waste of your energy on that upgrade, right?However, with the Dual Command Wonder, you can launch two fighters.  So even if half of them are destroyed, you are now up the other half on the enemy. If you have 4 fighters per ship, you can do that again next turn.  The Swarm is an achievement, and its a very real thing.  Make sure to science upgrade fighters 2 or 3 times for the random modules on them.  Even on hard, I had Fighters that could take 2 or 3 hits from enemy ships.  You can also use the Hyperlaunch to get a full move out of the fighters, and hit them, before they are destroyed, even if you dont have the dual command wonder.  Dual Command Wonder also applies to your Fighters, though all they can do is double impulse, or fire+impulse.The rest of ""how to win"" is upgrade sensibly from the bottom up, find the cheapest thing, upgrade it first.  Get the most for your money.  BE SURE to get every planet a WARP NEXUS.  This will allow you to be able to protect all of your planets from any of your other planets.  You will be able to move between them without crew exhaustion.A note on torpedoes, use them to Zone the enemy fleet.  You can see where they will be in 2 turns, so aim for places you dont want the AI to move into.  If they do, boom they die, if they dont, fine they are in worse position and you get to move in.  Just watch out for their torpedoes, especially if they have stealth torpedo wonder.So what will happen is, you do your turn, the AI does theirs, and if you have a strong fleet of Fighters and Warp Nexus upgardes everywhere, you can defend everything successfully, taking little to no fleet damage, meaning you dont need to repair or worry about attrition from battle to battle.  New turn, go dominate someone.  Survive the counterattack, and this continues until you finally win.I will say that on Hard, the AI fleets were better upgraded significantly.  They are more dangerous early on, so be a little wary.All in all, a 1 thing beats all strategy means its not good gameplay balance.  But... its just comp stomp i guess.  So nobody can be too mad.  For $15 you will get your value out of it, but it doesn't offer any super great planning or depth of thought.  I was hoping there would be more to it, I thought you would be making separate fleets, possibly an actual tech tree, so on.  I don't hate what is there, I just think it could have been a little better.			"

Sooo...Not recommended / Recommend....ok recommend it, if you want to click off your brain and do nothing for an hour or two. :)			"

												Sadly this is a large let down to the Sid Meier's IP. Where I was expecting and pre ordered what I thought to be a new type of Beyond Earth with the possiblity of a Horde mode or defence in classic Civilizations fashion, I got what would be good for an IOS or Andriod game. I beat the game within 2 hours on the hardest difficulty. It blended the Battles of Xcom with a hybrid and to be honest really crappy version of Civilization managment into one whole hot mess. While the battles were fun, they were incredibly easy and unsatisfying for a long lasting Civilization fan like myself. For a few dollars this game would be worth it, but sadly that would be charging a high price for it. The 22$ I paid for the pre order was a complete rip off. Overall I cannot recommend this game to nearly anyone, with the exception being the few games who only have an hour or so to spare every once in a while or those who have very low end PCs.			"

												Horrible game is horribly brokenI am rather dissapointed with this game. It is a nice idea but poorly implemented. Feels much more like a prerelease than a fully finished game from Sid - and I have been a great admirer of his for many decades!Easy enough to pick up and play - the game comes without any kind of guide or tutorial.Many achievements are not working - despite fullfilling described conditions, they do not activate.Graphics could be a little more interesting. There are only 3 ship graphs for the player. Upgrading your ships does not change them in any way - only in their description.The different starting characters and affinities do not really make the game play vastly different.It is rather difficult to determine during missions where and when what ship will be able to move and shoot, which takes away greatly from tactical play and makes it too much about brawn rather than brain.Missions while interesting almost always come down to the same boring tactics, which when mastered leave nothing to the imagination.The calculations of success of missions are way off.Diplomatic Negotiations are rather bizzare and often end up with player unable to tell what was concluded or how to improve matters.Play in Starships button in Beyond Earth while present is permentantly greyed out. A lot of the achievements don't work....Makes one wonder - what sort of testing went on before this pre-alpha was pumped out on Steam as a ""finished result"".End result - I just hope Modders have enough to work with here so that they can turn this title into what it ought to have been!

												A leap forward ? Or a step backwards ?When I think of Sid Meier Games, I think of complexity, good balancing,  time investment. If I think about the first day I saw Starships announced, I was very enthusiastic about a space game made by the creators of Civilization. I couldn't wait until the day it comes out on Steam, checking every day the time left.And then the time came, and I made the leap of faith to buy it and play it. What happened next not only puzzled me, it saddened me quite a bit. The first time I launch a new game I always check the options menu to set up my audio and video settings. This time I couldn't find ANY graphic options and I started thinking of Starships like I would an unfinished/unpolished game. It felt like an Alpha version of a future game.Nevertheless, I still wanted to see the game mechanics and what was in this game content wise.A couple of clicks and choices later I was in a brand new universe managing a planet and 2 starships. 5 hours later and a few restarts I already finished the game on domination and I slapped my face because of the lack of a challenge behind the game. I'm not even inclined to open it another time for another game. :(If you are looking for a quick, skirmish like, march of war style, starship game, this is the game for you, if not, don't bother.My packet thoughts :- over simplified options (every option included ! actions/buildings/research/ship modules/wonders/even the EPIC galaxy is tiny)- very stupid AI (shoot 5 torpedoes towards them and they will turn tail and run)- few research options and too easy to reach- lvl 8 capacity on every ship module (WHAT?!)- 8 maximum ships in a fleet !- only 1 FLEET !- very weak graphicsI hope with all my heart this is not a finished game. It had potential and it was a very, very, very bad failure!Overall feeling for a PC game : 8 year old mentalityI think this game is much more suited for tablets or phones. Even those are more complex..... did you know they developed MMORPG's on tablets?!?!?!??Please tell me your going to make massive changes to this game !			"

												While I find the game to be entertaining at best, I can easily see why many people are completely underwhelmed and disapointed, especially for a Sid Meier's title. There is little to no story or character to the game, and the core gameplay is heavily lacking. If anything, this would have served as a nice quirky sidegame added to Beyond Earth, but is by no means worth $15, regardless of the fact that it has crash multiple times within the first hour of gameplay.

												I feel cheated by this title. Anyone expecting a rich, rewarding, deep Civ game is going to be as disappointed as I was. This is a mobile game at best- not a great one either. The tech system is BS, no new trechnologies, just levels in existing ones, The ship upgrade system is BS, you don't get to design the layout of your ship, you just increase stats and the model changes slightly. The city building is BS, again it's just increasing stats with little to no progression. Missions are BS, they're either obscenely difficult or iunsultingly easy with no means to gauge just how hard they are. Not tried out the interface with Civ: Beyond Earth and I'm not sure I can be bothered attempting it. This game made me sad. It made me feel like I'd been conned. 3/10, Avoid. There are better examples of games like this for less money. Come on Sid, we know you can do better than this.			"

												My review of this is simple. Thsi is the description for the game. Taken from right here in this window:Build and command a fleet of starships and travel between planets as you explore, build, negotiate, and fight to preserve your vision for humanity.1.) Yes, technically you have to click a button that makes the ships get ""built"". There is 0, zero, nada, zilch, NOTHING that you do to influence this process otherwise. You, the monkey, click the button.2.) travel between planets, welll DUHHHHHHHH! it is a space game. That is ALL you do half the game. 3.) Explore? No, the maps are the size of ... well let me give you an analogy: If space were the size of say the Pacific Ocean than this game is the size of a drop of coffee spilled on the table this morning.4.) Build - You already said build dipwads and saying it more wont make it any less of a disappointment.5.) Negotiate.... ummm are you friggin kidding me. The ""diplomacy"" function in this game is about as in depth as a teenager's world view. Let's break down the options: I like you/I hate you - Let's fight/let's hug.6.) Fight... HOORAY! finally something that is actually in the game. This game is about the tactics and only the tactics. It is only a $5 game being sold for $10 extra due to having Sid Meier's name on it. But as a $5 dollar game it is decent. It is mindless fun at smashing ships.7.) And at last we come to ""...preserve your vision of humanity"" Yeah, if you were blind.Buy it on sale but do not expect it to be anything.			"

If there is an option to save every x number of turns, I couldn't find it.  For a game with Sid Meier's name on it, this is disappointing.

												Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game.  It's a mobile phone game not a PC one.  The is little to no depth and very little replayability.  It's something to do to pass the time while your waiting for a bus and probably wont take longer than the bus journey to complete.  I get the feel that it could of been developed into a reasonable PC title, but evidently the programmers only wanted an easy mobile game.			"

												For a gamer that missed the old Star Trek PC games like Game: Dominion Wars,that had interactive battle and many ship variations I found this game similar but with more ability to conquer and Build the empire. For the price I expected a limted game play, but was fun and enjoyable. The AI in my opionion was good,trying to setup the opposition was not easy and that added to the stategy, all to many games can be won because they are predictable. SMS was not predictable, and was fun. The only con is interaction with so called other planetey leaders is almost commical in the interaction, there are little to no real options for the interaction when compared to other SM games.I give it a 8 outta 10.  Fun and nice game play and good graphics and sound. "

												2/10Not a very good game. Read other reviews below of people if you want to learn about the lackluster battles/missions/economy/diplomacy. My biggest gripe is the gamebreaking bad/good (depending if you have them or not) wonders and other gimmicks that just make battles not fun i.e. reactive armor making one side invulnerable to torpedos or short range plasma cannons firing at extreme (across the map) range doing absurd damage through multiple asteroid fields (which reduce damage) while you can't even shoot through a single asteroid because it's their homeowrld/wonders they've built. As a whole saying this game falls short of other Sid Meir titles is a gross understatement.			"

												I don't know what's going on at Firaxis, but their last two games have really been duds. I love TB Strategy games, and Firaxis was always my go-to for quality, fun TBS games. However, between Beyond Earth and now Starships, I'm beginning to wonder if the devs at Firaxis have thrown in the towel. Even at $15, Starships is woefully inadequate, especially with Sid Meier's name on it. The macro-planetary conquest game requires no thought or strategy to win and the tactical combat micro game requires onlly slight strategic thought - very slight. I can't help but feel there is only 1/2 a game here. It's a surprising shame this game came from such a great studio. I hope this and BE are not indications of where Firaxis is headed in the long run.			"

When moving around the galaxy you have to continually drag to scroll because you can't click the next destination until you do. It also has no depth whatsoever, and yet no modding capabilities.

												Lots of people are panning this game for failing to live up to their desires of an epic level strategy 4X game. Lots of people are forgetting that this game is $15 base and even less on sales and never advertised itself as an epic level 4X strategy game. This game is exactly what it's advertised and priced as: a space ADVENTURE game where you command a small fleet in exploring the frontier, putting down pirates, engaging in tense standoffs or small scale battles with the other players, establishing trade aggreements, and bringing planets into your Federation/Empire/whatever, all through episodic missions with light storytelling. Think Star Trek Next Gen with an emphasis on combat.If you're cool with that, great! Get this game! It's fun and worth your bit of money. And if you want a more vast, epic, and detailed game, please, PLEASE, don't buy this $15 game and then come back to leave scathing, raging reviews because it wasn't the $60 game you were looking for.

												It is a fun game set in Beyond Earth universe.I enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone who liked the setting (or enjoys flying around in a star fleet of stealth bombers :D).---+Easy to learn!+Awesome ship/fleet builder. Do you create a hulking flagship, or a swarm of smaller ships? Speed vs armor? Drones? Torpedoes? Stealth? Fun choices.+Engaging tactical battles. Always nice choice whether to create an ambush, flank the enemy or charge head-on. Different missions have varied objectives and modifiers that can affect the randomly-generated battlefield.+Wonders. They can be the cornerstone on which you build your entire battle tactic.----Lack of depth. It's a lite game and is nowhere near Beyond Earth - let alone Civs - in terms of depth of its mechanics. -As result of above, the replayability will be lower than in BE/Civ.-UI could use some improvement.

												This game is quite interesting for the first few run throughs, but it totally lacks the addictive elements of Civ5 and Beyond Earth. The graphics and interface are much more basic than I was expecting, and not in a good way. It's not particularly challenging, even on the higher difficulty settings, there's not really much scope for changing your strategy, and the fact that you can't continue the game once another player has achieved a victory, the way you can in Civ5, is really irritating. Could be a good game but it feels much more like one made specifically for tablets or even smartphones than for PC gamers, or possibly a beta for a much bigger and more immersive game. Not really worth the cost.			"

												The game is very simple. It took me about 1 minute to get the basics down, learned a few new things along the way, and ultimately cruised to victory on the moderate difficulty level.Having said that... I had fun. I felt that there wasn't much depth to some elements, namely resources and tech. The diplomacy is minimal and wasn't worth pursuing in my playthrough. The combat was enjoyable and the missions seemed varied enough. The wonders work better than you'd expect, though are so expensive that many aren't worth getting.Great game if you've got a few hours to spare. I'd definitely recommend picking it up on your tablet for plane/car trips.Not so great if you're hoping to burn the midnight oil in a long, detailed game similar to Civ.			"

												Sid Meier’s Starships - for people who like star ships and turn based combat with the faintest smattering of light strategy on top. It was designed for PC and iPad and consequently it’s low in price, complexity, graphical fidelity and currently has some strange omissions in terms of PC controls. The main course of this game is boldly going with your fleet to wage turn based tactical combat in a variety of different missions. Succeed and you’ll eventually convince each planet to join your Empire. Through the wonder of a my2k account victory in Starships and progress in Civilization Beyond Earth will also unlock some cool rewards in both games.The combat is a lot of fun and if you like laser beams and torpedoes this game will scratch that Captain Kirk itch. It’s a fun game that will satisfy you in brief short bursts but it lacks the complexity for long term engagement.			"

												This is not Civilization, Or Galactic Civilizato, Or Masters of Orion.You are an admiral. You lead your ships, run missions, earn influence of the worlds you visit.The emphasis is tactical. Expect to spend a lot of time on a battlemap. Lasers are long range but planets block them and asteroids can block them or reduce damage. (There are a LOT of asteroids on a map!)Plasma weapons do more damge but are shorter range.Torpedoes are area affect and can pass through asteroids. Great for flushing quarry from a spot thats too good.You also have fighters, stealth systems, shields...You will build wonders, improvements and the like, but as I said, the emphasis is tactical or these elements are lighter fare.The game can be small and played quickly. The hardest victory conditions on the biggest map is about a six hour affair on easy level.A lot of people complain about the small window but playing full screen is trivial. There is a fullscreen button you can click in the menues...you can also simply maximize the window.A lot of people want a longer game...I recommend if you feel that way you play a ""Population"" victory, or ""Domination"" if you want an even longer game.In the end there is not as much here as there is in Civ or Beyond Earth. Then again, look at the price tag...On a 1 to 10 I give it an 8.2It's entertaining.			"

												Just finished my first game (on normal), so these are all initial impressions:Much like the Civilization ports for iOS, Starships is linear and short. I actually stumbled into a Wonder Victory while stomping through the galaxy to little resistance -- a domination victory probably wasn't that far off. I'll definitely have to increase the difficulty level in my next try.I didn't find much use for researching tech other than the ambiguous notion that it's helping me somehow. There's little context to tech developments like Artificial Intelligence (what does it mean for fighters to have a 'random module'?). It seems, though, like once I got fighters, the only thing I really needed to focus on was making sure that my starships had too much HP to be taken down. And there's absolutely no use to diplomacy other than to use it as a war on/off switch. You won't find the modifiers that you're used to in the Civ franchise, no helptext around why someone is angry/happy with you other than the general assumption that the closer you are to their border the less likely they are to want to be your friend, and maybe I'm an idiot but I didn't see anywhere where you could trade goods. Also, I found the fact that the other leaders were willing to give up all sorts of information about their empire (like how many ships they have, what their upgrades are, etc.), even in a peace treaty setting, a little weird, especially since war can be ignited as easy as clicking a button (there's no penalty for breaking a peace treaty, near as I've found). Though, I have to say that it's not like I had a bad time. The game seems fun enough for $15. I guess I haven't had a chance to experience the AI at a higher level, so maybe I'll feel like there's more strategic depth to the game once I do that. I mean, it's $15. Obviously not a fully fledged game. It's a time waster, so look at it through that lens before you pull the trigger.			"

												     While I recomend Starships, I also give fair warning. This is NOT something you would expect from a Sid Meier's game. I do enjoy playing it, but I also see the short playability of it. Other games from Sid Meier's I can waste many days worth of hours playing. However, after playing this for only a handful of hours, it is already becoming a bit stale.      The technical and tutorial issues expressed in other reviews are (as of this writing) are true and in many ways annoying. They do not greatly effect the overall experience though. That is, to me, probably the saddest part of the whole thing. The game is so shallow that even though there are some fairly glaring issues, they do not greatly affect the game. Were they all fixed this instant, it would hardly be noticable in the end. For example, the victory conditions only affecting the player and not the AI. It cuts the game a bit short unexpectedly, but the game play for the most part would be the same.      So yes I recomend Starships as it is. The price was reflective of its small stature of a game so it was worth it in my opinion. Try to suspend your disbelief in reguards to its being a Sid Meier's game, or try your best to completely forget it. If you can do either of those thigs you should be fine. Otherwise I suggest seeking professional help from either a psychologist or your local micro brewery.      It is at this point I would like to direct my words at Sid Meier and Faraxis ... please, oh please, redo this game in the grand history and style of every other Sid Meier's game made. It has potential and good ideas backing it in story and hope. Please do those things justice and meet the high bar you set for yourselves. Price it as you did Beyond Earth and Civ 5 and if it be as they are in grand stature and bredth, I would happily give my coin in trade.			"

												Nowhere in the title of this game does it say ""Civilization"" anywhere.With that said, Sid Meier's Starships is a solid enough game in its own right. You can dive into a game fairly quickly, and you'll pick up on what ship and planet upgrades work for you as you move through your first game.Combat is simple, quick, and aggressive. Most engagements throw you into the fray or require you to act quickly to complete your objective.There's not much more than peace or war for negotiations in Starships. You can usually aim for the opponent's home world to capture their empire in one go, which makes the game rather easy at some points.I personally don't see how people thought this game would be a full on Civilization game at a $15 pricepoint. If you're looking for a game to tie you over for a few hours at a time, then this might be what you're looking for. If you're looking for a $15 Civ game then you're obviously on the wrong page because this isn't even an entry in the Civ franchise. Wait for Civ 5 to go on sale or what have you.Overall, it's a solid game that makes for a good couple of hours of play, much like Faster Than Light.			"

												Light but fun, it is easy to pick up and play.   While it works somewhat like civilization games, it is very light on the management aspect of it, and instead focuses on tactics.  I believe people have come to expect a bit too much out of games, especially at this price.  For $15 out of the gate, I think this is priced fairly.  It is not as refined as other Civilization games, or Beyond Earth, but it is an enjoyable addition to the series.  I can't say I was disappointed.  I enjoyed it much more than Beyond Earth, to be honest.  Also, you should not expect some epic civilization building marathon game, because this is not it.  Games are done relatively fast.  Or maybe time just passes by quickly.  Either way, I think it is worth the price			"

												Sid Meier’s Starships - for people who like star ships and turn based combat with the faintest smattering of light strategy on top. It was designed for PC and iPad and consequently it’s low in price, complexity, graphical fidelity and currently has some strange omissions in terms of PC controls. The main course of this game is boldly going with your fleet to wage turn based tactical combat in a variety of different missions. Succeed and you’ll eventually convince each planet to join your Empire. Through the wonder of a my2k account victory in Starships and progress in Civilization Beyond Earth will also unlock some cool rewards in both games.The combat is a lot of fun and if you like laser beams and torpedoes this game will scratch that Captain Kirk itch. It’s a fun game that will satisfy you in brief short bursts but it lacks the complexity for long term engagement.			"

												Sid Meier's Starships, I don't even know where to begin. It's a great game. It really is. Although the beginning was a little rough to understand the concept of the game, and how to play it correctly but you'll eventually get the hang of it. Also when they say ""Turn based"", they mean every AI unit has its own turns. I'm really confused too. The story is about traveling the stars to find our lost brothers, yet when you play the game it's the same leaders from Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth. I can personally say it is a great game, happening I am a HUGE Sid Meier's fan. Although I am going to recommend his game to those who like a good Sid Meier's game.			"

												First things first, I really wish when they released this game they had released it without Sid Meiers name as this seems to be where alot of the negative reviews are based around. Looking at the game from Steam it SEEMS to be a giant 4X like Civilisation or Beyond Earth in space, however this is misleading. In no way is starships in the same league as the Civ series and while it may share the same 'universe' as Beyond Earth i dont believe it is in the same league as it either. Sid's name comes with expectations form the community that this game simply does not fill. However, if you look at this game independantly without his name attached it isnt a bad game. More importantly this game at $15 is still cheaper then a movie ticket.My advice, stick it on your wishlist and wait for the summer sale next year. Pick this up at a discount and give it a try while its not the best buy on Steam its not the worst either			"

												As a Galactic Empire simulation this fails, but where it shines is the Turn Based Tactical Starship combat.Personally I really like this game BUT it feels like they only made the combat modual for a larger game, and then said ""Eff it, throw together some very simple mechanism for getting the player into combat and call it good.""  By this I mean the rest of the game (those parts not involving glorius combat) could have been programed by a high school student of the ""back in the day"" 1980's computer nerd type (as I was).Bottom line:  Turn Based Tactical Starship Combat:  Awsome!The rest of the game: Thrown together.I still recommend it though but get it on sale.

												Great game but sadly the cap on ships upgrade makes the ship building part stale after the mid game. Every ship has max speed, fighter fleets, torpedos and weapon thus making the ship overpowered and standardised. For 15 usd its okay but kinda wished i waited for sale for it to go 5usd. the empire building lacks variety once u figured out all the types of planets.Definitely could use a dlc for more variety and to remove the ship upgrade cap thus ships can actually be different types.

It has enough strategy to make it attractive, and yet it is simple to learn. I haven't had it for a long time, but I love it already. As always, I think Firaxis hit a home run!			"

												Starships is a nice little game, but don't expect the same amount of game-play as in the Civ titles. This game is more sort of an arcade type of game. You have to move fast but smart in order to gain control of as big a chunk of the galaxy as possible, before the other factions have you completely surrounded and the only possibility for expansion is war. This is not a game with hours on hours of micromanaging your planets, establishing interstellar trade routes and high level politics. It's about using your highly customisable star fleet to turn other planets to your side, either by assisting these planets, or by conquering them. A normal play through is about 2-3 hours, and you can easily have the game running while you're doing something else.			"

												This game is pretty fun once you figure it out, but the interface is pretty horrible, and it's not fun for long. Lots of screens won't let you hit ESC to escape, like even the original civ would do. You have to click the button. When moving around the galaxy you have to continually drag to scroll because you can't click the next destination until you do. It also has no depth whatsoever, and yet no modding capabilities. It is not at all up to the standards of other Sid Meier games. If you paid more than a buck, you got robbed			"

												It is a fun game set in Beyond Earth universe.I enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone who liked the setting (or enjoys flying around in a star fleet of stealth bombers :D).---+Easy to learn!+Awesome ship/fleet builder. Do you create a hulking flagship, or a swarm of smaller ships? Speed vs armor? Drones? Torpedoes? Stealth? Fun choices.+Engaging tactical battles. Always nice choice whether to create an ambush, flank the enemy or charge head-on. Different missions have varied objectives and modifiers that can affect the randomly-generated battlefield.+Wonders. They can be the cornerstone on which you build your entire battle tactic.----Lack of depth. It's a lite game and is nowhere near Beyond Earth - let alone Civs - in terms of depth of its mechanics. -As result of above, the replayability will be lower than in BE/Civ.-UI could use some improvement.

												This game is quite interesting for the first few run throughs, but it totally lacks the addictive elements of Civ5 and Beyond Earth. The graphics and interface are much more basic than I was expecting, and not in a good way. It's not particularly challenging, even on the higher difficulty settings, there's not really much scope for changing your strategy, and the fact that you can't continue the game once another player has achieved a victory, the way you can in Civ5, is really irritating. Could be a good game but it feels much more like one made specifically for tablets or even smartphones than for PC gamers, or possibly a beta for a much bigger and more immersive game. Not really worth the cost.			"

												I have tried to play this game, but after two games I do not want to try anymore...The game is not ready (to say at least). If this strategic game has more victory types I would assume some feedback about oponents progress, but no... you play several turns and out of nowhere you lost, an unmet oponent finished wonders victory...Also the combat is unbalanced. After just few turns you upgrade you ships. And there is not much the AI can do about it... You do not even have to worry about developing your planets. Just construct the warp nodes and achive domination victory in a few turns.I would expect something deeper-thought from Sid Meiers that this mid-grade smartphone game...			"

												Lots of people are panning this game for failing to live up to their desires of an epic level strategy 4X game. Lots of people are forgetting that this game is $15 base and even less on sales and never advertised itself as an epic level 4X strategy game. This game is exactly what it's advertised and priced as: a space ADVENTURE game where you command a small fleet in exploring the frontier, putting down pirates, engaging in tense standoffs or small scale battles with the other players, establishing trade aggreements, and bringing planets into your Federation/Empire/whatever, all through episodic missions with light storytelling. Think Star Trek Next Gen with an emphasis on combat.If you're cool with that, great! Get this game! It's fun and worth your bit of money. And if you want a more vast, epic, and detailed game, please, PLEASE, don't buy this $15 game and then come back to leave scathing, raging reviews because it wasn't the $60 game you were looking for.

For the price I expected a limted game play, but was fun and enjoyable. The AI in my opionion was good,trying to setup the opposition was not easy and that added to the stategy, all to many games can be won because they are predictable. SMS was not predictable, and was fun. The only con is interaction with so called other planetey leaders is almost commical in the interaction, there are little to no real options for the interaction when compared to other SM games.I give it a 8 outta 10.  Fun and nice game play and good graphics and sound. "

The graphics in general though, seem pixelated, and not in the good way.The tutorial it pops up at the beginning of the turn isn't that useful when it does it more than one time in a row with the same information. Information that isn't all that useful on how to control the ship or giving you any input on if that is your only ship or if you can eventually control more, etc.I guess for only making Sid Meier's Beyond Earth $2 more expensive, it isn't a huge loss. It just needs some polishing for me to choose it over Endless Space.			"

												Sid Meier's Starships isn't that great of a game from what little I played of it.The text on any written aspects of the game were using a font that doesn't translate well to an hdtv monitor. The graphics in general though, seem pixelated, and not in the good way.The tutorial it pops up at the beginning of the turn isn't that useful when it does it more than one time in a row with the same information. Information that isn't all that useful on how to control the ship or giving you any input on if that is your only ship or if you can eventually control more, etc.I guess for only making Sid Meier's Beyond Earth $2 more expensive, it isn't a huge loss. It just needs some polishing for me to choose it over Endless Space.			"

												Honestly,this game is good,but the pricetag should be 1.99$,or even free. It just seems like somthing that was put together and rushed in order to work with BE. It also has'nt been updated fro a while,as the last update notice i have is for the releace of BE:RT. The combat in this is really the onyl thing keeping me from going %100 negative on this,as it's actualy pretty foucking cool. Most of the other stuff in here,however,are just plain boring. It's a decent game at times,but you should only really get if it you're a huge civ fanatic,or your favorite passtime is tossing silk bags of 100$ bills off of your solid gold patio in your NYC penthouse. That's also convieniently made out of gold.			"

												this game lacks too many features and gameplay elements to be a part of the sid meier series. there is nothing to do out side of combat aside from buying upgrades. the combat itself is boring and uninspired. the three fractions you can chose from are all too similar to eachother. why in there no multiplayer? i believe multiplayer would have given the game a longer life span. as it stands right now, after a few sesions you will see everything the game has to offer, leaving nothing new to explore or discover.

												I think this is an excellent game for $15.If you enjoy sci-fi and strategy games, I encourage you to give this game a try. There are a fair amount of negative reviews out there, and they share valid concerns, but I believe they all had expectations that would apply to a full on AAA title. Unfortunately the people who enjoy the game most likely are busy playing the game instead of posting positive reviews. Belly achers love telling people about their butthurt. Do your research online before you buy the game, and if you like what you see, you won't regret spending the $15. It's a tactical combat game for starships, with a small portion of Planetary resource collection. Build a fleet of 8 ships or less. Research tech that improves your combat performance. Colonize planets to gain additional resources every turn to improve your fleet. GOOD STUFF!!  "

												I really wish i could recommend this game, i really do... This is supposed to be my favorite type of game. Maybe i had too much expectations for it, some kind of ''tactical 4x'' like if xcom and endless space had a baby but the gameplay is way too redundant and shallow to play more than a few hours. It could have been a lot nicer if it wasn't all about the combats phase and more about managing your empire and diplomacy which, by the way, is a joke : you can either be at peace or at war with other empires and nothing else. No spying, no trade, no borders tensions, nothing ! Oh and did i mention that science and warfare are jokes as well ? it kind of reminds me some browser game like ogame or some cheap smartphone game.I liked the drawing that are used as cut scenes though.Sorry devs, your game... sucks. I guess that's what happens when you don't have enough time to give all the love it deserve...			"

												I should have written this a long time ago.  This game is terrible.  I kept thinking it would be better when I came back - it is not. They sold it like it was a Civ game.  It is not.  This is not a competitor to Galactic Civ III or Endless Space -- it is more like Sid Meier's Ace Patrol in space.  It is clearly designed to work on ipad as well as PC.  That says everything that I need to say.  There isnt even a button to quit the game. If you wanted to buy it, buy it on ipad instead. It would be more fun there.The Sid Meier name used to mean more than this.			"

												Considering it took me almost 2 hours to finish one game, I'm not sure. My first impression of this game is filled with ambivalence. I was kind of expecting it to expand a bit more on the """"beyond"" beyond earth"" story, which it partially does, however this game is not Civilization. It seems to be fun in short bursts, but unfortunetaly I think it will become repetitive rather fast. Still it has potential, but I recommend watching a few let's play videos before buying it.			"

												It's a fun little game, bringing more tactical gameplay into the civ universe, but keeping enough of the strategy to let you know it's a Sid Meier game. I'm very hopeful that cross connectivity takes off in a big way, well done to Firaxis, 2K, and everyone involved for taking the plunge with it here.It feels like a mobile/tablet game that's also been released on the PC, and so some will find the price a little steep - but if it's a mobile game, it's a HUGE and complex one with a surprising amount of depth and diverse viable strategies to experiment with.It does have some technical issues, for me it crashes sometimes if I try to move the camera below the plane of the map, but has thus far always reloaded without losing any progress.I recommend it for fans of Beyond Earth, and I think it's worth picking up on sale for anyone else who likes the concept.

												Well, all i can say is that i had fun playing.As indicated by my gametime, which is about ten times that of most other revievers.And really, what else is there? So it´s not Civ VI, so it´s light on everything you´d expect from Sid Meier. So what? These days a game (like everything else) has to be ""just so"" or it isn´t worth your time. What a load. Nice game? Yes. Civ VI? No. Worth my time (and some money)? Yes.That´s all there is to it.One word of warning, though.If you are ratteled by ""Sword Art Online"", you would be in for a little shock:There is no ""Quit Game"" button.You can go back to the main menu, but actually leaving the game is not all that easy.

												When I first played this game, I wondered why it received such low reviews.  Now I know.  While the basic game mechanics are really a lot of fun, the late game combat gets so tedious and boring that I dread when enemies attack me.  Sure, I know I can beat them, after a 45 minute battle of them running away while I chase them down, one by one.This game would've been better with a 3 or 4 ship maximum (currently 8).  Also, combat turns are slow and tedious.  Movement and attacks are about half as fast as they should be.  When you get an extra movement action and want to spend it on using the impulse action twice (move 1 extra space), there is no hot key, so you have to click the icon, select a location, click the icon, select a location.  It may not seem like much, but when chasing down enemies, and you've got a full fleet of 8 ships and something like 10 fighter ships (or whatever the max is), it adds a minute or two to every turn.The animations for attacks are also really slow.  It's supposed to be a laser, but you have to watch it for ups of 5 seconds as it travels through space and hits the enemy ship.The combat seemed like it was going to be fun, but it just burns my brain at this point.  I'm scared that the enemy will attack me, cause it'll be soooo boring.If they would fix that, I'd highly recommend this game.			"

												Why I like this gameI see a lot of hate on this game, but i realy like it, and here is why.Its a very light turnbased strategy game, i have it open on my work laptop and can speak to clients over the desk and on the phone while i play.The game it self is, yes light, but that makes it easy for me to do work and come back to it and not lose the idea of what i was doing.I feel the people who cast it away after 1 or 2 games might not see what i see in it and that is fine, we dont all have to like the same things.If this game was 50-60 €/USD I would be mad, but at this price i think its a realy good game, im planing on buying it for my iPad also.To me and alwais looking at the price tag, it a 9/10 game, thank you Sid Meier for yes what will be hours and hours of fun strategy.

Interesting choices, nice concept, versatile missions: I like it!However, if you are looking for a grand strategy game like Civilisation: This is not it. The focus is completely different.The game also suffers from the usual day1 problems that should not happen: Mainly an imperfect tutorial (I highly recommend watching Sid Meiers IGN lets-play video beforehand...I do believe it improved my experience greatly) and some balancing issues. But it also felt like a gem...parts of it still raw and uncut, but the elegance of it shining through.If you are turned off by such things: wait a month or two, otherwise I recommend the experience.

												I have seen quite a few negative reviews on here, and that really surprised me. This game is pretty brilliant for what it is, a 15 dollar game. It is sorta simple on many levels. That being said, there are enough variables to keep it fresh as long as you want it to be. I have about 9 full play throughs so far, and am still playing. Some of the achievements seem a bit difficult to trigger. The pirate one for example. I have taken the Pirate home world multiple times in games and still no cheevo. I see people have it though, so I am sure the game isn't broken. I am doing something wrong is all. I did manage to get my home world attacked on the second round of the game and lost, so that cheevo didn't happen. :DI have to say, it delivers exactly what Sid promised. Nothing more, nothing less.  I am hoping that as time goes on, more content, multiplayer options and such are added. With the 15 dollar price point, I would gladly purchase DLC to keep Sid employed. He has kept me entertained since 1982 after all. Only seems fair. TL;DR - Buy it. It is 15 bucks that will be well spent.			"

												First let me say that I came into this game knowing nothing about it but being a huge Civ's and Ace Patrol fan.This game is similar to Ace Patrol in its combat, though you dont have pitching and height mechanics, it feels the same.  Its out of combat screen however is a simplified 4x map.You get one fleet, it travels between planets and does missions to gain trade routes (similar to Spore) if the planet is owned by someone else you go to combat with their fleet, simple enough.  The planets can have their facilities upgraded and more cities added, each choice gives you more resources per turn.Your fleet can be upgraded, better weapons, shields, armor or change to new tactics like cloaking, torpedos, and launced fighters.  You will be able to do all of these eventually, you wont lock yourself out of any design, though you do have to balance your ships components with speed.The tech tree is tiny unfortunatly, the prices scale quickly so you will be sitting there a while if you're trying for a tech victory, its small but not short.The victories are done poorly, instead of a civ style advanced setup option you get to pick between all the victories (Population, Science, Domination, and Wonders) and any single one of them.  In practice the All games tend to end in domination or population quickly, wonder victories can come out of no where and science takes too long.The starting options are a bit generic as well, each civilization has a unique bonus and each captain has a bonus, the captains are the same reguardless of race however their portrait gets a slight change.  Some say that its lazy I think its cute.It has a pretty cool integration with Beyond Earth, you can earn starting choices for Starships and Beyond Earth by playing the other game.  For example because of some Starships gameplay I get a new starting option in Beyond Earth as well as a map for an achievement and for playing Beyond Earth I can choose hybrid civs with double the bonus abilities in Starships.Over all I hope it gets polished because it does have short falls.  Its not a bad game, its pretty fun in fact, and the cross integration with BE is something I can't support enough I love it.			"

												The game runs well and it looks good graphically. it is really nothing like CIV BE whatsoever, there is a bit of resourse management and research, but all the research is for your ships. Really everything is about your ships, you fly around and do missions for other planets. There are a few different missions you can do, each giving a differnt reward, money, research etc... you have to do a few missions per planet to gain enough influence for them to join your empire. It gets a little old fast doing the missions, depending on what the mission is you may need to outfit your ship(s) diffently. Some missions you only get to use one of your ships, and in others you need to avoid combat more than provoke it. Once a planet has been claimed by an opponent the battles become slightly more interesting and it becomes more about the ship battling and tactics than the missions, which felt like playing minigames. In youre planets you are able to build cities and planet upgrades, the cities boost overall income and the upgrades range in different things like planetary defences and the like. you're crew will allow you to travel a certain distance per turn, limiting how much you can do, without certain upgrades traveling between your cities can eat up you're turns. I did not find much use in the missle weapons, though they seem interesting they are fairly useless, atleast in my experience. The missles travel a certain distance per turn, you may choose to detonate them at any time during their travel but i didnt find the range to be worth it, i rarely used them but when i did i used them to cut the enemy off. The combat zones are riddled with space debris and asteroids, both allowing cover and hindering or dissalowing fire comletely. they are filled with narrow passages between asteroids that open and close (for some reason) between turns. Overall, due to its lower price tag i will recomend it, but it would be best to get it on sale if at all. The game gets old fast but it should be fun to go back to every now and again. I give it a 5/10 and hope that they update it and dont charge for micro-expansions.			"

												Sid Meier's Starships is like a cross between X-Com and Civilization.I ran into no game stopping bugs.  The screen might freeze up if one clicks too fast but it should clear up in less than 30 seconds.The game is easy enough to figure out and there is an advisor button if help or a suggestion is needed.  Buttons turn red if something requires attention.  There are action scenes of weapons firing for those with little imagination.9 out of 10 for those who like turn based games.			"

												This is not Civilization. An  ""epic"" game only takes a few hours (at most) if all victory conditions are enabled.  That being said, it is FUN to play. There is very little strategic management of your ""federation (empire)"". However, small changes have cumlative effects on the outcome of battles. You have the correct combination of effects on the right map and you can defeat a much larger force.  That is actually the best part of the game, the nuances. If you are looking for an epic space 4x game that takes days to complete, look else where.  If you are looking for tactical space battles chained together wtih strategic elements, this is it. Cons :1. The interface is a little flakey, could be improved, but it does function well once you get used to it.2. Game seems shorter than it should (epic really should be epic).Pros ;1. Fast to play2. Easy to learn3. Interesting tactical problems in the battles. Summary - it's only 15 bucks paid waaaaay more for games not half as good or half as fun.			"

												This isn't a strategy game - or at least not one like Civ, MOO, SINS, etc. It is more like a role-playing game that uses spaceships and turn-based combat.That said, for $10 (its initial release price), it's not bad. I actually quite enjoyed it, it has some replayability, and is worth a few bucks - especially if you can get it on sale. Comparing it to other AAA titles is a bit unfair because it started as a $10 game and isn't much more than that. But it is fun, unique, clever and will give a few hours of gameplay. But it doesn't have the ""one more turn"" additiction of other strategy games.Also, lasers and fighters are overpowered. :) Torpedoes are too, but harder to aim (except against easy AI).			"

												It is, as far as I know, a brand new subgenre of 4X games. Your singular fleet and its advancements are your sole concerns and unlike other 4X games you spend most of your time fighting based on a very fun and surprisingly deep combat system.  The addition of ""wonders"" and battle cards makes a lot of difference on the hexagonal battlefield riddled with environmental obstacles and effects that are a lot more significant than in any other 4x games.However, people hoping to find complexity of a $40+ title are going to be dissapointed. There's been some debate if the game is worth the current price ($15) and my personal subjective oppinion is that a game with this degree of polish despite the lack of $20-$50 content such as ""next gen graphics"", ""unique races"". ""diplomacy"". ""religion"" or ""multiplayer"" is well within it's 10-15$ range. It's a tactical combat game with 4X elements - not the other way around.			"

												Sid Meier's Starships is a very light 4X game. You control star systems and move a fleet of upgradable ships around while competing with the AI doing the same. There are four victory conditions (wonders, population, domination, science). Once two fleets meet or you attack an enemy planet the game switches to 2D hex-based, turn-based tactical combat.  You can attack enemy ships with lasers, torpedoes, plasma guns and fighters. There is a simple stealth option and there are obstacles on each map that can be used as a cover for ships. On the strategy map you can also upgrade your ships, buy new ships (but you can only have one fleet at a time) upgrade your planets, build cities and wonders and improve your tech level (there are different resources for each task).Now before I start on listing my personal pros and cons I'd like to get this out of the way first: The game is in no way comparable to great 4X games like Master of Orion, Endless Legends and so on. It's a simply game, designed for tablets much like Sid Meier's Ace Patrol. If you want a large, complex 4X-game then don't buy Sid Meier's Starships. Starships is much more of a ""let's play something for 20 minutes"" game than anything else.That said, here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Good Interface- Fast paced combat and strategy map- Fames don't take long to complete (I finished an epic game on normal in 2 hours)- Enjoyable if simple turn based combat- I really, really like the artwork in the game.Cons:- Diplomacy is useless.- The options are a joke (for example: Fullscreen mode only works on my system if I hide the task bar. If the task bar is   not hidden it's always visible and the game doesn't go fullscreen)- The different factions really don't play all that different. And choosing an affinity is mostly about what color you like- The turn based combat is simple. It's really easy to find a strategy that works for you (I enjoy mass torpedo spam for example) and stick with it. Once you have upgraded the first two ships to the max level there is almost nothing that can stop you)Conclusion: I recommend buying the game if you look for something to just play for a couple of minutes and if you enjoy simple turn based combat.I do not recommend buying the game if you look for something complex or challenging.

												I liked the whole style of the game. I played a couple full games, and enjoyed them. I love fleets, and how you can upgrade them. Lazer's, armor, shields, fighters, put enegry in to upgrade them. I really liked it, and I would recommend it to Space Fan's. I would like to see multiplayer added in the future, because after a while singleplayer does get boring. Enjoy :).			"

												Utter trash.  In case it's not obvious from the movies / screenshots... this is literally nothing more than leftover assets from Sid Meier's: Beyond Earth, reworked into a junkpile flash game.  It's not enjoyable, no real sense of accomplishment (or difficulty)... really it feels like one of the old ""classic"" TBS games like Master of Orion or Galactic Civilizations, only all the choices have been removed and the game runs at 10x speed.  I do NOT recommend, even at a discount (I got it about $5 cheaper than its current list price).  Sometimes I wonder if Sid Meier even has anything to do with the things that bear his name anymore.... I can't imagine any honest developer took a look at this and thought ""Yeah, this is totally not just a half-as sed cash grab!"".			"

												If you set your workers to automate or always put someone in charge of running your cities then this is a game for you. Sid Meier is known for giving you the ability to micro manage everything. So understandably this game is really making people angry because it's not that kind of game. It has a lot of offer but doesn't take anything too far. For me, a person who likes to plan my attacks and be able to led my forces into battle while not having to go back to every planet, city, etc. I own each turn to make sure it's on the right path, this game is a ton of fun and more challenging than I expected. Sure it's not going to be a game you sink 200+ hours in but it's also not a day consuming march of tears and cheers that gets saved at 2am and never finished.   "

												The good thing is: The ship to ship combat is actually pretty decent, and would fit well attached to a traditional 4X game such as Endless Space or Glactic Civilizations that have little or no tactical combat. The problem is, that this game as a whole feels pretty incomplete, and I don't even mean in the ""I am mad that this is a ported mobile game"" sense. Battles are all there is, and with no other narrative tying it together, it all falls flat. Upgrades to ships, and your tech, are all number increases, with no new abilities added. The buildable wonders give you some special traits, but even these all boil down to ""this works better"" or ""you are now immune to this"". This isn't bad per se, it just isn't very substantial. I still love you uncle Sid.			"

												If you're looking for a Grand Space Epic, this isn't it. If you're looking for a quick, clever space battle RTS, this is a good choice. The fact that it has the familiar lineage of Civ makes it all the more enjoyable. Graphics could be a little more elaborate, and I get why you're only allowed one fleet, but it can be annoying to have to run back and forth. A few ships for defense would sure be nice. Good use of the (very limited) tech tree to enhance battle tactics. Very logical and everything distilled to its essence.			"

Don't buy this game expecting it to be Civilization in space or to be a AAA game or you will be disappointed.For me this game is great, it's straight forward fun. It's got the same 'one more turn' appeal that Civilization and XCOM have but given that you can complete a game so quickly it is great for if you just want a quick game of something that you can see through to completion.

												Fun little twist on typical 4x thinking.  I like how you dont ""build"" ships that then become obsolete.  Every ship can be upgraded indivitually and once you own the frame of the ship even if it dies in battle it will respawn.  The assumption is that when its reduced to 0hp it just leaves the battle or something.  Going dark is plausable in a space game.Upgrades and reserch is instant so you can focus on racing around the galaxy brining planets under your federation.Recommend if you like new ideas and fun tactial space battles.  Dont reccomend if you demand high depth in every 4X game you play cause this one is on the light side.			"

 I want to start by saying that I clearly put some time into this game, and I do believe that it is on the VERY EDGE of recieving a recommendation.  The bugs and obvious mission features need to be worked out.  The Decent Parts   Tactical Combat - Although it still isn't perfect, the combat sections of the game are actually very entertaining.  Ships can be outfitted with various modules and upgraded to your liking.  Whether your ships are damage sponges with devastating firepower, carriers that can launch numerous fighters at the enemy, or insanely fast scout ships with cloaking abilities to get behind enemy lines, you're going to need to use some strategy and use your surroundings to your advantage.  If caught in the open, you can withstand critical hits, which need a turn to be repaired and leave you vunerable to attack.    Wonders - On each planet that you capture for your federation, you will recieve the option to create a wonder, such as stealth torpedos, 360 degree shielding, and systems that can withstand critical hits.  These can open new strategies and may influence how you build your ships.  Mission Variety - Missions aren't always simply ""Kill the baddies before they pimp slap you to death"".  While travelling to different planets to increase your federation's influence, you will often encounter missions that require you to escort civilian ships, maintain control of bases, and destroy stealth fighters that conceal themselves in the shadows.  While the missions to gain influence may often seem boring and pointless, it is often made up for by the epic battles between two warring federations.  These final battles as you attempt to capture homeworlds (or defend yours from an assault) often made me feel like I was actually doing something halfway important.  Instead of a 30 second mission where I blow up a fighter squadron, I was spending 30-40 minutes thinking about where to put my ships, which enemy ships to take out first, and how to evade my own destruction as masses of enemy battleships closed in on my carriers. The Not-So-Decent Parts   The UI/Graphics - The UI... isn't great.  At all. On top of the UI size being suited for an iPad and not a monitor, the graphics are just.. ugly.  This game looks like something I would've had on my phone two or three years ago.  Victory Conditions - I don't know what 2K was thinking by letting this slide.  At the start of the game you are given five settings for victory conditions. You can enable Domination, Population, Wonder, Science, or all of these.  Now you would think that enabling one of these would make it so that it is the only possible winning condition.  The sad part is that the condition you set only applies to yourself.  You can set the condition to domination, and after 3 or 4 hours of playing (the normal time for an epic sized map with a lot of opponents) a random opponent will win with a wonder victory out of nowhere.  This leads in to my next point...  Endgame - Nothing.  Unlike most other Sid Meier games I've played, and hell, any strategy game I've played (which is a lot, don't be fooled by my Steam library), you are not allowed to proceed with the game after there is a victor.  Instead you are presented a population chart (no other options) that lacks any type of accurate scale.  I could have 100mil population, and an opponent with 9mil is above me for some odd reason.  If you happen to win, you'll have the pleasure of watching a generic video about how you're some fabulous leader and now there's a thousand years of peace.  Clearly lacks any effort. The Potential / What I Expected Going into Starships,  I was expecting almost a complete reskin of Sid Meier's Pirates!, which, in my honest opinion is a FANTASTIC game.  I expected being able to customize my ships with my own names, specialized guns, and maybe even some visuals.  I also expected to be able to play the game after a victory.  I wanted to feel like I was actually the captain of a fleet, but sadly I didn't get that feeling.  Although I didn't get what I expected out of Starships, I do believe that it was worth the $15 that I purchased it for.  With a few updates and various tweaks, I honestly think that this could be a fantastic game.  Now I'm clearly not expecting an overhaul of the entire combat system or the graphics, but at least add ""one more turn"", a more varied diplomacy system, and work out some of the minor bugs. The Final Verdict:   5/10 - Average  "

												First let me just say that Starships is a decent and fun game to play for the low price it costs. The game has really good graphics which is what I have come to expect from Sid Meier's games.  The loading time into the game is a lot quicker than the standard civilization games which I also liked.   To me it was like a board game based in space using the basics from the civilization games. Their is some micro managing you can do in Starships but its not overwhelming like it is in other civ games.  I also like that the planetary jump gates allow you to keep moving your fleet without adding fatigue.  I played a game on the easy  level and had the largest map. I still finished it in under 6 hours, which is kind of cool considering their is no multiplayer option for starfighter.    I do feel their is a few drawbacks that I feel could have been improved upon.  The game seems to randomly shut itself down, which isnt that huge of deal considering it has the continue option when loading back into the game. The saves could use some work. I dont know where it saves it, I am assuming it is in some kind of cloud. I was unable to locate the save file directory on my computer for starships. I prefere to be able to manually delete my own save files without having to fire the game up first to do it. So if Starships is updated I would like to see a save file directory on my pc.  The in game maps do not seem to be that big in my opinion. The tool tips could use improving, it kept wanting me to develop my ion  engines even after i increased the tech and took ship engines to 5.  Finally their is no multiplayer option with starships. I think starships would be a lot more funner if i could have the option to play with my friends against the Ai's or each other. The one thing I dont understand is why only 1 fleet? Im guessing that is because the fleet is used for visiting the planets and attacking while the planetary defence's are for when you get attacked. So over all the game is fun to play if you dont mind playing it by yourself against the computer.  For the price of $15 I paid for it, I feel it was worth it and recomend it to play.			"

												Let me start with this: I love Civ Rev.If that statement alone makes you recoil in disgust, walk away from Starships and this review. I didn't come to this game looking for the depth that VI and V offer--or an experience which would redeem BE (I disliked it in fact). Instead I looking for something that can scratch that X-COMy, Pirates!-y, and straightforward Civ Rev itch which this game handily satisfies. Bonust points: Really reminds me of the 4x tabletop game, Eclipse--gathering resources, upgrading planets--extending your influence. Also a simiilar 'rubberband'  (escalating cost worker placement) mechanic keeps you from expanding too far too fast in the form of your crew's fatigue level. If you undertake too many missions, or travel too far your combat effectiveness plummets. There are ways to extend your crew's fatigue, but at the cost of resources which could be better spent improving the planets you control. The game also does a fine job during missions as well. The battles are fast paced and satisfying, even addictive. I often find myself absentmindedly going on another mission when I already decided that the last one was the last one. Penalties: They drop the ball in many places. To start, graphically, there's an appreciable difference between stylized and cartoony, and this game veers toward the latter. There's also ample room for imagination in the implemetation of weapon effects, and many missed opportunities to really differentiate the ship classes between affinities. The affinites are basically skin deep, and only add a starting bonus to the civ that chooses it. Another missed opportunity for depth is laying out the actual armament and defenses of your ships, ala Eclipse. There's no 'energy' cost however, for upgrading aside from the resource itself. Hence, with enough resources your could put every upgrade on one ship since there's no energy cap. Even FTL figured out a good balance in this regard. This game isn't for eveyone but if you found anything I said forgivable or intriguing--for $15 dollars--this game is worth it.			"

												I'll echo what others have said:  If you're expecting Beyond Earth II, or Civilization VI - that isn't this.  It's a light game with some 4x elements and some exploration elements.  There's a little colonial management, a decent tactical simulator (if you don't mind turn/hex based), and a variety of victory conditions.And that's really it.  It's true there is no tutorial, but there are a few help screens and that's all you need.  This is simple, light fare...and it does what it sets out to do.  In my first game I was one turn ('mission') away from a science victory, when one of my opponents conquered another one and was slightly over 50% population.  It takes 51 to win however and I managed to eke it out.  For all the lightness of the game, it was  a fun and entertaining game that took about 4 hours start to finish.			"

												Strategy-Lite; 4x-Lite. More filler game than mainstay. A little lacking in the kind of depth one finds in GalCiv or Total War. All of these things are true. And you know what? That is okay with me. Because Starships is not trying to be any of those games. This is a lite weight affair with ample choices and sufficient depth for the game it is trying to be. And that is a game wherein a player can wile away a few hours enjoying excellent theme and some lightweight, enjoyable turn based combat. If you're looking for the next GalCiv or Endless Space, no, this is not your game. If on the other hand you prefer your strategy lighter and simpler and a little less overwhelming - or you just want to kill a few hours with some lite fun - then give this a look. Especially if you enjoyed Ace Patrol, as this really is quite a good game in its own right.			"

												Strategy thick starship tactics with adrenaline stimulating tense action. Sid Meier's Starships has a incredible unique mix of elements which come together to create exciting suspenseful battles where fast skillful maneuvering to get in just the right sweet strategic position to fire hull shattering hits upon enemy ships then take off engines blasting behind a planetoid or some asteroids before the enemy can counter attack with devastating effect. Sid Meier's Starships is the first turn based strategy game i may have ever played which felt fast and furious giving a fps shooter adrenaline rush in of all things a turn based strategy game. It was like playing a table top game with friends but against the ai instead. Graphics have an old school style to them with a great hex map setup with many environmental variables which can mean the difference between life and death depending on how the player utilizes them to their advantage. Weapons have varying ranges and levels of damage with lasers delivering heavy damage from long range while missile weapons like torpedoes are usually slower with a chance of being avoided if one keeps their attacks fluid and mobile. Stay still and you are probably dead like a sitting duck.You can buy and upgrade ships to become lethal space faring dreadnoughts of unstoppable destruction. In my first game as i was learning my way around i built two heavily armored ships which were able to take on a group of five enemy ships and fighters for awhile letting loosing terrifying barrages of laser fire into their midst before eventually being defeated with blood curdling audio and visuals during their horrific demise. Talk about getting lost in fun abandonment as if watching a starship battle in a episode of STAR TREK.Planets you rule are used to get resources and do research to improve your battle prowess and keep your empire going. You will come across other leaders which you form alliances with or who will form alliances against you as everyone does their best to thrive and survive in the infinite vastness of the universe.Audio and music is excellent bringing home those peaceful space traveling moments only to be shattered by battle inspiring man your weapons music. Voice acting is quite good and am glad to say the female robotic voice of the computer is quite informative and comforting :)Cons-Ouch that user interface is not intuitive to put it mildly. During my first game session i couldnt even figure out how to move my ships until i watched a Youtube video by AngryJoe who was doing a first impressions playthrough. Also i have to hover my mouse pointer above my selection when giving a command otherwise i will choose the command below it or none at all.  If your into fast paced turn based combat with plenty of thrilling tension while not expecting a CIVILIZATION BEYOND EARTH experiance then Sid Meier's STARSHIPS is the game for you. Just enjoy it for what it is and you will find its more then worth the few credits you have paid to enter the star ship bridge for.			"

												So, Starships...What is it? The background is a basic two-dimensional map as in, say, Galciv 2 or even Moo2. You have one space fleet, which you can add ships to. You can also upgrade the ships both by adding components and improving your technology (the 'science tree'). Wiith your fleet you take on missions with Star-Trekky names, to gain influence over other star systems and eventually add them to your empire. You can also attack the AI players, who are the same cast that appeared in Civ:BE.You receive resources ech turn from your controlled systems; the systems can be upgraded by spending food to increase population, or metals to upgrade production. You can also build nexuses to get around more conveniently, and megabots to defend your systems. So there is an element of 'empire management', too.Victory can come through: science, population, domination, wonders; however, you cannot force the AI players to select a particular choice, so you need to keep an eye on their progress as well as your own. Game length is short; even spinning it out, you can finish a game with top-level ships (say, 6 levels of whatever components you like best) in 2-3 hours, and that would be a game you could have won much sooner if you'd chosen to do so.The main focus of the game is on starship combat, for at least two reasons: first, because that is the only way to expand, and second, because every player/AI battle at a home planet is sudden death for the empire being attacked; if it loses, all its systems immediately join the winner.So, how good is combat? Well, between equally balanced fleets (ignore what the game tells you about your 'prospects of victory) the AI will give you a challenge. Of course, if you have much better (fast, stealthed) ships, then the AI can be made to look foolish. But then, if the tables were turned, the reverse would probably be true also.Price: there are a number of good older games for the same price or less, but for a brand-new game, this didn't strike me as unreasonably expensive. Reservations1.	The game can end suddenly and unexpectedly if you or another player acquires seven wonders -  a number that is not scalable. So you can find yourself tactically NOT building wonders or capturing planets that have them. The same happens if two AI opponents decide to combine forces, and it turns out they have 7 wonders between them. It's not obvious to me why '7 wonders' should even be a victory condition, and particularly not such an arbitrary one.2.	There is the ability to link Starships and Civ:BE via My2k. It is quite fiddly to do (you need to open a My2k account and log on in both games). The reward is that you can take your Civ:BE persona into Starships against the same opponents and play on there. Also, you can obtain rewards (extra missions, more planet types and affinity choices). Having played 214 hours of Civ:BE and obtained nearly all achievements,it does seem like a bit of an imposition to have to jump through the hoops again on the off-chance I may get an Earth-type world, say, in Starships. At least there could be some indication of how to unlock the extras! More seriously, logging onto My2k while playing Civ:BE caused gameplay lag, and also a screen crash of my computer on restart. I believe you should get the bonuses automatically if you already have the achievements in Civ:BE.Conclusions. Mostly harmless. This is a perfectly acceptable, 'play over lunch' type of game. It isn't great, and it isn't terrible. It isn't hugely expensive, and it certainly isn't  cheap. It needs more content in terms of missions, and there are a couple of gameplay issues to sort out. Overall, it's good fun and is a welcome change of pace from those labour-intensive 4x type games that go on for days. Thumbs up.P.S. Thereis now a guide to the unlockables:

												First off, I am a pretty big Sid Meier's fan. I've been playing them Since Pirates and the original Civ. I can say in all honest this game is about worth the price but that's it.  Nothing horrible about this game, nothing great about it either. Personally it feels to me they were to focused on the mobile version and/or got bored making this and tossed out what they had. If you can I'd say get it on sale but if you pay the full price it isn't that much.			"

												A fun little game that's worth exactly the price. After you get a strategy down, the replayability might be limited to collecting achievements, appreciating the turn based combat, and then putting the game away after that, but it runs really well on my lower end system and the price, as I said, is just right.

												Not a game that hardcore fans of Civ seem to like from the comments.  At $15, my expectations weren't high, despite the research that I had done prior (once I saw the price point I knew I had to shift my priorities or I would end up disappointed).  Some will generally not like the touch-friendly control, however it still works for the game as it is designed, and it still provides enough challenge to play through with different characters and affinities.  It seems as this is more of a sequel to beyond earth that wasn't meant to be a full fleged game - and in its own right it owns that.  In its current incarnation it could be cross platformed across all Win 10 devices once the OS is released at the end of the year, as the hardware on most if not all computers won't be taxed by the graphics engine used in the game.If you're a hardcore civ fan avoid it - however if you want to give a slightly more casual incarnation of the Civ universe, this is it.

												I think most of the negative reviews around this came come mostly as a result of overly high expectations. A lot of the criticism is that it's not as in depth as civ, or other great 4x titles for that matter. But the fact is, this game isn't trying to be complex. Let's not forget that ""Sid Meier's"" games are not confined to complex strategy games. I've had just as much in my time playing Sid Meier's Pirates as I have playing Civ, and the difficulty gap between those games is enourmous. Just because this game is light on strategy doesn't mean it should be a let down. Also, this game was barely mentioned at all until a few months before its release; clearly this game isn't supposed to be a big deal. What's more, it really shouldn't matter if it's a mobile game, because it's still a good game. The only reason mobile games are a bad thing is that they are frequenty riddled with poor design and are little more than money-making schemes for their developers. I think it's good that Starships is a mobile game. You know why? It sets a good example. More mobile games should be like this. It's relatively simple, has a low learning curve, and yet still manages to be engaging and entertaining. It's easy to enjoy this game as long as you don't go into it expecting to play a 12 hour long game. I finish games in 30 minutes to 1 hour, and that's fine, because for what it is, this game is great.			"

												I actually really enjoy the game! If you're big on in depth strategy and resource management this isn't it. Managing planets doesn't have much depth. Build cities to up al resource output by a bit or build individual improvments to highly increase specific resource outputs. The game is mainly about building up your fleet and running combat missions. One thing I really enjoy is the fleet building. You start off with two ships and some energy to upgrade them. The fun thing is that all ships start with roughly the same base stats, and depending on where you put upgrades it not only does it alter that ships apperance but also what role you're looking to use the ship in. As I said, the gameplay is fast paced, not a whole lot of depth but I still really enjoy playing it! Something to waste away the afternoon with for sure!  "

												This is a great game, lots of fun!It's NOT a standard CIV game... it's a light strategy, with a light tactical  combat system that has surprising depth (a lighter version of XCom).The fleet combat (the main part of the game) is very fun, with many tactical options depending on your choices with wonders having a big impact on your play style. Tactics I've tried: A fast fleet with powerful short range weapons A fleet with lots of torpedoes and long range lasers A slow carrier fleet A small fleet with super ships (basically putting all your money in to 1 or 2 ships) think Mega Battleships A fleet with 2 'tanks' and the remainder light long range ships A fleet with 2 'tanks' and several carriersThese are just the ones I've tried so far... there are many possibilities, and you will have to responded the enemy fleet composition.In general you'll be spending your time:  Placing facilities on planets to improve output for a single resource or getting a fleet bonus (via wonders) Placing cities that will increase output for all resource types on that planet Acquiring technology for your ships Customisng ships (they change appearance based on your choices) Expanding your empire, by doing favours for planets or attacking other players And a lot of fighting (the game is all about fleet combat)Everything in the game is purchased, so there is no building or researching, you simply decide what you want and buy it with the correct resource. There are 5 resources generated by planets and they can also be traded or purchased with credits.So if you are expecting an in depth 4x space game you are going to be very upset (seriously read / view the marketing material).When you don't want to commit to a 20-60+ hour 4x space game this is an easy choice with games lasting for 30 mins to 2 hours.I can see myself playing this for many more hours.For some other opinions, have a look at: Eurogamer review [www.eurogamer.net] Polygon preview PS: I am confused why there seems to be so many ppl on here who expected Sid Meier's Gal Civ or Master of Orion, I found all marketing and previews very clear as to the aim / tone of the game!

												It's a lightweight but well formed strategy game which may be missing a few PC optimisations (a fullscreen mode and slightly more saturated colours would be welcome) but still manages to be fast moving with a reasonably elegant meta-game and pacy turn based battles. There is no overwatch mode in combat which would have been an interesting addition, but torpedoes, stealth and the ability for your ships to launch fighter wings give you lots of options and the missions (battles, escorts, maze escapes and full on fleet engagements) are surprisingly varied. I've had a lot of fun with this so far.			"

If you like flying around the galaxcy and engaging in ship to ship combat, its pretty good. The only thing I would say the need to add is permadeath for ships, and the ability to rename your starships. other then that, for what you are paying for, its a fun little game that you can pick up and play for a hour or so then move on to other things. Also the link with Beyond Earth is actually pretty cool.			"

												Sid Meier's Starships......an out of the blue title that generated a lot of anticipation and more than a little wonder at what the package would bring. Now it's here and while it's not socks from Grandma at Christmas, it's not quite the game you were hoping for either. Good but not great, worth the price but perhaps unworthy of the legend that is Sid Meier.This is not a 4x game nor was it ever advertised as such. It's more Ace Patrol than Civ, something fun that won't require huge chunks of your life to complete but something you can come back and jump right in to. While lacking in chrome, this game retains Sid's famous ""one more turn"" quality. The game is fun to play and the deeper you get into it the more strategies become apparent. I started it, played a few turns and stopped to do something else several times, then fired it up again after dinner and played it straight thru to midnight, surprised at how much time had passed.The lack of chrome, i.e. the ability to rename your starships and planets, the lack of any leaders, not nearly enough starship models, etc..... is disappointing but not a show stopper. Hopefully, given the track record of Meier products, this will be addressed in future updates. I hope to see steam workshop support added as well to let Sid's passionate fanbase come up with their own ideas. This is the kind of game that cries out for a Star Trek/Star Wars/BSG mod from some basement genius and I can't wait to see that happen.Over the years I've bought and played every single game Sid has ever made. This game won't add to the legend that is Sid Meier, but it won't detract from it either. You'll get more than enough gameplay from Starships to justify the cost, you just won't be sitting around 15 years from now saying ""remember Sid Meier's Starships?!?! Now that was a game""!			"

												After some thought I decided to recommend this game, but with some caveats.The best way I could describe this game is as a simplified version of Master of Orion I, with more emphasis to strategic battles (that cannot be skipped). We have battles, simple planet management, a very simple tech tree. You control only one fleet. You can add ships to it, or upgrade them by increasing the number of weapons, shields, etc...There is no limit on the number of components on the ship, but the cost of additional components increases exponentially.Another difference from MOO I is that you cannot colonize, and every planet is already populated, and by visiting them you can take battle missions, By winning them you gain influence and eventually the planet will become part of the federation. And yes, everything is turn-based.The main focus of the game are the missions. Indeed, you're going to spend very little time managing the planets and more fighting. Battles themself are generally short (about 5 minutes), and you can perform several battles per turn, as you can move your fleet multiple times per turn.Don't try to have long gaming sessions: you'll get bored very soon, because even if there are several types of missions the game mechanism repeats itself over and over again. The game is meant to be played for short periods, like one or two missions at a time. This is fine to me because I'm busy and I have little time playing videogames. No surprise that the game is also for iPad.My main complain about the game is the control system. It doesn't seem really designed for a PC. You can't zoom out in battles or even on the galaxy maps (you can zoom in). Also, it is easy to accidentally move the fleet to a planet you try to interact with. If they fixit my opinion of the game will increase quite a lot.It is good that the game is only $15, but I believe that $10 would probably be a fairer price. So maybe wait for a sale of the game.

												Well...it's not exactly what I expected... but it's obvious this game was made to play on an Ipad or equivalents. This isn't a real ""detailed"" game... too simplistic. I love all of the Sid Meier's Games. Played them since the beginning... but ... this one, it's fun, it's easy... but not something you could play for days like the normal Civ games. For the hardcore Sid Meier Fanboy, this would be trash. for the regular gamer, it might be fun. Also it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to think there is any strategic value or use of tactics. I would rebuy it on the Ipad, but for a pc game, it should have had ""more"" stuff. I recommend this for the average gamer, or for the people who like simple scifi turn-based games. But for the real gamer, I wouldn't recommend it. I'd give it a 6.5/10, the score will rise if the game gets more updates.			"

												Firstly, choosing between Recommending this game, and not recommending this game was kind of a hard choice, but in the end I decided to recommend it for what it is.The reason: It's a good game.  It's a short game, but it's a good game.Allow me if you will, to delve into the reasons why I will recommend this; It's a mini-game.  The game itself is made as a companion game but can be played on it's own and is still a bunch of fun.  It's short enough that you can fit in a quick game (an impossibility with other Sid Meier titles), and still leave satisfied.You choose a different ""leader"" which gives you a different boost during the game, but overall I didn't find they made too much of a difference.  Then you really just expand, fight off some ships through an asteroid field, and repeat.  There's a few ""varieties"" of missions, but it's generally just clear out the other fleet, get your ship to a ""warp hole"", or escort a colony ship.  If you're okay with repeating these missions over and over again (with more or less enemies, and a few modifications like reduced visibility) then the game is a fun little time filler.If you're not, then don't buy this game.

All you have to do is upgrade one of the weapons really quick and you basically over take the galaxy with ease. i was bored two hours into playing but decided to give it a chance anyway for a few more hours. stood bored for the next few hours torturing myself. it has great potential to be a sequel  and even greater for certain mods. before i start playing again, i want to see updates for more visual effects on the ships for upgrades 5 and up, more ships that'll blow my mind, more diverse missions, bigger galaxies, even though is a sequel more colonies, more wonders, a way that you can make it a longer campaign like the original rather than so short, and etc... alot of thought went into this game but not enough.

												A new Civilization in space? Something that expands Civ:BE allowing it to reach the glory it aimed at? Unfortunately, no. Sid M.'s Starships goes in the same direction XCom, franchise revived by Firaxis, did. And it goes much, much further. For those who may not know, the new XCom is an extremely simplified, tainted with tacky graphics ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the original game. Although, unlike Starships, it's still very enjoyable. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. What do we get buying SM Starships? Pitifully little. It's a typical tablet/phone game that could be distributed for free if the devs cut down on graphics, basic as it already is. Tech tree does not exist. Instead, we get several options to improve cerain aspects by a % bonus. Boring.Pretty much the same can be said about development of planets. Player is just adding numbers and %.Combat looks like in XCom but is much less intuitive. Will I be able to hit my enemy if i move a little to the right? Will have to see. It's a guessing game, especially when distance grows. Torpedoes and their delayed explosions are a nice touch, even though AI can't handle them a bit. BTW, ""lasers"" in this game act like tomahawk missiles. Curved lasers... Priceless. Missions are simply boring. All are played on almost identical maps. Only details vary. Special missions, ie. hunt a ship or flee, only pretend to be different.Another thing is pacing of the game. I've seen and done everything in 2 hours. Nothing left to explore. After half a dozen turns you've already been everywhere and done everything. What's worse, you've also upgraded everything worth upgrading and bought everything worth buying. The biggest killjoy comes from fleet upgrades. Cheap upgrades make you invincible. Spend one turn's income on lasers and bang! You are dealing 1000% more damage!All in all, if you have nothing to do while taking a shhhhh..., buy it and play it for a moment. Just make sure you have no problems with moving your bowels because if that's the case, you may get bored with the game before you succeed on the other field.I really hope this game makes a lot of money because after Civ:BE the name Sid Meier became much cheaper, and after Starships, it may be forgotten, or even shunned, by everyone besides older Civ players. After all, money is the only conceivable incentive that could have given life to this little title.			"

												Firstly, choosing between Recommending this game, and not recommending this game was kind of a hard choice, but in the end I decided to recommend it for what it is.The reason: It's a good game.  It's a short game, but it's a good game.Allow me if you will, to delve into the reasons why I will recommend this; It's a mini-game.  The game itself is made as a companion game but can be played on it's own and is still a bunch of fun.  It's short enough that you can fit in a quick game (an impossibility with other Sid Meier titles), and still leave satisfied.You choose a different ""leader"" which gives you a different boost during the game, but overall I didn't find they made too much of a difference.  Then you really just expand, fight off some ships through an asteroid field, and repeat.  There's a few ""varieties"" of missions, but it's generally just clear out the other fleet, get your ship to a ""warp hole"", or escort a colony ship.  If you're okay with repeating these missions over and over again (with more or less enemies, and a few modifications like reduced visibility) then the game is a fun little time filler.If you're not, then don't buy this game.

												Having played Sid Meier's Civilization since its first incarnation, I was interested to see how a $15 combat focused spinoff would play out. Starships possesses minimal depth and is far cry from what fans of the series are acustomed to. This is not Civilization, but it also doesn't pretend to be. It is a fun $15 game that focuses almost entirely on fairly rudementry combat mechanics. I have been enjoying the game and I highly encourage people to purchase it. Take a look at some Youtube videos and make your determination from there. What you see is what you get. There are no surprises.On a hours played to money spent ratio, Sid Meier's Starships is absolutely worth a buy.			"

It is interesting to have the abstract choices of tech and development instead of having to choose specific technologies or buildings.

												The Epic Review of Avatar Buddha SattvaFor consumer Most people that gave negative review of this game are ignorant ( thay played the game only 14 hours or less). This game is Beyond Earth episode II to be precise. The gameplay switches between Civ V like  tile system of gameplay  and tactical war perspective on the space map combat zone - it adds new transcedental level of fun; and there is a third perspective - controlling each individual torpedos- Sid gives you choice of when to detonate your space torpedos (it's nice but takes too long, you usually try to predict where your enemmy will move, its all game of probabilitie); however, I prefere maximizing mouvements of my sacecraft, lunhing two smaller fleets from my individual ships to expand my army) and then mele attack lunch from close range for most damage in game, point final. very quick. and did I tell you - the look of your fleet changes depending on upgrades you did each time.For Sid MeierPlease add turn base multiplayer option, lack of multiplayer is depressing, I can assure you- you can make it 'turn based' mutiplayer  instead of simultaneous, with rank system, and giveaway for top rank players. You can make this game into multi billionaire gem by adding it to android .apk mobile device, specially tablet with rank system, auto matchmaking, I am very sure you can compress the graphique. Now days rank system matters. You can update your app, make new skin for individual ships, and sell it for extra cash, so you can invest on your most next ambitious project- Sid Meier's Andromeda - the End of Milky way- where the human has to achieve super mastery of dark energy to escape our milky way that is on the verge of collapsing with Andromeda Galaxy.

												I picked up this game on sale recently.  I have only just played around with it a bit but I will say that it is entertaining. There is the inherant boredom factor that comes with each and every Civilization game and this one is absolutely no exception. It has a similar feel and dynamic as Beyond Earth but I do feel....an almost...emptiness while playing it.  It's a fun quick game but I guess I wish it was a little more expansive. I like the fact that it is a Civ game with a relatively short turn around as sometimes it's nice to just play a quick game and be done with it rather than spending insane amounts of time saving and reloading the same game to infinity.  The lack of multiplayer/co-op is either a massive oversight or a shrewd strategy to market it to the tablet crowd (Android capability please and thank you). Overall if you like the Civ games, like Beyond Earth, and want something that is not going to take 5 days then this is your game.			"

												It's all about the starships, so the scope of the same is small and specific. It's fun-size strategy. Like the candy that is either good or bad depending on how much you wanted to begin with.Despite real space being very empty, the battle maps are full of asteroids, and wormholes, and that gives you cover and shortcuts to work with so there's more to think about than just who to shoot.The strategic overworld is important though. In several games I've won every battle but lost the game because an AI won more important battles somewhere else.Equipping ships isn't quite what I'd hoped for. I was hoping for more precision in the choices. Situations where I could determine that one more level of shields would make a world of difference because that would mean a ship would take three hits to defeat instead of two. Doesn't have that. It's more a general: I need more protection-get more protection. It's the strategic layer that more determines how your ships take shape rather than countering something your enemy has.The wonders that enhance your fleet and the modules local planets specialize in give you reason to choose one design over another. If a planet offers cheaper armour that would be a reason to choose to use it rather than shields or stealth for defense. A wonder making your torpedoes undetectable would make them a key weapon in your fleet.The resources your planets provide will determine how you enhance your ships. Excess metal leads to wonders, science to research based bonuses, and energy to bigger fleets with bigger ships. Working with what the game gives you rather than a predetermined plan determines how well you do. This adds to replay in that one game may give you lots of science and cheep fighters but the next offers energy and cannons. You could see this as a loss of choice, if your goal is to find one good strategy and stick with it, but if you'd rather be surprised by and adapt to what you have then this will work for you. We should start calling (tagging?) games like this MacGyver games, because you have to win with not what is the bet tool for the job but, with what you can do with what's at hand.Can't tell yet how balanced the various options are yet, or if having a design theme is necessary or if you can just have all general purpose ships and be fine.I've had fun. It's only $15. Probably better on tablet.			"

												I must admit that I came into this game not expecting much.  But what I got is a game that is quite enjoyable.  Whilst the game borrows from the lore of Civilization Beyond Earth the game itself doesn't hold much in common.The game works by having you perform missions at each planet you stop at.  Complete the mission and your influence on that planet rises till you control it.  When you control it you can improve it, gain resources and wonders, and generally have access to more ""stuff"".The strategy comes in utilising your fleet (you only have one) to your benefit.  You only have a certain number of actions per turn so make sure you choose well.  Do you do a mission on a nearby planet?  Make a run for an emey's home world?  Or spend a turn to repair and make new ships in your fleet?Overall a really good game that ties ""tried and true"" Sid Meier concepts into the one game.			"

												Read lots of reviews before buying this!First off, I do like the game and I think many others will too.  However, if you're looking for the usual depth people expect from Sid Meier, then this won't be the game for you.It's a fun stratagy game, with some refreshing mechanics and a solid platform for interesting tactics.The down side is that it seems to have been designed for tablets then ported, rather than the other way.  So the interface is simpler than PC gamers will be used to, and annoyingly (at launch) it doesn't have true full screen or full graphics/interface options.If you want a more casual stratagy experience you can play in the background between other things then this is a cool little title. If you want a full emersive stratagy game that will steal hours of your life at a time, this won't do that for you.			"

												I cannot recommend this game at all.  It loads, it plays for a few seconds, then it crashes every single time.  Reading my way through forums for over an hour got me about half a dozen possible fixes that were brief and made not much sense as they apparently assumed that their readers would understand what they meant.  I figured out how to implement some of the suggested fixes which did earn me an additional second or two of gameplay; I can select the ship upgrade screen now, but within half a second or so after choosing the game crashes.  Again.  2K support is all but useless.  But that isn't a surprise.  No, I don't think I will choose to uninstall and reinstall Windows.  Instead I'll just junk your crappy program.The game looks like it would be a pleasant little timewaster of the sort I enjoy, but instead it is just an unpleasant waste of time for me.  If others can get it to load, run, and be enjoyable, I envy you your successes.  Congrats, and I actually mean that.  I will just remain disappointed.  Luckily I still have the original Masters of Orion.			"

												tl;tr: It's not Civilization in space! It is a small and fast game, perfect to play after work for an hour or two and have fun. Not very deep but funny! Don't expect too much, if you want to play deep and long games go to Civilization. If you want to relax after work for an hour or two this game could be for you.What is Sid Meier's Starships? You have an intergalactic empire and the goal is nothing less than to rule the galaxy. You can build some basic industry on planets which produce resources like food, metal and so on. With those resources you build your fleet and travel to other planets where you can do missions to gather influence. If you have enough influence the sytem joins your empire. Very simple.There are several mission types like ""kill all enemies"", ""protect a convoy"" or ""escape from a asteroid field"". You can customize your ships, which means you can add long range lasers, short range plasma weapons, torpedos, shields, hull, fighters etc. The fights are the fun part, with the different weapon types one can develop different tactics which makes really fun. The torpedos e.g. are good for a crowd of slow ships. Once fired they can't change direction but you decide when they explode. If the timing is perfect one explosion hits several ships and can even destroy them. Asteroids give you cover and the back of your ships are the most sensitiv part. I managed to destroy a big ship with two or three hits from my fighters in the back of the enemy.The research is very basic, 9 (if I'm not wrong) different techs which can be upgraded some levels. The results are weapons with more damage, faster engines and so on. No new weapons or other ships.You can build wonders, like in Civilization or Beyond Earth, but they do not cust so much. As far as I could see those wonders are powerful, one e.g. gives you clocked torpedos so the enemies don't see them anymore, which makes them even more powerful.Sooner or later you meet the AI players, they want to rule the galaxy too. The diplomacy is very basic (not that its counterparts in Civilization or Beyond Earth are better in my opinion, but...) and is like ""hey, how are you, what have you done in the past, lets compare our genitals (fleet strengths, plantes, etc), do you want peace or war?"". Sooner or later one AI will declare war on you and you must try to conquer their planets. Or go straight to their home world and end their suffering.The integration with Beyond Earth was promoted as a special feature. You need an extra 2K account for this (not sure if this hasn't been possible with Steam, but anyway). Then you are able to ""continue"" a save game from Beyond Earth in Starships. Not sure what this means in detail. I managed to unlock some kind of bonus in Beyond Earth, but haven't played this again. I'm sure they extend this feature over time and it might add some replay bonus to both games. We'll see.As I said at the top, don't expect too much. It costs only 15 bucks, I got it for 11 on GMG which is ok for the game. If you are unsure wait for a sale.			"

												This is a good game if you know what you are expecting. First, you need to put two things in mind: one, it's only $15, so don't expect some huge game like Civilization V or Beyond Earth; two it's not a Civilization game.Now with that out of the way, Starships to me, is a unique game that takes the gameplay from many other types of strategy and space faring games. I stated before it isn't a Civilization game, but it still borrows some of the game mechanics from Beyond Earth. It's still mainly just a turn based clicking game, with many different options to start your new game with to spice it up a little bit and to offer some diversity, such as the affinity system from Beyond Earth and the same leaders from it, too. I also like the new feature where you can interact between the two games.Now, to the pros. I've played a lot of Beyond Earth, and this game was still quite confusing when I started. It seems like it's very complex, but once you play the game for about fifteen minutes, you get the hang of it quite easily. Planets are like cities, and you can apply upgrades to your planets to increase science, metal (production), energy (money), and food. You also use the food to increase the population of your planet, which increases the production of all materials slightly, the only thing that's different in this aspect from Beyond Earth is it doesn't take time. The game is turn based, yes, but it mainly only applies to the battles. This game goes by much faster than a traditional Civilization game, which is good if you just want to kill a couple hours. The customization/upgrade system is pretty alright, too. You can use your materials to apply certain upgrades to certain ships which all have their own effect, you can upgrade the planet as said before, and you can instantly upgrade technology with your science points. There are also four ways to win: population, wonders, science, and domination. Also, another thing I liked is the map, I love the variety of planets and all the planets have their own special aspects to them that alter what they exactly do for you when you control them. And the missions you do for the uncontrolled planets are also pretty unique and fun. The game has no lag or glitches in it at all as long as you have a good enough computer to play.Cons, I'll make this short. I don't like that you can't trade with the other factions, you can't go through their territory at all unless you are at war which is hard if you don't like having war all the time, and the interactions with leaders are just pretty limited in general, all you can do is wage war, be at peace, see their progress, and very rarely do they offer you a technology if you fight someone for them. Unless you consider the uncontrolled planets as secondary factions, there are no secondary factions to interact with. You can't name the planets or ships if you're into that, either. Most of the wonders are very limited in their use, and you can only build one per planet and it depends on the planet you control.Conclusion, Starships is a pretty good game to play if you got a few hours to kill or are up at night and can't sleep and it's relatively easy to pick up and learn as well. While it has it's good things, it also has it's flaws, but in Starships, the good outweighs the bad for this one. For $15, you can't really expect a perfect game especially when Firaxis only put a few months into it, but they put good work into this game. While it serves somewhat as an expansion to Beyond Earth, it is it's own game entirely, and it's very fun and time consuming. Remember though before you buy, just because it has Sid Meier's name on the game does not mean it is a Civilization game, it is it's own game with it's own likeness. For $15, it completely worth it to me, and if you can catch this game on sale, I would definately get it.			"

												Ever since Civilization 5, the Firaxis team has been focused on a casual, arcade-like feel for their games. Civ V never had the intensity that Civ IV and before had, yet it was very agreeable to the eyes and had decent replayability. Moving onwards, we got Civilization: Beyond Earth. A pale comparison to Alpha Centauri, but still a fun game if you were in that arcade mentality. Firaxis continues the trend with Starships, a very simple and pretty game that is practically a tablet app game.Pros:- The visuals are stunning as usual, and seamless graphics for the most part- Very interesting use of tactics, looks like they took a page from their X-Com game- Once you get rolling, the game is straightforward and can bring that ""one more turn... one more turn..."" feeling that every Civ player has come to love and hate.- the variety of planet missions are great and makes every encounter different.- the save-link between Beyond Earth and Starships is a nice touchCons:- If you hoped for a intense space domination game, this might not be the best bet for you- It is really casual oriented, and that does give the feeling of emptiness and being unfulfilled after playing a game (which could last up to 3 hours)- space combat  does get monotonous, and once you fire torpedoes enjoy watching the AI scarmble right into your lasers.- Controlling only one massive fleet takes a lot of tactical potential away, especially on the large/epic maps if your fleet is on the other side of your federation and your planets get attacked.verdict:In the end, I did enjoy this game more then I hated it, and I hope with some modest mods the game can really shine, just like how the mods for Civ V have made it a new game entirely. If you go in with a asual, arcadey attitude, you will not be disappointed and will find this game enticing and refreshing. Just don't expect any long epic campaigns.			"

												Straight from the Science Officer:---------------------------Sid Meier's Starships is the continuation to Beyond Earth. While BE was more focused on 4x empire management, Starships shifts gear to commanding a fleet of interstellar vessels as you run around completing missions in turn-based strategy fashion. In-depth customization of your ships' systems is the center of the game as lasers tear through your hull because you thought having maximum sensors was the smartest idea. While the tactical map is where you'll be battling, the galactic map is ultimately where you win the war. Here, you'll be competing for influence on various systems against your rivals from BE as you seek to rid the universe of their annoying one-liners. Victory is achieved by eliminating all of your rivals, controlling over half of the galaxy, researching enough technologies to the maximum tier, or spending enough industry to own seven wonders. ""Yes Commander""---------------------------(+) Well thought out tactical gameplay - Do I stealth this turn? Fire my weapons? Launch torpedoes?  ""Oooh let's hide behind this planet and when the enemy comes, charge guns blazing"" (+) Great ship customization - With your fleet of ships, you'll be able to craft each ship to fit your battle plans. You could make a fleet of ships with many engines and long range weapons and kite the enemy or brawlers that hide behind a planet and charge out when the enemy nears. Maybe you'd like to have a stealth carrier that pops out, launches some fighters, and goes back into the void or a sensor ship to detect an enemy fleet that relies on stealth fighters. The options are vast. A bonus kudo goes to the fact the game auto-classes your ship based on its setup. A ship teethed with guns and armor will be labelled as a battleship while a fast ship with high damage would be an assault corvette. It just provides an additional, nice immersion feature.(+) Simplicity - While it can be argued that this is a negative as some people perhaps expected a complex 4x game reminisicent of MOO or Galciv, Starships is a game focused on ...Starships. The focus isn't on managing a large empire but instead on controlling your fleet and completing missions with that said fleet in order to build your empire. (+) Missions - There's a decent variety of missions so you won't get too bored until a few playthroughs. While the mission types get similar, the map and the ships in each mission can change.(+) Price - $15 (in the US) is a great price for a game like this. You'll definitely get hours of gameplay and like most Sid Meier's games, once you figure out the controls, it's hard to pay attention to real-life.(+) Bridge Visuals - Each bridge depending on which faction (harmony, purity, supremacy) you picked gets it's own unique bridge. It's a really small thing but it's something that definitely stands out.""We'll get them next time..."" ---------------------------(-) No Multiplayer - One of the things I was hoping to do was get a nice game going with some friends. The game definitely has unexploited MP potential. A decent size map can be finished with some friends in a day. It's not going to be like playing a MP match of Crusader Kings or EUIV which can last weekends on ends. The AIs only going to be able to be so unique on designing fleets.(-) One Fleet - Having only one fleet really limits strategic gameplay on the galactic map. There's not going to be any strategy where I can defend one location and fight in another on AI turns. I won't be able to create a fleet for defense and another for attack or specialize one fleet for certain types of missions. (-) Squishiness of Ships - Hopefully this gets sorted out but ships seem like they are glass cannons no matter how you build them at the moment. Unless you're literally building all armor / shields (which makes that ship pretty useless since it has no weapons), most ships die in a few hits. Fighters die in one shot from basically anything short of a maximum range pea shooter. This makes the tactical gameplay more arcadey and will hopefully be improved upon in later patches. (-) Lack of 'One More Turn' - A fundamental Sid Meier's feature. Sometimes you just want to continue but you win, victory, that's it. This was an easy feature that was just simply and unfortunately overlooked.(-) Modding Tools - There's a lot of potential for modding a game like this. It's not a stretch to imagine someone trying to recreate a Starfleet or Star Wars based mod if the tools are provided. Some of the best additions that enhance the value of old Civ games were fan-made maps and mods.""Close Victory""---------------------------Overall I'd give this game a 6.5/10. The gameplay is addictive and the tactical battles are in-depth. Ship customization and fleet design is well-developed and serves as the main anchor for this game. Nontheless some pitfalls exists, mainly in the fact that there's no multiplayer in a game that would obviously benefit from having the ability to play a match against your friends. If you're expecting a big 4x game then you might want to stay away but if you want a quick game and you have a love of starships and fleet command then you should definitely pick it up. It's only the price of a dinner and you won't be eating tonight anyways when you're too addiced from playing.For future reference, this review was released on game release date and may be updated in the future.For those interested in a preview, I recorded some gameplay:

												First off. Please don't let the ""5-seconds after launch Negative Reviews"" cloud your judgement of the title. They're the people spiteful about Beyond Earth feeling like a lesser Civ V and want to take it out on the developers they're suppose to love. This game is a cheap $15 for one, and what you get more than justifies the price as it's still complex and well-put together, like other 4X games, but revolves more on space combat while the resources Civ players are familiar with, gained through missions to other worlds and expanding your federation/empire are managed for the purpose of upgrading your soon-to-be armada that deserves ""Empiral March"" playing as they jump from hyperspace. That tight focus may honestly turn off hardcore Civ players but it's also a great middle ground for 4X fans that still might have trouble with the overwhelming concepts traditonal 4X throw at them off the bat and can become better aqauinted in this game. This game's connectivity with Beyond Earth makes that purpose seem almost intintional. So if you're looking for a game where you can simulate feeling like Tarkin commanding marine warfare from a Star Destroyer and being diplomatic with foreign worlds, and don't have a childish beef with Firaxis because one of the many godly games they made wasn't exactly they way YOU wanted it to be, this game is for you. And if you're still skeptical and have some chump change sitting, you can extend your library by 1 and try it for yourself. And once your comfortable with the mechanics, send me a game invite because I'm always down to play and my friends and I would love to fight for the galaxy with you until one Civ's left standing. Fight for your Civ and Empire! You're Admiral and you're it until you die or they find someone better.			"

												This is NOT an epic strategy game with the level of detail of a Civ 1-5 or a MOO (if you want to think of space strategy games). If you don't have those expectations upfront, then the game can be interesting in it's own way. At it's most basic level, Starships is actually ""Ace Patrol"" set in space with themes from Beyond Earth thrown in. The battle hex board layout is exactly the same as Ace Patrol, but the mechanics of how weapons play out is now space themed. There is definiely more detail here than in Ace Patrol when you look at all aspects of the game. There is a simplified research system, planets that are ""upgradeable"" to harvest more resources for upgrading your ships. All of this is simplified to a point where each aspect of the game could be thought of as an upgrade system, less discovery, and faster. The mission system is also simple and can get a little repetitive, but by mid-game it becomes only battles against other empires. This is a mobile game for the most part, but I don't mind playing a quick game on the PC when I have a moment. Some might say it's not worth $15, but that's actually cheap compared to the $50 epic game. For a fast playing strategy game with more depth than an ""Ace Patrol"", Starships is definitely worth it. The expectations around this game were poorly set up, so watch a gameplay video to decide if it's right for you.			"

												Played a couple of games so far on the first two difficulty levels and smaller universes, and enjoyed both.  The game is easy to get into and fast-paced.  It's reminiscent of Spaceward Ho! for the few of you who may have played it years ago. But with much more depth.I suppose there is the danger of some fun aspects of the game bogging down as the fleets get large and you have to manage larger empires. But I haven't encountered that yet.I do wish you could rename your planets and ships --- the planet names start to blur after a while, and I would like to be able to specialize my ships with regards to capabilities and name them appropriately.I don't think the replayability of Starships will be anywhere near the Civ games, but seems worth the money.  I am looking forward to playing at harder difficulty levels.  And hey, there is a final animation for winning!			"

												I knew before it was released that this game would be ranted and raged about on release. Why? Because a number of people had expectations which were completely out of line with the game that Firaxis promoted repeatedly on their YouTube channel.Sid Meier's Starships was announced as a tablet game with a PC version from the get-go, but a certain segment of gamers saw the name Sid Meier and convinced themselves that this game was going to be Civilization In Space (a.k.a. Sid Meier's Master Of Orion) despite all evidence to the contrary.Here's what it is: a simplified tactical space game with colorful graphics and impressive music. It has some depth -- it might be worth reading the in-game rules section to understand the game's strategic layer -- but it's basically a tactical starship battle game.Does the game have problems? Yup. The lack of a true fullscreen on PC, for example, really annoys me (you have to manually set your taskbar to auto-hide) but there's nothing wrong here on day one that a few, inevitable post-launch patches won't fix.So, if you're undecided, wait for the patching. Some people report not being able to start the game at all, but I've seen none of that here. (If it won't start, I've heard that skipping the opening cutscene may be a work-around)Day One Verdict? The things I like about Sid Meier's Starships outweigh the things I don't, by a fairly wide margin. I expect a number of issues to be corrected with patches, going forward. This isn't the next great strategy game -- it's a ""play it for fast, fun starship battles"" tablet game. You won't devote days and weeks of your life to this game, but I think Sid Meier's Starships does what it set out to do very well.			"

												Coming into this game, my expectations weren't super high. There are some features that could be better, no doubt, but for what it is, and the short time that I played it at the time of writing this review, I do recommend it. Compared to other Civ games, it's light, but the features that are in it make it pretty fun (even though they could do with some touching up). It seems like most people don't like the game very much, but for it's price, if your a fan of Civ games and other space games as well, I'd say give it a shot. It's not the greatest by any means, but still worth a look. I'm sure with future patches, the game will get better (hopefully).Pros:-The ships for each affiliation (Supremacy, Harmony, Purity) look pretty good and when upgrading them, their look changes with each corresponding upgrade.-The way you get control of different planets is pretty cool (in my opinion)-A decent amount of leaders to choose from each with different bonuses-The battle and movement animations look nice and fairly smooth-Tactical battles are pretty fun, but may get boring quickly depending on who you face. (Pirates are a constant thing when it comes to the quests)-Easy to learn and understand the mechanics.Cons:-The camera control is pretty awful. I get it was made for mobile as well as PC, but really? You can only move the camera with the arrow keys and it's pretty bad, especially in battles.-Quests to control planets can get repetitive; most of the time it's just beating up pirates of some sort, though since I've only just started playing, it may change as you go along (doubtful though).-There are no graphical options at all, and the fullscreen mode (at least for me) shows my taskbar still at the bottom of my screen. Minor, but can be annoying.-The affiliations are cool, but I wish there was a little more variety with them. The only real difference I've noticed so far are different looking ships and a different starting bonus.-The research ""tree"" is...lackluster to say the least.That's about all for now. I'll update this review further as I play and as they patch the game in the future.Personally, I do recommend it, but don't expect a huge amount, cause it's not Civ, but nevertheless, it's still pretty fun to play.Thanks for reading, guys!-AwesomeOne			"

												Fast, fun little space 4x.Initial impressions are that this is Sid Meier's take on a remake of Master of Orion 2.The pros are this game has very little learning curve with a pretty easy to learn interface. Easy is easy, hard is actually hard, just as it should be. This is the kind of game you play if you don't have time for a game of Civ, but still want that hit of strategy.The cons are lack of flavour and options. The game at times feels a little generic, like the bare bones were built, the skins were drafted, but the complex flavouring was left out. At times it's like going to a 3 star resaurant for a burger and fries.			"

												I watched the Twitch vids for this on the Firaxis channel and I liked the look of it so I preordered. I've waited till I got a few hours in to post this so as to do the review justice.It's alot of fun! I'm actually surprised I'm enjoying it this much. I was hearing alot of negative stuff before the launch so was unsure but after playin it for a while I'm completely satisfied with the purchase!The game is alot quicker than you're used to from a Sid Meier title, I havn't tried a small map (preferring the large) but I'd estimate you could Knock out a game on the train to work or the tube or whatever you're taking! There's enough strategy in there to keep you thinking, between mission choices, planetary improvements, wonder construction and ship upgrades/ships.Visiually its pretty but nothin special.Audio is the same.I was disappointed I could not rename ships and planets.On the whole a great casual title perfect for me between stressful rounds on other games or a quick game of somethin when you don't have the time for a 3 week epic game of civ 5! On the whole I like the game and I'm glad I bought it, Its fun!I'd give it 7/10*Edit: Just a thought, but being able to purchase officers maybe 1 per level of ship in 5 main categorys:ShieldsWeaponsNavigationRepair per turnFighter Rebuildetc et al			"

												All the other reviews are complaining about how this game isn't a proper 4x game.  Well it's not & I'm pretty sure it never claimed to be one.Sid Meier's Starships could use a little more polish & more things to do (think Sid Meier's Pirates), but as it stands it's a fun little space romp.  I'm certainly enjoying it a lot more than I have Civilization: Beyond Earth.			"

												Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.First of all, you should know that Sid Meier's Starships is a game more reminiscent of the Ace Patrol series than the Civ series. Do not expect deep or complex gameplay here. What you CAN expect is a turn-based strategy game that delivers a ""pick-up-and-play"" experience, tied into the ""Beyond Earth"" story. The game is simple to get into, easy to learn and master, and perhaps not that challenging. This does however not stop it from being fun, but sadly there are some sides to the game that is, well, not shoddy. But perhaps not entirely well-thought out. There is little difference between the plasma cannons and the lasers (the two main types of weapons) in terms of visuals and mechanics, and you have no control over what your ships use. Close up? Plasma. Long range? Lasers. More depth would have been welcome. The maps do offer some nice mechanics (asteroids that block shots, ""corridors"" that open and close, wormholes that will teleport you and so on), but I still think they could have included gas clouds to hide in, rather than the (somewhat pointless) stealth system. One area where I've always felt that the Firaxis games has excelled, is in the ""feel"" of different factions. I may have missed something here, but it seems that your opponents are generic in the extreme in ""Starships"". You can fight them, or not fight them, but you probably won't care much about them whichever way you decide to go. And they won't really care about you and what you do, unless you fight someone they don't like (they'll give you something or other as an incentive) or you pass through one of their starsystems (which results in an immediate declaration of war). Pro: -""Pick-up-and-play"" turn-based strategy.-Simple and fun in its own way.-Some pretty good ideas.Con:-Not very polished.-No real depth.-Abrupt ending.-Oversimplified game mechanics.-Not really great graphics.-Ship explosions are extremely lackluster.Summary:Sid Meier's Starships is a turn-based strategy that offers quick ""pick-up-and-play"", wrapped in a plain package and with mechanics that falls short of what they could have been. This is not deep strategy, but rather ""Ace Patrol in space"". Keep that in mind, and be ready to forgive the game its simplified graphics and gameplay, and you will likely find a fun little game underneath it all. You may want to wait for a sale before picking it up though, as it seems to me that it is a bit overpriced relative to what you get.5/10 -Recommended, if on sale.For more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation "

												Simple and elegantFor the price I did not expect a game that would blow me away. I expected a polished simple single player experience and that is exactly what I got.At first I was slightly disappointed in the introduction video. It should at the very least scale up to 1080p, but it is a minor aestethic complaint. Next I was confounded by the ""Settings"". Basically you can only choose between windowed or fullscreen, and you can adjust various volume levels. Thats it. Further on it becomes obvious that you will not need any advanced settings for this game.Visually the game delivers a polished, clean and smooth experience. Various icons and symbols ties nicely in with Beyond Earth. Aduio effects are also very BEish.Strategically you manage planets and one fleet of spaceships through resources produced by said planets and rewards from missions. You have to choose missions wisely because you can only complete so many each turn and those you ignore will be completed by your neighbours.Tactically you move around and attack enemies on various ""maps"" generated for each battle and there are a handful of random elements thrown in for each battle.  You configure your ships offense based on preferred range and utility, and you have a few defensive options as well.The whole thing ties together nicely and offer a relaxed, balanced single player experience. I can easily recommend this game.			"

												A short but good game. As you can see on the price, it is a small game. The game is good. It's would be great if there would be multiplayer in it. But there is only single player skirmish in it, I think. (SPOILER a.k.a. about the game:) I only played 2.1 hours on medium size and easy level so far.It's not a civ game. You have only 1 ""unit"" with many ships in it. Combats are  turn based. Science wonders, and everything goes for building your ships. Aside from your one unit, the other important thing is defending your planets. On easy level if you defeat enemy homeplanet then you get all territory of his. (note: If you register to 2k at the left side of the menu, then you will be able to get bonuses from Civ:Beyond Earth)Because of its style, it would be great if there would be multiplayer..			"

												It's a good little game, I'd buy it full price, but would recommend people buy it for sale. Reminds me of MoO2, only less depth, and alot shorter.It's the most basic of 4X games I've ever seen, and because, good. It polished its core very well, you need to explore to expand, and you need to exterminate your rivals to make sure you end up with a controlling majority of the galaxy. You explore other player by playing off know rivals, for boost in you tech or resources. I've only complete the one play through, and it took me roughly an hour. The controls took me about 15min to learn. Comparing it to MoO2, combat is hex-bases rather than square based, and you take on the role of fleet commander. Very similar to each other, and it was nice.The game is really basic, focusing on the core of what makes a 4X game, well, a 4X game, you can gain tech/recourses from fighting for a rival of a allied faction. I think we need to seem more games like this, games that focus on what makes a good 4X game, before we see another MoO3, or Galactic Civ game. Going to fair done the path of exploration, exploitation, or extermination.			"

												I have never reviewed a game before, but after reading so many reviews of others, I wanted to express my opinion.  Whether or not I can recommend the game is dependent upon what you seek, and what your expectations are.  The biggest problem, from what I have inferred from reading reviews, is from disapointed expectations.  Civilization V and earlier Firaxis/Sid Meier games are nothing short of brilliant.  The entire Civilization series (and I have been there since its inception) could arguably be labeled the greatest PC games ever produced, from every which way you might want to analyze it: quality, depth, re-playablility, customization, fun, and strategy. If you are looking for Starships to have the depth, and strategy (long-term planning and maneuvering) to achieve the final victory, you won't find that here.  This is a simple game, almost more like an arcade game with some choice elements to be determined by your preference, such as do you want firepower or stealth?  But not the intricies of long-term grand scale strategy that Civ is famous for.  If you are anticipating even a scaled-down version of Civ, you will be disappoineted.  This is not a game of watching your grand design come to frutuion.   After having played several games of Civilization V, marathons that lasted more than 800 turns and a week of playing per game, I welcome being able to play a quick in-and-out game like this.  This is more complicated than Solitaire or Minesweeper, and can be similarly addicitve.  Starships is NOT trying to be Civ.  Perhaps Firaxis went too far away from strategy on this one, but I had fun with it.    Simple fun.However, I was really disappointed the way ship design and outfitting work.  When I first heard about this release , I thought back to one of my all-time favortie games, Master of Orion II, and shrilled at the prospect of a Sid Meier version of this.  In MOO2, you selected a ship class, which was an empty shell, and you chose how to outfit it, based upon the research you had done.  And even if you were capable of adding your Class X shields to your ship, you could have instead installed Class V shields, allowing more space for other modules (such as another array of lasers) and reducing its cost.   And there were several choices of laser technology to add, based on research and function.   In Starships, there are only lasers (long-range) and plasma cannons (short range), with only a nebulous upgrade by incrementing a level.  I was looking forward to specialized intricate ship design.  There is none of that, as this is the simplest system.  For me, the ship designing  in MOO2 was the most exciting part of any Space 4X game I have ever played, and what I was hoping  Starships would be.  Based upon my expectation, my desire, this game fails.Does this game have depth?  No.  Is the strategy a deep-thinking man's game like Civ?  No.  Was it fun?   Yes.    What you want from a game, the level of complexity and granularity you enjoy,  together with your expectation of Starships, will determine whether you think it is worth it ot not.    For some easy, casual and quick fun, Starships delivers.  But if you want this to be a CIv-like game, or somewhat like MOO2, complicated and full of strategic and tactical choices, it will not satisfy.			"

												This game would be perfect if they would have expended it into the size and detail of civ 5. It definitely has the portential to be a game like that. Now if only they combined civ 5 civBE and starships, let the game be civilization 5 and have civBE and starships be expansions to the game. Just add the techs of both games, satelites, and the planetary warfare, but no major changes to the way civ 5 runs  have it be nothing more but a large expansion to Civ 5. I would find it to be really cool to get to future in civ 5 have several stages that would reach you to the late game victories, for example when you complete space victory it would be a world wonder instead and you would get an advantage for ship tech or new future technology, or a say a diplomatic victory would give a bonus to how much influence you would have over a new world when you assist them in getting rid of marauders, and the dom victory would determine how powerful you were before when you jumped to the space section of the future and give you a bonus ship or give extra bounses to your ship, (unless you conquered everyone, then you would win an early victory). Another thing that could make combat very interesting would be, for one have more than one fleet and once you won the space combat you get to siege the actually planet and have to fight through the inter planetary defenses and show if you have what it takes to truely take over the world, instead of just beating their fleet and you have the world. The only other things that should be added could be the aliens and health which could be in place with having to deal with happiness from civ 5 at the same time, and make you have to deal advanced aliens whom are just advanced as you. And keep how the spy system works in Civ 5 althrough out the game, and keep the intrigue nosense from CivBE out of the game.			"

												This is more of an Ace Patrol game than a Civ game. The factions, alignments and model design are based on those from Beyond Earth but that's the closest it gets to Civ. Instead this is a game about moving spaceships around a map, completing Star Trek style missions and having the occasional war. Good fun, and nice and quick.			"

												Let's be upfront about something: This is not a Civilization game, nor does it pretend to be. If you're looking for Alpha Centauri 2 or a rehabilitation of Beyond Earth that isn't a weak Civ5 mod, you're in the wrong place.If you want a board game to play on your computer, then this is exactly what you're looking for.Starships is a compact game probably designed primarily for mobile devices. And you know what? There's nothing wrong with that. Where Starships excels is in its vision and execution of making a game that recreates the board game experience.What's so elegant about Starships is that it takes common board game mechanics and takes advantage of the fact that since the game is being run on a computer, it can develop those mechanics to new heights. Developing planets as your resource generators very much mirrors how a board game might have a chart where you move tokens around to determine how much you get per turn. Special abilities function like cards drawn out of a deck, and the map looks like a game board. Even the victory condition, ""Control 51% of the map"" sounds like something out of a board game.The combat is simple but deep. You get full customization of your units, and you move around on a hex grid shooting at each other with stuff like line of sight, distance, and cover to calculate. It would be unmanageable as a tabletop game (unless everyone playing is a total Warhammer junkie), but as a video game it's very easy to let the computer do all the calculations for you.Like any game worth its weight, the rules are very simple to understand after a turn or two, but there's enough nuance to them that you'll be spending quite a few hours understanding how to optimize everything and adjust on the fly.Major strikes against the game: Missing a lot of basic computer game functions (come on, let me up the resolution!) and no multiplayer. The latter is pretty bad, but then again, it takes a very special group of people to have the patience to sit through a multiplayer 4X game.In short: It's a board game. Don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise. But it is a great board game that takes advantage of not forcing the players to calculate anything on the fly, and blossoms because of that. If you even enjoy the occassional game of Settlers of Catan, this is probably a game you'll enjoy. "

												Even at $14.99 this game is even more garbage then Civ: Beyound Earth. Feels more like a beta/demo then a full game. If you think you are going to have fun customizing ships and planets think again. Planet customizing consist of cliicking a button to add points to resources or population. Ship customization isn't really customization at all, but just add points to like 6 different stats. It's just sad how a great franchise can fall so far but this seems to be happening lately with all big titles. Oh and there is an end game that you can't keep playing after like other Civ games, so onces it's over you have to start a new game :(.			"

												-- updated after 2 complete playthroughs --After playing the game a couple of times and learning the intricacies a little more, I'm still enjoying the game. It is simple and fun, and has surprisingly repeat-play value. Although I do hope they release an update that would make it a little easier to play (proper fullscreen support, better key bindings, etc.). Would be nice if they added more complex missions too.I'd give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.-- initial review --I like this game! It is not sophisticated or expansive as Civ or Beyond Earth, but it isn't too shabby either. There is no steep learning curve, although it took me 30 min to get used to the mechanics. So far I'm enjoying this game. I'll update my review once I have a few more hours under my belt.As far as the negative reviews go, I think the game got hyped too much and was expected to be big like Civ, but personally I think people should've seen how complex (or not) the game would be when they announced it would be available on the ipad as well.

												If you can handle knowing there is a Sid Meiers game that isn't very complex then you might enjoy this spin off title.  I was pretty skeptic when I started playing, but it grew on me a bit.  Imagine an odd combination of Beyond Earth, Risk, and any of the better mobile games out there and thats what Starships is. You are mainly going from planet to planet completeing one of the 4-5 combat missions (elimination, escort, escape... etc) and then slowly taking over the galaxy. You upgrade your starships and planets via resources you gather from the planets and move on. It will be much more straight forward than any other Sid Meiers game. But if you go into knowing its pretty much a glorified mobile game, then you might just enjoy and keep playing.			"

												Really worth the 15 dollars i spent, when looking at it try not to think of it as its own stand alone game which it actually does really well as, look at it like a future exspantion for Beyond Earth. Because thats basically what it is. Firaxis announced that they are going to tie it in with beyond earth adding another layer of machanics to an already solid game.			"

												yes? maybe?  I find the game to be a lot of fun but WAY too short and WAY to shallow.  There needs to be bigger maps, more fleets, more factions, and a better ship classification system (ie. Torpedo crusers, heavy crusers, cariers, ect.)  I was also a little disapointed with the continuity from BE, the factions are the same and the afinities are the same but it would be great if there was more carythrough of your choices and tech from BE.  That said I loved the combat mechanics, they are fun and smooth.  The weapons systems are fun to play with and try different tactics, My personal favorite is the torpedo swarm, Just launch a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of torpedoes and kill everything.  The ships are cool to play with, I like to build them with specific purposes in mind.All in all it is a fun but short game.			"

												-- updated after 2 complete playthroughs --After playing the game a couple of times and learning the intricacies a little more, I'm still enjoying the game. It is simple and fun, and has surprisingly repeat-play value. Although I do hope they release an update that would make it a little easier to play (proper fullscreen support, better key bindings, etc.). Would be nice if they added more complex missions too.I'd give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.-- initial review --I like this game! It is not sophisticated or expansive as Civ or Beyond Earth, but it isn't too shabby either. There is no steep learning curve, although it took me 30 min to get used to the mechanics. So far I'm enjoying this game. I'll update my review once I have a few more hours under my belt.As far as the negative reviews go, I think the game got hyped too much and was expected to be big like Civ, but personally I think people should've seen how complex (or not) the game would be when they announced it would be available on the ipad as well.

												If you can handle knowing there is a Sid Meiers game that isn't very complex then you might enjoy this spin off title.  I was pretty skeptic when I started playing, but it grew on me a bit.  Imagine an odd combination of Beyond Earth, Risk, and any of the better mobile games out there and thats what Starships is. You are mainly going from planet to planet completeing one of the 4-5 combat missions (elimination, escort, escape... etc) and then slowly taking over the galaxy. You upgrade your starships and planets via resources you gather from the planets and move on. It will be much more straight forward than any other Sid Meiers game. But if you go into knowing its pretty much a glorified mobile game, then you might just enjoy and keep playing.			"

												ENGLISH""Sid Meier's Starships"" is like these three parents become a baby: ""Civilization - Beyond Earth"", ""Star Wars - Empire at War"" and ""Strange Adventures in Infinite Space"" (which had a sequel: ""Weird Worlds"")!Civ-BE contributes a background story and the Optics.SW-EaW adds the idea, that everything takes place in an entire galaxy. You just see the planets, but you can only see the appropriate suns are only visible in the ultra-cool space combat mode.And SAiIS delivers the general feeling! You are put into the role of a Fleet Commander, assigned to a spacefaring civilization. Your civilization is always called ""United Federation"". It's purpose is to spread its light over all other planets in the galaxy. Unlike SAiS you have up to six opponents, who try to do the same things like you.In ""Starships"" you always control exactly one fleet, consisting of a handfull of ships. You're heading from one quest to the next with these ships, until - after a while - it hopefully turns out, that you've been better than your opponents.I can raise my thumb for ""Starships"", for I like the immersion (that means: ""atmosphere"") of the game and because - being a 35-year old Gamer - I worship Sid Meier as a God! The game is cheaper than Sid Meier's unforgotten milestones, so don't expect a pretentious masterpiece, that makes history.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DEUTSCH""Sid Meier's Starships"" ist so, als ob diese drei Eltern ein Baby bekommen hätten: ""Civilization - Beyond Earth"", ""Star Wars - Empire at War"" und ""Strange Adventures in Infinite Space"" (dem späteren ""Weird Worlds"")!Civ-BE liefert die Hintergrund-Story und die Optik.SW-EaW liefert die Idee, dass alles in einer kompletten Galaxie geschieht. Man sieht die Planeten, aber die dazugehörigen Sonnen sieht man bestenfalls im überaus coolen Raumkampfmodus.Und SAiIS liefert das Spielgefühl! Du schlüpfst in die Rolle des Flottenbefehlshabers einer raumfahrenden Zivilisation, die beschlossen hat, ihr Licht auf allen anderen Planeten zu verbreiten. Du erkennst Deine Fraktion immer an dem unveränderlichen Namen ""Vereinte Föderation"", aber im Unterschied zu SAiS hast Du bis zu sechs Gegenspieler, die das Gleiche wollen, wie Du!In ""Starships"" kontrollierst Du immer genau eine Flotte, bestehend aus einer Handvoll Raumschiffen. Mit denen kämpfst Du Dich von Quest zu Quest, bis sich irgendwann hoffentlich herausstellt, dass Du besser warst, als Deine Kontrahenten.Da ich Wert lege auf Immersion (sprich: Atmosphäre) und als 35-jähriger Gamer den guten alten Sid Meier als Gott verehre, kann ich meinen Daumen nur heben! Das Spiel kostet weniger als Sid Meier's unvergessliche Meilensteine, also erwarte kein pompöses Meisterwerk, das in die Geschichte eingehen wird.			"

												Even at $14.99 this game is even more garbage then Civ: Beyound Earth. Feels more like a beta/demo then a full game. If you think you are going to have fun customizing ships and planets think again. Planet customizing consist of cliicking a button to add points to resources or population. Ship customization isn't really customization at all, but just add points to like 6 different stats. It's just sad how a great franchise can fall so far but this seems to be happening lately with all big titles. Oh and there is an end game that you can't keep playing after like other Civ games, so onces it's over you have to start a new game :(.			"

This is really sad that people were expecting a new 4X game and didn't care to try to understand what was acheived with this game. Guys if you are real fans of Sid's work go watch videos he did playing the game himself and explaining what it is and stop giving bad reviews to a great game simply because you didn't take 5 minutes to inform yourself before buying it.Now, to the review:This game is a fast paced strategic & tactical game with a very small learning curve, it offers to have great time on this type of game in a short period of time and it does it really well.What other strategy game feels both elaborated in style, content and gameplay but is at the same time simple enough to almost feel casual ? (and no, there are no great mobile strategy games except maybe chess, and side note games of type build something and pay or wait aren't games and even less strategy games, they are a steal and should be deemed internationnaly illegal, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it)In Civ: Starship instead of building an empire and the story of a world, you build a victory.Game feels polished (noticed a couple tiny bugs but nothing anywhere close to game breaking, i'm just picky on this because i'm in game dev myself), and is really well optimized.Ships are low poly and haven't heard of dx11 :( but visually better than up close models in BE and don't feel as disapointing.Regardless of what people are saying, all this game misses is competitive multiplayer and that doesn't take away from it that it's an awsome game in his own gender, aside from the franchise.To be honest, I thought I'd be as disapointed by this as I was with BE, but it turned out to be the complete opposite and I'm already loving the game. It's a total surprise how great it is, i didn't believe someone could pull it off.My last game almost felt like playing a board game. I can't wait for the next half hour i'll have to poor into this :)Sid if you ever read this, I'm really sorry so many people are blinded and don't understand it but you did an awsome job. Thank you.

Posted: March 12, 2015
												I just downloaded starships and played a few games. This game is awesome! I don't get people who are complaining that this game isn't enough like the civ games...seriously...one of the biggest criticisms of critics regarding beyond earth was its supposed overly similar interface and gameplay (to civ 5). So sid releases a game that is only loosely based on beyond earth (factions, faction bonuses) and all of a sudden this game doesn't play the same as beyond earth or civ 5? wow..talk about hard to please....Anyways back to my review:The good-This game is very tactical (the battlefield has asteroids/planets you can use as cover (to hide behind) and blocking players shots (some weapons can shoot through minimal asteroid fields but then the dmg you take is reduced (it feels good when the comp tells you you have only a 35% chance to complete a mission given your current situation (*ships/upgrades etc) and you still manage to pull it off!-upgrades on planets provide good strategic options (as planet wonders affect your economy, ships, battle, income, repair costs etc the list goes on...)-The ai is pretty sneaky and will come by and try to undermine your influence on planets that haven't been won over to your side yet-upgrading your ships even has some strategy too it (do you upgrade existing ships to have more movement points, higher shield, better weapons, cloaking, sensor range etc) vs buying a completely new ship and thus increasing your overall fleet size-fleet sizes don't seem to get too big, so its easy to manage, and the combat is really fun. of course you have to like turn based hex based combat to enjoy this (but what are you doing buying a sid meier game if you dont'? lol)-the ai will ally with other players against you (but its still not impossible to win...just hard) - so the challenge is there if you want it (as i only played on normal and i found it challenging) -the graphics are pretty good, and the animations look cool (lol its like  startrek but without familiar ship designs)-various parts of your economy to manage (balancing metal (to improve defenses/planets, food (to increase city sizes (and thus increase resource generation), energy (to upgrade your ship) and science points (to provide general upgrades to your entire fleet- all of the crap is pared away with this game..no random stats or updates on your planet populations mood/ or any of that garbage..this has been replaced with the morale of your starships troops (they fight less effectively until you give them shore leave (effectively this is the end turn button)..enemy does its turns and then you receive your planet income and start your new turn (with all morale restored). There is a wonder you can build on your planets so that your starship crew fights at max level no matter the level of fatigue (this is def something to research.). -the defense of your planets is handled well (you buy planet defense upgrade (its called a megabot or something) and they are basically extra ships that will assistn you in defense of a planet (good thing to upgrade...lol). the bad-it would be nice if i could adjust the graphics options (even though it does look really good lol i like the ability to make it even better..thats why i bought an expensive pc....-the trainer (i.e. tutorial) is ok...but doesn't tell you everything you need to know...(tutorial is only a few popups and ends with telling you to click the info button (and it then gives you a suggestion of what to do). Some things i had to figure out for myself (most of it is intuitive so you will figure it out just by playing a game or two) but a little more help would have improved the experience for people who don't want to waste any time figuring out little details (for instance i didn't know i could improve defenses...build cities etc until i started clicking buttons to see what did what), i also didn't realize i could buy a new ship (instead of just improving the ones i had), i didn't know if i could have more than one fleet (it doesn't seem like you can) and it wasn't super obvious to me if i had to manually change weapons in combat (lasers for long range, photon something for close range and torpedoes for really far) lasers/photons activate when you go to attack the enemy by themselves (i.e. if its too far for photons you shoot lasers and vice versa). Torpedoes are weird in that you do activate it manually but when you shoot them (at first they dont' do anything...you have to wait until your next turn to manually detonate it or move it forward more) you have 2 turns to either move it forward a bit more or detonate it (after 2 turns it detonates by itself). generally people see them coming but you can move out of the way...unless you get the planet wonder that makes them perma stealthed (which is awesome). (ok this was long but basically as you can see..woulda been nice if the game just told me some of that stuff..but you figure it out pretty easy. - not much story here...at all (if you care about story this may irritate you)Overall, this game is pretty awesome...its fun to play, different enough from normal sid meier games that its refreshing, but familiar enough that you won't be completely lost if you have played a 4x strat game before. Definitely recommend this game! just buy it already!...at 17 bucks its less than half of what i paid for beyond earth and is just as fun so its a great price point for a game that has a surprising amount of depth at a price thats cheaper than going to a movie at the theater.

												If you like turn-based fights on tiled (hexagon) maps there's a lot of fun to be had in this game.  Not super complex, but enough so as to make you consider which planet to invade or which upgrade to buy for your ships or which wonders to build in your empire. Games last anywhere from about 30 minutes to a few hours depending on difficulty and galaxy size. If you remember the ship combat from Master of Orion 2, this game is similar to that. The wonders in this game taking the place of some of the more exotic ship components from the earlier game. No one aspect of the game would be enough to win an award by itself, but everything is competent, pretty and the level of polish is excellent as you would expect from Firaxis. All in all, a really good value for just $15.			"

												I am very thankful I paid no attention to any of the hype for this game.. why? Because I didn't have undue expecations, so I think this game is fun! Yes, its simple.. its meant to be. Thats a good thing to me (and I play a lot of very complex deep games). The menu is sparse? Well.. its meant to be simple, so why would a simple game have a complex menu? You can easily playthrough a whole game in one night.. and again, thats not a bad thing! Its a quick and simple setup ""boardgame"" style and thats what makes it great! What more could you want for just $15? I have played every. single. sid meier. game. ever. And this game is not bad. Is it alpha centauri in space? No. Its not meant to be. No its not perfect, no game is anymore, not at launch anyway (devs need real feedback from players first, they can't read out minds). I think this game has a lot of potential down the road, especially with integration into civ: beyond earth. A few things I would like to see is a bit more information for the missions before I send my fleet there... some of those missions are brutal! Also, more than one fleet would be especially nice. The game is playable with only one fleet of ships though. Bottom line: if you want a fun, simple, quick and easy(ish) game for cheap that ties into civ: be that can be played in an evening than this is good game for that. If you enjoy tactical turn-based battles and some micromanagment thats not overly complicated this game is good for you. I could easily see this as an actual boardgame someday too, complete with starship figures!			"

												I honestly don't understand the negative reviews. It's almost as if people are angry that the game doesn't play like a $60 game when it's not a $60 game. It's $15. The game is fun, but simple. Does it belong on tablets and such? Yeah, I'd say so. It reminds me a bit of the Plague Evolved/etc games, where there are mobile and PC versions and they all play just fine, they're fun, but everyone understands you aren't going to make it your life's mission to master it. All that said, this game could really benefit from modding capabilities to take it to the next level.If you can accept this is a game at a quarter of the price of a normal Civ game and thus will have less complex and detailed content, then buy it. If you are looking for Civ 6, this is not the place to look.			"

												Perfect, game play is smooth, graphics are nice, remember its $15. The  game plays nice and the space battles are interesting with the way they are set up. Diplomacy is easy and smooth. Been playing a while now and see no problems with this game. It is not super complex, well duh its a $15 game. You can custom build your ships, build advancements on the planets, adjust the way the game is played. I think this is a nice addition. I can not wait to see what all unlocks on both games. :-)			"

												At first glance the game is fun and it will give you a good length of gameplay. Although the game is fun it is rather short from my experiences the map fair sized and gameplay is simple but fun. however i do not believe it is worth the amount i paid. the win cenarios are a tad too easy so if you want a long run it may not happen due to simple amount of wonders or territory it takes to win. but i will continue to play it and be happy with my purchase becouse it comes down to the bottom line that i am having fun with the game			"

												I spent a few hours playing this today. I have not played Beyond Earth. I've enjoyed the game so far.What it is:A $15.00 space title, with tactical combat, decent graphics, and some compelling aspects.Ship customization (modular)Tech TreeLightweight turn based systemLow maintenance.This is a great game to play on your ipad or machine when you have a couple of hours to burn and want to unwind after work. It is not a Civ game and will not have that level of cmplexity. I think it has potential to be very moddable if they make that an option.Now with that said there are some things people need to know:The tech tree is very imited and has no appreciable effect outside of combatThe game centers around space combat and gathering territoryYou can only have 8 ships and they always travel as a groupIt can feel a little rinse and repeat in the late game on Epic stick to shorter gamesNone of those things surprise me this is not a $50.00 game. What it does not have is any bugs I have found, it performs perfectly, and I have had fun playing it. I like space games, I like to unwind, I do not like to feel like I am managing an empire when I get off work during the week. This is exactly what I expected when I bought it, I watched a lot of game play videos from the creators before buying.I suggest if you like science fiction and want something to play thats simple and fun. Give it a try, watch a few videos first if you are unsure.If however, you are expecting the next Orions, Civ in Space, Galactic Civ or what have you then you will be dissapointed. It plays like a lightweight X-Com in space. This would not be a game for you.Hope this helps!			"

You could image this game being a complicated Risk game where you play a little game of Chess to resolves the battles.			"

If it is galciv from sid you expect, then do not buy this game. If you want to play something that is at the same time 4x-ish, casual and yet may be challenging, then this game is for you.     No multiplayer is a huge flaw in my opinion. I play a mac version, no crashes so far.I do recommend this game, but not for the ones who seek a great global 4x strategy.			"

												Sid Meier´s  StarshipsThe goodIts a fast pace Sid Merier´s game, it uses alot of mechnics featured in Civ V and Beyond Earth, however its simplified in order to make turns faster and easier. Which i feel make it a good addition to the CiV franchise for those day you dont want  to spend hours or days to play a CiV campaing. Building and maintaining your fleet is easy and quick, upgrading cities and building improvements are easier then ever.  I find it alot of fun.The BadJust like Beyond Earth the different faction personalities lack character, and arent that interesting, unlike its more historical predecessor,BE and Starships dont have humanitys rich history to draw upon in the players imagination and give us instead a barebones universe. I love sci-fi but there is so little lore in this game that can draw you in it quickly becomes a very sterile experience. Starships also lack true fullscreen and a decent options menu.The UglyThe graphics are functional and colorful, but i cant say the game is especially pretty.The VerdictSid Merier´s Starship is a lightweight mobile game that aimd in providing a on the fly fast CiV experience. I think the game achives it goals. It lacks the strategic depth and richness of the other civ games, but it has fairly enjoyable in shortbursts. Its the Sid Meier´s game you choose to play on  the train, before you go to school, a late friday night before a date or a party, If you dont like that idea and want something more substantial, i would not buy this game. However if you want affordable, fast paced tactics game Sid Meier`s starship provides that. "

												Despite what others have said this game is great. Why they link it to Pirates is unknown to me, it is more like Civ meets Air Patrol. The civ part requires very little management and the fleet system is so much fun to customize. By customize I don't mean the look of the ships, rather how tough, fast, how many hangars, etc. And if you want to reduce points you spent from say stealth to engine, you can in no time flat.It does lack fullscreen mode at this point. But I've played worse games in fullscreen and some awesome games in windowed mode. I'd like to see it added, but I am not gonna whine and say it ruins the whole game. That's extremely petty when the game has much to offer to keep you busy.I think some folks are getting a bad impression of this game because of the lack of micro-management. To me that gets you in to the action that much faster, which is the point of this game. I've already spent hours conquering the galaxy. The maps aren't very huge, in this type of game they don't need to be. You don't have to exhaust yourself building 40 structures from the ground up like you do in Civ, that's a major plus for me. Although I love Civ, I didn't need another one so soon.For the current cost of the game, it is great. It can use some polish, what game can't use some 5 years after it's launched?Update: I expected to get some down votes, can't expect children to understand simple logic with out getting their panties in a bunch I guess. Bottom line, the game is worth the money, don't expect to be wow'ed. It's a simple game, lots of fun.			"

												First let me put your mind expectation on the right track..This game only cost $10 (at least from my currency to USD) Price might differ from region to region. Anyway from the Game price.. you will know its not a Super Expensive Triple ""A"" game that cost around $60 and Above. So the Game experience is what you get from a $10 game.. nothing more nothing less =). Even thou it have a Sid Meier's name on it.. it still a $10 game. So put your Expectation in $10 range hahaSo is it a good $10 Game?Yes! The game is worth it. Its a fun game.. more of a casual stratergy game. I myself finish a Game in 3 Hours on Normal difficulty. There is some replayable value to it as well. You have the 3 faction.. Harmony, Supremacy and Purity. Each faction have a different ability and Each faction have 8 hero with different Hero skill. Not bad for a $10 game =)Pros:* Fun tactical game. Simple but engaging enough. You want to be stealth shot from a far.. or.. you want to be a Tanker close up and personal. All up to you =)* Simple and Great Ship customization. The ship will reflect your build.. Add armor for more HP.. your ship will look buffy and Tanky * Simplicity done right. It does not feel overwhelming. Simple yet engaging* Price.. its a $10 game with tons of fun =)* lots of Mission.. There's variety of missions for you to do.. you won't get bored until a few replays =)Cons:* No Multiplayer thou.. but for me its optional..* You basically play with only One Fleet.. kinda limit your stratergy. I wish we have more =)* Some bugs as usual. but i bet it will be Fix soon enough			"

												Okay don't let the thumbs up fool you, I 've played every game with Sid Meir's name on it since the first Civ game.  This looks to be an early release at full price, I wouldn't spend the $15 on it just yet. It's not deep, very clunky to control and just all around not good YET.  I have complete faith that once the devs start the inevitable patches and DLC's this will turn out to be a much better game in a few years ala CiV 5, we all remember what that was like at first but then came the patches, the DLC's, more patches.  Must I go on?  Anyways wait until this puppy goes on sale and then snarf it up and wait for the really good stuff (crossing fingers) to show up.  Come on dev's help us out.			"

												Fianlly being able to play Starships after watching hours of livestream from Firaxis, it's exactly what I was expecting it to be. With a not-too-complex playstyle, Starships is a fun short-game alternative to the Civ:BE universe akin to Ace Patrol (only with a bit more simplistic battle mechanics). Also, there's the added bonus of cross-game rewards between Civ:BE and Starhips, although I've yet to figure out how that system works precisely. Some bonuses are straightforward, and other pop-ups I've gotten saying I've unlocked something left me a bit perplexed. I've found that in order to have a worthwhile run of a game lasting more than an hour I have to restrict myself to Domination victory, at which point one can accrue a rather sizable fleet which on harder difficulties can make for interesting battles with the AI. So, bearing in mind the $15 price tag, understand what you're getting into if you're on the fence about this one. And not that there's multiplayer plans I'm aware of, if such a thing happens that would add leagues of value to the game overall.			"

												This game is underatted by far yes its a simple game but absolutely solid in AI performance and core mechanics sure the settings and window could be improved sure they will with a patch.Its to simple they say yes its supposed to be I found the most fun in the fleet battles and different missions I really did enjoy this game that moment when your best ship gets blasted to peices by three enemy ships at once, it seems well balanced.The main map is well designed easy to understand lack of tutorial is helped by simple advisor mechanic and initial screen shots showing the basics of the game so you don't need a tutorial this game is already easy enough to understand.I played and beat very quickly well thats the point replayability setting up your own game victory condition choosing your difficulty through games can last a few hours.Building a fleet is easy you start with base ships and through various options you can choose to speciallise them I.E ship carrier, heavy Battleship so on reccomend long range.The A.I seemed very competant just played on easy so far to get the feel of the game reccomend you just dive in and have fun with it well worth the price of £10.99 not £30 so don't be exspecting a AAA game.To most of the negative reviews there was plenty of Videos information about the game to know what it was about hell even the steam store page pretty much sums up the game well so you have only yourselves to blame don't put people of who would like the game.overall solid 6/10 high replayability easy controls hard to master, look forward to more games like this very refreshing  "

												Sid Meier’s Starships is simple and to the point. It's a hex based strategy game focused around fleets of starships. Don't expect the moon, but what's here is pure and well developed. The mechanics are clear and intuitive, as with any Sid Meier creation. You use your fleet to garner influence with planets by either performing missions or taking shore leave there. The planets provide resources and can be upgraded in a few ways. Combat is turn based. Your ship's shields are weak in the back and strong in the front. Asteroid fields either block sight completely or reduce it. Weapons vary with long range lasers, short range cannons and torpedoes that cover a finite amount of space per turn. Researchable technologies are tied to specific ship systems and planetary wonders affect a given gameplay mechanic. It's streamlined down to a fault, but it's a fault they're not trying to hide from you. This is a $15 game made with tablets in mind as much as a PC. The games are quick in comparison to the ‘oh it’s dawn now’ syndrom that’s inherent to the Civilization franchise which is refreshing.I’ve only played two games with harmony so I haven’t played around with the other two affinities. The easy difficulty is extremely easy, so I’d recommend going hard or in the least normal. Though easy is a safe way to get a feel for the game. I’ve also only used a couple of the commanders, but their special bonuses seem balanced enough tied to the right playstyles.This is a good and purposely small game. It’s fun and quick and I really can’t say anything too negative about it. There’s no deception by Firaxis trying to build it up into something more than it is. But it’s inevitable that the game’s disinterest with being bigger than it is will bother a number of people. Thankfully it’s interested in what it is beyond the backlash.			"

												I want to start off by saying I gave this a good recomendation - but only just good.The game is fun - there's no doubting that; but there's something missing from the game.  It's too damn simple and the AI is ridiculous.  My first game was a test (didn't do the tutorial) and just started winging it.  I had no problem playing and the concept is easy to understand.Now my second game was kinda crazy.  I was a bit into it and suddely it's game over: the AI (I had only run into 2 of the AI players) won with a wonder victory.  No clue how it was over so fast... :(The graphics are great - the sound is fine - but there's something lacking and so far, I can't put my finger on it.  I really hope firaxis rebalances and puts more ... well, whatever it is that's missing that I can't just put my finger on... into it.The end result:  It's not civ v, it's not beyond earth.  It is fun, but it's just a lunch break game that you probably won't win most of the time (or so it seems)			"

												The game is simple, don't expect anything like civ, but i found it entertaining. It does have some strange errors, but I think it has something to do with the fact that it is made for many platforms and they have forgotten to focus on each of them. As the game is now, it feels more like a game for tablet in design. For eksample: there is no exit option, I simply think they forgot it. There is only borderless window for fullscreen, you can always see you desktop info bar. Theese things a sloppy design, but forgiveable. There could have been a better tutorial. The one in the game is more or less worthless, but when you figure it out, it is pretty straightforward. I think we will see some patches comming pretty soon.I like the game, and unlike many civ games it is over pretty fast. Some may like it (I actually do and i'm a big fan of the civ games) It is something you can do, when you have some time to spare. It has that boardgame / casual game feeling to it.It feels like they wanted it to be a DLC for ""Beyond Earth"" and decided, that it would not work. If that was the original plan, then I think it was a good idea to make it a standalone game.			"

												After reading some of the other recent posts about this game I have edited my review:This game is for casual gamers not for veterans of Galactic Civs or Sword of the Stars are anything remotely on that level. I am a little disappointed that some gamers compare epic games (that cost 60 USD) to this 15 dollar offshoot of Beyound Earth. If you are looking for a an hour to kill this could be for you. If you are looking for 3 hours to get lost in go Mod a copy of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.One hour in and counting:Pros:15 USD excellent value Starship customizationGraphics are solid Munition animationsGood Voice ActingIntelligent Diplomacy with aggressive AIPlanetary missions have a sense of urgency (if you wont help them a rival will and soon)Lots of detail without being overwhelmingVery Fluid Gameplay (not nearly as micromanaging as some 5x space strategy)Cons:Surprising hardware requirements (Less stable than Endless Space)Cannot Rename Planets or starships (There is a reason for this, planetary names are spoken aloud adding to voice acting quality)Limited scope compared to space strategy genreOverall: Excellent buy for 15 USD. Simple to enjoyable to those outside the genre. Detailed enough for regular strategy players. In summary: More than the sum of its parts			"

												Fun game but not very deep. If your looking for a Civ in space thats not this game. More a guilty pleasure game with great graphics and some stratedgy working the battle field. I played on the second easiest level and once I figured out how to play it wasn't much of a challenge so far. I love how you can customize the ships to what battle style you like but was a little peeved you can only have one fleet. Or did I miss something? The options for the planets seem daunting at first but on the level I played at you really didn't need to upgrade them much. Why upgrade them when you can just as easily and with a lot more fun take over a new planet? On my level, it seems that if you make peace with everyone but the people your fighting, you are good to go. I am currently third in ranking as far as the percentage I need to win but all I need to do is attack the ones ahead of me to correct that. I seem to have the strongest fleet quit by accident as I built it before I knew what I was doing. LOL.I give it two thumbs up if you accept the game for what it is. A fun short period of time killer thats great to look at and easy to win. On my level any way. I will bump up the level next time and see if it's much harder.			"

												Because bullet points are cool:---Advantages---+Simple, but not overly simple gameplay mechanics: Click and move. Click and shoot. Resources = fleet upgrades. Get more planets = get more resources = more ships and upgrades+A nice variety of starting customization+Lots of starship upgrades for those who are into that+Battles look cool+Buildable Wonders that grant additional tactical capabilities---Drawbacks----Really short-Poorly balanced: Let me elaborate on this one. Some wonders are just too overpowered. 2-non-attack-actions-per-turn wonder+Full-Fighter-Movement-On-Launch = Swarm all your enemies with fighters on turn 1-Really random at start: Every wonder have a few specified planets where it could be built, so you can get some nearly-useless wonders at your first planets on your first run, and the above-described combo on the next one. Some with missions, as some missions are easier than the others.-No multiplayer--------------------Overall, i have enjoyed the game because i love turn-based strategies and because i simply ADORE upgrading stuff.

												A like, with a but - so far it's thin, a bit buggy, etc. There's a fun game here, and an interesting board game style starship combat that I found really fun, but it may require patches, adjustments, etc.There's just not a lot to do here yet, but what there is to do I enjoy. So I'm going to give a tentative thumb to Sid Meyers enthusists, board game enthusists, Gotta have every starship people, and ""I buy every game collectors.""If you're wishywashy on it, wait and see how patching goes - Sid does a good job of steering into user issues and games often come out with low scores and end up masterpieces via udpates/freeLC (or sometimes DLC that later becomes free.)I'd like to see the team add more content, more story, fix some bugs and generally improve the title however - but the bones of a fun game for people who play these sorts of games exists here and the price of entry is fairly low.

												A good waste of time for a 10er but clearly made for tablets. Pros its quick to play unlike the vast majority of sid meiers games so suits quick sort games. It is far easyer to learn than other Sid Meier games which is both a good and a bad thing as with it comes a lack of really complex gameplay that people enjoy but at the same time people put of by complex gameplay might enjoy the simpler gameplay. Cons not much mileage interms of replayability in comparison to other Sid Meier games but at the same time its much less expencive at launch. The con that may kill this game on PC is the lack of multiplayer without it this game may just die off. Verdict decint spinoff but lack of multiplayer kills it.Buy in sale if you wanna kill a few hours.			"

												This game does not have as epic of a scope as the main CIV games do, but its still a very fun game to play.  Its very simple and it took only a couple turns into it before I could get all of the mechanics.  The game goes by quick, but if you like strategic combat, this game does pretty well.  Everytime you build a ship, you start with the same template, but the amount of customization you can put into it can lead you to some really interesting tactics in space battles.If you were hoping for a 4x with a lot of empire managment, dont get this game.  The game revolves almost solely on space battles.  But if you love intense strategic turn-based combat, you will enjoy it.The only real things I would change about the game is:1) Allow fullscreen. (You can maximize the window, but that doesnt really count)2) Subtract $5 from the price.Despite these two things, its worth trying out if you dont mind spending $15 on it.  Just dont expect to be spending hours on it in one sitting.			"

												Starships is simply brilliant.  The game is tightly focused on the tactical missions, which is the whole point. The strategic layer is intentionally light to keep most of the playtime in the battles, where it belongs.The missions and ship configurations are varied enough to keep the game interesting through many iterations.Starships is short.  A standard map game can be finished in a few hours, even a huge map game will take a tiny fraction of the time needed to play Civilization. Short is good. I love Civilization, but I can count one hand the number of games of Civ5 I've actually been able to finish in the last two years. And more often than not  Civilization ends with a grinding game of attrition or acumulation of culture points that is simply not that much fun. The strategic game in Starships does a good job of avoiding this kind of slog. The action in Starships builds steadily throughout the game until a satisfying climax in a decisive big fleet battle (at least in my games so far.)There is no multiplayer. This is also a good thing. If you really want a multiplayer online TBS game with both a strategic/political level and a tactical battleboard, then IMHO you really, really have way to much time on your hands and need to get a life. I strongly recommend Starships.I do have two minor quibbles. First, players cannot rename their ships (or I haven't yet figured out how.) Second, the game could use an empire management screen/table to make it easier to find and develop your planets on the larger maps.			"

												I like the concept. It's a simple, bit-sized game that can be finished in a couple hours. My main gripe is that the game seems unbalanced. Taking a capital converts that entire civ to your side, so big swings are inevitable. It's also pretty easy to spam fighters and destroyers, which makes combat a cakewalk. Speed runs should be interesting :)Overall, fun but I'd like to see what they do with a couple of patches.			"

												I have owened every Sid Meier game made.  I am a fan.  I am a Civilization Fan as well.   I am also a turn based fan in general.  That said I haven't been near the fan of Civ: BE as prior Civ games, and was a disappointed with it.  That said when I heard about Starships I was interested though I didn't jump on it like I would normally have done.  That said when GMG offered a great sale on the game for just over $10 prior to release I went ahead and figured what the heck and picked the game up.   First off I do believe that Starships was going to be an expansion or even part of Beyond Earth.  Does it feel like a AAA game?  No, but then again it is not selling at AAA prices.   Does the fact that it is tablet friendly make it less of a fun game? No I don't think so.   Is the game complex?  No, but it is fun for when you want to kick back and just have a relaxed turn based game. I know that the game is getting mixed reviews, however I haven't seen any bugs in the game, and have enjoyed it for the small amount of time I have been playing it so far.  Is it ground breaking?  Not  in the least.  But for even the asking price I have hundreds of games that I paid double the price for and found far less entertaining.  The game isn't something I see myself playing every day.  To me it is going to be one of those games that I turn to when I am watching TV and have other distractions yet want something to do when I don't feel like forwarding through commericals.  That said if you like space games, and like Turn Based games, I personally feel the game is worth the money as is.			"

												Here are my first impressions:+The gameplay and everything concerning it that I've played thusfar (ship building, combat, quests, etc.) is spot-on and very enjoyable. Hard is hard as it should be so I've got some work ahead of me which pleases me (I was worried it'd be too easy.)=I can read most of the font if I downsize my resolution or squint. That's very important but only to me.-The user interface and options as a whole are downright terrible. If I hadn't been told in countless videos that this was developed for PC first, I would have thought it was an IPad game first. No fullscreen, no WASD panning, no edge-scrolling, no remappable keys, and I could go on and on. Also the ""turn ship"" system is wonky.As it sits RIGHT NOW, I rate the game a ""good"" out of ""ADOM-levels of awesome!""If the UI issues get fixed, this looks to be upgraded to a solid ""great."" If there are new features added (more quests, longer gameplay options, etc.) alongside the UI fixes, this game could go all the way to ""Played Once A Day.""			"

												For what it is, this is a decent little game. The combat has a surprising amount of nuance for the simplicity of the rules, and the visual effects, while being light enough for older systems, are nicely pretty.The range of starting options also means that there's a lot of different approaches in the game, different starting conditions that you can control - as well as all the random variation that you can't control.It's not a civ game, it's not MOO-like (or GalCiv-like, or SotS-like) - it's all about the adventure and tactical combat, with some light 4X-like elements to tie it all together.And I'm having a lot of fun with it. There are some rough edges, like the lack of an 'exit game' control on the main menu, and no true-fullscreen (only fullscreen window, and that isn'r borderless), but then it's not a game to play for hours and hours on end, but 20-60 minutes here and there.But I'm also going to have to go back to BE to get as much as I can out of it - some minor content elements are locked until you do something in BE to unlock them.

Classic will not be borderless.Still not worth the price. Wait for a sale and grab it for at least 50% off. Not much to see here at all really. If only it had been a full blown Civilization Starships 4X starting off where Beyond Earth ends. You could pickup Endless Space for around the same price or even less and have a much bigger more complete epic tbs 4x instead of this tablet crap. The cross game connection is so lame I regret the changes by Firaxis as I have to look a a giant 2K button on the main menu of Beyond Earth.So not impressed with Firaxis right now... I'm ashamed I actually pre-ordered this game. I thought it would be much much better even if it was lite on content. Last game I pre-order with Sids name on it. If you want to release shovelware so be it. I know he has some pull at Firaxis but come on this game is just not that good.			"

												 This is one of those games I keep coming back to.  Think of this game more along the lines of a computer based board game in line with Risk and Settlers of Catan.  It is more casual than intense.  I am an avid Civ player and play other 3X games.  If you read any of Sid Meir's notes he did not intend for this game to be an intense massive tech tree brain melting game. This is part turn based strategy part RTS. I can walk away from the game then come back after months of not playing.  I am a pretty big fan of this game.  Is it CIV no, but it is just plain fun to play without all the overlly how did i do that before strategy games. If you want a fun game you can just jump into that has good strategy this is it.  You don't have to spend hours learning a tutorial.			"

												I bought this game as a stand alone game and started very excited about it. The idea is great and it plays nicely. But now comes the BUT, as nice as the gameplay is, it is missing in depth action. I would prefer more the possibility to do more than just fly around fight a bit and maybe increase the output of a planets ressources. In general it sounds nice and it coud be, but it is too easy. There is no real strategy needed to win.Still I do give it thumbs up, as you can play it as a casual game and if you don't expect Sid Meier in depth strategy, it is worthwhile.			"

												I'm sorry to say that Sid Maier's Starships is a missed opportunity. the game it's ok, simple, clean, nice, and some times even funny, ok for 7.49 USD (not 14.99), but the amount of bugs and the continuos crashes, takes away that little bit that was in the game.Major crashes:-after a long session it just close, totally, like an alt+f4, no error reports.-When you win or lose, the game crash, then you have to force the process shutdown.-many audio bugs, like very loud sounds when the enemy use the radar ability.-others random bugs with the camera when you destroy an enemy ship.

												Meh. Not worth it.I saw Sid Meier on the title, and thought to myself: ""A cheap sid Meier Game? Maybe it will be like Pirates; simple but tons of fun..."" The simple part was accurate.Over all, it attemps to be a 4X game, but the resources are interchangable and may as well be labeled A, B, C and D for all they affect game play. Combat isn't too bad, but once you get the hang for the mechanics, the strategy is straightforward, and the A.I. acts erratically, sometimes running from you when they should charge in. Also, you know those ships you blew up last turn? they will attack the same system again, and you will have to fight the exact. same. battle. with the exact. same. ships. over... and over again. The only way to break that monotony is to destroy the A.I.s homeworld, and poof! all their planets are belong to you. Did I mention you only get one fleet? it's ok though, because it somehow manages to cover the entire galaxy (through a re-enforcement mechanic, but still"".The ""wonders"" you can build have no back story/picture/etc. you just click build, and poof! it's built? You don't actually see anything happen, so it's kind of an assumption. This is kind of a theme, as the races/leaders/affinities are identical aside from pittance starting bonuses.

												There is a lot of hate on for this game, which is unfortunate. It's my favorite game, if you can believe it. Everyone has different tastes. I love Civ, my old favorites used to be Homeworld and C&C. This is my go-to for ""spacing"" out in front of the tv and absent mindedly playing some strategy/tactics spaceship battles. This -isn't- a game you're going to play for hours at a time, completely losing yourself in. It's great for 45 minutes to pick up, have some fun, come back later. I really wish there were more games like this.			"

												I got this game in a bundle when I bought Beyond Earth and I've put off playing it for some time because there are a lot of negative reviews that make it out to be a terrible game. After having played it I have to say I enjoyed it. It is by no means Ci goes to space and if that is what you go into it expecting you will be dissapointed.However, what it is, is a nice casual space ship game with some empire control thrown in. Mostly the management comes from building cities, improvements, and wonders in the world in your federation as well as upgrading and buying your ships. The combat is fun, it's nothing ground breaking but still enjoyable and over all it is a game you can play in a short amount of time.For someone who enjoys spaceships and casual games this is something I find to be a lot of fun. I'd suggest if you see it onsale or you end up with it because you bought BE and it came bundled in give it a shot it you might enjoy it too.			"

												Recomended but not at full priceThe game its self is fairly fun but be mindful of your expectations.Think of this as a mobile friendly snack not a full on civ game or even a full on game of any type. Gameplay is simple, easy to pick up and prety easy to master to and thats not bad if you go at this thinking ... casual time sink in the civ beyond earth theme ... because thats what it is and that fills a nice nitch honistly. Thus far I have had 0 luck with any integration between civ beyond earth and starships but honistly I dont care about that aspect.Ship/Fleet building is very simple really its just a matter of adding more to your current set while technologies are simply making what you have a bit stronger/more efficent.Battles come in a handfull of flavors, kill everything, avoid death, and goaly e.g. keep enemy away from this. It fits well given the scope of the game; remimber its not a 4hr play session your getting out of it, think casual time sink.Visualy its expected, would be nice if the PC version had a bit more to it but honistly at this scale I would rather have more lore and story than eye candy. The lore is light I had hoped for a bit more there and that would have been a nice easy tie-in to the 'main game' if you will but its not a deal breaker.If we compare this to what I feel are similar games, not in play style but in purpose I would compare this to say Fallout Shelter. In that case it doesn't have as much to do as Fallout Shelter does, wont hold you as long likely but it does play faster and for a casual game thats a positive I think.Price point wise, I wouldn't recomend it at full price unless you just have spare cash laying about. That said I have paid that much for lesser games and been happy enough. Taking the purly numbers point of view I will likely play this game a few more hours and if we see any more expansions to the 'main game' it will likely see me return now and then. If I dont log another hour im getting about an hour of play for 3.33€ not bad but not as efficent other options out there.I would like to see more games like this, e.g. smaller more casual 'side dish' like games to our fav big games but not at the expence of the main product. They fit well in a buisy schedule, add a little extra to IPs your a fan of and if the devs can manage to keep the price point down and find interesting tie-ins to the main game then all the more better.Honistly I wouldn't want the game to become bigger or more involved, adding a bit more lore or what ever is appropreate for your IP fans to chew on in the main game it supports would be key I think. For civ (and me specificly) that would be a bit more detail on tech, history, etc. perhaps some screens or concept art I can find/unlock what have you. As for the gameplay its self I think its plenty deep and just right on the complexity side all be it a bit easy on the difficulty aspect for what it is.			"

												Before purchasing this game, I took the time to read reviews made by others, and nearly did not purchase it. I've been a fan of Sid Meier's games since the original Civilization, this and a sale price prompted me to make the acquisition of Starships. Boy, am I glad I made this purchase! It's Civ-like enough to make me happy, but at its core, Starships is a turn-based tactical combat simulator.I've read complaints that it doesn't play like Civ - which is good since it is not a Civ-type of game. It's distantly connected to Civilization Beyond Earth (which also worked for me because it inspired me to play that game again). That connection  primarily gave the designer's a ready-made universe so they did not have to spend time creating one. The designers also made cross-game connections - so playing one, can unlock items in the other.The Civ-like aspect comes from planets that you influence to join your federation. Think of a planet as if it were a city in a regular Civ game - it provides your basic resources; however, your resources are key to your success. The game does an excellent job of demonstrating the principle of scarcity - having one thing means not having something else. This drives your decisions regarding where to send your fleet of Starships and how to best allocate your resources. I found the simplicity of growing/managing your federation ample for this game's purpose. For those seeking a greater likeness to Civ, I can understand their disappointment, but need to point out that the game's name is Starships.Starships is about using your fleet of starships to explore and grow your federation - frequently this involves combat. As such, Starships shines as  more of a turn-based tactical combat sim, and it is on this basis that I recommend this game.Also, you can easily FINISH a game of Starships in one sitting - unlike most Civ games which require an investment in time to complete (at least the way I play them).If you enjoy learning through experience (i.e. trial and error) give the game a try and see what happens. The more you play it, the better your grasp on the game's mechanics. For those not interested in trial and error, I strongly recommend  reading through a guide. I found several on the Steam Community for Starships - one of which I forwarded to friends so that could take a peek at what Starships might have in store for them (Welcome to Starships: A Reference Guide by thecrazyscotsman).

												Essentially Civ in space. Not much of a plot but thats not really important. The ship combat is fun while forcing admirals to be aware of their ship's capabilities in often changing environments. Fighters, despite their alleged fragility are a bit overpowered if you have even just one carrier build. Same with torpedos (they're essentially nukes when you think about it). The diplomacy is simple and an effective tool to use on A.I. that don't know any better. Overall a fun game that would really benefit from even larger maps and mulitple fleets.			"

												Game seems unfinished. Interface is tiny at higher resolutions. Ship ""customizability"" is a joke. There's no incentive to specialize the ships.  Ships routes don't bother to avoid the wormholes, so if you try to move a ship towards the enemy it might fall into a hole and warp across the map. System descriptions don't always list the bonuses from the galaxy screen (things like +50 science). If you have wonders in the system and such, it seems to truncate some of that. You have to go into the ""build a city"" screen which substitutes as a detail view of the system.Not fun. Lots of basic UX problems. Lots of gameplay issues.			"

It's Sid Meier, putting his name on this game.It's supposed to be a sequel to Beyond Earth -which, despite all the flak it got, is a good game-.And it's♥♥♥♥♥♥Replay value is close to zero, connections to Beyond Earth are minimal, the difference in the ships (according to what path you choose) is merely aesthetic, and even then, there's only one class of ships, and you can't EVEN name your bloody ships. A good Beyond Earth game lasts 10 hours. This lasts at most one. And at the end of it, you're even disappointed.It's too easyIt's too shallowIt's too casual.Sid Meier lost his bloody mind on this one. Get it, sure. I'm not saying it's not a funny little game, but it's a LITTLE game, not worth the money it asks for.			"

												This is a great step the first decemt space-based combat simulator since Masters of orion. No one else has been able to come up with anything other than automated combat and combat cards. The game play is fairly weak, but totaly worth it for the combat simulator. Sid meier and the creator of Galactic Civilazation need to get together then they might have something.			"

												As far as turn-based strategy games go, Starships is okay. It isn't very complex, but it is an enjoyable little game. Sure, there are a lot better space-based conqure-the-planets-and-build-and-empire games out there, but if you don't want to spend a lot of time in the details of allocating planetary resources, managing planetary defenses, dealing with multiple fleets, yada, yada, yada... then this game is for you. Otherwise, it's a nice break from those other sorts of games.Positives:* Turn-based tactical combat is intuitive and rather straigh-forward* Building and customization of your fleet is straightforward* Resource development and trade isn't overly complex* Wonders add an interesting twist making resource allocation decisions interesting early on* Multiple ways to win* (Very) loose integration with Sid Meyer's Civilization: Beyond EarthNegatives:* Winning is a sudden surprise that ends the game... suddenly* Not a lot of depth to the game* AI in combat gets predictable after a few games* Not Steam Workshop compatible... All in all, its just a fun little game that's worth purchasing when it is on sale.			"

												Painfully mediocre.Ship designs and upgrades are bland.  There's no point in dealing in diplomacy and no strategy to war beyond beelining for your opponent's homeworld.  Actual combat is mostly decided by the paper-thin logistics layer, with victory going to who brings the most resources to the combat - unless the AI starts going around in circles for no reason.I've heard rumors that this was cut content from Beyond Earth.  Even given how painfully stark and sparse that game is, this deserved to stay on the cutting room floor.Also, getting the 2k games login integration to work has been a pain in my neck, so I can't even get the gimmicky back and forth between the two to work.

												I got this game in a bundle when I bought Beyond Earth and I've put off playing it for some time because there are a lot of negative reviews that make it out to be a terrible game. After having played it I have to say I enjoyed it. It is by no means Ci goes to space and if that is what you go into it expecting you will be dissapointed.However, what it is, is a nice casual space ship game with some empire control thrown in. Mostly the management comes from building cities, improvements, and wonders in the world in your federation as well as upgrading and buying your ships. The combat is fun, it's nothing ground breaking but still enjoyable and over all it is a game you can play in a short amount of time.For someone who enjoys spaceships and casual games this is something I find to be a lot of fun. I'd suggest if you see it onsale or you end up with it because you bought BE and it came bundled in give it a shot it you might enjoy it too.			"

												 This is one of those games I keep coming back to.  Think of this game more along the lines of a computer based board game in line with Risk and Settlers of Catan.  It is more casual than intense.  I am an avid Civ player and play other 3X games.  If you read any of Sid Meir's notes he did not intend for this game to be an intense massive tech tree brain melting game. This is part turn based strategy part RTS. I can walk away from the game then come back after months of not playing.  I am a pretty big fan of this game.  Is it CIV no, but it is just plain fun to play without all the overlly how did i do that before strategy games. If you want a fun game you can just jump into that has good strategy this is it.  You don't have to spend hours learning a tutorial.			"

												I'm sorry to say that Sid Maier's Starships is a missed opportunity. the game it's ok, simple, clean, nice, and some times even funny, ok for 7.49 USD (not 14.99), but the amount of bugs and the continuos crashes, takes away that little bit that was in the game.Major crashes:-after a long session it just close, totally, like an alt+f4, no error reports.-When you win or lose, the game crash, then you have to force the process shutdown.-many audio bugs, like very loud sounds when the enemy use the radar ability.-others random bugs with the camera when you destroy an enemy ship.

												I bought this game as a stand alone game and started very excited about it. The idea is great and it plays nicely. But now comes the BUT, as nice as the gameplay is, it is missing in depth action. I would prefer more the possibility to do more than just fly around fight a bit and maybe increase the output of a planets ressources. In general it sounds nice and it coud be, but it is too easy. There is no real strategy needed to win.Still I do give it thumbs up, as you can play it as a casual game and if you don't expect Sid Meier in depth strategy, it is worthwhile.			"

												It's a great little game. A joy to waste some hours on. While it's much much simpler than anything else I've tried with the Sid Meier name on it, it still is quite entertaining.While playing it feels like you've taken Master of Orion 2 and removed all the tedious parts. There's still a bit of micro management if you want to do really well, but for the most parts it's harmless. The game isn't perfect though. For instance, several achievements don't seem to trigger reliably. Also I wasn't able to load a savegame from beyond earth as indicated by one of said achievements. Then there's the slightly steep learning curve. You're not being told exactly what each victory condition entails. You'll simply notice, once you get there. And not to forget - the ai diplomacy is lacking. You can declare war and peace, that's about it. And peace has a time limit of only 1 turn, so every turn you can declare war and negotiate peace if you so desire. Anyway, despite it's shortcommings, I find it a rather enjoyable title. Especially since I found it on the internet for 7€ "

												As an avid gamer and an older redneck, I have always found Sid Meier's games to be great for hours of entertainment in each gaming session. So, when given the chance to purchase Beyond Earth in a discounted bundle with Starships, I jumped at the chance. Sometimes, you really do get what you pay for.Let's start with overall appearance. Starships uses some rather simplistic graphics, but is more than adequate for the type of gameplay intended. There is nothing overly special graphically speaking. Personally, I find how the camera follows the player's shots to the point of impact in space battles to be the most exciting part of the game from a graphic standpoint. And, yes, just as many players have pointed out, the overall appearance of the game gives the impression of something you would normally find designed for iOS, Android, or a tablet.Now, to game setup and user friendliness. Game setup is extremely simplistic in that you have just the most basic of choices. Options are nothing more than if you prefer a windowed screen and game volume. Setting up an actual game, again, you have VERY limited choices which barely covers the basic criteria for what a turn based strategy game should consist of. Map size, number of opponents, affinity(your chosen race's galactic outlook), player's race/leader, and victory conditions. The last being a subject of what has become quite a heated debate in many forums across the Net, but more on that in a moment. Let's break each of the previously mentioned choices down.The choice of map sizes range from the typical small map to what the game considers gigantic. The choices are fairly accurate to the stated size with gigantic being just a tad bit smaller than the name would imply. Just your basic ""how big of a game do you want to play?""Choice of number of opponents is rather self explanatory with 4 being default.Then we come to affinity as well as the player's choice of leader as the two choices are rather intertwined. There are three choices for affinity: Supremacy, Harmony, and Purity. If you are unfamiliar with Beyond Earth, affinity can be simply summed up as how the player has decided to approach the progression and evolution of the human race. Supremacy embraces technology giving way to augmentations and upgrades of the human existence. Harmony denotes a desire to be a productive and well balanced race among many in the Universe. Purity is a choice to maintain the normal progression of the human race while embracing those qualities that make a human, well...human. In the game, you choose one of the three affinities then choose your leader from the given options. No matter which affinity you choose, the same leaders are available. And as you can guess, the choice of affinity/leader each has their own particular pros and cons. Now we come to aspect of gameplay that has caused so much ""ruckus"" in so many forums across the Net: victory conditions. To start, the choice of victory conditions seems simple enough with each being what you would typically find in any strategy game be it real-time or turn-based. Choices like Domination(controlling the majority of the known galaxy) to Science along with familiar choices like Time, Population, and so on. Are you asking yourself ""so what's the the big deal"" yet? As it turns out, the choice of victory conditions ONLY applies to the human player and not any of the A.I. players in the game. Each A.I. player chooses it's own victory terms from the given choices. Example: A human player may choose Domination to which the player is required to decisively rule the majority of the galaxy whereas the A.I. player may choose the Wonder victory conditions which requires the A.I. player to complete a certain number of wonders to attain victory. The human player is not made privy to the A.I. player's choice of victory conditions. Now you can start to understand why this type of gameplay has been the source of much aggravation for many players. A human player can choose a strategy that requires a long term outlook such as the tried-and-true ""build up, build up, and attack"" only to lose the game a few dozen turns in due to the A.I. player building a quick ten wonders. When asked as to why gameplay is like this, the developers stated they wished to add a challenge. Challenge or insurmountable source of aggravation? You be the judge.Finally, the overall impression of Starships. The game really seems to be nothing more than a ""dumbed down"" and cloned version of Galactic Empires with certain aspects of Sins of a Solar Empire incorporated in. And I must say, a rather bad clone at that. Starships has it's moments, but no portion of the game really stands out. Gameplay is entertaining only for a short time then becomes repetitive. Graphics and sound are less than what many would consider average. The only positive Starships has is it's rather easy to use and simple User Interface. Between the victory conditions ""glitch"" and numerous reported bugs that seem to cause fatal crashes before gameplay even begins, Starships seems destined to boldly go where no game has gone before: making a negative stain on the otherwise legendary career of Sid Meier.Score:Using a 0 to 5 scoring system, I give this game 1.5. Wait for Starships to become a rather heavily discounted game before purchasing. And even then, don't part with more than $5 plus be ready for only a moment's entertainment.			"

												This game can be fun, but when you play a huge galaxy on the harder levels you will nearly always lose to a 'wonder' vicory. Despite setting victory conditions when you start the game, unlike other Sid games the AI completely ignores this setting. Do I recomend buying it? No, don't buy it unless you want to always rush a game. It can be quite fun but also extremly madding when you lose to a populaton or wonder victory, even when you control 50+% of the galaxy and have defeated your oponents fleet at every encounter. "

												This game's victory conditions are broken.You cannot change victory conditions even when you manually adjust it at the start of the game I have done several tests of this to be sure. I have picked science, domination, and population, and the AI still wins victory conditions that aren't selected. Usually the AI wonder victories because it's the dumbest way to win when you are losing everything else. You CANNOT play a long game because of this. Either I win by turn 20ish by wonder or lose to the AI by wonder. The AI can hold 8 planets and win by wonder even when it can't win a single space battle. It's a stupid AI too it just sits at home planet and upgrades wonders when the victory condition is domination or science, AND IT STILL WINS WONDER VICTORY WITHOUT WONDER CONDITION SELECTED !!!Wtf learn how to make a game where the most essential part HOW YOU WIN isn't broken as hell.

Until I watched AngryJoe's worst games of 2015 and found out it was a 2015 release.  The game is shallow, fun but gets old really fast.  It feels more like a polished Indie Game then I expected it to be, The hint things were up came when within 1 hour I'd written off a dozen achievements and hadn't progressed much in the game at all.This game needs double the content it offers right now; do not buy this outside of a sale or if you're reading this in Jan 2016, get it via the Humble Bundle website.As a note, I got this because it was inthe bundle; I was after Beyond Earth purely since it was on offer for $15.

												If you are a civ snob and have lots of time on your hands, this may not be your game. It is very quick compared to civ (4 hours instead of 4 days). It is way simpler than civ. So if you are looking for a civ game, go somewhere else. I really like this game. Sometimes you want to play a game that lasts weeks and requires a ton of thinking. Sometimes you want to play a game that takes a couple of hours and doesn’t require a ton of thought. That is this game. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of options (customize ships, planets, etc). But compared to huge stratagy games, it is a game you can kind of relax with. The graphics are awesome. The game looks, feels, and handles cool. If you want a quick space strategy game with a high end feel, you really can’t go wrong. While I can only handle so much time with a huge stratagy game (because I have a job and a life to live), I predict playing this game off and on over and over again when I get bored and just want a quick game to goof around with. I will get my $14.99 out of it and then some.			"

There are a few different factions as apposed to EaW's two* You can chose between three main races and a few different leaders each with different abilities* Only one fleet. Each ship is highly customizable. * The fleet has a few action points which regulates how much it can do in one turn* buying planetary upgrades, research or fleet upgrades can be done anytime in your turn, except when in battle* Turned based. The game is essentially turn based, both in the overview and in the space battles. * There are no ground battles. * A game can be completed in relatively short order. * More control on research In essence, a game can be finished in a few hours. It is interesting enough to keep you playing until the end. it should have a decent replayability value based on choice of starting race and leader.			"

												Well, after some prolonged and frustrating problems I eventually got this game to run, and I must say that as a Sid Meier linked game my expectations were high.  The man is a genius.  However, things had been tempered by reading some mixed reviews and the annoyance of actually getting it to run.When I got the game to play I found it to be pretty much what the reviews had described.  There are several levels of difficulty, 3 different player factions to choose from and each has I think 8 different leaders to choose from, and their skills have a direct impact on your play.The map is basic but pleasing on the eye.  Combat is simple, easy to learn and again fairly nice to watch.  The diplomacy is very limited, but seems to function as intended.However, and it's a big HOWEVER, all is not well in my spiral arms of space.  The gameplay is repetative, to the point were the desire to play ""just one more game"" eveporates fast.  This is a new experience for me with a Sid game.  Combat, at the heart of the game, is so basic it can be painful.  I have repeatedly seen the AI bring a fleet that should have had me struggling just to survive get crushed as it makes one moronic choice after another.  Another thing I can't say I like is that so far every time I conquer a homeworld of a rival I inherit their entire empire.  While that might work on a National lever (and I doubt even then), it seems a bit lame in this sort of game.  It also makes achieving an outright win over a mighty rival possible in 1 combat.  Wonders are fun, but get a powerful 1 early and your enemies are doomed.Fun? Yes.  Limited replayability?  Also yes.			"

												PositiveThis is a decent game for a mere $15. I'm sure with more money Sid could add a lot more features that folks might want, but he would have to charge more. And unfortunately all the kickstarter funding is apparently going into Star Citizen, a mere 72 million so far. It better be good. Anyway, I mostly liked the carry over bits between Civ Beyond Earth and SM Starships. Made me think of the data/choice carry over in Mass Effect. I expect more good things from Sid and the boys at Firaxis if they intend to use data carry-over in future developments.			"

												This game is far too easy for a Sid Meier game; and is simply generic as a stand alone game. Gameplay is simplifed to the extreme since all the buildings are available from the start, and are only used to supplement your resources which are plentiful to begin with. BTW if impossible mode was accurate, wouldn't your home planet blow up on turn one? :p			"

												This is very much the kind of game which either becomes a cult classic a few years down the line, or simply gets forgotten. It's not really anything like Civilisation at all, there's very little ""city"" (planet) management, and the research gameplay is relaxed to put it mildly. It's really just a turn-based-tactics spaceship battle game with some persistence elements.Those of you who are old enough, I'd like to take you on a brief journey through time. Back to when UFO: Enemy Unknown/XCOM: UFO Defense was new. Remember how the geoscape felt tacked on, like it was providing the minimum amount of glue to get you to the next battle? It's exactly the same here. Replace soldiers and aliens with space ships and, well, other space ships and you'd have something very close to Sid Meier's Starships. That sounds kind of like a compliment, doesn't it? Well, not entirely. The look and feel of the game would really sit quite well in the mid-late 90s (compare Total Annihilation), and frankly the pared-down Civ-like engine for outside of battle is less polished even than XCOM was in its day.In addition to that, and perhaps in some ways as a consequence, the difficulty seems to be miscalibrated. I put it on ""normal"" (from the default ""easy""??) for the first try at playing, and really got straight through to winning the game with pretty trivial ease - maybe 3 battles lost - and that's without ever learning half the interface or discovering where the last faction was. I'd speculate that players who have a reasonable sense of where to put there upgrade points would find it painfully easy on any but the higher difficulties.Thankfully, the actual turn-based battling is pretty enjoyable, and the ship customisation works well. Good for a pick-up-and-play, assuming that you have a couple of hours to spare, and perhaps a worthy antidote to too much Civ.			"

It is a great game in many regards, and I want to love it, but it feels too shallow.The graphics, sound and music are all fine. The gameplay too. You can explore, you can shoot enemy ships and upgrade your own. There is plenty of things to do and no shortage of depth in terms of amount of content.However, after playing the game for a few hours, I'm left with the feeling of ""this is it?"", in terms of gameplay.Sadly, it gets old really fast.

												I enjoy the simplicity and focus of this game, it's not exactly lacking unless you are comparing it to a more complex game such a Civ V.The biggest problem with the game is that large battles bog down in micro-management and protracted animations.  I tend to go do something else while waiting for the computer to move.The game needs a setting to disable battle annimations and hurry things up.  After playing 4 or 5 games, I'm done and simply tired of the tedium of watching the computer move.  After the novelty wears off, gameplay itself is a chore.			"

												Personally, I enjoy this game and have not been disappointed, as the price is reasonable for the content.   The game is exactly what I would have expected it to be, a small turn-based strategy game with a Beyond Earth feel.  It reminds me a bit of Distant Star: Revenant Fleet, albeit turn-based with a Beyond Earth flavor.  As I enjoy games such as Distant Star: Revenant Fleet, Infinite Space, and FTL, this game falls in line.  Those who are looking for a  deep storyline or an involved strategy game will almost certainly be disappointed.  That being said, those who enjoy sci-fi turn-based strategy that doesn't get overly involved might just find this one as enjoyable as I have.			"

												I've taken a good liking to Sid Meier's Starships. It's quickly become my go to game when I have just an hour to kill and don't want to get into something deep. I hope they make an iPad version of the game because I feel it's really suitable for those moments where I want to have some fun but don't want to be too engaged: for example a transpacific flight, on the train, or time sitting on the toilet. It's fun and to the point and not too repetative. While the documentation in the game is sparse at best it's easy to figure by giving it a quick go.It's best to think of Startships as being the ""Civ: Revolutions"" of Beyond Earth. 2k is very clear they see it as a casual title -- something that seems to be lost on the majority of the commentors. This is not a game you sit down and play for 8-12 hours straight and it's not meant to be nor is it priced as such. It fills the niche of a casual tactical strategey game to perfection. And that makes it a welcome addition to my Steam Library.			"

Starships feels lazily made with great ideas implemented only in the most basic ways. Game options are limited and glitches often make selected victory condition null. The ship upgrade options lead to the same result, by midgame even on Hard or impossible I was next to unstopable.This game has little stratagy and turns mean very little.I sadly wish I had not paid money for this ""demo"" of a game and do not recommend that anyone pay more then a couple bucks for it unless this money grab is made into a ""real game"".

												It’s a fun, almost “casual” game in the genre. It’s something that be played while waiting for an appointment or during a lunch break. But I can see where other people would decry this one. Most games like this are usually overbearing in its complexity, require a bit of micromanagement for everything, from upgrading colonies and structures, to specific types of research. But upgrades are a simple, one-button click and I love it. This game feels very intuitive. A playthrough or two and you’ve already gotten the gist and feel of it. The combat sections are fun, although the “odds of success” part can get iffy. I’ve completed missions where my chances of success were in the low 40’s. Again, intuitive; once you know of what does what and how they can be useful it all starts to fit together. Torpedoes are to force the enemy out of cover, or try and take them out long-range and en mass. Fighters are heavy-hitters but are fragile. Asteroids are for cover, and so on.  Downside: No ability to name your ships. Considering that you’re entire success depends on your fleet, I thought that was an oversight. That lack of basic-level customization I hope would be corrected in a future patch. I am hoping that this is a test platform of sorts for Firaxis: budget-level games, or just something that can be expanded later on with DLCs or something.   "

Diplomacy, what diplomacy? there is none, only neutral, peace and war, and peace can be broken in the same turn it started, so this is a complete fail.There are several other flaws with this game, i guess it was rushed so developers did not have enough time to finish this properly. i bought pre-order but it is not worth paying full price, if you still want it, then get it when on special.

												The game works perfect for me and I have a nothing special laptop .This is very tight design . I suggest playing it on at least hard an you will see there is no wasted turns , no mashing the next turn button . And yes you dont know the other players victory conditions - a time honored convention in many board games of which this game would be perfectly adaptable for . I also like that Starships skips the uninhabited world convention and instead each planet is populated and  will have immediate tactical and strategic advantages that you will need to win.The combat portion is well thought out too but I have to admit once I developed a tactical  doctrine of slow withdrawal and fighters to soak up hits the A.I. 's advance fragments around the asteroid fields where one can counter attack and destroy his navy in detail . I was able to defeat much larger forces where I was given a very unlikey chance of winning . But you can win the battle but lose the war which is what has been my fate so far . No wins yet and I like that .Some have made Starships sound like checkers but there is enough facets to the game play to keep me interested  and give  me that ""just  one more turn "" experience . I feel for those having crash issues as its always many dergrees  of unfun to purchase a game aand not be able to enjoy it but hopefully they will be fixed soon and then maybe a demo so people can see for themselves whether Starships is their thing .

It's like playing an early beta or even alpha game.  That's okay, but I don't like the idea of paying to play what is an unfinished and very unpolished game.  I'd love to get the final version, but call it what it is and perhaps we won't have our expications set so high.  I'm sorry, but at this point, I can't recommend this game.			"

												I seriously don't understand all the negative reviews for this game.  It works, it's serviceably pretty if not cutting edge, and it's easy to kill as much or as little time with it in a sitting as you like.  Sure it's not deep like Civ, nor does it have graphics that would melt your eyeball or a meta-game that would cramp your brain, but FFS, people, it was a paltry $15.  At that price point, what we get here is worth every penny.			"

												It's a fun enough game for what it is. But don't pay full price for it.Basically ask yourself: Is it $5?- If yes: buy- If no: don't buyMaybe they'll do more with it later, but it seems like this is pretty much it.The game is fun enough for what it is. What it is NOT unfortunately, is Civ In Space.Even the actual starships, the ostensible focus of the game, aren't particularly interesting. You get some buttons to push to make some aspects of the ships better in exchange for resources, or worse and get some of those resources back. The tactical combat actually IS interesting and requires that you think about what you're doing. Unfortunately there's a very real potential for you to just become an overpowered titan of the galaxy here and roll mindless over whatever your opponents throw at you. This can happen entirely by accident.There's no diplomacy to speak of. No meaningful relationships with other faction leaders. And no real way to negotiate for... anything really.The planets themselves are pretty boring, conveying some numerical advantages to you by existing. They're less like planets full of people and more like buildings in a strategy game. They're there to provide resources and some of them can house wonders. That's all.Overall, it's a fun game, but a barebones one. Don't pay full price for it.			"

												Starships starts out relatively fun - you can work your way up through the difficulty chain and the map size while trying out different factions and characters. However, after about 2 hours of play the game becomes extremely repetitive. I have played multiple missions at the highest difficulty with the largest map size and always win - gameplay just becomes a grind, really. I find that torpedoes are the weapon of choice, especially when combined with the wonder that allows 2 actions per turn and the wonder that cloaks torps.Graphics are simple but clean. Sound is good for what it is. The in-game movies for certain events (like firing torps) gets old because it wastes time. The game is very stable - has not crashed at all.The real problem with the game is as I stated in the first paragraph - it is an easy game. It is also simple (not complex), which is a good thing, but the ease of the game means that there is no real replay value. All your games will pretty much be the same, and therefore become more of a grind than a fun experience.Rating 7/10 (8/10 initially, 4/10 later on)			"

												Game seems unfinished. Interface is tiny at higher resolutions. Ship ""customizability"" is a joke. There's no incentive to specialize the ships.  Ships routes don't bother to avoid the wormholes, so if you try to move a ship towards the enemy it might fall into a hole and warp across the map. System descriptions don't always list the bonuses from the galaxy screen (things like +50 science). If you have wonders in the system and such, it seems to truncate some of that. You have to go into the ""build a city"" screen which substitutes as a detail view of the system.Not fun. Lots of basic UX problems. Lots of gameplay issues.			"

												So I sat in on a Panel for Starships before it came out and they showed off some of the game and Sir Meier was there and he was like, ""Yo, a couple of the dudes at the company made this in their spare time and I liked it so much that I'm producing it."" And that's actually the most accurate way I can think to describe this.  The game has a lot of promise but lacks the usual polish that a Sid Meier game would have.I'd rate this game at $5-7.			"

To those people: You do realize that the game's price is about equivalent to what DLC of equivalent ""value"" by current trends would have been, right? Look at it this way, you now get that DLC, and a decent mini-game to go with it when you get Starships.			"

												Some cool ideas in here, but in the end it's really tedious. I'm no snob, I loved CivRev and Ace Patrol is pretty cool. The combat gets repetative and the presence of Fighters just makes everything take longer. If I could mod fighters out of the game, I might try playing it again. The most fun I had in the game was the early portion of the game, before you run into other factions. Strategically picking which planets to help and what upgrades to make is fun.			"

												This game isn't bad, it's just half-cooked - at least that's my opinion. Lacking a decent tutorial my first attempts were a little confusing, but the game itself is rather easy to play. It's basically: buy plants, cities and improvements - upgrade your ships with money and through science - attack and help other planets. Rinse and repeat! That's the whole game. I miss a lot of depth of this game and honestly, a little more gameplay and diversity.Another thing that bugs me are the missing options - whether it is an option to change game settings, graphic settings or even key bin certain actions. The options menu consists of some audio sliders and a full-screen option. That's it.I would really love to recommend this game as I like the actual concept and look, but it's missing a lot of depth and probably not really worth your money.			"

												Well, after some prolonged and frustrating problems I eventually got this game to run, and I must say that as a Sid Meier linked game my expectations were high.  The man is a genius.  However, things had been tempered by reading some mixed reviews and the annoyance of actually getting it to run.When I got the game to play I found it to be pretty much what the reviews had described.  There are several levels of difficulty, 3 different player factions to choose from and each has I think 8 different leaders to choose from, and their skills have a direct impact on your play.The map is basic but pleasing on the eye.  Combat is simple, easy to learn and again fairly nice to watch.  The diplomacy is very limited, but seems to function as intended.However, and it's a big HOWEVER, all is not well in my spiral arms of space.  The gameplay is repetative, to the point were the desire to play ""just one more game"" eveporates fast.  This is a new experience for me with a Sid game.  Combat, at the heart of the game, is so basic it can be painful.  I have repeatedly seen the AI bring a fleet that should have had me struggling just to survive get crushed as it makes one moronic choice after another.  Another thing I can't say I like is that so far every time I conquer a homeworld of a rival I inherit their entire empire.  While that might work on a National lever (and I doubt even then), it seems a bit lame in this sort of game.  It also makes achieving an outright win over a mighty rival possible in 1 combat.  Wonders are fun, but get a powerful 1 early and your enemies are doomed.Fun? Yes.  Limited replayability?  Also yes.			"

I've put in under 38 hours and have completed about 5 games in different combinations of gameplay variables (3 different classes, 8 different leaders, and 4 different galaxy sizes).  This game is a turn-based, sci-fi/ space, strategy game.  And although the graphics are quite old school, the price of around $15 or less if it's on sale... It's more like the futuristic Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire than the very disappointing Sid Meier's Beyond Earth (BE).			"

												As a big fan of the Civilization series I had high expectations for Starships & hoped it would emulate the same fundamental style of gameplay as other games in the franchise. Sadly the finished product feels like a rushed attempt at trying to create something that could have been great but falls short in so many way and ultimately feels like a Civilization: Beyond Earth mini-game.The game revolves around conquering planets with a single fleet of starships & engaging in repetitive battles that feature an uninspiring AI that can be easily defeated once you (quickly) discover a simple formulae for defeating opponents (You can quite easily hide your ships in cover and cripple the enemy with waves of torpedoes & fighters).I don’t explicitly dislike Starships, however, there is very little replay value and almost no scope for variety in terms of how you play the game, due to the almost identical factions and simplistic victory conditions (I’ve found myself winning a population victory by accident on several occasions).Although the game isn’t anywhere near as engaging as I hoped, it does have good touch support and is a pleasant enough game to play on a tablet when on the move or sitting in bed. As much as I hate taking the price into consideration, as I would have much rather paid three times as much for a far deeper experience, I do think that it’s a decent enough arcade game for killing time in short bursts.In summary I’m going to (only just) recommend Starships based purely on the fact that it’s a cheap and cheerful game to pass an hour or so here-and-there, just don’t expect the same engaging experience that you might expect from other games in the franchise.

												This is a mobile game being masqueraded as a PC game. It's extremely simplified and lacks any real depth. The games only options are by increasing the ticks in your weapons and by adding more ships. The planets have ticks as well that give more resources and a unique ability. Combat is grid-based, with asteroids offering cover an unknown amount of cover, you won't know until you fire on an enemy - visual clues are limited to greater or lesser. I'd expect this to be a game for no more than a dollar or two with banner adds. The price point doesn't match the game play.Once upon a time if a game supported the ""Sid Meier's"" prefix I would preorder it in a heartbeat (and that was one of the few auto preorders for me), but lately Firaxis has been releasing games that don't have anything new or substantial in the games they develop. This was the game that stopped that for me, friends have been telling me I shouldn't preorder games anyway - this is the proof in that pudding.			"

												It could really use multiplayer (with some serious balance work) and continue after victory. Overall I'm pretty pleased, I think it fills it's niche very well. Most of the critics seem to expect a full AAA $60 game experience for $15 and that just isn't fair. I think this game would be better thought of, and later expanded upon, the way so many great tabletop games have a core module with a ton of add ons. Catan does it, Dominion does it, Arkham does it, Warhammer sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥does the hell out of it.If possible, a little more depth and diversity would be nice, but I'd be perfectly happy with this becoming a platform for DLC or open it up for modders on the PC. Adding an endgame alien invasion mechanic would be awesome; you've united the galaxy under your banner, now lead it! Or add a ground combat miniscenario in a DLC pack. Rig one of your capital ships as a troop carrying drop ship they way you currently can have a fighter centered carrier. Maybe they can launch boarding parties to capture vessels? Bringing in something like the crew specialists from Pirates! is something I think would be really cool, too.I'm sure almost all of this is just wishful thinking, but I think it is a testament to a really great game that it inspires all kinds of ways it could (realistically) expand and be even better.

												Starships is legit, old school Sid Meier.  He programmed the game, did it his way, and it feels like Civ 1 with X-Com style combat (using asteroids as cover).  I've only played it on easy, and it is as easy as a game of Civ on Settler difficulty.$15?  I wouldn't pay that for this game (sorry Sid).  It's solo player and seems to have relatively little to do for a video game.  I recommend trying out a demo if you can, or watching gameplay on YouTube, but get it at a discount; don't spend more than $6 on it.  I was fortunate to get it bundled with Beyond Earth for $27, when Beyond Earth was on sale for $25, so it's like I spent $2 on this game and it was worth it.			"

												I dig it, but of course, I bought it in a Beyond Earth/Starships bundle when both were also being offered on a Steam sale, so I paid $27 for both titles total.  Since BE runs $25 during a normal Steam sale, I ended up paying $2 for Starships - for $2, this game is AMAZING.  It's light...nothing at all like Civ or BE.  To me, to give a perspective/description to what the game feels like or what you should expect, you have to start with a baseline - for me, that's Civ 5 with all the DLCs/expansion packs.  If you start there, Civ 5 gives you tons of options and playstyles...then you simplify when you move to BE where you have a fairly young game with fewer options that still feels more or less like Civ 5 without any of the major DLC packs...then you move to something like ""Pandora: First Contact"" - a Civ-style 4x game that almost completely focuses on battles, and as such, has a lot of upgrade options for units, lots of unit variety, lots of fun attack graphics, but offers little in the way of multiple play styles...then finally, you get to Starships - a game that is *JUST* fighting.  Think of it as ""Risk - Beyond Earth"" or ""Axis and Allies: year 3400AD Edition"".  It's totally not a 4x game - it's just about claiming land, kicking spaceship♥♥♥♥♥ and buying new upgrades.  I think the game normally runs around $10, and by my math, I figure that I'm willing to spend roughly $0.50-$1/hour for a good game.  Well, since I spent $2 and have played for about 50 hours, I spent about a nickel per hour on this game.  I can live with that.  Even at $10, that'd still be less than a quater/hour.  Synopsis - if you want to shoot things in space, go for it.  If you want to play Civ 5, go do that instead.  If you want Civ 5 super space edition, wait another 2 years for Firaxis to release 2-3 BE DLC's and then buy it on a Steam sale.			"

												Personally, I enjoy this game and have not been disappointed, as the price is reasonable for the content.   The game is exactly what I would have expected it to be, a small turn-based strategy game with a Beyond Earth feel.  It reminds me a bit of Distant Star: Revenant Fleet, albeit turn-based with a Beyond Earth flavor.  As I enjoy games such as Distant Star: Revenant Fleet, Infinite Space, and FTL, this game falls in line.  Those who are looking for a  deep storyline or an involved strategy game will almost certainly be disappointed.  That being said, those who enjoy sci-fi turn-based strategy that doesn't get overly involved might just find this one as enjoyable as I have.			"

												I've taken a good liking to Sid Meier's Starships. It's quickly become my go to game when I have just an hour to kill and don't want to get into something deep. I hope they make an iPad version of the game because I feel it's really suitable for those moments where I want to have some fun but don't want to be too engaged: for example a transpacific flight, on the train, or time sitting on the toilet. It's fun and to the point and not too repetative. While the documentation in the game is sparse at best it's easy to figure by giving it a quick go.It's best to think of Startships as being the ""Civ: Revolutions"" of Beyond Earth. 2k is very clear they see it as a casual title -- something that seems to be lost on the majority of the commentors. This is not a game you sit down and play for 8-12 hours straight and it's not meant to be nor is it priced as such. It fills the niche of a casual tactical strategey game to perfection. And that makes it a welcome addition to my Steam Library.			"

												I love Sid  games, this is a sad showing even compaired to B.E. which was enjoyable but essentially Civ 5... Starships feels lazily made with great ideas implemented only in the most basic ways. Game options are limited and glitches often make selected victory condition null. The ship upgrade options lead to the same result, by midgame even on Hard or impossible I was next to unstopable.This game has little stratagy and turns mean very little.I sadly wish I had not paid money for this ""demo"" of a game and do not recommend that anyone pay more then a couple bucks for it unless this money grab is made into a ""real game"".

												It’s a fun, almost “casual” game in the genre. It’s something that be played while waiting for an appointment or during a lunch break. But I can see where other people would decry this one. Most games like this are usually overbearing in its complexity, require a bit of micromanagement for everything, from upgrading colonies and structures, to specific types of research. But upgrades are a simple, one-button click and I love it. This game feels very intuitive. A playthrough or two and you’ve already gotten the gist and feel of it. The combat sections are fun, although the “odds of success” part can get iffy. I’ve completed missions where my chances of success were in the low 40’s. Again, intuitive; once you know of what does what and how they can be useful it all starts to fit together. Torpedoes are to force the enemy out of cover, or try and take them out long-range and en mass. Fighters are heavy-hitters but are fragile. Asteroids are for cover, and so on.  Downside: No ability to name your ships. Considering that you’re entire success depends on your fleet, I thought that was an oversight. That lack of basic-level customization I hope would be corrected in a future patch. I am hoping that this is a test platform of sorts for Firaxis: budget-level games, or just something that can be expanded later on with DLCs or something.   "

												Bottom-line up front: I'd give this a solid 1.5 out of 10. This is an expensive version of a free Facebook game... read more to find out why. I REALLY wanted to like this game. From the pre-order description, and the fact that Sid Meier does an amazing job with about 95% of the games that they produce, this had a ton of potential.Branded as a 4x game that related to Beyond Earth, I was a bit hopeful to see something that played like Master of Orion 2 and had the space-ground gameplay of Star Commander. Alas, I got my hopes up too high.Also, before you go too much farther with this, just know that I haven't read the other reviews. This is my own take on this game.Everything from the tech, to the resources, (lack of) diplomacy, (generic) space combat, and AI feels flat.TECH: The tech ""tree"" is just a menu of upgrade. There are no new capabilities to introduce and no real choices that force you to examine tradeoffs and benefits. After playing BE, you'll likely be especially let down because NONE of that innovation exists in this game.RESOURCES: Four resources, and four very narrow things to do with them. Like most campy Facebook games, using your resources requires no more thought than a button click.DIPLOMACY: My main complaint with most Civ games is that you have options that the AI will not accept... in this case, you don't even have those options. Your two basic negotiating stances are a) war, or b) peace. Given the combat, neither has any particular advantages.COMBAT: This is probably the only (slightly) redeeming part of this game. For about the first 20 turns, the combat and the missions are challenging. Once you've pumped enough resources into your ships, you can pretty well steamroll the AI with impunity.Oh yes, the ship customization (and the reason why I was excited about this game)... yawn. Again, like the tech tree, the characteristics of each of your ships can be leveled up to attain greater advantage. There is no researching of new ship hulls, engines, weapons, or shields; just leveling. Facebook flash games have more options than this... such as Battle Pirates.Final thing that I'll say on combat is this: one fleet? If SM was trying a new twist on 4x games to limit player to one fleet and up the challenge, this was a terrible choice. Any potential challenge is wasted because they let you construct warp gates so that you do not use up movement points while moving between your own worlds.AI: Now for the AI. Like the rest of the game, the AI is stale and offers no challenge. In three different play throughs of the game (each at increasing difficulty), I have as yet to have an AI player declare war on me or attack me. I can roam the galaxy with my large armada of heavily armed ships and tear through pretty much every other empire with little effort.What could have been a stellar game (see what I did there?) is really just a black hole for your wallet (even at $13 - as of this writing).Save your money. Save your time. Don't save this galaxy (or SM's bottom line).			"

												Starships is a decent game.  The game UI could definitely use some polish/PC-specific tweaks.  But it's a good concept, distills the 4x genre down to a tighter core, with some interesting tactical elements.  You won't have massive space battles, and you're managing a single (small) fleet, but it's got a nice ""crew fatigue"" mechanic that allows multiple battles per ""turn"".  The tech tree too, is boiled down to it's barest essence, amounting to generic upgrades of wide areas of tech: ""Better lasers"", ""better engines"", etc.  The planet management too, is down to the essence: ""Add city"", ""add more mines"", ""add more research stations""...It's fun, in a casual-strategy-game kinda way.If you're looking for something with a lot of depth, this isn't it.  But if you can get it cheap, and you want something that won't tax your brain too hard, this can be fun for a couple hours at a shot.			"

												Hello!I will have to say I went into this game not at launch but waited until a little while ago to buy it, So I was aware from reviews on here and elsewhere what sort of game I was getting into. An IPad app game and is very light for a Sid Meier’s game. Knowing this I got the game anyways just because I was drawn in by the story and the general idea of the game itself.This being said I can’t say this game ""suck"" because it’s not a Sid Meier’s game or because I didn’t know what I was getting into. It is however my opinion this is a good app game however while playing it, the game left me wanting more of pretty much everything, more depth in diplomacy, more depth in federation building, larger universes, more than one fleet, and generally wanting this to be a full game with combat left as it is currently.So I like the combat system, I like how ships upgrade, I like how planets upgrade, I like the overall art style. However even with all that I am left just wanting more of a meal out of this snack sized game. So at a hefty 15$ which is extremely high for apps but very low for full games I can’t recommend this to anyone without quite a bit of fore warning.This is a snack sized game so in about an hour you will see pretty much all it has to offer and be left wanting more of a full meal out of such an awesome set of Ingredients.

												At this time (April 13, 2015), I cant really recommend this game. The game is fun, and casual play friendly. The main issue I am currently running  into is that the AI will not adhere to the victory condition that the player chooses. For example: I set the victory condition to Domination, and while playing the game I lose becuase the AI won by Population or building the most Wonders. This is frustrating to say the least. The game also suffers from very limited choice of Race/ship design. No real customization.I would give the game a 5/10 as it does have a good base to work with.			"

Anyway, I mostly liked the carry over bits between Civ Beyond Earth and SM Starships. Made me think of the data/choice carry over in Mass Effect.

												As an avid gamer and an older redneck, I have always found Sid Meier's games to be great for hours of entertainment in each gaming session. So, when given the chance to purchase Beyond Earth in a discounted bundle with Starships, I jumped at the chance. Sometimes, you really do get what you pay for.Let's start with overall appearance. Starships uses some rather simplistic graphics, but is more than adequate for the type of gameplay intended. There is nothing overly special graphically speaking. Personally, I find how the camera follows the player's shots to the point of impact in space battles to be the most exciting part of the game from a graphic standpoint. And, yes, just as many players have pointed out, the overall appearance of the game gives the impression of something you would normally find designed for iOS, Android, or a tablet.Now, to game setup and user friendliness. Game setup is extremely simplistic in that you have just the most basic of choices. Options are nothing more than if you prefer a windowed screen and game volume. Setting up an actual game, again, you have VERY limited choices which barely covers the basic criteria for what a turn based strategy game should consist of. Map size, number of opponents, affinity(your chosen race's galactic outlook), player's race/leader, and victory conditions. The last being a subject of what has become quite a heated debate in many forums across the Net, but more on that in a moment. Let's break each of the previously mentioned choices down.The choice of map sizes range from the typical small map to what the game considers gigantic. The choices are fairly accurate to the stated size with gigantic being just a tad bit smaller than the name would imply. Just your basic ""how big of a game do you want to play?""Choice of number of opponents is rather self explanatory with 4 being default.Then we come to affinity as well as the player's choice of leader as the two choices are rather intertwined. There are three choices for affinity: Supremacy, Harmony, and Purity. If you are unfamiliar with Beyond Earth, affinity can be simply summed up as how the player has decided to approach the progression and evolution of the human race. Supremacy embraces technology giving way to augmentations and upgrades of the human existence. Harmony denotes a desire to be a productive and well balanced race among many in the Universe. Purity is a choice to maintain the normal progression of the human race while embracing those qualities that make a human, well...human. In the game, you choose one of the three affinities then choose your leader from the given options. No matter which affinity you choose, the same leaders are available. And as you can guess, the choice of affinity/leader each has their own particular pros and cons. Now we come to aspect of gameplay that has caused so much ""ruckus"" in so many forums across the Net: victory conditions. To start, the choice of victory conditions seems simple enough with each being what you would typically find in any strategy game be it real-time or turn-based. Choices like Domination(controlling the majority of the known galaxy) to Science along with familiar choices like Time, Population, and so on. Are you asking yourself ""so what's the the big deal"" yet? As it turns out, the choice of victory conditions ONLY applies to the human player and not any of the A.I. players in the game. Each A.I. player chooses it's own victory terms from the given choices. Example: A human player may choose Domination to which the player is required to decisively rule the majority of the galaxy whereas the A.I. player may choose the Wonder victory conditions which requires the A.I. player to complete a certain number of wonders to attain victory. The human player is not made privy to the A.I. player's choice of victory conditions. Now you can start to understand why this type of gameplay has been the source of much aggravation for many players. A human player can choose a strategy that requires a long term outlook such as the tried-and-true ""build up, build up, and attack"" only to lose the game a few dozen turns in due to the A.I. player building a quick ten wonders. When asked as to why gameplay is like this, the developers stated they wished to add a challenge. Challenge or insurmountable source of aggravation? You be the judge.Finally, the overall impression of Starships. The game really seems to be nothing more than a ""dumbed down"" and cloned version of Galactic Empires with certain aspects of Sins of a Solar Empire incorporated in. And I must say, a rather bad clone at that. Starships has it's moments, but no portion of the game really stands out. Gameplay is entertaining only for a short time then becomes repetitive. Graphics and sound are less than what many would consider average. The only positive Starships has is it's rather easy to use and simple User Interface. Between the victory conditions ""glitch"" and numerous reported bugs that seem to cause fatal crashes before gameplay even begins, Starships seems destined to boldly go where no game has gone before: making a negative stain on the otherwise legendary career of Sid Meier.Score:Using a 0 to 5 scoring system, I give this game 1.5. Wait for Starships to become a rather heavily discounted game before purchasing. And even then, don't part with more than $5 plus be ready for only a moment's entertainment.			"

												This game can be fun, but when you play a huge galaxy on the harder levels you will nearly always lose to a 'wonder' vicory. Despite setting victory conditions when you start the game, unlike other Sid games the AI completely ignores this setting. Do I recomend buying it? No, don't buy it unless you want to always rush a game. It can be quite fun but also extremly madding when you lose to a populaton or wonder victory, even when you control 50+% of the galaxy and have defeated your oponents fleet at every encounter. "

												I love Sid Meier's games, always have. But this is, by far, the worst of the bunch. They should have either done it right, or not done it at all. Sure, it's only $15. But it doesn't match the playability of a lot of $15 games out there. Even only playing it for a couple of hours, it's clear there isn't much there there.			"

												A basic tactics game with no true customization. Your faction determines the apperance of your ship. You cannot name your ship or even the faction that you play as. With the exception of domination the other victory conditions are vague. It does not tell you how many wonder, technology upgrades, or amount of population. It is oddly addictive and may simply be because of the simplistic tactics. In the end it is a game made for your Iphone and not your computer. Feels like this was a project handed over to some interns to prove they are competant. It is a good game, simply basic.That being said if you are looking for a laid back casual game, this is a game for you. If you are looking for in depth customization (like myself) stay away. A good game indeed, just not for me.			"

												This game's victory conditions are broken.You cannot change victory conditions even when you manually adjust it at the start of the game I have done several tests of this to be sure. I have picked science, domination, and population, and the AI still wins victory conditions that aren't selected. Usually the AI wonder victories because it's the dumbest way to win when you are losing everything else. You CANNOT play a long game because of this. Either I win by turn 20ish by wonder or lose to the AI by wonder. The AI can hold 8 planets and win by wonder even when it can't win a single space battle. It's a stupid AI too it just sits at home planet and upgrades wonders when the victory condition is domination or science, AND IT STILL WINS WONDER VICTORY WITHOUT WONDER CONDITION SELECTED !!!Wtf learn how to make a game where the most essential part HOW YOU WIN isn't broken as hell.

												As a big fan of the Civilization series I had high expectations for Starships & hoped it would emulate the same fundamental style of gameplay as other games in the franchise. Sadly the finished product feels like a rushed attempt at trying to create something that could have been great but falls short in so many way and ultimately feels like a Civilization: Beyond Earth mini-game.The game revolves around conquering planets with a single fleet of starships & engaging in repetitive battles that feature an uninspiring AI that can be easily defeated once you (quickly) discover a simple formulae for defeating opponents (You can quite easily hide your ships in cover and cripple the enemy with waves of torpedoes & fighters).I don’t explicitly dislike Starships, however, there is very little replay value and almost no scope for variety in terms of how you play the game, due to the almost identical factions and simplistic victory conditions (I’ve found myself winning a population victory by accident on several occasions).Although the game isn’t anywhere near as engaging as I hoped, it does have good touch support and is a pleasant enough game to play on a tablet when on the move or sitting in bed. As much as I hate taking the price into consideration, as I would have much rather paid three times as much for a far deeper experience, I do think that it’s a decent enough arcade game for killing time in short bursts.In summary I’m going to (only just) recommend Starships based purely on the fact that it’s a cheap and cheerful game to pass an hour or so here-and-there, just don’t expect the same engaging experience that you might expect from other games in the franchise.

												This is a mobile game being masqueraded as a PC game. It's extremely simplified and lacks any real depth. The games only options are by increasing the ticks in your weapons and by adding more ships. The planets have ticks as well that give more resources and a unique ability. Combat is grid-based, with asteroids offering cover an unknown amount of cover, you won't know until you fire on an enemy - visual clues are limited to greater or lesser. I'd expect this to be a game for no more than a dollar or two with banner adds. The price point doesn't match the game play.Once upon a time if a game supported the ""Sid Meier's"" prefix I would preorder it in a heartbeat (and that was one of the few auto preorders for me), but lately Firaxis has been releasing games that don't have anything new or substantial in the games they develop. This was the game that stopped that for me, friends have been telling me I shouldn't preorder games anyway - this is the proof in that pudding.			"

												I have played every single Sid Meier's game that has been released to date and this is by far the most dissappointing of them all.Resolution isn't correct on Windows, there is a gap at the bottom of the screen, and you can only play in full-screen. If you switch to windowed mode it goes to 4:3 aspect ratio. This cannot be changed.There is no difference in gameplay between leaders.There is no difference in gameplay between affinities.Map size does not change tactical gameplay - it only increases the amount of time it takes to overrun everything.I was able to complete 40% of the achievements within an hour of playing.By far the most simple and horrible game I have played from Firaxis games to date. I think this was made for children on tablets.			"

												Bloody awful! When I first looked at the game, I thought it was a retro game from 10 or 15 years ago. In that context, I was able to forgive a lot of its primitiveness. Then, I discovered that this isn't retro in any way, that it came out this year! In that context, I have to wonder what the game designers were thinking!The gameplay is simplistic, not terribly challenging except at the highest difficulty setting, and rather boring after you get the basic ideas down pat. It barely held my interest long enough to complete the various achievements (most of which you'll get just by playing the game normally a few times), and now that I've done that, I don't ever see myself playing it again.Sid Meier: you can do better!

I've put in under 38 hours and have completed about 5 games in different combinations of gameplay variables (3 different classes, 8 different leaders, and 4 different galaxy sizes).  This game is a turn-based, sci-fi/ space, strategy game.  And although the graphics are quite old school, the price of around $15 or less if it's on sale...

												I really like this game... even apart from Beyond Earth. It's not super complex, but when I compare it to MoO2 which I tried to get into sometime long ago, I remember how frustrated I was with all the different options and confusing systems. Starships has a similar game play with a far better tactical experience (which is the focus of Starships) than MoO.(This is still the case, but I have recently switched to a negative review from a positive one.)I keep finding more and more glitches, and they have yet to work out the touch screen functionality. It works 75% of the time, but sometimes it scrolls at the same time I move so the end result is using up my movement to go to the wrong spot. Othertimes, I press an option and it treats my touch as pushing the same option twice. And if I switch to the mouse, there are some options, that it doesn't recognize my mouse clicks at all, but a single touch will register.The diplomatic interactions sometimes make little sense - I'm getting contacted by a planetary system, but one of the other federations are speaking on their behalf... I think that's how to interpret it.			"

												This game may be of the Civilization heritage however it sorely lacks much of the polish and depth that its predecessors have.The game is very easy to pick up and get playing and doesn't have much of a learning curve. The visuals of the game are ok but that is not why people play strategy games. Customising your ships is easy and can lend it self to creating different specilisations of your ships.This game is lacking in depth for a real strategy fan. The battle system is similar to XCOM (turn based) however there now real sense of cover. You can use asteroids to bottleneck your opponent into a sort of kill box but then you might end up being shot through the asteroids anyway. The random environment effects that disable certain features of the ships can be annoying but do not really factor into any kind of strategy.Lack of information when mousing over various aspects of the game is very annoying. You have no way of knowing what exactly is happening when you are spending energy upgrading your ships. What does upgrading fighters do? Make them stronger? More fighters? There is no way to tell easily unless you commit to it. Upgrading fighters just gives more fighters to that can be deployed by your starship.The world map portion of the game is another feature lacking any real depth. You can control planets for more resources and wonders but that is all they are good for, you can specialise them for more of a certain resource but that is it.The map sizes are very tiny and are meant for quick games nothing long and drawn out like the Civ games. I was hoping for a massive epic length battle like in civ but sadly, that is not the case.Victory condition restrictions only apply to the player. If you wanted a massive conquest style game that allows you to get your starships to the end game you will not see it. The AI can easily win with a wonder victory or science before you have any real chance to see the full glory of your starships. Would really love those victory conditions to be applied to the AI as well.I cannot recommend this game to any strategy or civ fan.			"

												Anyone who was thinking of buying this game: wait until at least May 2015.  Hopefully by then the major bugs will have been fixed.  And don't buy it for over $10.It runs for me, but apparently not for many.  One bug I did run into was achievements not unlocking when they should.  (Granted, I fulfilled the requirements for a couple by conquest, when apparently normaly building was the intended way.  But still, these things should be checked for.)It's generic science fiction that tries to be 4x, but really is all about your single steadily growing fleet rolling over the galaxy.  Upgrading your planets is almost inconsequential compared to upgrading your fleet.  Energy constraints heavily favor optimizing for just one form of attack; in particular, lasers 4+ and 0 cannons, torpedoes, et cetera mean you can destroy most targets from a long distance, often times even through asteroids.  (Just make sure you are strong enough before attacking homeworlds: the defense ships that any homeworld starts with will maul a starting fleet, but they don't upgrade over time.)As of this writing, the non-military victory conditions are only feasible if you disable the military victory conditions.  (The UI lets you enable all victory conditions, or only one specific condition, with no option to, say, only disable Population.)  Otherwise, someone's probably going to win a Population victory first.  Even the Domination victory is usually preceeded by a Population victory, unless someone (probably you) launches an early attack on the other empires, to score a Domination victory before enough of the galaxy has been claimed that reducing the galaxy to 2 empires (a necessary prelude to reducing it to 1 for Domination) triggers a Population victory.I do not recommend this game at this time, but if you are reading months or years later - after the bugs have been fixed - and you can get it for under $10, it might be a cheap diversion for a weekend or two.

Combat is pretty straight forward with the emphasis on menuevering and flanking other vessels and landing a more powerful shot.  Even though the combat is simple, the developers did a good job at making it still engaging.This game would be fun on a tablet.  It is not, however, worth the full price.  Wait until it is drastically reduced with a sale, or added as a savings bundle with another Sid Meier's game.  This one has none of the depth that is normally attached to the Sid Meier name.			"

												Fantastic little Game. Well worth the price tag. Although it has got a lot of negative reviews, I think those reviews were from people who were expecting it to be Civ with starships. It isn't at all. In Civ a game may take 10+ hours depending on what settings it is on, and it takes a lot of thought and tactics. A game on Starships takes around 2 hours, and it's a lot more easy going. It does still require thought though, enough so to keep you engaged with the game. It's a great game with what looks like a lot of replayability. Its perfect for that half hour before going out or that 1 hour in the day that you have spare. Would thoroughly recommend.			"

												Great concept for a game, too bad about half way  threw the devs felt this game wasn't worth finishing and put it on the market.  Current features have this being a very basic turn based strategy and minor resource management.  There are only two types of units in the game and they all function the same.  Because of this combat feels extremely repetitive with no rpg elements (besides the basic upgrades you see i the begining) however you will max these out.  For me that came around turn 8 at that point you will one shot all ai starships.  Like i said, great concept, its too bad they didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about making this into an actual game.			"

												I have seen some astoundingly negative reviews on it and my opinions is that the writers were expecting something different. Have you ever heard the phrase ""Don't judge a book by its cover?"". Like many of the disappointed reviewers, I bought this game almost immediately afterward. It's been two weeks since I bought it and I've put a lot of time into the game already.I didn't know what to expect and I really love the game. Especially when I'm on the obvious upper hand and all of a sudden I lose because the AI decided to go for a wonder victory instead of a world domination victory. Pros:- Good artwork.- Makes you think tactically.- Interface is actually quite simple.Cons:- No tutorial.- NO FREAKING MULTIPLAYER. (I would love to play this with friends.)In short, the game is great fun and can take an unexpected turn at any moment.I know this review isn't very informational and probably won't persuade many of you to buy the game, but I think you should give it a chance, don't let others make your decisions for you.

												 This is one of those games I keep coming back to.  Think of this game more along the lines of a computer based board game in line with Risk and Settlers of Catan.  It is more casual than intense.  I am an avid Civ player and play other 3X games.  If you read any of Sid Meir's notes he did not intend for this game to be an intense massive tech tree brain melting game. This is part turn based strategy part RTS. I can walk away from the game then come back after months of not playing.  I am a pretty big fan of this game.  Is it CIV no, but it is just plain fun to play without all the overlly how did i do that before strategy games. If you want a fun game you can just jump into that has good strategy this is it.  You don't have to spend hours learning a tutorial.			"

												Bottom-line up front: I'd give this a solid 1.5 out of 10. This is an expensive version of a free Facebook game... read more to find out why. I REALLY wanted to like this game. From the pre-order description, and the fact that Sid Meier does an amazing job with about 95% of the games that they produce, this had a ton of potential.Branded as a 4x game that related to Beyond Earth, I was a bit hopeful to see something that played like Master of Orion 2 and had the space-ground gameplay of Star Commander. Alas, I got my hopes up too high.Also, before you go too much farther with this, just know that I haven't read the other reviews. This is my own take on this game.Everything from the tech, to the resources, (lack of) diplomacy, (generic) space combat, and AI feels flat.TECH: The tech ""tree"" is just a menu of upgrade. There are no new capabilities to introduce and no real choices that force you to examine tradeoffs and benefits. After playing BE, you'll likely be especially let down because NONE of that innovation exists in this game.RESOURCES: Four resources, and four very narrow things to do with them. Like most campy Facebook games, using your resources requires no more thought than a button click.DIPLOMACY: My main complaint with most Civ games is that you have options that the AI will not accept... in this case, you don't even have those options. Your two basic negotiating stances are a) war, or b) peace. Given the combat, neither has any particular advantages.COMBAT: This is probably the only (slightly) redeeming part of this game. For about the first 20 turns, the combat and the missions are challenging. Once you've pumped enough resources into your ships, you can pretty well steamroll the AI with impunity.Oh yes, the ship customization (and the reason why I was excited about this game)... yawn. Again, like the tech tree, the characteristics of each of your ships can be leveled up to attain greater advantage. There is no researching of new ship hulls, engines, weapons, or shields; just leveling. Facebook flash games have more options than this... such as Battle Pirates.Final thing that I'll say on combat is this: one fleet? If SM was trying a new twist on 4x games to limit player to one fleet and up the challenge, this was a terrible choice. Any potential challenge is wasted because they let you construct warp gates so that you do not use up movement points while moving between your own worlds.AI: Now for the AI. Like the rest of the game, the AI is stale and offers no challenge. In three different play throughs of the game (each at increasing difficulty), I have as yet to have an AI player declare war on me or attack me. I can roam the galaxy with my large armada of heavily armed ships and tear through pretty much every other empire with little effort.What could have been a stellar game (see what I did there?) is really just a black hole for your wallet (even at $13 - as of this writing).Save your money. Save your time. Don't save this galaxy (or SM's bottom line).			"

It would also be better if there was variation in Starship design and classes so they dont just change from a corvette to a cruiser with a few upgrades but have it so u choose certain ships for differnt roles in combat.

												This game may be of the Civilization heritage however it sorely lacks much of the polish and depth that its predecessors have.The game is very easy to pick up and get playing and doesn't have much of a learning curve. The visuals of the game are ok but that is not why people play strategy games. Customising your ships is easy and can lend it self to creating different specilisations of your ships.This game is lacking in depth for a real strategy fan. The battle system is similar to XCOM (turn based) however there now real sense of cover. You can use asteroids to bottleneck your opponent into a sort of kill box but then you might end up being shot through the asteroids anyway. The random environment effects that disable certain features of the ships can be annoying but do not really factor into any kind of strategy.Lack of information when mousing over various aspects of the game is very annoying. You have no way of knowing what exactly is happening when you are spending energy upgrading your ships. What does upgrading fighters do? Make them stronger? More fighters? There is no way to tell easily unless you commit to it. Upgrading fighters just gives more fighters to that can be deployed by your starship.The world map portion of the game is another feature lacking any real depth. You can control planets for more resources and wonders but that is all they are good for, you can specialise them for more of a certain resource but that is it.The map sizes are very tiny and are meant for quick games nothing long and drawn out like the Civ games. I was hoping for a massive epic length battle like in civ but sadly, that is not the case.Victory condition restrictions only apply to the player. If you wanted a massive conquest style game that allows you to get your starships to the end game you will not see it. The AI can easily win with a wonder victory or science before you have any real chance to see the full glory of your starships. Would really love those victory conditions to be applied to the AI as well.I cannot recommend this game to any strategy or civ fan.			"

												Anyone who was thinking of buying this game: wait until at least May 2015.  Hopefully by then the major bugs will have been fixed.  And don't buy it for over $10.It runs for me, but apparently not for many.  One bug I did run into was achievements not unlocking when they should.  (Granted, I fulfilled the requirements for a couple by conquest, when apparently normaly building was the intended way.  But still, these things should be checked for.)It's generic science fiction that tries to be 4x, but really is all about your single steadily growing fleet rolling over the galaxy.  Upgrading your planets is almost inconsequential compared to upgrading your fleet.  Energy constraints heavily favor optimizing for just one form of attack; in particular, lasers 4+ and 0 cannons, torpedoes, et cetera mean you can destroy most targets from a long distance, often times even through asteroids.  (Just make sure you are strong enough before attacking homeworlds: the defense ships that any homeworld starts with will maul a starting fleet, but they don't upgrade over time.)As of this writing, the non-military victory conditions are only feasible if you disable the military victory conditions.  (The UI lets you enable all victory conditions, or only one specific condition, with no option to, say, only disable Population.)  Otherwise, someone's probably going to win a Population victory first.  Even the Domination victory is usually preceeded by a Population victory, unless someone (probably you) launches an early attack on the other empires, to score a Domination victory before enough of the galaxy has been claimed that reducing the galaxy to 2 empires (a necessary prelude to reducing it to 1 for Domination) triggers a Population victory.I do not recommend this game at this time, but if you are reading months or years later - after the bugs have been fixed - and you can get it for under $10, it might be a cheap diversion for a weekend or two.

												Starships is a great game to play. But ... the destruction of enemy ships is too long. I would like to see an option for ""Quick Combat"". Also, what would make this game more satisfying is if it were possible to board enemy ships and have options for negotiating ""Terms Of Surrender"". With the occassional ""Self Destruct Initiated"" captains on board. lolAnd the final thought ... ""MultiPlayer""!!! 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.			"

												Pretty basic game.  It fun trying to figure out the strategy of the battles, but once you master it, there isn't much left.  Its re-playable for about 8-10 games, but gets repetitive after that.  I wouldn't spend more than $7-$9 on it.			"

												So I really enjoy this game. Yes it does have some issues and is far from perfect but is a great time waster.So good points; The ease of play, there is no real learning curve, you can pick this up and dive right in. The combat. Comabt is interesting and the variety of ships you come across can keep it so. Coming across ships from other factions with very different strenghts and weaknesses can throw what was otherwise an easy roll through space.Ship customisation. Fun but not perfect, it makes a large difference as the game starts and on harder modes, less so in late game easy modes.Negatives.It can get a little old after a while, simeply because there is no real depth to play. The mission variety is low, and can really wear thin after long sessions.In late game it can become a long slog between each faction going back and forth.Very easy to lose on population when two factions join out of the blue. Several times I have gone from 49% population with an easy lead and then been overtaken by two factions, leaving me in the dust.Bugs. You do find many, visual bugs mostly, animations looping, funky camera angles and windowing issues. All normally sort out with a quick save and restart so nothing game braking. Overall I would reccomend if you fancy an every so often time sink.			"

												Although I'm not a real scifi-fan I really liked Sid Meier's Starships. It's much better than the two Sid Meier's Ace Patrol games but less complex than Civilization. Starships is easy to learn (even though the tutorial isn't that good), has a nice setting and good turn-based gameplay. What makes this game so interesting is the following: A full game only lasts a few hours, you can choose from three playble factions and there are different ways to win the game. This guarantees that replaying the game is still enjoyable. The only negative aspects are, that the game can appear a bit repetitive and that there is sadly no Multiplayer at all. In cotrast to a lot of other reviewers, my game run very stable and never crashed, but like others mentioned there is no real fullscreen mode. If you have Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth you can combine it with Starships and unlock some bonus content in both games, which is really nice if you ask me. All in all I can recommend the game to all turn-based strategey-game-lovers but I suggest you get the game in a discount or in bundle because the fullprice seems a bit too high.			"

												This game was just a pitiful waste of time in my honest opinion. This game looked somewhat interesting by the images and i was looking for a good space turn-based strategy game. Now that i have found games like Master of Orion i can now truly say that i found a good space strategy game. This was a waste of money and am upset that i bought this before Steam offered refunds.

												Games are supposed to be fun, and this one delivers.The best thing about this game is its simplicity, even though it bares Sid Meiers' name. It helps you focus on your winning strategy without the need to micro-manage.The first game will seem difficult - even when playing on the easiest level - but once you get the hang of it, you'll come to appreciate what it has to offer.I especially enjoy the space battles, there's a lot of room for tactics. With that said, it's also suitable for those who like to simply charge the enemy with what they got, as long as they choose the right battles. "

												This is a mini-game. If you expect a big game then you will be disapointed. The depth of the game is redicilously low. There is so little to choose between and almost no options to customize your gaming experience. However as a mini-game for a tablet it would be perfect. On a PC it doesn't do very well and if you have a 4k monitor it's absolutely horrible. The font size doesn't scale up so it's so incredible tiny, the resolution is impossible to change as it runs in windowed mode and can't run full-screen. Heck, you even have to watch the windows taskbar at the bottom of the screen! Of course those things can be fixed manually by changing resolution outside of the game and setting the windows taskbar to auto hide, but those are just simple things that are very annoying and it makes you wonder what the devs was thinking... There's also bugs like trying to shoot a torpedo and then change ship while aiming then the aiming remains on and you can suddenly shoot a torpedo from a ship without torpedos.Diplomacy is a joke, I don't even know why they have the diplomacy screen, it's absolutely pointless. It's more like an intel screen where the enemies comes to you and tells you ""these are my planets, these are my forces. I have this much defence, this much armor, this much attack. That's it, bye now"". Why would an enemy reveal that?Sure, I could have voted Yes if I played the game on a tablet and only paid $2 for it, but not at this price point. It feels somewhat unfinished due to the above issues and it's absolutely not worth more than $2. Fix the issues and it's worth $4, add some depth and it's worth $8.The only thing I like about this game is the user interface and graphics, it's compelling but then you soon realize it's not much more than that.

												For a sid meier game this is remarkably shallow and simplistic:5 resources : energy (to build/upgrade ships), food (to add cities to planets, these up all resource production), metal (to build planetary improvements and wonders), science (fo buy tech improvements), credits (to buy planetary influence or other resources via the market)5 planet types: normal and then four that each provide 50% increase to one of the first four resource types.4 planet improvements to increase the income of those resources, 1 to improve defence and one to help with ship travel.9 ship modules and 9 techs to improve those modules8 ships in a single fleet, can't have multiple fleets, and a limit of 8 to the number of any specific module on each ship.There's a bit of variation with the selection of wonders to build (1 per planet  and it's random as to which wonder is available on which planet), but it still does not make up for the lack of diversity throughout the rest of the game.I can well believe that this was originally designed for the mobile game market.Also FYI anyone who's not getting the achievements for the game for some stupid reason you only get them if you allow all victory conditions.Basically this will provide a small distraction but is not worth considering a full ""game"".

												If you're buying this game for the ""Beyond Earth Connectivity""... meh. When I heard Beyond Earth and Starships had connectivity, my mind immediately jumped to what yours probably did...""Hey, I can build up my world in Beyond Earth, with Starships effectively acting as a major expansion pack, and start colonizing other worlds too, and colonizing them beyond-earth style, or maybe while I'm still in my initial world, be invaded by faster-advancing colonies from other worlds.... that's Sooooo coool, basically making the game that much more massive in scope!"" Well, I got in... started looking for the connectivity.... and was quickly disappointed. I then looked up online to find out exactly *how* they connect and.... they don't. Sure it ""says"" they do, but they connect in the same way that TF2 connect to Red Orchestra.... they don't, but you get some cross-promotional content in each one for having the other. Whoop de doo. No massive grand multi-world strategies, no epic level conquests on a scale far beyond just one world.It's a classic situation of something living up to nowhere near it's expectations.You want connectivity? Nope. You get some micro-dlc's back and forth. Whee.			"

Because it's a fun romp that's, relatively, easy to master (on lower difficulties) most gamers should find it to be replayable a handful of times. Which makes it easy to grab the handful of 'unlocks' for 'Beyond Earth'.TL;DRIt is enjoyable, even fun. ;)A casual Civ player would most likely enjoy this for what it is.

Combat is pretty straight forward with the emphasis on menuevering and flanking other vessels and landing a more powerful shot.  Even though the combat is simple, the developers did a good job at making it still engaging.This game would be fun on a tablet.  It is not, however, worth the full price.

												Fantastic little Game. Well worth the price tag. Although it has got a lot of negative reviews, I think those reviews were from people who were expecting it to be Civ with starships. It isn't at all. In Civ a game may take 10+ hours depending on what settings it is on, and it takes a lot of thought and tactics. A game on Starships takes around 2 hours, and it's a lot more easy going. It does still require thought though, enough so to keep you engaged with the game. It's a great game with what looks like a lot of replayability. Its perfect for that half hour before going out or that 1 hour in the day that you have spare. Would thoroughly recommend.			"

												I have seen some astoundingly negative reviews on it and my opinions is that the writers were expecting something different. Have you ever heard the phrase ""Don't judge a book by its cover?"". Like many of the disappointed reviewers, I bought this game almost immediately afterward. It's been two weeks since I bought it and I've put a lot of time into the game already.I didn't know what to expect and I really love the game. Especially when I'm on the obvious upper hand and all of a sudden I lose because the AI decided to go for a wonder victory instead of a world domination victory. Pros:- Good artwork.- Makes you think tactically.- Interface is actually quite simple.Cons:- No tutorial.- NO FREAKING MULTIPLAYER. (I would love to play this with friends.)In short, the game is great fun and can take an unexpected turn at any moment.I know this review isn't very informational and probably won't persuade many of you to buy the game, but I think you should give it a chance, don't let others make your decisions for you.

												Bottom-line up front: I'd give this a solid 1.5 out of 10. This is an expensive version of a free Facebook game... read more to find out why. I REALLY wanted to like this game. From the pre-order description, and the fact that Sid Meier does an amazing job with about 95% of the games that they produce, this had a ton of potential.Branded as a 4x game that related to Beyond Earth, I was a bit hopeful to see something that played like Master of Orion 2 and had the space-ground gameplay of Star Commander. Alas, I got my hopes up too high.Also, before you go too much farther with this, just know that I haven't read the other reviews. This is my own take on this game.Everything from the tech, to the resources, (lack of) diplomacy, (generic) space combat, and AI feels flat.TECH: The tech ""tree"" is just a menu of upgrade. There are no new capabilities to introduce and no real choices that force you to examine tradeoffs and benefits. After playing BE, you'll likely be especially let down because NONE of that innovation exists in this game.RESOURCES: Four resources, and four very narrow things to do with them. Like most campy Facebook games, using your resources requires no more thought than a button click.DIPLOMACY: My main complaint with most Civ games is that you have options that the AI will not accept... in this case, you don't even have those options. Your two basic negotiating stances are a) war, or b) peace. Given the combat, neither has any particular advantages.COMBAT: This is probably the only (slightly) redeeming part of this game. For about the first 20 turns, the combat and the missions are challenging. Once you've pumped enough resources into your ships, you can pretty well steamroll the AI with impunity.Oh yes, the ship customization (and the reason why I was excited about this game)... yawn. Again, like the tech tree, the characteristics of each of your ships can be leveled up to attain greater advantage. There is no researching of new ship hulls, engines, weapons, or shields; just leveling. Facebook flash games have more options than this... such as Battle Pirates.Final thing that I'll say on combat is this: one fleet? If SM was trying a new twist on 4x games to limit player to one fleet and up the challenge, this was a terrible choice. Any potential challenge is wasted because they let you construct warp gates so that you do not use up movement points while moving between your own worlds.AI: Now for the AI. Like the rest of the game, the AI is stale and offers no challenge. In three different play throughs of the game (each at increasing difficulty), I have as yet to have an AI player declare war on me or attack me. I can roam the galaxy with my large armada of heavily armed ships and tear through pretty much every other empire with little effort.What could have been a stellar game (see what I did there?) is really just a black hole for your wallet (even at $13 - as of this writing).Save your money. Save your time. Don't save this galaxy (or SM's bottom line).			"

												I do not know if i should recoment this game or not. It is fun for a couple of hours. But after that it is more the same.You realy can see it was intentionaly made for a tablet and not for pc.But lets look at the game it self:> The mecanics      >> Map            + feels quite intiuative. click a planet and you have accesse to all the options (building and upgrading) of that planet.            - No ""go to"" option.            +/- You only have 1 ship to control, altho with a high movement.       >> Battlefield            + It feels more like chess.            - Torpedos are a bit useless at moments, but when you have stealth torpedos you can basicly make a mine field (+)            - AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥      >> Research            - very simple      >> Controls for pc            - very simple (you can not set them)            - No ""Enter"" for end of turnAs i said it at the start, it is fun for a couple of hours. On a tablet!For pc, i would say it is fun, but games like Galactic Civilization or Sins of a Solar Empire are better.For Sid's Meier please go back and find your roots; like CIV 3 or Civ 4. This was a nice continuiation of Civ 5: BE. But i would not recoment it when you as player when you buy the steam version you should also get acces to the tablet version. "

												Starships is a fun game where you play as the admiral of a small fleet. It simplifies the technology and resource managing aspect so that the player may focus on their fleet and the missions that they go on. If you are expecting a 4x game then you will be disappointed because this game was not designed around resources but around space tactical combat and does a good job with it. In the galaxy you do get some resource management but all of those including the techs are strictly focused around building and maintaining the fleet. Then there are the missions the player sends their fleet on, they play out like a good game of chess involving a few varied sets of moves and abilities for each ship. With the longer games taking around 2-3 hours this is far more casual then the Civilization franchise it spawned from which makes it easy to pick up and play on a random day as opposed to a civilization game which takes a little bit of commitment to get through.Now for the ugly. The game does have some balancing issues at the moment of release but nothing game shattering. The only 2 victories that you ever go for are population and wonder victories as science victory takes forever to get and when you go for a domination victory you will inevitably conquer over half the galaxy (population victory) before you wipe out the last player. There is also a very sad lack of multiplayer which could have done very well especially if Firaxis set up a single mission game (kind of like what they did with X-Com Enemy Unknown). I am hoping they eventually give us a multiplayer because that would drastically increase the value of the game but even without multiplayer this is a fun game and for $15 ($10 if you wait for a sale) it is not a bad buy.

												I have been following Sid Meiers games since Civ 1. But Starships really surprised me as no other of the recent games. Of course Civ5 and Beyond Earth have been solid. But this one is different. Still you have to build your fleet and watch your planets and thus ressources grow. But the battle mode based on different scenarios and missions by neighboring planets is something really shortwhile. Sure there are some similarities with the Master of Orion series, but its much lighter yet in terms of technology tree or building diversity, there are yet no superheroes with special abilities – but I am sure they will come soon. It´s also nicer to play a day of bad weather, a normal game lasts about 3 - 8hrs. Sometimes I have been won before, but that was just more challenging. I think it is a great gameplay, which will even grow in complexity soon.			"

												This is a tough one.. really wanted to like the game, but it's got some issues.After playing thru a few games, the biggest problem in my opinion: Regardless of what you select as a victory condition, it apparently does not apply to the AI.  So, the game is going to be a race to get to 7 wonders nearly every time.  You can set the game up to the largest, most epic map that settings will allow,.. and if you don't rush and build 7 wonders, one of the AI will.  This causes the game to be over far too quickly.Some other issues:Lack of customization/variety in your available ships.  You have one type of ship available, and you can alter the appearance a bit based on the loadout you select,.. but they all still look basically the same.  Some of the Wonders are a bit over the top.  Stealth torpedos, permenant stealth ships, and a wonder that gives you two actions instead of one,.....battle over.I don't regret buying this game for the price,.. but it falls painfully short in my opinion.  The game seems over simplified.  Not sure if this was because they wanted to pander to the tablet crowd, but I'm not looking to buy a tablet game to play on my PC.Maybe if there are future updates/addons that add more to the game I will adjust my review,... but for now, the game comes up way short for what I expect from a Sid Meier game.

												While sharing story elements with Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth, this is *NOT* an empire builder game. I would call it a turn based tactical/strategy game. It's a good game, although several things about it just don't make sense. First, you only have 1 fleet of ships. Second, every planet's combat environment is filled with asteroids. Third, lasers and cannons are graphically homing missiles, not lasers and cannons.The flaws don't really matter though, it is a good game. And even though it was obviously designed for tablets, that doesn't hold it back on the PC.			"

												What is this? When i heard that there was going to be Sid Meier's game on the interplantery level i was stoked. Unlike many people i actually liked Civ: BE particularly since the rising tide pack came out. One of my dream games is to have a Civ type game where you go seemlessly from Stonehenge to the stars. I thought that this game might be it. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a cheap, last second knocked together insult to the proud Sid Meier name. I've played $5 early access games that are better designed and more interesting than this. I could go on but here it short and sweet.This isn't a civ game. This is a mobile game trying to leech money off the Sid Meier name. Boring, repetative and pointless. Don't buy it.			"

												This game is similar to chess. Do not expect depth, but rather an experience similar to chess. It is the same board and the same pieces, but each game is unique. In experience however, the challenge and uniqueness only applies to the 2 hardest levels. At easy and normal the game is comically easy as to be boring. The first 4-5 (8-15 missions), in most cases, largely determine the outcome of the game. I recommend setting the victory conditions to ALL as this will make you scramble to prevent other civilizations from completing any of the requirements. Playing Domination only as the victory condition is the easiest as most AI civilizations will combine against you should you get strong. SImple, challenging and repeatable.... Chess like.  "

												Not that great of a game... the battles are fun but the way to actually win is kind of stupid. It should be a bit more like Civilization instead of the 51% thing... why does someone with 51% population automatically win when your army is 10 times as powerful? Not that great of a system but I mean it is sort of a good time waster and it doesn't use a lot of battery but it is only fun to beat on domination victory and it is only fun to do one time.			"

												There may be a lot of negative reviews for this game, but for the right people, this game really hits it.If you've ever wanted just the turn-based tactical combat without the baggage of empire management, this is the game to get. If you've ever set up a Civ5 game on a huge epic pangaea with only elimination victory type, you might want to try Starships using epic + impossible + domination-only setup. You get the fun battles with much less empire management baggage and with much less possibility for lopsided technological mismatch.And if you want turn-based combat in the form of starships in space, this may well be the only modern take in existence because I haven't managed to find any other. Most other 4X games have gone real-time with combat and they come with massive empire management and ship design overhead.Here are a sample of things I liked compared to other tactical (mostly RPG) games:- You can reconfigure your party instantly with little to no resource loss, promoting build diversity. You can refit your fleet into any spec to suit the next battle and respec it back. In most other tactics game, you're locked into particular builds accompanied by long grinding process which you have to repeat if you switch builds.- The game gets going fast with minimal build-up time. Within 2-3 battles, you're already progressing up to considerable strategic options (e.g. cannons, fighters, new ship). In most other tactics games, you'd have to grind around for dozens of missions to gather resources and gain EXP.- The galactic screen is essentially a very good mission chooser screen. Most other tactics games offer very little choice with regard to choosing missions. (e.g. limited to open sidequests, random battles that interrupt your travel, etc.) In Starships, you can look at your borders and choose a mission based on the other empire's strength and your crew fatigue. Mission types on non-federated planets are quite varied.- Planetary Wonders are a really nice way to differentiate the strengths of each player in the game in a way that's halfway between randomized and controlled, and also in a way that you can't plan for from before the game starts the way you could with Civ5 leader traits or world wonders.- No random chance to miss. (looking at you XCOM) Cover reduces damage instead of chance to hit.The only real complaint I have for this game is the lack of multiplayer, although ultimately its addition would probably be no more than what multiplayer was in XCOM which didn't really do much.Another possible complaint is that the AI is not terribly difficult, but I find that it only really has problems when you start using special tactics (like invisible torpedoes). In an open brawl, I find that the AI is quite competent with finding odd line of sight that I can't fire back to and are pretty good at finding a way to shoot your engines. The Impossible difficulty should be good for the vast majority of average players.I like what the game has to offer in its current (and probably final) state and wholeheartedly recommend it for fans of turn-based tactical space games.

												Despite what most people say, this game is pretty good.Ok, it is not a Civilization 6 nor a Civilization Beyond-Earth 2, but it's not what was annonced. Most people seems to dislike this game only because of Sid's name. And so they were expecting so much more. It is a Sid's game, a little one, but still a good game. It keep his promises. You'll play in the same universe as Beyond-Earth, but the game is turn based strategy, and not the 4X.So yes, I recommend this game for these reasons :- It's price- Sometimes, I wanna play a fast game of Civ', wich is imposible, so now, I'm gonna play instead- It has a great replay value, and the 3 differents factions and 8 characters are enough for it- The game is more hard to play than it seems, and you can't -just like any other Sid's game- put your brain away to play it			"

												This is a great, streamlined strategy game with a heavy focus on -- surprise, surprise -- building a fleet of starships and improving their stats. You improve the ships by spending resources and you get the resources by exerting ""influence"" over planets (basically, you conquer them). You can buy influence or gain influence by either completing a mission at the planet or by giving your crew shore leave there. Shore leave basically serves as an ""end turn"" button on the main strategy map and allows your crew to rest and recover, so you can move again next turn from planet to planet, improving them (by building cities, improvements, or wonders) and gaining influence. Aside from the main strategy map, you'll also be conducting an awful lot of combat missions on a more detailed battle map. You'll fire torpedoes, which you can detonate at will after the first turn when an enemy is nearby (or you think it's nearby), or perform scans, or simply shoot an enemy vessel with your ships' weapons. Asteroids little the 2D battle arena that provide some cover for your vessels as you manoeuvre into an advantageous position. The best thing? These battles, while numerous, move very quickly, so you'll never get bored. You can win the game through a variety of means, though the most common one is the ""population"" victory, where you control 51% of the galaxy. The end isn't particularly exciting: you'll get a dialogue box that essentially tells you, ""You win!"", followed by a short and rather nondescript video. But the game is fun! Yes, it's nowhere near as complex and involved like any of the Civilization games, but it isn't supposed to be. This is Sid Meier's Starships, not Sid Meier's Galactic Empires. It's streamlined and simple without being simplistic. You'll be doing all the standard 4X things: exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating, but at such a brisk pace you can easily finish a full game in a couple of hours or less. If you expect this to be the next big Sid Meier game that will devour your life for months if not years on end, you'll be disappointed. (And incidentally, congratulations on having so much spare time on hand!) If instead you're looking for a quick, fun turn-based strategy game with lots of fairly interesting options and brisk combat, then Sid Meier's Starships is worth your time and money. I thoroughly recommend this.			"

												There's a good and grand idea behind this... and I enjoy this game quite a bit. But it's missing the bulk of what you'd expect from a space strategy- and there's a lot out right now.A good mobile game, a bit lacking for a sit down PC game. Still worth a try.			"

												Despite what most people say, this game is pretty good.Ok, it is not a Civilization 6 nor a Civilization Beyond-Earth 2, but it's not what was annonced. Most people seems to dislike this game only because of Sid's name. And so they were expecting so much more. It is a Sid's game, a little one, but still a good game. It keep his promises. You'll play in the same universe as Beyond-Earth, but the game is turn based strategy, and not the 4X.So yes, I recommend this game for these reasons :- It's price- Sometimes, I wanna play a fast game of Civ', wich is imposible, so now, I'm gonna play instead- It has a great replay value, and the 3 differents factions and 8 characters are enough for it- The game is more hard to play than it seems, and you can't -just like any other Sid's game- put your brain away to play it			"

												This lightweight tactical combat simulator is worth the time, but not the money.  Pick it up in response to extreme boredom or a good sale.			"

												Shallow mechanics, poor AI, trivial to beat. I'm hope Sid Meier was involved with this in name only.			"

												Loved almost everything about it. The pure lack of keyboard support makes the inevitable grind of clicks less enjoyable. Would have been great if I could have just been able to map ""end turn"" and ""fire"". Outside that, hours and hours of fun.			"

												Space combat is easy to learn and is fun for a while, but it gets repetitive fast.Planet management and diplomacy add nothing fun to the game.This game is not terrible. If you are curious about it, get it on sale.Sid Meier's Ace Patrol has better combat mechanics and is cheaper, give it a try.			"

												Not worth the 15 dollars asking at this time really. The integration with Beyond Earth is neat, and the game isn't terrible but clearly lacks polish. For the <20 hours of gameplay, and Beyond Earth unlocks, pick up for under 10 bucks. It's kind of a shame, as if it has some large potential that is just left untapped.			"

												It's a neat, simple game. Perfect for a few hours when you can't afford the time to play Civ. For me it's perfect, a classic old few-features 4x space strategy. The kind of strategy game you don't have to learn every quirk about because you're busy playing other games (and living) as well. I personally LOVE that simplicity.Take-away: This is a casual game that will still eat a lot of hours, just not as many as the Civ games.The unlocks between C: BE and Starships could be called P2W, irritating, or if you have them both... um, neat. It is a bonus anyway, but rather poorly integrated so you don't really know what unlocks you have unlocked (especially in C:BE).Is it worth the cost? Barely! I picked it up cheap through Humble Bundle in a big civ bundle. It was basically a bonus game. That said, so far I've spent more time on Starships than on C: BE.There are some bad things: It's basically a windowed game/ipad game. To me that's almost a bonus though. If you have a peace treaty, it's not completely obvious or straith forward how to declare war/break the peace. The UI is...not refined... and I'm being polite saying that.The lack of multiplayer and some seriously lost potential is sad too. They could have expanded on this game, a lot, for that price without making the game more complicated. Basically they did a lot of things.. um, not wrong, but poorly, but for what it is, and that's pretty unique nowadays, I still recommend it. It's a blast from the past when things where simpler, but not always easier.(I just *tried* to play Crusader Kings II and my head hurt trying to get into it all again. While those games are amazing - I love them - I just don't have the time to invest.)			"

												It's not the best game, but it's not a bad one. I bought this game and BE for around 17 dollars if i remember correctly and I think I've gotten my money's worth. Just dont buy it for full price. If you're expecting a civ game but in space don't buy this, this game is basiclly just turn combat in space with some empire management. Overall its a decent game in short play throughs. Just don't marathon it or buy it at full price.			"

												Being a massive Sid Meier fan of many years, my excitement level for an easy to pick up game from the renowned designer was pretty high.Sadly, the experience didn't match the expectation... Simplistic strategy, a lack of depth and poor development choices blight what could at its core be a good design.Therefore, I don't feel that I can recommend Starships to anyone but a die hard Meier collector or space strategy nut.

												Starships has no fullscreen mode, only fullscreen windowed, and no graphical settings beyond that option. It has no mouse over to move the map, you must click and drag. No menu option to exit to desktop. Smacks of lazy design.			"

												Very small and quick games with a tiny galaxy even on the largest map possible. However it is still a great game and is very good if you just won't a casual, simple and action game. I highly recommend it!			"

												Starships is a great game to play. But ... the destruction of enemy ships is too long. I would like to see an option for ""Quick Combat"". Also, what would make this game more satisfying is if it were possible to board enemy ships and have options for negotiating ""Terms Of Surrender"". With the occassional ""Self Destruct Initiated"" captains on board. lolAnd the final thought ... ""MultiPlayer""!!! 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.			"

												I really want to give a thumbs up. I really do. But I feel as though other space 4X games are much, much more worth your money. The game makes it almost impossible to win other than through war and the interface was a bit counterintuitive at times. Domination victories can catch you off guard because Starships's definition of Domination is just control 50.01% of the population and win. Personally, I hate those types of victories. There are other victory types, but they are almost never achieved because you or the AI will win Domination way earlier than any other victory.ProsThe ship battles were fun and engagingExploration was done wellMarketplace (different than directly trading with other players)ConsHard to use interfaceLack of replayability (especially with city management, wonders, and technologies)Poorly thought out victory conditions and cannot turn on/off certain victory condition typesAlmost non-functional diplomacy system (at least for the AI to AI interaction) and no any tradingFor builder type players, this game is definitely not for you(Edit: In the first paragraph, the victory condition I was referring to is called Population victory, not Domination victory)			"

												Overall, I give it a thumbs up.I went in with low expectations, and I was sufficiently surprised. The game is fun enough, but doesn't have the depth that one would expect from a Sid Meier title. That said, it is still pretty fun and the battles are interesting. I wouldn't rank this as a top tier title, but it is worth a few playthroughs (they aren't very long).			"

												Little Big Game...I enjoy a lot games made by Sid Meier; from Trains, to Airplanes, and now Starships...It plays MUCH faster than others like Civilization, but that doesn't mean it's less fun. Casual Gaming at it's best.P.S.Mostly, I play OFFLINE, so, my gaming time isn't accurate, but if you play on a GIGANTIC map, you'll have some 4 hours per game.			"
