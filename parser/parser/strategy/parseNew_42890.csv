												I had to buy this game again in order to review it. My hours played does not include the older Steam version that isn't sold anymore.This is hands down my favourite game of all time. Therefore I am actually going to take time writing this review.Ridiculously deep, engaging gameplay that can allow for 250+ hours for a single large game - a game filled with desperate struggles against merciless and highly adaptable AI in long late-night/early morning sessions. A very nice physics engine allows for some interesting RTS battles with completely customised ships bristling with esoteric weaponry - from the humble red laser to giant space revolvers that shoot asteroids that glass planets.With a quasi-randomised tech tree system and 6 different races that each play completely differently, it is easy to spend thousands of hours on this game and still not experience everything it has to offer. Multiplayer is just as good - coordinate with a friend or compete against them in 4X/RTT combined gameplay. If you thought multiplayer games of Sins of a Solar Empire or Civ were long, this game is somewhat longer, but rewards you with deep satisfaction during and after play.Overall it is similar to the Master of Orion series of games if you remember those, but also feels akin to Total War with the RTT combined with turn-based strategy, and the depth of control available during battles. Most of the time you are trying to expand, tech up and survive in a turn-based 4X type strategic map.However, if one of your ships encounters something hostile, you are given the option to fight manually; this is often very rewarding, you are able to visually assess the ships, including tech level and weaponry, and to also destroy them with extreme prejudice (or not if you prefer). The RTT game engine allows polygon targeting, allowing you to aim shots at precise parts of their ships - snipe off their turrets or shoot out their engines so their inertia causes them to crash into a planet. The level of detail simulated allows for incredibly fun and often unpredictable fights. This is not like Sins, where ships have simple health bars and succumb after a set number of hits; exactly what and where you hit things is of great importance - hit a tanker in the fuel tanks hard enough and be rewarded with a satisfying secondary explosion, sometimes disintegrating the ship and everything small within a large radius.Visually, it is quite dated now, something that they tried to fix in the sequel, which is somewhat buggy and sometimes broken. However, this original is very well polished, and I would highly recommend this gem of a game to anyone with half a brain and some patience.If you do end up enjoying it as much as I have, the sequel may be worth trying, but be prepared for a general feeling of lack of completeness that is absent in this original. I wouldn't fault the devs too much for that, Paradox wanted them to release at an incomplete point and it was do-or-die for the studio. It has come a long way since release but the devs aimed a bit too high and fell short. This does not mean it is terrible, much fun is to be had, with a lot of new things to be tried - if you have the patience and an SSD to cope with the *occasional* CTD - (occasional is a relative term).TL;DR: this is a very good and underrated game, buy it (it is also cheap), play it. Don't buy the second one if you are new to the series unless you are a masochist with too much money.			"

												This is one of the most underated 4X games ive played. Ive put way more than 112 hours into it before i had steam. The combat controls take a bit of getting used to but once you have those nailed this game will eat hours of your life. Planet management and the tech tree are easy to understand but the tech still retains depth. After an 8 hour long game you will still have lots of tech still to discover.Whilst the graphics are a little dated it really doesnt matter once you are playing and you are immersed. Combat is enjoyable to watch especially when you have 3 massive dreadnoughts trying to face off against an entire enemy fleet.This is a really solid game one of my favourite random buys ever .Its worth every penny and if you see it in a sale definatly grab it!

												So my friend introduced me to this game as he wanted more friends to play with. It was an old game (relatively) and I expected a few laughs and not much else. I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask for Civilization in space. I didn't ask for all the lore and all the different races and ships. I didn't ask for interesting space combat and with ship by ship construction and pretty high level strategy. They even forced multiple maps down my throat with a tech tree that is randomly generated from game to game! It was horrible. Terrible. I didn't want this.On a more serious note. The game is fun, as usual especially with friends. Has a pretty good learning curve, interesting races with tons of lore to read. Every race plays different and is interesting in what they are good and not good at. Good mechanics and has actual space battle where you control the ships in 3d space. It can be a bit daunting at times and for some people it might get boring if things get slow. However I very much liked this game. Certainly gave me some sleepless nights staying up to play it. Graphics are solid. No real complaints, though games do tend to go very long.			"

												+/+ Unique take on research.+/+ Simple ship building UI.+/+ First encounters with alien species is handled very well.+/+ All six species have unique play styles and lore as well as provide unique opponents to fight.+/+ Micromanagement decreases with game length.+/+ full 3 dimensional star maps (with many choices included a ‘2D’ star map for those who prefer 2D).+/+ Games are very customizable. +/- Turn-based star map with real-time battles (kind of like Total War in space).+/- Economy management is relatively simple.+/- Graphics are nothing to write home about (not that important for a 4x strategy game IMO).-/- SotS lacks a sufficient tutorial and the UI fails to present all relevant information.-/- Sound effects range from average to bad.  Some may even find them offensive.-/- Lacks steam features.Verdict: 8.8/10.  SotS is a very impressive and unique take on the 4x genre.  The developer managed to create a game design that scales the micromanagement with empire size.  The ship design is one of the best I’ve seen in a 4x game (Star Ruler would be my only contender).  The game has a steep learning curve and requires some forum reading/let’s plays to gain a moderate understanding of the underlying mechanics.  If you are willing to invest the time, you will find a lot to love in Sword of the Stars.			"

												I think it's my favorite 4x game by far, and I'm playing it in 2015, the game still holds to modern standards and modding community is still active.This game should serve as a reference for the space 4x genre, it gets everything right and does not try to push fancy and poorly made useless innovations like too many games.Pros:easy to play, hard to master, has much more depth than it appears at the beginningfocusses on what really matters and does not annoy you with useless micromanagement just for the sake of complexity.interesting real time tactical combat phases where both how you command your fleet and how you designed them matters.very well designed UI which allows you to play quickly and efficiently.just enough ship customization, lets you design them for your intended strategy, does not require you to spend hours fine-tuning them.3D galaxy map which adds real strategic interest and variety to the games.varied and balanced races with very different travelling methods.interesting and challenging research tree, partially randomized for every game and player, with random technologies that you may not be allowed to research at all for this game, but have some chance to steal from an enemy.smart and challenging AI which properly uses diplomacy, however not so good within tactical combat phases.still active modding community, great mods available to enhance visuals and improve game balance (check my Steam guide ;) ).the game seems very polished and you will have many pleasant surprises, few bad ones.straightforward videos + text transcription tutorials, easy to skip parts or quickly read the text if you are in a hurry ...Cons:... but lacks explanations for advanced things, which you need to look up online, such as how planet size, resources and hazard works, how population, industrial output, and income impact each other, detailed game mechanics and weapon damage values, or some useful key bindings (pausing combat, making waypoints in strategic map, speeding up combat, rotating fleet formation, etc.). RNG can be potentially ruin your game (if you activated random events). no ship refitting (but that did not bother me that much) trading system is not great, it requires you to build A LOT of freighters at some point in the game, and when you upgrade the freighter technology you need to rebuild them all. However by becoming at some point the backbone of your economy it becomes of great strategic value and improves the dynamic of the game.TL;DR: Best space 4x game without aimless overcomplicated features, way better than recently released ones.

												A surprising favorite among 4X games. I've put 90% of my time into this game before getting it on Steam, and I still come back to it now and again. Everything about SotS is cut down to its best aspects; empire management is user friendly and simplified, but still a powerful way to gain an advantage, while combat is straight to the point and engaging. You will never spend twenty minutes meticulously planning your next turn. Instead you'll be rushing to make new designs and push production, scraping together fleets to push your advantage and stave off annihilation.If this game had better publishing, it would rank among the classics. And once you think you've played it out, just try the ACM mod.			"

												An extremely in-depth and large-scope turn-based space empire building simulator. It gives enough freedom to feel in control but does not get bogged down with a ton of menus. Though it looks a touch dated by now it is still easily the best I've found in the genre. (There is a sequel, and there are a LOT of reasons I'm writing a recommendation for the original instead of that).			"

												I'd probably call this game a cult classic, but I don't even think the following it has would extend that far. Which is a shame, considering how epic this game is. Honestly I can say if you want a 4X space strategy game, get this, and ignore the sequel.Why? You might ask, surely the sequel is better! Wrong, it had a terrible, terrible launch, released in a bad unfinished state, to the point where even clicking the new game button would crash it. Which isn't the developers fault, i'd like to add, they suffered the same problem that plague's most games today, the publisher forced them to push it out the door. But back to the original topic. SotS is addictive and more importantly, fun. Six races to choose from, each with their own quirks and style of play. You can set up a galaxy with a number of options, ranging from amount of stars, to the galaxy shape, the size of the stars themselves, the distance between them... basicaly you can create any game you like and choose who you want to play and play against.It has a randomised research tree, every game. So don't get comfortable with those awesome beam weapons, come the next game, you might be unlucky and not get that tech. There are some essential techs that every race gets, every game, like the very basic laser or mass driver tree. But each race has different probabilities of getting access to the much more advanced technologies that are in the various trees.The empire management is... basic, you colonise planets and they develop on their own, terraforming till they are suitable for your race, and building infrastructure. Some planets are so hostile that you can't even colonise them, although there are technologies that you might get access to that can improve the hazard they impose. Ship design is another interesting and fun part of the experience, as you pick different sections and weapons to put on your ships. Maybe you'd like a ship fully loaded with missles? Sure, go ahead, just be mindful that if the AI has a lot of point defense, that ship will be nearly pointless. So a lot of designing can revolve around what gets thrown against you, or what you come up against.Then, theres the random encounters... which is an option you can fiddle with in the game settings when you make the galaxy. Basically, it is what it says on the tin, a random encounter can range from a asteroid shower, which can wipe out a new colony, to getting attacked by slavers. But there are special types of encounters, which often turn out to be dangerous and can take massive fleets to stop. I'll give you an example of a grand menace I encountered in a game I played, The Peacekeeper. This dude comes into the map and travels to the center of the galaxy and makes a speech, telling you to stop all hostilities with each other and stop prodcution of war ships. Break these rules while he's on the map, and he attacks you. Sounds reasonable, right? Wrong, this guy is... holy mother of god frightening, he will literally tear your fleets to shreds, no matter what tech you have. Luckily, he doesn't discriminate and will love wailing on the AI as much as you if they step out of line.All in all, Sword of the Stars is an impressive, and addictive game, that is starting to show it's age graphically, but the fun factor and replayability keeps me coming back to it. I deffinitely reccommend this title to any 4X fans, and especially to space strategy fans. It's an easy to pick up game, thats difficult to master.			"

												Talk about a hidden jewel. This game has it almost all to become a legend; too bad it has not a big name like EA for publisher. You are missing some serious 4X fun if you pass this one. It has aged very well and is truly a benchmark on the genere. Don't believe me give it a shot and see for yourself.For me THIS is the perfect 4X game along ROME:Total War.PROS:-Has a nice tutorial and manual; not a steep learning curve.-Can appeal to a very broad audience; vets and newcomers alike.-AI plays reasonably well.-Races have it's strength and weaknesess very well represented.-Incredible modding capabilities; this is a highly replay value few other games have.-Most mods are available even today at the developer's forum and play smoothly.-Easy to set up mods and get rid of them.-Very stable; I had zero issues regarding system stability in Windows trhough XP to 8.-Mods enable to work wonders regarding the playable races.-Most 4X games are insanely difficult or plain dumb. This game can be configured to a healthy middle ground or not... your choice.-Very nice fleet management.-Some screenshots are awesome.-Very fun close battles and just perfect Electronic Warfare for your ships.-Has a depth you won't believe until you realize you spend a lot of time tinkering with the designs and fleet roster and you realize you enjoy it as much as the battles.-A true and worthy successor to Master of Orion 2.-Easily one of the most valued games judging by the price/quality ratio.-Empire management is a BREEZE, efficient, elegant and comprehensive.-Nice diplomatic stance and neutral roaming monsters (menaces).-Research is absolutely perfect.-The most polished and fluid UI alnost perfect.-Massive scale? hell yeah. Even has custom maps for a quick skirmish type play.-A game with some seriuos lore.-Should you want the AI to simulate the battle it can do it nicely.-Nice physics engine that won't ""CLIP""or clump your units. Actually you can use size as an advantage; more nimble and small vessels can outmanover largar ships for a nice and devious tactics.-Once you understand special weapons, intelligence and fleet layouts you are going to like it because it adds another depths to the tactical side that can cripple ""stronger"" empires.CONS:-No campaign.-AI can be seriously hampered by bad decisions, however this is rare.-Very hard to aim your long range weapon in some cases when a planet is between you and the enemy fleets. (your ships oblitarate a target on range though not always the ideal target).-Some designs are a little too restrictive, but you can manage with some creativity.-Somewhat dated graphics and sound effects.-Some weapons require manual launch and targeting but those weapons are very nice and nasty.As you can see a nice old school game that will knock your socks off should you manage to give it a chance. The cons are only minor and certainly won't matter once you give it a shot. Highly recommended.			"

												Okay, so I'm a decade late to the party, reviewing a game released back when I was in highschool. But I'll be damned if it isn't fun!The differences between the playable factions in the game are more than just the typical cosmetic or minor-boon types you find in many 4X games; every single faction has a wildly different playstyle because they all employ different forms of interstellar travel, and have different spreads of tech trees. There are a lot of random factors to the game that make every game different; planet hazard ratings, available techs, encounters, and star locations. But it is where there is NO randomness that makes the game stand out: Combat is done entirely in real-time with actual ballistics and NO die rolls - the only randomness comes from weapon spread cones. Population growth is predictable, travel speeds behave the same every time, and weapon damage is fixed. This perfect balance of where to have randomness and where not to is what makes SotS so enjoyable; despite the random factors, skill and tactics will always have the final say in victory.Toss in the amazingly detailed lore by Arinn Dembo, and you get a 4X game with a surprisingly engaging setting. The alien designs avert the usual boring ""bipedal humanoid recolors"" that plagues sci-fi; you've got clever reptilians, long bird-dragon-things, sentient insectoids, telekinetic cetaceans and rabid marsupials.Pity about the sequel, though. At least the spinoffs (The Pit, Ground Pounders, and Freehold) make up for it!			"

												Pros:A very deep strategy game combining slow paced turn based strategy with battles handled in a tactically rich real-time, so fans of either should find something to enjoy. Gameplay is smooth, Intuitive, and mostly bug-free at this point.There is seemingly limitless customization with a wealth of ship designs and weapons systems to implement all with their own strengths and weaknesses, countless tech options allowing you to customize your playstyle depending on what research you choose to specialize in, along with each playable race feeling truly unique in their playstyle. Multiple scenarios to play through with differing victory condition based on your race and/or faction within that race.Cons:The sheer amount of information on the screen and choices to make can be a little mind boggling at first but is fairly intuitive and doesn't take too long to learn. Graphics are a bit dated at this time but certainly acceptable. Music is forgettable but maintains a pleasant atmosphere in the game. The AI doesnt scale particularly well however often remaining pretty easy on any difficulty but you can offset that with handicaps while setting up the match. RNG tech availability can leave a game terribly unbalanced if you're extremely unlucky. Lack of a true 'story mode' may turn off some players.Overall a solid game that has given me hundreds of hours of entertainment long before it was available on steam,			"

												Sword of the Stars is the greatest Epic star conquest game ever made. The battles are fantastic (although they can run forever as you have to search for that last ship!). I really like the music and voice acting during the battles. The technology tree is awesome.Never mind my play time = I played for a huge number of hours long before Steam came along with this game.The random events can be a little harsh, however, so be careful. I especially hate the Star Crusher event as I have never been able to defeat it. It destroys a whole star system.I really liked this game. My Steam version was a gift although I had the regular copy as well.This game is Epic. I mean HUGE. You get to design ships, build ships and colonize new worlds. By the way, don't go overboard colonizing too many bad planets early = it costs upkeep to keep poor environment wolrds colonized and takes time to get those worlds better.There are many different races to play, each with their own star drive types. The Humans are actually the easiest to run for beginners since they use star lanes.Anyway, I hope you get emitters and ship armor in your tech tree = it makes the game easier. The technology tree is randomized each time you play.Sword of the Stars 1 is a great game.			"

												The best space 4x game there is. Total War... in space! In the turn based strategy layer you explore and colonize worlds, research and build spaceships. When two fleets meet you get real time battles.This game has great depth, where you have to manage refueling and repair, try to counter your opponents using techs on a tech tree that has random branches missing every game. You have to deal with random events and epic Grand Manaces and AI rebellions that can be far more dangerous than your opponents. The races are really different, each with its unique travelling method, strenths and weaknessess. All this is presented in a faily easy and intuitive way. An epic game.			"

												A galactic civilization sim with fleet combat and multi system resource management. For an older game it holds up amazingly well in its detail and the gravity of the battles. I especially recommend the complete collection for the variety of races and the ships relative to their race. Various scenarios and challenge levels and even third party gallactic threats loom when enough time passes.Internet multiplayer is down so hamachi or another LAN program will be needed. Oh, there's also simultaneous turns where the rounds progress when everyone concludes their turn as opposed to waiting for other players to finish before ever starting.There's even a wiki for the races if you're into that kinda additional info. The sequal does not measure up, we need a reboot to this awesomesauce!			"

												Basically Rome Total War in space. Only less buggy and you don't have to worry about ♥♥♥♥ing squalor(Diplomacy is still lacking, but who has time for that while commiting genocide on bird/fish/dog/ant/whateverthe♥♥♥♥tarkansare people?).Combat plays kind of like Star Wars: Empire At War, only MUCH more in depth. You can pin point exactly where you want your ships to fire and with what weapons. Every weapon has it's own use and even your basic destroyer class ships still have their uses end game.The research tree is race specific and semi-random, so although you do have a few technologies you can count on being there, don't always expect to get that Anti-Matter Missile Upgrade. However you can still salvage technology from enemy ships, so not all is lost. The tree itself is vast and makes you feel like you're playing pokemon(GOTTA LEARN THEM ALL!) for scientists. Unfortunately, finding out how something is effective requires either a google search or trial and error.I play on a Dual Pentium 2.3 ghz laptop with an integrated graphics card(♥♥♥♥ you Intel), and yet so far I have yet to hit a spot where framerate becomes an issue. However once an AI controls a large territory they take longer to figure what they do(so I assume) and so you get a 30 sec to 1 min delay in turns. Which is extremely frustrating when you are just trying to skip turns.I've played with the AI on normal difficulty and default economic settings and so far I've been able to take on empires twice my size(probably due to me beefing up my economy then research end game tech a little early and I did finish around 400-500 turns so not the quickest by any means). The time limit can be a curse when you are trying to comb the area for enemy units or simply trying to glass a planet.Great game, definitely something for those of you who want to conquer the galaxy, plenty of race variety and scenarios to make you replay this game.

Not perfect, but well thought and goodThe game Sword of the stars is a dated game. But even over time the shine of this jewel couldn't be dimmed.First, it has all the basic stuff that a 4X game should have, Exploration, Exploitation, Expansion and Extermination.Each of the races has their unique style of ship building and selection of Technology (which also might change slightly from playthrough to playthrough). Furthermore has each race their own needs of habitats, their own lore and most important, each has their strength and weakness. Keep those facts and specialities always in mind, because they will help you along the developement of your surpreme empire.And yes, that is the true objective in the game: ""Build your empire, expand it to the fringes of the galaxy and destroy all other races. If you involve random encounters be warned that they are quite challenging... and sometimes at an early level of developement travelling species can finish off your empire just at the start of the game. One thing that ticks me off was, that the game actually cheats. When you are starting with some races you will encounter (if played by AI) SolForce fleets early, sometimes build up to very impossible sizes (at least to normal construction). The other thing is the obvious non existence of diplomatic virtues, especially if you play with AI's against Humans are the most cheating, lying and betraying race of the game... (which actually might stem from reality... heheheheh).Pros:Nice Tactical Spacefights, you can give orders sit back and watch your results... while feverishly looking how your dreadnaught just breaks up by an massive attack of cruisers... Darn...The races are ""unique"", they are in depth described in the setup screen, with history, technology writeups and some lore.The Techtrees are randomized at start of the session, thus you might not always have the same technologies when you start an new game, some techs are race specific, take care and read the descriptions carefully.Cons:The game tends to cheat...Diplomacy is mostly fruitless during AI sessions, at least I had real troubles with the reliability of pacts...RecommendedEven with the game cheating, you still can win - you just have to prepare yourself with all racial capabillities and industrial might. More anoying is the diplomacy, which is only fun during games with human foes in a multiplayer game. The options of what you can say to the other players can at first be quite stunning, but believe me - it's more easier than you might think. Also a bit on the off side, though not really something to be negative is the ""one"" world per System solution... There would have been other options, but this is not implemented... Overall this is a playable fun game, which will bind you for a while on your computer, exploring the possibilities, the races and of course the technologies...If you are searching for a game that offers you lore, tactical and strategical possibilities, 4Xing and marvelous tactical Spacefights... this game would be a game for you.

												I can't recommend this enough. This is the most fun I've had with a 4x since Alpha Centauri. They implemented a lot of elegant solutions to reduce tedium and streamline management without losing depth or complexity. The UI is not intuitive largely because they kept it from being cluttered, as such the tutorials are highly recommended.Ship design was done very well. It is very satisfying to come up against an overwhelming opposition, make a few minor adjustments to a design and alter its tactics and come back and win not because you had bigger boots but because you used an effective strategy. There is a lot of depth to design, and variety is rewarded. Strategy in combat is very enjoyable as you are given plenty of useful tools. You can make a 2 tier setup with heavily fortified ships engaging close range and long range support keeping distance without having to constantly switch between the various groups to give orders. That might sound oversimplified, but it doesn't play itself. It simply gives tools that streamline basic tactics and the end result is a smarter and more fluid battle. Also, combat is simulated in engine, there are no behind the curtains dice rolls to verify hit and miss. If missiles get shot down, it's because anti-missile turrets hit their target. Furthermore, it is possible to target specific points on the enemy if you want to disable something specific, like getting behind the enemy and taking out their forward shields, or their engines. Combat is as tedious or simple as you choose to make it, and the end result is a rewarding experience.Diplomacy is available, but rather than assume you want to be friendly with the neighbors, the default is war, with alliances and NAP's being something you have to work for if that’s what your into. It's there if you enjoy the challenge of diplomacy, but its assumed you want to blow things up. With that said, any time you encounter a new player or AI for the first time your ships are set to hold fire, so the game respects the possibility of peace, but you must research their language and diplomatic options for them to be available.People say this is underrated, and I have to agree. I'm more than a little annoyed that I didn't find this gem until now.			"

												LAN support, tons of fun. Remember to look up the controls and how to play. I didn't know how to aim my ship's weapons for example, and it cost me quite a few battles. Left Click to aim, middle mouse to focus cam, and right click to move them (tactical).Playing with friends against the A.I. is so fun and an entire campaign can last days depending on when you can play. The best part is that the game isn't tedious, and yet has a lot of depth and strategy. Figuring out what your tech tree favors, deciding what planets to colonize, trade, and tactics play a huge role. Unlike quite a few games, you can customize your ships (which isnt really new but...) and when you get your squadron commanders you can decide how your ships deploy on the battlefield.Almost like a Total War game in Space.

												Great 4X space game. Every Race has a special means of traveling the Stars with Terran's [human's] Node Traveling being the easiest to instanly grasp but not very open to choice as the other races [You can only travel to linked Nodes thus your path is made for you]. This means knowing whom your enemies are, as a race, matters. Also small things that other Space 4X's forget like having to learn the language and psychology of alien races to actually speak efficiently with them or your reseach team not always delivering tech upgrades on schedule. Honestly, I could go on and on with the amount of small things that add up to make this game into a 'MUST BUY' for all 4x players and a 'OMFG WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT IT YET' for all 4X space lovers.

												Oh how I miss you, SOTS. The short answer is yes, you should totally buy this game if you enjoy any 4x game. The long answer...The way combat is handled in this game is supurb. There's absolutely no game on the market that offers this in a 4x game properly. You enter a manual engagement with pre-defined fleet formations (if you have a command vessel with the fleet) and can manually control literally every aspect of a battle. Due to how the game calculated raw attack power, sometimes manually shielded ships won't work in auto combat, so it's quite advantagous to actually manually fight.Other than that, the sound, and atmospherics of the game are great. The graphics are a bit dated, but that's to be expected. No multiplayer support anymore (without using third party software) or else I'd still play it with friends. Gameplay is pretty standard for a 4x for the exception of environmental rating being the ""Habitable"" vs ""Non-habitable"", (closer to 0, the better).			"

												The “Test of Time” Award - should go to Sword of the Stars: Complete Edition.The space 4X king in my book. It mixes engaging variety like different factions having a very unique game style, or the organic tech tree that has a % of chance of even having the possibility of researching a tech + faction specific techs + tech aptitude of the race included in itself with a very good balance. Then there’s all the wonderful things you will love (or hate) like random events that can be pretty massive and universe shattering. With graphics that really still can make it without hurting your eyes in 2016. And my favorite part - Multiplayer which lets you enjoy this great game with your friends and frenemies.			"

												Prepare for a long game. If you only like short games, go away. If you like long games that can be replayed, even being forced to change your tactics because the tech tree isn't guaranteed to be fully available, yet remains fully viable, play this.There's lots of replayability in this game. Some features only work with players because the AI isn't capable of using them (I'm looking specifically at joint science projects), but for the most part the AI is as capable as any human opponent. The different drive modes each race has at their dispoasl also results in tremendously different tactics based on race, which means just changing your race can give you a completely different experience. The ship design is also able to greatly change how your game experience will be, as default ship designs with default loadouts, while fine, can be varied to an incredible degree to better suit your personal playstyle. You prefer missiles, and lots of 'em? Load up with corrosive missiles, maybe. Lasers more your style? Battle bridge and blazer mission section. Small craft your thing? Use drones, especially if you have access to the C.O.L. upgrade to launch them straight at your foes at high speed.But whatever you do, seriously, prepare for a long game, especially on the largest maps. Personally, I love that, but I know not everyone does, so be forewarned, we're talking a game in this runs more like a tournament in RTS.			"

												Make no mistake; Sword Of The Stars is the BEST 4X game I have ever played. It is the only game on the market that has such a unique and satisfying combination of macro, micro, customization, and even both RTS and turn based strategy. Civ V? less than two hours. C&C Red Alert3? A little more. Anno 2070? Quite a bit. And Supreme Commander? LOTS. But none of them can compare with the grandeur of SOTS and its three expansions. From the map to starting budgets and tech trees, no two games will be the same, and very few will last less than 100 turns. Out of any strategy title, if you were to purchase any, I would recommend this.On top of the gameplay, it's the little things that make this game so memorable and nostalgic (I originally found my first copy of SOTS at a used book store around age 8). From the dated button sounds and the laughable one-liners voice acted by who I can only assume were family and friends, finishing a campaign in the lore-rich scenario mode is so satisfying, it pains me that this game isn't as popular as it should be. GET THIS GAME.Not SOTS II though, that makes me cry :(			"

												Well, after some 20 hours, I feel I finally understand how to play the game. It's actually pretty good and well worth the effort, but unless you're willing to put in that kind of time, it's going to be confusing. The documentation gives a good overview, and there are tutorials, but neither really prepares you to play the game. They talk about Command and Control ships, for example, but don't tell you how vital they are; they talk about formations but don't make it clear how to set them up. Nor will you likely be able to play the real-time combat without reading the documentation very carefully and making sure that you have the keyboard shortcuts clear in your mind. There are also odd design decisions, and the ship are definitely low polygon models, but all told, the gameplay far outweighs these negatives.Sword of the Stars is a 4X space exploration, colonization and conquest game released in 2009, and what sets it apart is the ship customization and that the real-time combat is very detailed and depicts the nature of the weapons during combat, graphically but also in terms of their power, range, rate of fire and accuracy. You can also target individual components on enemy ships to blast out the most important weapons, or perhaps to disable the ship to take it over with a boarding crew. In addition, there are various defenses for different sort of weapons and you can see these in operation as well.The tech tree is sensible, interesting and mostly useful, and has significant depth. Each of the six races shares this tech tree with the exception of their FTL drives, and surprisingly, this detail alone makes the races significantly different to play. The Hiver ships, for example, are horribly slow but they can create a gate for instant teleportation to any other gated system, making their defense second to none. The Morrigi, on the other hand, can fly up to 10x faster than the Hivers, and so can raid almost anybody before they can bring in reinforcements. Their speed increases with the number of ships in the fleet, though, meaning that their defense is often quite weak.In addition to combat, you have to manage your economy and you can engage in diplomacy and a limited form of spying as well, but in my estimation, the combat is the defining feature of the game, as your objective is always to take over the place. And that will take you hours, even in modest systems with 50 or so stars. With hundreds of stars, games will take you days.Lastly, the internet multiplayer aspect has long since been disabled, and so you either play solo against multiple AI opponents, or on a Lan against friends. Fortunately, the AI is decent enough to keep you challenged for a fair while.			"

												- I almost didn't buy this game because the trailer is awful. I came to check it out because I'd read about it on forums when I was specifically looking for a 4X game with good space combat.-I found the top notch space combat but almost walked away from the game 15H in due to the lack of tooltips and tutorial which had no idea how to actually tutor.-After looking things up online and reading forums etc. on the game I started to really, really enjoy it.What you have here is a game that at its core is actually an excellent game. It had the best space combat out of any 4X by FAR, and better combat in terms of controlling a group of units than any other game I've played. I love the interactions of the technologies on the ships and the way that every shot is individually calculated.All of the races are very very balanced against each other despite all having a unique playstyle that absolutely does affect how you play them. What technologies you choose to research has definitive effects strategically or in combat (depending on the type of technology of course). Especially in combat, none of the techs are a simple ""hey, you had 20 attack, now you have 24"" type of lazy game design. Instead, you get new weapons that fire in different ways that you simply need to use and observe in order to understand how to use them effectively. That can influence what other technologies you research in order to compliment those. For example, maybe you research the anti-ballistics deflectors for your ships. That might mean you want to research energy weapons to equip those ships with so that their shields don't stop friendly ship's shots from getting through when you have them in close formation.Alternately, maybe you want to research really fast, maneuverable ship sections and equip them with ballistic weapons to run around in wolfpacks, knocking enemy ships off course and pummeling them to death. Or, maybe you simply want ships that have a good top speed and are equipped almost solely with missles and point defence to kite enemies and kill them from a distance.It all makes a difference and it all changes how to effectively play with the ships.In this game you're able to have fairly large fleets, but the battles are capped to what are a manageable number of ships by a certain number of control points that determine how many ships you can have on the screen in a battle. You'll learn you need to research CnC kinds of technologies in order to send control ships into battle and determine what your initial fleet layout is and what ships come into battle as reinforcements.There are even cool extra details like crappy ships like tankers explode when they're dying, so you learn that you can suicide them into enemy attack balls in order to do big AOE damage and soften them up to make use of your worst fighting ship in a very good way and turn the tide of a battle where the odds are against you into your favor. Or, you can kite the enemy ships, keeping them out of range of where they can bombard your planet while your planet based surface to space missles slowly pick their ships off.The tactical options are pretty endless and they're really up to you. 90 hours in as of the time of this review and I haven't even started using languages and diplomacy and I barely understand how the trade system in the game works.The game really needs a lot of explanation about how its mechanics work and that's it's biggest flaw, but the underlying mechanics themselves are rock solid and it's a great game. I can only imagine how good this game would've been with a larger team to give it more polish and some good marketing behind it.			"

												Simply put one of my Favorite 4X strategy games to date, why you ask? well the game has a very large MoO3 feel to it and that game took up alot of my childhood,,,and i didnt even know what i was doing. The tech tree is also rather intruiging as it doesnt stay the same. sometimes you can research a tech and sometimes sometimes you cant which gives the game a little more challenge. the combat is also pretty interesting although i do feel like they are a bit too strict about the amount of units you can have fighting as it seems a little too few even with the Command and Control ships.as for the diplomacy i think this is one of the more interesting takes on it. after all it makes sense to have to research an alien language before you can speak it, that being said they do tend to decline or betray a little often. lastly the races (as far as i can tell so far) are reasonably balanced and there is no ""pick this race and win"" but the randomised tech tree can make it seem so.TL;DR version: The game is good and not trying it when you claim to like 4X games gets your cookies conviscated			"

												One of the best 4x titles out there (definitely my favorite).* TONS of cool stuff to play around as space stations, lasers, beamers, rail guns, mines, planetary plagues, stealing technologies from other races, trading, cloaking, raiding, there is just no end!* Parallel turn resolution* Unique races with custom movement type* GREAT customization of ships (in terms of modules that play a vital role in battles)* Deep battles (where ship speed, rotation, turret tracking, unit selection, matter a lot!)* Meaningful research topics (not just some +10% this, -3 to that)* Terrifying random encountersThere are things that you can not like very much like: lack of keyboard rebinding, lacking quality of life UI features, slower turns resolution in long games. But these really don't ruin the great experience from this game.			"

												Although my record says 7 hrs, I owned the game way before it went steam and got around 400+ hrs gameplay sink in this endavour. This is by far the most unique 4X gaming experience for me and I consider it as the most immersive. I absolutely dig the SoTS lore that is in fact extremely deep and enjoyable to dive into. The graphics, although not so flashy as in newer products, suits the game very well and those dialogue lines! Still give me shivers while playing as the mythical Morrigi or the insatiable Hivers :)You get a lot of replayability since each race has different mechanics and randomised tech trees for each playthrough while some random effects (i.e. von Neumann attacks) can tip the balance of power even lategame, especially on higher difficulty levels. Speaking of difficulty levels - at higher settings the AI is very, very good and will keep you on your toes uneasy about your borderworlds safety. The most memorable moment for me would be the construction of my first projector dreadnought with extreme effort and seeing it and it's escorts shred to bits in the second battle to a swarm Zuul fleet. Yeah, the learning curve is quite steep and makes it a real challenge to master.Unfortunately, the second part is not as fun and I could not make myself to like it. As some people stated below - SoTS I mechanics with SoTS II engine would be really great to see in my library.As far as cons go I would say that automanage functions and diplomacy could work better.Highly recommended if you are looking for a deeply immersive, complex and unique 4X experience in an obscure and mythical setting. I played a lot of strategy games since 1997 and I have to say that as far as the gaming experience goes, the only other 4X games that have similar feel to it are Illwinter's Dominions series and Amplitude's Endless Legend.This is a very rare gem. The game is still very enjoyable for me to play in 2016 - 9/10.			"

												Addictive. Think Sins of a Solar Empire meets Stars. Still in development, and improving as far as I have been reading. Engrossing 4x game. Turn based strategy and a choice of simulating or fighting out your battles in a 3D battlefield. Much like the Total War series. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loved playing Masters of Orion, Stars or would like a Total War in space.  8/10 - Play regularly.			"

												After all these years this remains the go to 4x space combat game. The combat is a joy and the variation in research routes - especially with the return of the idea that not all research is open every game - makes for interesting and replayable campaigns. The strategy overview is on the light side, especially on planetary development, but actually this works in the game's favour, as combat is what it is all about. At times there can be too much of it, but the joy of seeing your new weapons come into the fray is hard to beat, and it is one of the few games where zooming in to watch the action is well worth it. Probably it is most comparable to the Total War series but in space, but with a bit less meaningless combat (though it does still become heavy at times). Seriously recommend you add one of the more popular mods for even more weapon and ship options.What's it worth? £25 / $30			"

												Great game with a lot of replayability due to how different the races play compared for each other along with a semi-random tech tree that makes some playthroughs easier or harder, and pretty fun RTS combat that can be tweeked by the player for their needs in terms of the round time limit along with a really streamlined and easy to understand Ship Building system that, while not as extensive as the Galactic Civilizations series ship creation system, it still has a lot of options and customization in terms of loadout and section choice. While I'm at it, there's a ton of customization options for game setup, ranging from galaxy shape, amount of explorable planets, number of players, etc. along with the previous randomization leaves this game with a ton of replay value along with a lot of fun with friends. I feel obligated to mention that currently the main online servers are shut down at the time of this writing, but LAN is still always an option, so if that's your cup of tea, you're in luck! Anyways, Sword of the Stars is a really addicting game that has eaten weekends of my life that I don't regret losing that time in the least. Hope this has been helpful.			"

												Not sure if it is a good place to start with 4X space games due to steep learning curve (isn't it always for this type of games though? and it's part of the initial fun.. I do miss some step-by-step fully controlled scenario to teach you the basics tho) and UI design that I find somewhat lacking (which is unfortunate).But I recommend checking this title out for bunch of interesting features!It has actual 3D galaxy map with 6 races to play, each with their own mode of transportation that changes the way you look at the galaxy (most map flavors still favor 2D tho).Interesting twist is randomized research tree - can't count on every tech being available every time, besides some core selection.Empire management is turn based while skirmishes are real time, time limited. You can autoresolve, but the rts fights are big part of the game and offer on their own strategic/tactical opportunities. Unwieldy a bit, but intentionally to some extent at first - some tech research improves it!			"

Has both turn-based strategy and real-time battles combined into one game.  I promise you will keep playing this until your hands come off and your eyes falls out.**EDIT**I still very highly recommend this game. This game is still fun to play now as it was back then. 1 of the 6 races is literally dragons in space. I recommend for new players to set random encounters to 55% when they start a game because they can be overwhelming pretty fast. Dragons in space are in this game. There are also a good number of scenarios that are challenging but adds some backstory to enjoy. Did I mention that there are dragons in this game? Dragon in space?			"

												Unexpectedly good. The graphics are a bit dated but good enough for me and it runs like a dream with max hard A.I. players. The races have interesting lore and the randomized tech tree stuff is pretty cool. The strategic play is turn based like any 4x game. Nothing too special there (though my largest pet peeve about the game is how annoying it is to move around. You can only do so by selecting something and zooming towards it. No arrow keys or mouse movements over the map. After a while you get used to it though). It has some fairly straightforward mechanics for a complex game which is always a plus. It took me about six hours without any tutorials to get used to it. The game is great because of the ship customization and tactical combat. With three ship classes with a few dozen different modifications for the three ship sections you can create hundreds of different unique ships. The tactical play is RTS and is generally quite fun. The only annoying part is how the ships A.I. sometimes don't account for one another and you get friendly fire. However the need for fuel makes moving fleets a tricky business and I genuinely feel like I'm running a large scale military campaign when I play this game. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who might like a space strategy game with RTS elements or turn based strategy. As long as you don't mind some rather odd controls and dated graphics then it's an excellent and easy to run game. Just do not ever get the second one.			"

												An absolutly FANTASTIC space empire builder with incredible and unique gameplay tactics. This game deserves so much more attention than it gets. There are aspects of this game that I didnt even know about until I was knee deep into its fascinating and complex gameplay. The game has several unique factions with distinctly different playstyles and ships. This game can be played with complete naivity to the deep internal complexities and still be an enjoyable blast but if you dive headfirst into the amazing and complex inner workings of the game it turns into something completely different with almost complete control over every fascit of your empire. Coupled with the strong gameplay comes a unique randomness involved with strange alien incounters and battles againts grand menaces who threaten the entire universe. The randomness also extends into research forcing you to adapt and change your strategy around which researches are granted to you and which ones arnt. It is completely up to you whether you want to be the distant underinvolved monarch or the controlling tyrant who wields his power with an absolute hand. Its completely up to you how build and create your galactic empire. Oh and did I mention COMPLETE REPLAYABILITY with enough RNG integrated into the game to make each and every playthrough feel completely different and lets you expierience a whole new kind of game every time you play it. So far playing through it my only complaint is sometimes the AI get so massive it takes the game about 30 seconds to process their turns. 9.8 out of 10.			"

												a brillant 4X strategy game fun if you want to spend hours on a single set of battle going from planet to planet wiping out enemy after enemy.the game is a semi turn-based semi real-time game. the way it does this is the strategic map most people will probably call it the galactic map is done by a turn-based system similar to the galaxy at war from battlefront or empire at war. while the battle are all real-time tactics with  limited reinforcements and ship positioning actually mattering. weapons have indivudual firing arcs and some ship sections cannot contain weapon slots leaving certain angles of a ship it's blind-spot.you can fully customise your ships changing their weapon loadout's ship sections even choosing whether they have shields or different armour types.

												Sword of the Stars is a Grand Strategy game in space, very much along the lines of Master of Orion or Galactic Civilizations.  While it may not be as pretty or as polished as Galactic Civilizations, its mechanics are solid and the game is fun.  The tech tree is interesting and provides a few innovations, like the idea that your civ might miss out on certain techs and have to work with what you have.  Combat is very interesting, as it involves some real-time giving of orders (such as targeting spcific parts of enemy ships).  For the most part, though, it follows the same basic model as Gal. Civ.The downside of this game is that the interface can be kind of clumsy, it is fairly hard to learn, it lacks a Story Mode, and it just generally could use a bit more UI and graphics polish.			"

												Unexpectedly good. The graphics are a bit dated but good enough for me and it runs like a dream with max hard A.I. players. The races have interesting lore and the randomized tech tree stuff is pretty cool. The strategic play is turn based like any 4x game. Nothing too special there (though my largest pet peeve about the game is how annoying it is to move around. You can only do so by selecting something and zooming towards it. No arrow keys or mouse movements over the map. After a while you get used to it though). It has some fairly straightforward mechanics for a complex game which is always a plus. It took me about six hours without any tutorials to get used to it. The game is great because of the ship customization and tactical combat. With three ship classes with a few dozen different modifications for the three ship sections you can create hundreds of different unique ships. The tactical play is RTS and is generally quite fun. The only annoying part is how the ships A.I. sometimes don't account for one another and you get friendly fire. However the need for fuel makes moving fleets a tricky business and I genuinely feel like I'm running a large scale military campaign when I play this game. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who might like a space strategy game with RTS elements or turn based strategy. As long as you don't mind some rather odd controls and dated graphics then it's an excellent and easy to run game. Just do not ever get the second one.			"

												This game is a beautiful, ugly mess. You know, there's never really been a true sucessor to Masters of Orion II. Even though that game came out in the 90s, it's still the best by virtue of doing everything better than everyone else. Moo2 has sat lonely on its throne of 'Best Space 4X', and only rarely have there ever been pretenders. This game is one of them. This game deviates from a lot of Space 4Xs on how radically different each race plays. While most 4X games differentiate species by simple bonuses and ship designs, SotS goes further by changing the very way civilizations travel the stars. Humans can go fast, but their routes are limited. Tarka can go anywhere, but are slow. Hiver have to get to starts via STL, but can construct instal-travel warp gates once they're there. It also changes wars from outright conflicts of extermination by introducing the concept of alien civilians. No longer is it one species standing on the top of the hill at the end, but possibly all the ones you've integrated into your empire either by conquest or peaceful immigration. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't have that muche effect on the strategic level, but it's a nice detail I've never really seen in other games. There's also the matter of the combat system, which is very solid. Every species ship plays different, and there's even space monsters you get to shoot at to make things interesting. This game also has some of the most detailed lore I think I've seen in any 4X *ever*. Arinn Dembo, who worked on the story of Homeworld, has probably written a novel's worth of backstory to each species, and still posts stuff about it from time to time. It's the extra mile that makes this game special, despite its flaws.Now, the bad: this game is ugly. Horrendously ugly. The interface is one of the worst you'll ever see, and a lot of the ""art"" seriously looks like something from a teenager's deviantart account. The AI is notoriously prone to temper tantrums, and will declare war on you for very minor things while they're literally destroying your outer colonies. Even though the battlescape is good, ships do have a tendency to ignore your orders or do them completely wrong, The Autoresolve feature for the battlescape is hilariously broken, and you can win battles with it you'd otherwise lose your entire fleet to. Like I said, beautiful mess. It's a game you have to give several chances, but I think it deserves them.			"

												A spiritual successor to Master of Orion that uses a Total War series style blend of turn-based strategy and real-time tactics. The strategy layer is superb compared to the usual micromanagement quagmire favoured by MoO successors, as in things not neccessary to designing, producing and deploying fleets of ships simply do not get in your way.Sometimes the combat layer is fiddly, particulay with small arc heavy beam weapons but it works well enough plus you can see every burning impact crater on that planet you're glassing.The extensive lore available for each alien race, each with a unique play style, plus the randomised tech tree gives the game an above average amount of depth and replayability. If you like sci-fi grand strategy or even just 4X games (e.g. Civilisation) then this is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ TL;DR buy			"

												It's very similar to Sins of a Solar Empire and Galatic Civilizations. The tech tree is gigantic. The user interface is good. The controls, you get use to. The AI is quite good and the fact that you can research and design the ships, is awesome. This game back in the day must have been allot of fun. I am dsappointed that there are no carriers in this game. I would love to take control of an attack frighter similar to Wing Commander Amada (A game ahead of it's time). The single player aspect is almost non existing. This game was designed for multiplayer action and that's the problem. You can set up a lan or direct connect connection, but no WWW. Why? Because they relied on Gamespy for their serves, which doesn't exist anymore. They can easily patch the game, so we as players could host games on the internet but noooo. Without that patch, I really can't recommend the game. As a single player game, you will get a play through but without any friends to play with, the game becomes stale very fast. The mod community is still active, which can bring some new life into this game. http://wiki.swordofthestars.com/sots1/Main_Pagehttp://www.kerberos-productions.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=23https://sourceforge.net/projects/sotssaveditor/files/ "

												One of my favorite games of all time: turn based empire-building with total-war esqe real time tactical battles. The game has a randomized tech tree keeps things interesting, though the chance of a faction getting a particular tech is based on the race they are playing asThe battle AI is reasonable for the time and is still comparable to today's strategy games and the Empire AI is good; able to keep up with the player at the various difficulty settings and is responsive to the composition of your fleets (players are able to gather data on the tech on enemy ships over time and the AI can do this too) and your overall power relative to them: if they are stronger than you they will try to destroy fleets then your colonies, if they are weaker by a large margin they will avoid your fleets and attack unprotected colonies and comparable enemies will do whichever the AI's race would be more incline to do.Diplomacy options are rather limited, but it is a 4X game with a focus on gunboat diplomacy, so I can't really fault it on that.Edit: It should be noted that my steam hours are far short of my actual time spent playing this game.

												In my first hours in game i ran into some king of bug horde. They proceeded to destroy most of my fleet and my colonies. They murdered my people and made my cities into nests for their queens. I would lose every battle with only takng out a few of their ships. I sent a colony ship into deepspace in hopes that they would find a planet while we were eradicated. BUT just as i had given up hope, My research team finished reseraching Dreadnuaght class ships. I, in a last ditch effort built one and sent it to my former colony to clense the bug scum festering there. The battle was long but in the end i was able to destroy their local fleet, their hive and one of the queens. The Dreadnaught and all crew were lost however. This was my first victory against the vermin. I began mass producing dreadnuaghts and sending them to purge the bug filth. One by one i reconquered my colonies, which major cassualties on my side. and eventually the last hive was destroyed. There was still some kind of super queen still out there however, I onky ran into her once and after the last hive was destroyed i had not seen her so i assumed she was gone for good. I Began rebuilding my empire and put this whole thing behind me. Couple hours later i check up on my Colony ship, yes the same one, and noticed that they found a nice planet to settle. I settled a colony and a few hours later my ally requested help with defending a planet. i send some ships and what do i find? a Giant Bug Super Queen wrecking my allie's fleet. FMLTL;DR Got Independence dayed by Space Bugs.9/10 would almost go extinct again.Actual review time: Not much of a steep learning curve like other Paradox games. Its not going to compete with stellaris but its still a great game. "

												Sword of the stars is amazing. The graphics are great, the multiplayer connect is a wee bit glitchy (probably just my computer) but once the game is active the universe is yours! The research tree is a cool function and combat is great, i have played this more than any other game in my library, the different factions completely change the gameplay, and it has yet to crash or lag. Each game is completely different than the last. At the start you can tinker with so many things to change the gameplay even further. I have no objections, which is for me a very rare occurence.

The game has so much content you are going to spend hours of your time just finding out and it's suprisingly fun. However, this game is not for everybody, players who want nonstop action should not play it. Even if you played games like sins of solar empire and other space empire building games SOTS is a lot different.			"

												I have logged some decent hours on this game and I have to admit, this is one of the most solid games in the 4X genre.In comparison to other games of the modern day, I will try to explain my views in comparison to the others.Endless Space: Solid 4X game but has no real time combat where you can control your ships.  Combat is determine through a cinematic trailer of ships facing off via broadside battles and selecting a ""Buff Card"" for three different phases of combat.  Not exactly my cup of tea but still a fun game.StarDrive 2:  Best way to put this, 2d Version of a wannabe SoTS game.  No multiplayer and tends to bog up late game on a large map.  Tech tree is horrid in comparison.Galactic Civ 3:  Played the beta for a little while, when I found out that you can control ships in combat I ditched the game.Sword of the Stars 2:  Stay away from this game...There was a fallout between the producer and developer.  In honest opinion, Ironclad as someone previously stated should have made the game.Sins of a Solar Empire:  Massive like SoTS but pure RTS with real time combat.  ZERO ship customization.So if you like a game where you have hundreds of stars to conquerIf you like a game where theres an expansive and random tech tree for each game,IF you like a game where you have nearly 100% control over the customization of ships weapon placements and designs (except for hulls, they are prefab), this is the game.SoTS to me remains the BEST 4X game.  Never played MOO or MOO2 so I cant compare.			"

												The game is good. It suffers from a high learning curve and a somewhat boring endgame, like many 4X titles do.Once the game is ""won"" and the enemies are utterly dominated, it will take many long turns to actually finish the game.Despite this, if you are willing to accept the learning curve, I'd say the early game is one of the best any 4X game has to offer.Definitely worth 10 €			"

												Less than expected here.  Nothing glaringly wrong in the little time I've played it, all the things you'd want are there and the tutorial is somethat passable.  That said, the UI is a bit clunky, the races uninspired, the combat pretty blase'.  It doesn't help that virtually nothing in the research tree is quantified so you'll just be shooting blind in the dark with the ""I guess this might be helpful"" approach.  Ship design is something I love, but once again a very detailed system is rather ruined by unquantified data or no data altogether when it comes to weapon damages, power outputs etc.  The combat was a letdown with clunky controls that don't even have toolbar tip rollover as an option on the rather sparse control options.  There is no option to create a custom civ here.  Maybe I'll come back to it and find something more redeeming in this game, I hope I do, but I kinda doubt it.  6.0			"

												So far I'm not impressed.    The controls are clunky, the map is horrible and hard to manipulate, and the civilization development options are near to zero.   After a few dozen turns, your human empire will look more or less the same as anyone else's human empire.And what someone else said about random events being game crippling?  they weren't kidding.  In all  of my initial games, the ratio of usable words to worlds where some giant monstrosity was lurking to kill all my ships was about 1 to 2 in their favor.  Once it even went so far as to hide the alien threat until a colony ship showed up, -then- it attacked and wiped me out after I thought I was safe.I will admit, the combats are a lot more interactive, but this fact is lessened when all you can really do is hope all your ships don't die before you can blow off that one turret, then wait for the next batch of ships to come in for the next turret, and so on.

												I really wanted to like this game, since its one of the better 4x games I've played. Still, I have to give it a negative review. There are two main problems that absolutely drive me nuts, the first being that the game AI just crushes you with its computational power. Even on smaller maps, there is just way too much to keep track of, and towards the middle and end of the game it just becomes incredibly tedious. The AI consistently manages to outpace on all stats, which I think might be in part due to the fact that there are alot of really worthless techs in the game. It has a really annoying learning curve because of that, which is my second main complaint. Techs that might seem useful end up being totally worthless, and it takes awhile to figure out which are crucial, and which are just wasting time. Also, what level of hazard do you colonize, and when? (With what level of technology) This is also a process of trial and error, since there is no way to calculate exactly when a colony will become profitable based on X number of colonizers times Y technology divided by Z hazard. The balance between races is also pretty off, and you will most likely want to stick to only 3 races out of the 6 or so available.  This game would probably be alot more fun on multiplayer and in any case, is definitely not for the casual gamer.			"

												The tech tree is randomized at the beginning of the game, so important techs may be unavailable to you.  The quality of planets near your homeworld varies greatly with each game.  When combined with the randomized tech tree the means the initial state of the game has significant impact on how the game progresses.Too much micro-management of ships and fleets.  The only way to measure distance between star systems is to have a ship in one of the systems and try to move to the other.  The transition to combat is jarring as the ships usually start out in weapon range, only one of the ships in your fleet is selected, and the camera isn't usually set to give you an optimal view of what is going on.The number of defense platforms that can be built in a system depends on the physical size of the planet, which makes small planets doubly bad since they also have a lower population limit.

												Wasn't for me.There seems to be a big debate about people who think the 3D star map is awful or the best thing about the game. I was really disoriented by it and in my first few games spent as much time just reorientating the map as I did actually playing the game. Beyond that it was still very frustrating. Techs offer vague bonuses (""Stronger Hulls"" - How much stronger?) the combat system is fairly obtuse (There are 4 options for your combat stance when you enter battle but two of them seem to garauntee being blown up without firing a shot if your opponent feels differently).I'd honestly love to play the game if it would just tell me accurate information. With one race you can tell a ship to move beyond its actual range but the game will still give you an ETA. ""5 Turns"". Well, no, it would be 5 turns if the ship actually made it there, really it's 3 turns of movement and infinite waiting until you send a tanker out to refuel. The map shows part of the trip in red to inform you that you won't make it, but sometime ths amount of red is so small that you cann't see it unless you're zoomed in point blank to where you're traveling.All in all I look at the game and want to love it as sort of a Civ meets homesworld, but 3 hours in I haven't had 5 minutes that I would call fun.

Sometimes a roll of the dice sends a Dreadnaught class ship -- that you are completely defenseless against -- straight to your capital world only 32 turns into the game. Sometimes your colony is wiped out by a random menace that you had no way of detecting. So, it's not perfect. Oh and the voice acting is awful, with a hint of racism.

												Certainly a game like this is not for everyone.  The game is turn based which is a rare thing these days.  Basically it is an empire manager, not unlike Rome Total War or a Civilization game.  The majority of the game takes place in the “Strategic View” which allows you to manage your empire, fleets, economy, diplomacy, etc.  All combat does take place in a real time battle though (these can be autoresolved).  With the expansion sets there are a total of 6 playable races, and each has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, different visual and audio themes, along with unique ships and engines which totally alter how you play the game.  The lore behind each of the races is very impressive as well, I only wish we saw it more directly in game rather than just as text.  But the game is good, fun, long, slow.  I like to sit down and get like a nice hot chocolate and just play armchair admiral (or emperor) for a few hours with it.  The interface can be hard to use at times though.			"

I love the beam weapons in the game, and the particle effects are good looking too.you can target specific parts of enemy ships to disable weapons and engines and such, and all the ships have damage models so the parts that break ""blow off"" and float about. also spots on ships that get hit by big ordinance get marked and sometimes vent into space. the camera in the battle mode isn't the best but you get used to it.  the only thing they could have done to make this game better was have hulks for bigger ships blowing up.buy this game.

												Honestly, this is probably one of the best 4x games I've played.  And, thinking about it, I'd have to say the biggest strength as to why it's good is its straight forward design that offers a lot of depth, which makes the game pretty easy to pick up and learn but quite difficult to master.  For example, rather than having dozens of resources and currencies to manage, such as production, science, faith, diplomatic capital, food, trade goods, and so on, you only have one resource:  credits.  All of your colonies produce credits once they're going and everything cost credits.  It's very easy to get a handle on, but managing that budget between your research, ship production, fleet maintenance, colonization, and everything else optimally definitely takes a lot of knowledge and practice.  Everything else in the game is more or less like this.  Everyone is at war by default and not being at war takes some active effort on your part, such as talking to your opponents in chat during multiplayer rather than setting up pre-defined treaties for pre-defined durations.  Star systems have only one planet and colonies have no buildings to build, just some terraforming and infrastructure to automatically build.  And so forth.  ...there are some exceptions that are a little obtuse.  I've never really figured out how to use spies effectively and, while I'm sure I could eek out some edge in managing civillian populations, default settings work just fine.  But what you can do within all that is staggering.  Although there's only three classes of ships, they can be customized to a crazy degree.  So you want a long-range attacker?  You don't research the technology to build an ""Imperial Missile Cruiser"" unit, instead you put the design together yourself, tweaking it based on your own needs and what you've researched.   Want to execute a specific strategy to assault?  Arrange the ships in your fleet and adjust your reinforcements and then have them do that rather than relying on numbers to hopefully do it for you.  Need to crush an opponenty but can't hold the territory?  Engaged in a sorched earth campaign and have mining ships strip resources from the colonies you defeat so the planets become worthless and you don't need to worry about holding the point.Some other tidbits is there's tons of customization options to set-up your game, making for a unique experience every time on its own.  On top of that, each of the races play vastly differently by virtue of different modes of travel.  This isn't like... Civ V where a race has two units and a perk to slightly distinguish it.  No, playing the Zuul might as well be a different game entirely from the Hivers, who both are entirely different from playing Morrigi.  And on top of that, the tech tree is somewhat randomized, meaning you have to adapt based on what's available.  Each species has areas they're more likely to get techs in than others, like the Liir get lots of energy weapons usually but struggle on ballistics, but it's not a 100% given.  If you find yourself without a tech you want, you'll have to adapt your strategy and perhaps wage war with someone who has it in hopes you can steal it.  Or maybe trade for it instead if you're friendly.  ...this, admittedly, isn't for everyone, but it really makes each experience more unique.Oh, and also, combat is real time.  This might be a little off-putting for some, but it's pretty easy to control.  You can aim at any point on a ship so, if you wanna blow out its engines, you can.  Heck, aim can even be precise enough that you can strip individual guns off of ships to get an edge against them!  There's been times where I've taken advantage of this features to cripple fleets I stood no chance against, leaving them stranded in uninhabited systems with no repair, forcing the owner to keep paying for useless ships or scrap them for little to no return all the while I flee to the safety of my colonies.Also, one feature I wonder why other games still don't include:  end of turn count down.  Instead of ending instantly, you get three seconds to change your mind.  I can't tell you how many times this has saved me from forgetting to do something on a crucial turn.  Why does this not exist in other games?The game does have its downsides, however.  Multiplayer is kind of shot since the servers were knocked out a few years ago by the third party host being utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to the devs of this game and others.  However, using direct connect or VPN, it's still certainly possible, just makes it hard for you to find games with randoms.  Meanwhile, the A.I. gets a bit... predictable.  Difficulty only buffs or nerfs their income, they behave the same otherwise.  Expect them to lob massive fleets of outdated crap at you frequently rather than scrapping it to make something that'll stand a chance, always charge  into close range, ignore certain weapons, be very flaky at keeping their peace treaties (unless it's the Morrigi... sometimes), and rush certain techs even before its feasible to do so.  ...on the bright side, they're not entirely stupid as they will research techs and design ships that attempt to counter whatever you're spamming to keep you playing honest.  And, really, they're actually quite good at doing that, enough they can nullify your entire fleet if you're relying on just one type of weapon....all in all though, why are you still reading?  If you like 4X, get this game and get it now.  Kerberos has hypothetically discussed a possible HD remake, but they've openly stated that, if it even does happen, they've not started working on such a thing.  So, if you want to wait for something like that... don't because it'll be a looooong time.			"

												This is a great turn-based 4x game. Each faction is unique, and there are several random elements to make replayability extremely high.The game can get downright unfair at times. Sometimes a roll of the dice sends a Dreadnaught class ship -- that you are completely defenseless against -- straight to your capital world only 32 turns into the game. Sometimes your colony is wiped out by a random menace that you had no way of detecting. So, it's not perfect. Oh and the voice acting is awful, with a hint of racism. Seriously the voice acting is so bad. It's obnoxiously bad.			"

However after that gameplay interest drops dramatically as you know all the tricks and there's nothing more to learn. Plus all matches are basically ""kill everyone else"" so not a whole load of replayability in the end.			"

												An excellent space-based 4X game. Not as micro-heavy as the Total War series and a lot of similar games in the genre, which may turn some people off, but if the micro has been what kept you away from such games, Sword of the Stars may well be for you! It manages to simplify a lot of things while still maintaining a great deal of depth, such as the ship design function and planet colonization.That being said, you will want to have a look online for a walkthrough/FAQ/similar to understand a lot of the game mechanics, because the tutorial is incredibly barebones and doesn't tell you very much, and plenty of stuff that is important is left unmentioned. For instance, do not ever just send one colony ship. You want at least 5 if you have Stasis Pods, or roughly 5 times as many if you don't have that tech. Don't colonize every planet you come across at first, be picky and look for ones with 200 or less planet hazard. That sort of thing.Overall though, once you figure out how stuff works, which is made a lot easier with the internet, it's extraordinarily fun. And given the price, it's worth picking up even if you're not 100% sure.			"

Well, it is not that complicated when playing, and I god a lot of surprises, something like a real story unfolding suported only by the game features themselves (i.e. a story created by my imagination).

It is just fantastic. the research tree is something, in all the 400 plus hours i must've played, i've never completed. there is always something new to find, a new technology to research and outfit ships with. the diiplomacy side of this game lacks a little compared to some other games in the series but for sheer replayability and depth it has been my go to sci fi strategy.Can't stop praising it when ever i hear the term 'Strategy game' in a conversation. 9.5/10 if you care about scales or if you care about my frame of mind going into this game, I have just played sins of a solar empire and galactic civilisations. this was a natural step forward.

												One of if not the best 4X strategy games ever created. I've played nearly all of them and this one really brings together the strategy and tactics parts of the game unlike any other game. The strategy part of the game is stream lined so that you can manage a massive empire just as easily as you can a small empire. The tactical portion of the game is full of exciting weapons and sneaky tricks to keep you from auto resolving most battles. (For example I once had a fleet of cloakable cruisers carrying bio weapons that I could sneak past enemy defense fleats and bomb their home planets out from under them without losing a single ship) If you choose to play this game watch an online tutorial of something to get the general hang of it, one important thing to focus on early IMO is a command ship (gives you a much greater control over the battle and which ships from a fleet will fight in it) also try and upgrade a basic weapon and a special weapon (Say, lasers, and torpedos) I generally go for torpedoes just because I love the flashy explosions : P			"

Sword of the Stars has its flaws, but makes up for its steep learning curve and odd interface with a unique brand of charm and creativity. The universe of Sword of the Stars is such a mad, varied place that all kinds of space opera scenarios wind up playing out over the course of a game.  Any given game you stand a solid chance of triggering ancient space traps, fending off enslaving space marsupials or watching in horror as your robot workers become sentient and begins a crusade across the galaxy.  And those are some of the more likely scenarios.  There are stranger, and more difficult things that might occur over the course of a game that can change the usual free-for-all to a set of uneasy alliances engaged in a bitter struggle to survive a common, devastating threat.The game itself plays out as a turn-based strategy game on a 3D starmap.  Battles are either autoresolved or played as real-time skirmishes, with decisions and research made on the turn-based map impacting the capabilities of the ships in the battle.  Ship design is a major gameplay element, and works quite well for the most part.  Research into command and control technologies will add more elements to the real-time battles like sensor coverage, reinforcement ordering and larger fleets.   The different species in Sword of the Stars have major differences in gameplay, which leads to oft-amusing and unique scenarios in every game.  Every side has its own method of movement, desired planet type and research priorities, giving what could have been a straightforward conquer-or-be-conquered game a bit more depth and intrigue.  There is surprisingly fleshed-out lore, and the actual faction species are creative and varied.  There are hyper-destructive space possums, Latin-speaking, fast expanding space humans, telekinetic space whales with a penchant for genocidal bioweapons and intensely slow, tough, monarchic space insects among the playable factions.There are plenty of issues:  the interface is complex and unintuitive, the amount of randomness to the game can be frustrating, and the voice acting straddles the line between charmingly bad and ear-grating.  Most of the unit portraits and loading screen art is amateurish at best, and the base game isn't the prettiest thing to come out.  There is a solid core of inventive ideas and decent gameplay though, and the game lends itself well to replayability.  The multiplayer worked quite well, but the internet multiplayer was done through Gamespy, so games have to be set up through a virtual LAN like Hamatchi right now.  It's worth playing if you enjoy stuff like galactic civlizations and distant worlds.      "

I LOVE the custom ship building and the desin menu is very good and alows you to make very advanced ships. the real time space battles are very complex I am still figureing them out but the options avalible to you are overwhelming and there are so many ways to defeat your enemy. my only complaint is that you cna't have your entire fleet in combat at the same time you have reerves and once a ship dies a reserve ship is made avalibe I think there is  a way to get around this but I haven't figured it out yet. over all this game has lots of features that you won't find anywhere else and ABOVE ALL IT'S TONS OF FUN AND ADDICTIVE. if you like total war and space games this is definitly the game for youEdit:that was a year ago. I'm still loving this game and it's complexity. Best played with friends! I have put countless hours into the wiki on this game and I still don't know half of what there is to know. just recently I discovered strip minning planets was a thing. weapons that suck enemy whips into a pocket dimension and then collapse the pocket dimension inta killing the ship.

												The user interface is unintuitive and awful, and the art is truly awful even by 2008 standards. But if you can look past that, the gameplay is very deep and engaging. Overall, the game is worth playing despite its flaws.			"

												I've enjoyed playing this game even before it became available on Steam. I've enjoyed everything that the game has to offer and it is pretty basic when it comes to gameplay. Ship fighting was a little hard to get use to when I first began, but it's easy to pick up once you've researched the techs.			"

												A solid game, not very intuitive but once you work it out it is surprising rich, and deep in game play. Online play is stable and lag free so it's worth playing with friends.What makes the game more fun is that the races are all very different to one another and all extremely fun to play, the tech tree is randomised, so it changes up the game every time you play. Combat can be auto-calculated, or manually played out - and if played out the amount of control you have is pretty precise, but still very slow.Worth getting during a sale.			"

												Awesome game if you're into 4X Gaming (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) and Space Simulation games. Not many races but all are very unique, with their own languages and ways of moving through space, meaning you need a different strategy for every game you play!			"

												I'm a great fan of 4X games ever since MoO 1. I've played pretty much every major 4X game out there, IG, Space Empires up to V, Sins, GalCiv, you name it.if I were to name one game that gave me as much fun as MoO, it's Sword of The Stars. It's got a random tech tree. It's got six races that are truly different from one another. This is a big thing when you think of replayability.When you play SOTS, you can design your own ships fom scratch. You can, in battle, target not only ships, but specific components on them. The game's got a real physics engine, where a ship hit by a mass driver starts spinning uncontrollably. And if a Small ship gets hit by a Big weapon, it just dies. No more boring slowness, where the entire fleet has to concentrate fire to destroy one puny frigate.In this game I've seen a drone dodge an enemy PD missile, which then made a sharp turn to follow the drone and instead smashed into a damaged enemy destroyer and killed it. Cool enough for me :)			"

												very fun. it can be confusing at times look at the wiki page carfully before and while playing also start with the tutorial the videos are very helpfull. once you get the hang of it it's extremely addictive and very hard to get away. I LOVE the custom ship building and the desin menu is very good and alows you to make very advanced ships. the real time space battles are very complex I am still figureing them out but the options avalible to you are overwhelming and there are so many ways to defeat your enemy. my only complaint is that you cna't have your entire fleet in combat at the same time you have reerves and once a ship dies a reserve ship is made avalibe I think there is  a way to get around this but I haven't figured it out yet. over all this game has lots of features that you won't find anywhere else and ABOVE ALL IT'S TONS OF FUN AND ADDICTIVE. if you like total war and space games this is definitly the game for youEdit:that was a year ago. I'm still loving this game and it's complexity. Best played with friends! I have put countless hours into the wiki on this game and I still don't know half of what there is to know. just recently I discovered strip minning planets was a thing. weapons that suck enemy whips into a pocket dimension and then collapse the pocket dimension inta killing the ship. A special ship designed to shoot asteroids! I will never stop playing this game. never ever ever will I let go.50/10 top 5 best games I've ever played!			"

												I recomend this game to those that like to waste entire weekends at a time.This is a very customisable easy to learn 4X strategy. If you like games that can take entire months to play out, then you will like this... if you dont have the patience for it you will hate it. Its graphics are showing their age now and the sequel is due out soon with a vastly improved game engine. 3/5			"

												If you don't own this game: GET IT! One of the best RTS games I've played in a long time. Hours and hours of play time, and what can I say, I'm a customization junkie too, and this game's ship design feature works great. In short, get this game like NOW.			"

												""Masters of Orion""-level strategy and ship design.Tactical combat unlike anything else in the genre.Racial diversity that exemplifies ""Different, but Balanced"".Uprecedented immersion for its class.There are many games like it. This one is simply the best.Be warned, however... the fall of GameSpy made multiplayer rather difficult.			"

												Fairly un-intelligent AI, but thats about all I could say thats lacking about the game. And because of that you can set the AI to hard and have them start with larger/better developed empires :)Overall a very entertaining game, easy to get going, doable to master it(not that hard), and impossible to absolutelly dominate (as you can always increase the starting imbalance ;)).

												My experience says after 100 to 200 turns. Just one more turn then i'll call it a day. And before i knew it i was at turn 350. This game is pretty addicting. The free roam in space, colonizing and defending planets. Every game you make is different even if you use the same map over and over.I recommend this game to anyone who likes space combat sims. Although the graphics are not that great still you get hooked. You can play this game like it was 1993 when you had those endless DOS games where it took you months to complete. Exact same story here, you can play months on huge maps and still you haven't completed a map. Just try it and see if you are convinced.When you're at it and it's on sale get the full package with all the expansion for more turns and research stuff.Would glady go another 3000 turns and ruining my life.

												The game itself is strong in the AI department (except for the BLATANT CHEATING, oh and it never uses some ship types such as ""Minelayers"" and ignores games features like trade routes), has a good techtree, ship combat is excellent - so yes, it has it's good points! And I have indeed gotten play value out of it, but it remains very weak in many standard 4X space genre key points! In fact this game is 90% it's space battle scenes, with a less well crafted 4x (or even 3x) tacked half heartedly onto the space battle routines - to give the battles some kind of meaning!- The game ""galaxy"" is not realistic..... it's just a bunch of different coloured stars, all purely cosmetic, none of these colours means anything, that just turn into a single planet when you explore them. Not since Master of Orion 1 in 1992 (and this was MOO1's ONLY bad trait) have I seen this one planet per star rubbish! They're not even proper star systems at all, actually. Not since ""Elite"" on the C64 and BBC Micro in 1984 have I seen such BORING systems. And yes ""Grilleds"" I full well know what *you* think about this - and maybe he was half right, as I've played the game more, I've not noticed the astronimical BS that makes up this game's universe! But I'd still like to see realistic stars, multi-star and multi-planet systems, with moons, asteroid belts etc!- Apart from a basic ""numerical climate stat"", a basic ""single resource count"" and a ""size of 1 to 10"" these boring planets are all the same functionally as well as cosmetically! There are no special features with any of them, except some have asteroids around them..... so ""eXploration"" is a bit moot then..... this is a 3X space game, not a 4X! Still this does just manage to be enough for the game to be playable.+ Though there are only six races and two of those were only added with DLCs bundled in with this ""Complete Package"" edition! They're good races, and the game does take on a full different flavour with each having it's own ship sets, and music theme sets etc.....- The descriptions for these races is an irritatingly smug, clever-d1ck sounding, load of over verbose Darwinian twaddle! The developers put more effort in these bollshit texts than they did the game itself! When they weren't whacking off to one of Dawkin's bogroll books that is! Little wonder the game is such a dog's breakfast in some areas! Yes, I'm NOT an atheist. I'm not a Darwinist neither. Live with it. Not that this harms the game though!Another major minus with SotS is the cheating AI. I don't care a jot what the fanbois and the developers say, the AI CHEATS PROFANELY. Simple as.The only game I have won so far is the tutorial. All other games, even on so called EASY have resulted in a 10 : 1 outclassed defeat. The last game I wasted over 24 hours of my life on I thought I was sure to win. I unlocked Dreadnoughts by turn 50..... but by turn 250 - even though NONE of the AI had Dreadnoughts yet - I was still unable to so much as dent the enemy. Even the tiniest planet had over 200 cruisers + the full suite of 30 - 40 various defense orbitals, sure I had DNs but I simply could not build enough. I had only 8 colonies and already my economy was collapsing under the weight of the fleet I had. No way can the AI have 200+ ships at all of it colonies unless it is TOTALLY INGORNING the same ""economy rules"" you are subject to! And the AI sides all had about 30 colonies each against my 8. I just simply had to throw in the towel. Next time I'm using cheat codes and/or Cheat Engine. I think the only way you will ever win a game of SotS is to totally disable the economy and fleet maintenance costs 100% - which will mean you can devote everything to research.BRILLIANT! Not ONE cheat code exists and Cheat Engine won't crack it!The AI must ignore planet environments as well..... I'm sure it is allowed to colonise even the most impossible of hostile worlds. In this last game again, I explored about 60 systems in the first 100 turns - and found only 8 even half habitable worlds..... the AIs had found 30 each..... now how they do that huh?I have also discovered it crashes and freezes regularly when commencing battles with large numbers of ships! (Well it did in one game anyway, constantly!)Going off the fact that only 2 / 11 people have posrepped this review also shows what an elitist bunch of smug fanbois the majority of the SotS community is. Maybe I'll get more posreps now I've changed this review to a more positive one. Despite my initial complaints, my heart saw something in this game my head did not. I kept playing, and it's kept growing on me. I've even changed the main ""recommend this game"" to a thumbs up yes! I've even now managed to win two games - though with the help of a strong ally and only in small galaxies and on the easiest settings possible. I still believe the AI cheats, profanely.Oh ho! That's interesting! Changing this review from ""not recommended"" to ""recommended"" reset the neg and pos reps! Now there's a tool to use against all the idiots who gang up on you and negrep you silly!			"
