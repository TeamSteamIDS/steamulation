												Space Empires V, like its predecessor, is a brilliant turn-based strategy game. Research is deep and complex. The AI, with mods, runs well. Ship design has interesting nuances and micromanagement isn't overwhelming even in the late game. Diplomacy is good enough and resource management isn't that easy but isn't overly complex, either. The modding community has created some absolute masterpieces for this game, as well.Of course, then, there must be a caveat. SE:V is one of the buggiest games to exist in recent memory. It was designed to run with DX7.1 and DX8 on Windows XP machines. As technology marches ever onwards, getting SE:V to actually install and work even remotely properly has been a source of constant headaches. Provided you're willing to go through the slog of troubleshooting cryptic error messages, forum heresay, and troubleshooting myths from people who are taking potshots in the dark, SE:V is a game that I wholeheartedly recommend. Otherwise, stay away.			"

												I bought this game just to leave this review. I may not have much on Steam, at the post of this review. However I have a CD copy and I have spent at least 7000 hours in this over the span of 8 years. There has never been a game to match this one's scale. It does have a steep learning curve, however it's completely rewarding once you master the games interface.Here is a guide listed to get the game to run on modern Windows. http://steamcommunity.com//app/1690/discussions/0/846947320625372516/Also, one should also pick up Balance Mod. For better AI, and well. Balance to the game.There are other reviews that are much better, with a much better description than this one. However this game is amazing in scope.			"

												This is likely the best space 4x game out there.  It's a shame it hasn't gotten more support, because you occasionally encounter some frustrating bugs and oversights (like if a planet with multiple populations rebels against you, it forms a new race with stats identical to your base race, and erases all other sentient species from the planet).It gives you what you want.  Ship design, the ability to make your own society, lots of interesting research, good espionage, an organized and customizable interface, and cool battles (with lots of tactical options, even if missiles+outrunning the enemy seems a bit overpowered).The diplomacy can be frustrating, due to there being a turn delay and also you not knowing what conditions the AI wants.  So anything more complicated than an open borders treaty might be impossible to implement.I strongly recommend getting Captain Kwok's balance mod.  This will make the AI more intelligent and challenging, as well as give you a chance to engage in more fleet actions.			"

												Space Empires V is an unpollished diamond. You just know that if it had a reasonable length of time in development to remove all the bugs and add a proper multiplayer experience, then it would have been unsurpassed in the 4X genre. What saved this game in my view is just how easy it is to mod. All parameters are contained in .txt files so you can alter anything. Adding mods is incredibly simple(no installers, just download mod folder into a folder in the game). Personally I play with the balance mod(makes intelligence probability based, balances the game, makes AI terrifying) and have tweaked things like the battle timer for ground battles.I guess I will begin with the really bad things in the game: -Bugs: At this point many of the bugs that made the game unplayable were removed over a period 3 years after release but many remain. Issues with coding cause intense lag during big battles and, in my case, for every single ground battle. The alliance system just doesn't work which is a giant shame as it had huge potential-AI: The AI in the normal game is simply terrible although this issue is fixed with the mods. The AI will create big fleets to kill you, lay mines in strategic areas and alter its designs to counter yours. It can be terrifying at times.-Multiplayer: Multiplayer has never worked properly in this series. Everything is done through a play by web system using simultaneous turns and removing tactical combat. Connecting is difficult and just feels underdeveloped and old. It was so much easier to play a multiplayer game of Master of Orion 2 on Hamachi than playing this.-The UI: It is difficult to know what to do and it put me off when I first started the game. It takes a long time getting used to and even if you know all the hotkeys and how to access what you want to know, it still takes ages. My biggest gripe is trying to know which ships still haven't moved as the game doesn't filter out fast units in a fleet when you push space.-Ground combat: It is just not any good. You don't have to think about tactics at all unlike space battles. All you do is sit and watch cockroaches kill one another. Fighters are also a must as the ai will automatically start running away to the edge of the map once it is being beaten and this is very frustrating. Your guys are so slow that they probably wont reach them before the timer runs out. At that point combat ends until the next turn where a new militia will pop up from the city. For this reason I doubled the timer for ground combat.-Late game slowness: This is typical of the genre where micromanaging increases exponentially as the game progresses and you get more plantes & units. Ministers which control your units for you and can be assigned very specific tasks get rid of the need to micromanage so much but an issue remains. Unlike civ v, all the units with assigned commands do not automatically move at the end of the turn. They instead move one by one at the start of the next. Late game it means that I have to sit and watch the game play itself for 5 minutes or so.Now for the good:-Scope: The size of this game is just incredible. A single match on a small map will take weeks and have you go from a newborn space race to god like beings which are able to do anything to star systems. You can blow up enemy planets and mine the remains or use them to create new ones. Destroy stars, create new ones, alter the very map by manipulating wormholes and create dyson spheres. -Tech tree: The tech tree is enormous. There are dozens upon dozens of areas of research, each exponentially increasing the possibilities available. Each new tech can also be upgraded multiple times improving the same designs and many techs can be combined to make fun new strategies. I personally love researching boarding parties, tractor beams and cloacking. Then making a ship to secretly attack support units and take them over. You can make warheads and place them on ships to ram bigger ships or place them on drones and swarm a planet. Getting far into the research tree, making a deathstar, fitting it with a wave motion gun and sending it out to wreak havock is immensely satisfying. There are also specific techs that you get from colonizing ancient planets and race specific ones like organic manipulation or temporal manipulation.-Diplomacy: I really hate the lack of diplomatic options you get in other games as they are very basic. Here you can set any term that you could possibly imagine. You can set how much each race will passively trade, can make treaties banning research of certain techs, you can prevent an ally from even doing any research, set whether or not there will be migration between the two races, impose tarrifs on the trade, share medical or resupply depots, ANYTHING!!!. I absolutely love it. You can even trade information on enemy ship designs and battle replay to help allies prepare.-Intelligence: Espionage is another thing lacking in most game as they tend to simply give you random benefits. Here you can specify what kind of espionage activities you want to conduct or whether you want to carry out sabotages. It is quite feasible to use intelligence to cripple a planet before sending a fleet to attack.-Customization: When you start the game, you can customize everything about your race. What kind of race are they? What type of planet do they inhabit? What atmosphere do they breathe? What type of culture do they have? All these things will have an impact on how you play and the customization extends throughout the game. Every ship you make is designed by you individually by adding components to preset sizes and dictating their strategy. The game even gives you a simulator to try out new designs. This works really well in my opinion. It is a lot of fun to get new ship designs from an ally who was just beaten by a new enemy and then altering your design using the simulator to check how well they will fare against the enemy. The simulator really does add a new level of gameplay that puts enphasis on tactics and good designs to prepare agaomst threats. It also makes good intelligence even more important.-Space battles: Another great thing in this game. Battles can be massive in size and all play out in real time. Ships in fleets will fly in formation and battle using strategies set out by you before hand(you can also manually control them in tactical view). Damaged ships will fly slower and have damaged weapons, missiles will fly out and point defence turrets will attempt to shoot them down before they get too close. There is a surprising level of depth to the battles which are decided mostly on how well you prepared for them.  This is a game really worth buying for people who enjoy the genre although expect some hippucs. If you have a friend of a brother to play hotseat while you work then all the better.			"

												This is a good old turn based 4X. You design your empire and then try to conquer a galaxy (or win through diplomacy/culture; if you're of that persuasion...) Lots of tech development, and ship design. Gameplay is quite excellent in terms of grand strategy, with customisable interfaces and various options for automation (ai ‘governor’ control etc), but I was not hugely impressed with the controls and scripts for tactical combat; it leaves some features to be desired. There may be some mods available which could improve this aspect of the game. Overall, quite a fun and interesting game, I find the dynamics of the gameplay and strategies to be thought provoking. It offers opportunities for a slightly deeper level of interaction than many other 4X games. This is not a game for players who like fast paced, easy to understand gameplay: it takes time, practice and conceit to develop one’s own personal strategy (of which there are many possibilities). I usually play this game with the Crimson Concept mod, which can be found (free) here: www.spaceempires.net/downloads-details-922-Crimson_Concept_Mod_v9.0.html#dldetailsI've tried the game without this mod, it was not as interesting...Lots of people on Steam have commented on it lagging/being unplayable: i noticed that the game lags if the resolution colour bit setting is high; i switched it from x32 to x16 and it runs better now. I guess the graphics in this game are not designed for modern hardware etc. If you have the game: check out www.spaceempires.net there is a community of players and developers, and a massive library of mods and other content to explore.

Pros- The game has an incredible number of customization options and offers a wealth of variety in viable strategies, particularly if you're using the balance mod practically everybody seems to be using. You can manage fine details of your empire's war machine that most games would abstract, and the game is clearly aimed at people who get giddy at the prospect of developing and testing warships to maintain an edge over current and prospective enemies.- Despite the dated graphics and sound design, fleet battles manage to be enjoyable, and I've killed hours just messing with designs and testing them in the simulator. The weapons have a good amount of variety in their look and feel, and the encouragement toward mixing specialist designs in a fleet means that the enemy's fleet composition can significantly affect your tactics in the field.- The AI will happily sign my Treaty of Imminent Backstabbing and praise me as a peacemaker, because the AI cannot comprehend the English language (I guess that's kind of a con, but I've never seen a game with AI that could deduce when it was being threatened or insulted through a text prompt, so I'm just happy for the source of amusement).Cons- You're not really given a choice in terms of how much detail you want. You're going to engage with all the detail, or you're going to lose. The learning curve can be very steep, and the UI is not friendly to new players. Forget not holding your hand; SE5 is pushing you down in the street over and over and laughing at you while you try to cross. Enjoy giving orders tediously one at a time across your huge empire until you figure out queues, because the game isn't going to nudge you in that direction one bit.- The balance mod is almost necessary, because the base game doesn't feel like it was balance-tested sufficiently, and the built-in AI is pretty much useless. Even with the balance mod, the AI doesn't have a good chance against a player with at least a decent understanding of the system, which only makes the transition from single-player to multi-player less comfortable, because if you're used to fighting the AI, human players will kill you before you even figure out how they built so fast (it's spaceyard rushing and their management of that emergency build thing the game never hints at the importance of).- There is only war. That depth I mentioned earlier doesn't extend to politics, economics, or anything else like that. Your empire is a machine to kill other empires, and everything else just kind of feels bolted-on. If you don't enjoy designing ships to patrol spacelanes, or you get bored of it, there's not much to fall back on. You can win through diplomacy, but it's far too easy to be any fun.Bottom LineIf you're looking for a combat-focused space 4x that's so deep it hurts, SE5 is one of the best I've played. You definitely want the balance mod, though.			"

												Great game! It is practically identical to space empire 4 but with better graphics!The good:- Same amount and same teks as in space empire 4, which mean an enormous amount of tek to research- Graphics of solar system and ships is good but starting to get dated. This is a game from 2008 still.- Strategy can go pretty deep in this game- Ships and bases and satellites and weapons platforms and even troops can be customised to your heart content. Eventually, you can even build Ring worlds and mega huge sphere worlds if you research far enough. Destroy and create black holes, destroy and create warp points and the like!- If you like space empire 4, you will love this game since it's so similar- It can be modded to your heart content. There are quite a few mods out there. Better to install the Balance mod straight from the get go to get better ai opponents and better structured research too.- Music and sound are pretty good and never tiresome. Space Opera like star trek.The bad:- The single guy who did all the space empire games sold the game and its right to make space empire games to another company. And he doesn't work for them either. They never did any dev on the game or any patch after it was sold. I don't even understand what they intended to do with this game after paying money for it.- The game is stable, but it looks a bit unpolished and unfinished in some area- The game was developped for Windows XP directX only. It doesn't work fullscreen in Vista or Windoze 7 & later. You can play it in windowed 1024x768 with no problems, but its small for nowaday. The performance of the game is abysmal with lots of lag if you manage to put it in fullscreen.- The ai in the base game is terribad. No challenge even at highest difficulty. Install the balance mod to correct that problem.- The scale of the research is a bit too much. You can research 100 levels in one research. So there is no point in changing your type of weapons from the starting tek you have if you invested millions of points of research into it, it's going to be so strong that no amount of new weapon ability is going to top it. For example, the starting laser can go from 5 damage at lvl1 to 500 damage at lvl 100. The balance mod adresses this specifically which is good!- Very addictive game. You can't stop yourself from playing just another turn and look its now 3 am in the morning and you got to go to work in a few hours! yipeeeeee!			"

												This game is incredibly complex -- in a good way, except for the fact that its just too complex for the AI to get a decent grasp on.  It's also made to be modded, and frankly, is really best played with the ""Balance Mod"", which basically turns it into a game of Space Empires IV, with cooler graphics.  The default game is unbalanced to the point of being effectively broken -- find, and install the Balance Mod, if you get the game.Due to the complexity of the game, single player is kind of easy, unless you give the AI outrageous bonuses to production, etc.  The AI just can't manage the game as well as a player can (although the Balance Mod AI is certainly superior the the default AI).Multiplayer, via PBEM, is the ultimate MP space conquest experience.  I'm not kidding.  There is NO equal.   I have played just about every space conquest game in existance, and NOTHING beats SE4/SE5 when it comes to mutliplayer.  I say Play-by-Email (or cloud drive, these days, is an amazing option), because you want people to spend 15-30min on their turn, and run the turns simultaneously, to really get the best experience.Space Empires is, and always has been, the computer equivalent of a board game called ""Starfire: Empires"" (or ""Starfire: New Empires"", for the second edition).  This game was/is outstanding, if you're into epic galactic conquest with your friends.  Space Empires IV/V do not disappoint, if you are willing to muscle through the poor UI design issues that give the game its steep learning curve.  The fleet AI interface is particularly well hidden, and tough to grasp, but the nuances of the game, particularly of the tech tree, are unending -- and worth the time.			"

Finetuning required!This game is setting one more step above the Space Empires IV game. Also the graphics got updated, the sound isn't so enervating as in Space Empires IV.The game would be a nice addition to any library, if, yes if there weren't some issues. The game requires a lot of manual finetuning by the player, to get it run smoothly on any system with a modern OS. Fullscreen is, well, not implemented for those resolutions too. All this would be suferable, and bearable...But there is more, it's even more complex than it's predecessor and for someone who is new to the 4X Space Conquest genre it might be too much. Pros:Updated Graphics and sound compared to Space Empires IV.A lot of self customization, you can download so much stuff - even fanbased patches, to give it a more fluid run on modern machines.Cons:Buggy, it might crash on modern OS if not finetuned by the user. Lags would also be possible, and hanging up during calculating the outcome of a round.The game can overwhelm a newbie with all those windows, informations and options, please read and tread carefully.Sadly, not supported anymore officially.Recommended only to a limited audience.This game is for empire builders, to all others the game won't open it's charm. It will get boring after playing some rounds and not seeing anything fruitful comming out of it.I can't and I won't recommendate this game to a broad audience, because it's harder than it seems. But once you get the run of the game, you'll find it quite easy. Furthermore there is a lot of finetuning to be done to get the game run smoothly - which will possibly frustrate younger or more impatient players, there is a lot to do for this.The game is not bad, per se - it's among my alltime favorites, since it offers so much possibilities - but, as I said, to a broad audience this game can't be recommended, not now, not even back when it was created.

												Can't reccomend highly enough. Once you get past learning how to use the UI and some of the more subtle features, it's a great strategy game. Whilst fairly unbalanced, it allows for a lot of customisation, which in turn leads to an almost RPG like element of deciding what kind of society you'll be, what kind of technology you'll discover and what kind of ships you'll build.The tech tree is not as linear as something like Civ V or Gal Civ II and has a lot more in terms of options, but it's not as smooth a game to run, or optimised for multiplayer; turns on hotseat take a while to load, but it's a lot of fun to play with a friend. Seeing as one of the only things holding this back is it's optimisation and the fact it's old, I can't help but feel a space empires VI would be as groundbreaking as Civ or maybe even AoE II.			"

												Space Empires V is a turn based strategy/empire manager. There is just so much that you can do in this game, really. I don't even know how to start reviewing this, there is so much to talk about. The game itself is so complex  yet simple at the same time, anyway, lets just go on to the pros and cons list.Pros-Audio/Music, the music is great and doesn't get to repetetive or broing. The sounds and everything just fit the game really well.Empire Management, this is huge. You can develop your entire empire, from the solar system to the single building on a planet. You also manage foreign relations, trade, your local population, ambassadors, and so much more. Like I said, this game is huge and complex.Combat, the combat is also very complex and fun. A huge list of weapons for your ships is available to you, but ship combat isn't all there is. There is also land combat, defensive planetary shields or gun stations, and a lot more. You can either have your units do combat automatically or manage each one of your units. There is so many strategies available that the options are basically endless for a single playthrough.Cons-Graphics, the graphics are very basic. I understand this game is slightly dated, but even so, the graphics are not really special. But I can overlook this, the game is amazing.Complex Research Tree, but isn't this a good thing? What I mean is, there are so many options available to you, it is nearly impossible to research a vast majority of the researches in the span of a single playthrough. There are also some ""Elite"" research paths, that let you do godlike things like create planets, destroy stars, and so on, that take a huge amount of research to unlock, making them impractical for a normal playthrough.TIME, this is the biggest downside to this game. It takes a long time to get through a playthrough of it (depends on settings, but if you are like me, then you like huge maps with lots to do). Early on in the game before you set up your adminitration on planets, completing a turn can take quite a bit of time as well, so overall the game progresses slowly.Conclusion-Anyone that calls themself a fan of these turn based strategy/empire building games must get this, it is simply amazing all of the options it gives you to play with. You can create almost anything you can think of, want a peaceful democratic nation? Make one. Want a tyrannical dictatorship? Make one. If you want a nation whose population is made up entirely of pokemon? You can do that to! Anyway, hope this review has helped some!May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League			"

												This game is definitely not for everyone. STEEP learning curve with a bewildering array of options woefully underexplained in the joke of a tutorial ensure that it will never be called easily accessible. For some reason even though it is ten years old it runs very slow on modern systems and that only gets worse as the game progresses. There are steps to alleviate that somewhat but you have to google it for yourself. Also, the guy (yes A GUY not a team) who made it has apparently given up on it so support comes from the fans. Diplomacy is really only for role-playing humans since the myriad of options are largely wasted on the AI. Yet despite all of that I have to say that I have really enjoyed playing a game that allows me to attack enemies with drones, viruses, anti-proton beams (laser-like beam weapon), meson cannons (space shotgun), missiles, spies (espionage can really be effective at high values), ground troops, and if all that fails you can blow up the planet or even the star it orbits. There are no premade ships and thats a good thing. You are free to build a kamikaze fleet of ramming self destructable ships or maybe a Marine carrier that just boards enemy ships and adds them to your empire. What if they use a master computer and no crew? Just attack with a computer virus. Speaking of virus, you can drop a viral bomb and start a freaking plague if you feel like it. Don't like the enemy attacking you from a wormhole behind your fleet? You can place mines there or close off the wormhole altogether. You can put missiles on colony ships. You can build mobile ship-based shipyards which can build other ships. You can use one of those ships to build a fixed space station to mine resources from an asteroid field. You can BUILD a new planet or Dyson sphere or even CREATE a star from nothing. This game allows more freedom and options than any game I have ever played and it is for this reason that I tolerate its performance issues with modern hardware so that I may gleefully kill aliens with crewless kamikaze viral spore carrying frigates again.

												While for the longest time I was plagued by crashes or otherwise bad performance I still adore this game. A long and relatively complex game that allows you to design your empire down to what's on your mines and fighters. I love that it gives me so much control over everything, I'm not stuck with ""Your race has slow but powerful ships designed for bombardment warefare"" or some such. Instead My ships are whatever I want them to be at the time. Plus, the game lets you go so far as destroying and creating planets, like seriously what more could you ask for in a 4x game?			"

The game is about small decisions that add up over time into tactical advangtes in the quest to dominate the galaxy.

												I feel like this game sometimes gets a bad reputaion, and not undeserved.  The vanilla version is rather buggy and technology awkwardly weighted, but in the years it's been out, there are several mods made available, such as Crimson Concepts and Captain Kwok's Balance Mod, which I have found make the game much more enjoyable.  With all of the cookie-cutter space strategy games that have come out in the many years since, SEV is the only one that I eagerly return to.			"

												I was pretty excited to see Space Empires 5 here after I got SE4 from sale on gog.com - But I was utterly and completely disappointed with this game. The new resolution messed up the UI badly and the icons that were previously very visible are now very hard to make out. Even if you get used to it, you'll find out that the game is in that regard fundamentally the same as the previous part and loads of the new stuff I've seen is largely superficial or outright stupid.-Parts placement: In SE4, you just added components to the ships, here you have a 2D-View of your ship with lots of slots to put your parts on. It's utterly redundant though, as the placement doesn't seem to do anything (surround your crew quaters with engines? why not!) Additionally, there are three decks for these slots and the new view makes it hard to see what you got on your ship already.-Race Creation: They put in new options for race creation. Mostly, it's cosmetic and allows you to e.g. describe the physical make-up of your species and can choose the ship designs independently from each other (unlike SE4). The new social structure your empire has ultimately added just a little bonus to various aspect. Instead of making each government unique and stuff, you just have a sliding scale of peaceful/research bonuses vs. war/combat bonuses (for some reason Anarchy is on the far end of peaceful gameplay and Hivemind is for aggressive play, everything in the middle is when you are indifferent). Oh and you can of course give your leader the title ""Grand Emperor Führer Overlord"" if you are in a peaceful democracy, because that totally makes sense and all.-Research: Oh god. In SE4, you just picked all areas in which you research and then the game allocated all your research points automagically. Either split evenly or one after another. The new system requires you to allocate the points with sliders which is incredibly cumbersome and you can't just enter the amount you want with a keyboard either. The option to automatically (re)allocate points is missing entirely. This is furthermore worsened by the fact that the Research tree was broadened to include stuff that no player would ever research unless he knew the techtree. I mean if you research Energy Beam Weapons, you know you can laz0r your enemies harder afterwards. But please tell me why you would research Ethics in a game like that? Would you have known that it protects you from espionage actions? Also, gaining new ship hulls is now a crawl, while you could get the base ships (Death Star-Sized warships) within 7 research steps in SE4, you now need five times as much, because each shiphull size is now it's own research field.I could elaborate on every aspect this game has to offer now, but given the amount of content it predessor already had, this could probably fill a book.What I noticed about this game is that loading between turns and other stuff (e.g. generating the maps) is much longer and low-end machines might perform rather slow, a problem SEIV doesn't have.Ultimately, if you like 4x Strategy games and this game seems really interesting to you, get SE4. There is no reason to choose this game over the prequel.			"

												It is not said in jest when this title has been described as Excel spreadsheets in space. The depth and selection of imaginable options permitting the finest granular control are stupefying and at times intimidating.This is an old 4X space strategy running on hexes, in turns. It needs dearly user-made mods to be sensible and better functioning. Modern systems might not even be able to run it due to its age. But if it runs on your computer and you fanatically love 4X games that let you design everything, and like sinking hours after hours into singleplayer titles, then you have a good contender at your hands to fight with more modern games of the genre.Things that Space Empires V allows the player to design or min-max: Species, Empires, Units (from stations to ships and ground troops), Planets and Ship formations. Breadth of technologies permit wildly varying designs and counters to them. Lensman arms races ensue between you and the other empires. When trying to outgun your opponents comes to a dead end in ship-to-ship combat, a different set of options open up: If you can't beat the enemy navy, destroy their worlds with planet-crackers, make their stars go nova with star-killers, collapse their systems into black holes, sever their lines of transportation by destroying wormholes, and create new wormholes to blindside their homeworld. When the war is over, rebuild every broken planet and asteroid belt into new worlds, or build ringworlds and Dyson spheres as ultimate mark of your ascendancy.			"

												This game is best played with a mod (eg. Balance mod). The game is designed to be easily moddable, ie. all techs/facilities/components etc. are in text files. Different mods really increase the reply value eg. the tech tree is different in each mod.You design every class of ship your race uses in game so there are no generic ships. AI is a bit weak, though some mods improve upon it. Against human opponents this game really shows its depth. To play by web see http://pbw.spaceempires.net/.			"

												This is a great game for fans of the 4X genre. The graphics are slightly dated but hold up well compared to most conventional standards. Replayability is a one of its better selling points, with the expansive tech tree, custom races, and insane ship builds and strategy it is very difficult to lose interest. The game does tend to slow down the further the game progresses. The larger your empire grows the harder it becomes to manage. Many of my games have turned into 40k tier bureaucratic nightmares.If you enjoy strategy this game has you covered. With a variety of ship loadouts and fleet configurations you will be able to create the ultimate battle strategy; Only to scrap it after the first battle. At higher difficulties you will be fighting not only enemy but against the vicious cycle of fine tuning your ship loadouts to meet newer threats as they emerge.Overall Space Empires: V delivers consistent quality and satisfying gameplay despite coming out a decade ago. The game has a noticeable difficulty curve that new players may find challenging. Overall for its price: 2.99 (on sale as of 8/24) this game is a steal.[Addendum: I've purchased this game twice now with 0 regrets, the steam version is very much playable]			"

												FAR superior to Galactic Civilizations III. Absolutely no bugs for me, which is where most of the negative reviews are coming from. The level of micro can be daunting but if you like the idea of actually running a space empire in detail then this is certainly for you. The ship designer is detailed, meaning that you can build very specialised ships (I love my Aegis missile defence cruisers providing anti-missile protection for my attack ships). The AI can be a bit predictable but the level of customisation is immense so you can tweak however you want to balance it out. 10/10 - exactly what a 4X game should be.			"

												Really, when it comes down to it, Space Empires V is fairly bad (especially compared to SE4). This is mainly due to the broken graphics and AI in some cases, but I love it. I love the ideas that it employs, such as RP-aimed features and decent race customisation options. That being said, if you really want to enjoy SEV, your going to need to use mods. While the modding community is pretty much dead, you can still find some good ones on spaceempires.net . This is made easier by the fact that the game has native mod support for drag-installation into a 'gamemodes' folder (in a game from 2006!). Unfortunately, one can only be selected at a time. I am yet to find a program that automatically merges textfiles and still have themwork ingame (though I didn't search very hard (if at all)), so if you want to use multiple mods, you will need to manually go into the files (something like notepad) and combine the differences (though I usually just replace the smaller folder with the larger one, because I'm slack). While this is a hair-splitting process in itself, it's not uncommon for there to still be conflicts after your done anyway, not to mention that the files can actually be very large, meaning it can take a fair few hours depending on what you're doing (if you're commited enough to actually finish merging them and not resort to my way).Anyway, there are also still a few tutorials on mod creation and modifying game files out there for any interested, which is nice. Oh yeah, before I forget, make sure to play the game windowed if you don't want to experience unplayable white-screening. This is one of the fairly common graphical bugs with the SE5, but to be honest, these didn't bother me very much. The AI isn't great, either, which is usually one of the features people critisize the game on, but there are a fair few improvement mods out there incorperated into total conversions and the like, which is the type of mod you'll be finding most of the time anyway. Overall, while SE5 definately isn't for everyone, it may charm those who are looking for a fairly old-school 4X and don't mind using hastilly-patched together modpacks. Got all that?			"

												Space Empires V is great tactical game on strategic level. It's also game with obtuse user interface with a lot of micromanagement, stupid AI (without special mods it's hard to even talk about AI) and pretty complicated structure. The graphics are pretty bad (considering today standards), but who plays turn based strategy games for their looks?It has a great customisation options when it comes to type of galaxy quadrant you'll be playing in, there is also a lot of choice when it comes to creating your own race. And yes - creating, because they're no races available in the standard game. Name, looks, type of planet native to the race, special abilities and disadvantages are all decided by the player.Amount of things you can do in research is staggering. Of course the main problem is that choosing the bad path can pretty much doom your race. But the same goes with starting in the wrong sector - without planets to settle, cut off by some black holes or gas nebulas. I'm pretty sure that there is a tech which can destroy and create these too, the same as planets (Alderaan, anyone?).Battles are fought in real time, but of course amount of ammo, supplies and type of the units is chosen in the main, turn based part of the game. Speaking of units - while there is autobuild option you pretty much must create your own designs, assign them to roles and then try them in battle! (there are also mock battles available - and if your espionage agents stole some of the enemy designs then you can even choose to try them out against enemy types!).Overall game is great, but really hard. There are strategies which pretty much destroy computer AI (like fighter rush or mining whole systems), but in the end it's about how much time you want to invest into it. Also - there are some pretty good Let's Plays on the YouTube, so it's better to check them out, before buying.Also a warning: the SEV is old and doesn't run on every system. People are reporting some problems with it all the time. In my case I was blessed with working game, even on my Windows 7 laptop, but that may not be case for you - so please buy responsibly!			"

												Great game.  Had this a few years ago and bought it here on Steam.What is so good about this game, is the sheer replayability.  Theres so so much to do and have a go at, from making your own Races, designing your own ships and trying out new Technology.  You could make a race thats very war like and set ot to build the biggest ships possible and arm them to the teeth or make a race thats super good at trade and diplomacy and achieve victory through words.The Tech tree is crazy big and it keeps on surprising and delivering, so you could edit your race to try out new things the next time you play. Your game options are very good to depending on what sort of game you want to play.  You could have a relitively smooth game with no events and few other races to encounter or, go nuts and have severe events and a lot of races as just examples.Only lil critisism I have, and its ony minor, it doesnt ruin gameplay at all, is the music in game tends to be on a massive loop and the music selection is a lil limited, so you could hear the same song being played over and over again, before it changes track, just to do it again.  But as I said, its nothing bad.All in all, worth a pick up, you wont be sorry and you will come back to it over and over again.  Totally recommend if you like strategy and space age stuff!			"

												I've been a fan of Space Empires for two decades, but this one has kind of landed with a thud. Despite some promise at the improvements, the technical issues are far too furstrating for me to make the necessary time investment.Pros:- Richer, larger star systems.- Much better ship design.Cons:- Unstable and sluggish performance on modern OSes. I spent a lot of time fiddling with settings and I could barely get okay performance running in a window with a bunch of graphical details turned down. Most of the guides seem to be stabs in the dark as well. As much as I'd love to deep dive into this game, running like garbage on hardware a decade newer than it isn't something I can deal with.- You apparently need the 3rd party Balance Mod so that things don't get out of whack in later stages of the game, but I can't muster the patience to make it that far.If you're willing to sort through the technical issues dogging this 10-year-old release, you might find some enjoyment at the end. Personally, I'm going back to SE4.			"

												This is not a game for weak minded. It is actually nominated for the most hardcore 4X game that is. And takes a long LONG time to become familiar with. But what a game!!! It will take explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate to new heights.This game gives you total freedom to do what you want the way you want with total customization. And I'm not talking customization like the color you want on the wing, or what your minions shuld have for lunch. I talking about strategically customization. You want to make a battlestar? Create it! Design Vipers, Raptors, the hole shabang!Star Trek? No problem! Stargate style? You got it!One game takes a long time to complete and each game is unique and never the same. Space Emire V is also cheap and one of the few games you can count on one hand that you never get tired of.PS: The producers behind Space Empire V has made it easy for players to make modifications. I suggest ""Captain Kwok's Balance Mod"" it has better balance and AIWhat makes this game mortal is the old game code that makes the game lag, and iwaiting for your turn takes longer and longer as the AI empires expands.If they remade this game. I wuld trow money in their fases so hard they wuld black out.			"

												A perspective of SEV I am using a 2011, I5 macbook pro with parallels and XPsp3. First, tech research is handled a little differently in SEV. If you favored SE 4’s R&D scheme it might take some getting used to Imho. When I first sparked up SEV my FPS would slow down and it would frustratingly hang up calculating round outcomes. However after loading the “Balance Mod v 120+ and “Dark Nova 5”  frame rates have picked up on my macbook. The new R&D system and empire automation options are growing on me. In summary, I recommend this game if you don’t mind a little learning curve the game is very  customizable with lots of dept  …just one more turn is the chant... trust me!			"

												Played much more than what the tooltip says, as i got this game in the very early years of Steam. Must have played for several hundred hours at least.SEV does have several things going for it;- Micromanagement galore. You have control over a LOT of things in this game, and they all really matter. Ground combat, space combat, population management, ship design.. and that's just the first layer.- Combat is fun. YOu can also experiment with your ship designs in a simulator against your own designs or what enemy ships you know.- Many race creations options, and they are all valid.- Loads of research options, both wide and deep. Afaik, all of it is usefull, and its goes far as far as options it offers.- Boarding, stealing techs, blowing up suns, building ringworlds ect ect.- Ships and troopers trying to flee combat when crippled, allowing scattered survivors to escape (.. or not).-Supply and ammo management make ship design require a bit more care, plus making having support/supply ships to back up your warships important.To note, Vanilla balance is a bit all over the place, but using Captain Kwok's Balance mod make this game so, SO much better. Go get it!Buuut, SEV does have severals problems.- The UI is clunky, cluttered and heavy. Too many (useless) options presented at once. At the time i was fine with it, today i can barely tolerate it.- THe engine is weak and really struggle with displaying your stuff on the strategic layer once you get 100+ ships in a system. Nearly unplayable (at the time i played, years ago) when  i was busy moving around several fleets of 100+ ships as the lag was that high. No idea how it would fare on my current machine. It did make for epic wars however, when they did get there.- Multiplayer is utterly primitive by today's standarts. But despite that, i keep thinking of this game in a positive fashion as its one of the very few that gave me all that freedom in the sheer depth and width of options, choices and designs i could DO. The options. ALL the choices. ALL of them, it made them work. I find myself wishing for more of that SEV's toolbox in 4X games i play right now, like Stellaris.If that game could get a new update/iteration with today's standarts but keeping its good points? Its weaknesses are really about UI and engine frankly. I'd buy it. I'd buy it HARD.			"

												A good predecessor to Space Empires IV. Great 4x space game with plenty of customization options and high replay valueand graphical improvements.The UI however is not very intuitive, compared to SE IV. Nevertheless, I love the Space Empires Series and hope one day there will be a 6th incarnation.			"

But I cant recommend this game to anyone because of the crashes. It might run better on Win 7 or earlier OS. In the mean time im playing another space 4x game.			"

												Man, I really wanted to like this series. I love the 4X genre of games and had heard a lot of great things about the Space Empires series. I spent hours trying to wrap my head around it but in the end this game had three major flaws that just killed it for me:* The Learning Curve - Wow, is the learning curve on this game steep. I consider myself an intelligent person, but trying to figure out what I needed to be doing or how to do it at any given point in time was a Sisyphean effort. In other turn-based strategy games buttons are labelled clearly and in a way that new players can easily understand what they will do. Not here. Even the tutorial which attempts to walk you through it in baby steps is nigh-on useless because things are set out so poorly. I don't know what the exact antonym of intuitive to use would be that would describe the controls but needless to say it was an effort to learn what to do.* Game Speed - Damn is this game slow. Even once I started to get an idea of what I needed to do at the beginning, setting up a new game and starting to play would find I had been at my computer for close to an hour and was only three or so turns in.* The Manual - The manual could not have been more useless. It was nothing more than a list of button definitions, with no picture of what the button or menu object looked like. Many times I sat there after spending ten minutes figuring out what I should do next only to find it would then take me twenty minutes to figure out how to go about actually DOING it. If your game is going to have a manual that is nothing more than a list of definitions you had better include a good in-game help system or even a suggestion/advisory system - a la the Civ series - to make up for it and help get players hooked in playing your game.In the end these problems all combined to form a Voltron of frustration with the game. I had such high hopes for this game but unfortunately the poor execution made it completely unenjoyable. Sad to say it but this game just lacks fun.			"

Posted: March 2, 2014
												Hey,I know you have probably read a lot of ""negative"" reviews stating how dated, or how ""incompatible"" this game is with Win7+.Well, that's been fixed and it was really kind of a small issue.  I've had this game since it first came out....well, not Exactly then, but I remember playing it when it was still getting some Major bugs worked out, so a ""flashy"" display or whatnot is minor :).Anywho, this is a review, and this is why you should give a hoot about this wonderfully deep 4x game:Research: yes. you need research to run an empire.  If you've ever played another 4x or deep/grand strategy game, this aspect should be as fluid as it is useful. It is.  Not only do you have the option(s) - in game setup, with racial points - to try out different ""cultural"" technology trees.  For example, if you like your planets being ""deeply religious"" and having structures that either boost population growth, ""psychic-ally"" increase your ship's (and fleet's) experience gain, or  having oozing organic structures that have weird weapons (like manta-ray and globule's for space projectiles), then you've chosen the right game and path ;).Customization: being that this game has run its paces and has seen the ""best and worst"" of times in its long history, there is a HUGE fan-base with modifications, ship designs, and ship ""auto-namer"" files...yes. I'm sure when you first load up the game, you might balk at the auto-naming of some of the ships?  ""My Dreadnought is a beetle? what in the world?"".  Take heart ! there are many auto-text files floating out there :), and though you may think going through each and every step of creating your anarchistic commonwealth of zombie fauna, who call themselves the ""Trumpy's"" is trivial, it just might add to the flavor of your game:  ""My lord, the zombie commonwealth of Ataxia is running rampant in our sector.""  ""It's a contagion - invasion - with no vaccination"" ;)  Though the last phrase may not pop up in your game, the former/one before it will be fun to read when other (sometimes Hooman?) players get there daily log read :D.Diplomacy: yes. it may need work in the current version - 1.79 at the time of this writing - it was really fun to mess with the different options....see customization...Military: Ah, the bread and butter of any 4x game (to some).  There are many paths you can take in this part of the game: will you be a drone-infested carrier? Will you have security stations for defense, or go the route of boarding parties to try and take over the other ship(s)?  Will you place mines on the warp points of your systems, for anyone clumsy enough to wander in ""Unannounced"" ;), or will you place military satellites to vaporize and/or neutralize the fighters and smaller ships before they get to your actual planets?  How will you defend your planets? will you have starbases, or rely mainly on ground troops and weapon platforms?Domestic ""issues"": as stated before, there is much customization in this game. Deciding what you want your planet's focus to be is a personal preference, but can also be strategically important.  Should you put your mining and storage colonies in your border systems or should you have a military base-planet there...should you use the sometimes rare ""Huge"" planets as intelligence centers or should you go the route of using the smaller planets as the system-wide ""buffer"" planets - as in, using the smaller planets to build the structures that will increase your system-wide production, research, or supply abilities?  Although there are ""default"" planet-style types, not everyone will have a strictly military installation planet...maybe there will be some monolith facilities on there b/c of the incredible resources available there?  The choice is yours again :D.Replay value:  depending on your mood, as this game for me is mood dependent:  should I spend hours tailoring a civilization around a specific goal or should I just mess with the AI and just build like crazy?  Of note, the cheat codes, which can be found in the manual...yes. I said the manual :).... do Not break the game. Instead, some of them, such as ""OMNI"" which makes your presence ""god-like"" in all systems, makes the game that much harder to stay out of universal quarrels between (neutral) empires you may not even be Remotely close to :P.   Also, some of the cheat codes, such as ""NOMAINT"" are handy for beginners just getting used to the game, as not having to pay Any maintenance costs on your ships, means you can field a massive fleet or have a massive/expansive empire at half to no cost to you :)...Replay value (continued) : for those that love the 4x genre, multiplayer will be fulfilling, but the real beef is getting there and outwitting your opponent, which, naturally, might increase Your own replay value - this is totally a ""should I buy it"" or ""should I spend it on food?"" kinda situation ;)....For the price of a meal combination at your favorite local fast food chain, you can have 4x (see what I did there ;) ?)  the fun and replay value of that processed hamburger you just ate, minus the trips back and forth from your computer :D...Summary: I Highly recommend this game to anyone of a strategy-centric mindset :D.....as long as you don't mind a turn-based atmosphere ^_^ / Cheers and peace....until those pesky other aliens decide to poison and bombard your home planet, then ""it's on"" ;),Bob			"

												Space Empires V reviewThere’s very little aid available about the tech tree to help someone to make sense of it. I also haven’t seen anyone that thinks in an immense weird way like me. Strategy is my thing I even got a degree in it. I used my knowledge and skill to dissect the tech tree. I was disappointed. Most players say how enormous it is. Well it’s not. First thing is all the items that can be unlocked (not the  tech, like the equipment and facilities) It’s not as much as some other games I played. Some games got less but they got a greater effect. My point is the items you can unlock don’t have a very big effect. 90% of the tech tree is only minor upgrades of the current tech. You’ll need to research a lot of levels in order to get an effective effect. That’s kind of being dishonest. Most games got a tech tree with a few upgrades (or updates) in between. That’s sometimes not needed. Space Empires V is just the opposite. So we should call it an upgrade tree instead of a tech tree.The second thing is the techs that are available. There is a lot available but you supposed to be able the divide it on your own in to four categories, Essential, Sub essential, Support and luxury. Essential is the core technologies needed to play the game. Sub essential is important tech based on your strategy. Support tech is tech that support other tech. it’s not needed but can be effective. Luxury tech is useless tech but is nice to have. Dividing Space Empires V tech tree in these categories according to your strategy is almost impossible. Last thing, the game offers no strategic freedom; a simple example is the strategic clock. I’m not going into all eight strategies now but the three I love are, no frills, diversification and high value. The no frills are the opposite direction of the high value, tech strategy. No frills uses low value items that are cheap with low maintenance but in greater numbers, (Quality in quantity). Diversification is exactly what it says. Medium cost and value but with a wide range of capabilities. The last one is the one most players use. Best tech, best value, the best quality and to be the best but with lower quantity and extreme cost. If you play the way you want to play you will lose. In conclusion: it’s my computer, my game, which I purchased with my money so why can’t I play it how I want to? My work is a big enough of a challenge so most of the time I just want gaming entertainment, (fun). This game is for the none-strategist who loves to be irritated.                "

												If you are using a 10 year old computer that is running Windows XP, this MAY be a great game.  I spent 5-6 hours trying to get it to work to no avail.  I had 2 bad installs (Shame on you Steam!).  Fixed both installs, modified 2 configuration files, changed the way my video card runs the game, downloaded 2 software utilities and still the best I got was a game that runs at 8-15FPS when in menus and corrupted saves.

												The classic 'big but buggy' style game, in this case marred by a jolly dislike of modern Windows (I didn't even experience the apparent infinite lag you get after building a thousand ships, yet for my but 15 ships, trying to open the ship view already takes a good while) plus the game's longing for you to MICROOOOO most things.

												Ive bought this game 3 times.  Once on CD, and the dog chewed it up.  Malfador Machinations told me go pound salt, they didnt care, and if I wanted to play the game to pay them MORE money and buy it again.So I did.  No clue where that CD went.  So rather than listen to MM tell me to go pound salt again, I bought it on Steam.Steam Version DOES NOT WORK.MM apearantly has abandoned support for this and wont fix the Range Check DRM error.  Nor will they release the source code to allow modders to fix the problem either.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  Even though it was a fun game, IT DOESNT FUNCTION.			"

												A hidden gem of a game with a level of complexity and customization for the genre that sets it in a class of its own. the learning curve may be daunting at first however the game becomes quite gratifying once everything 'clicks'.The game's tech tree is very large and the custom ship components well varied. this edition looks to be patched up to date which is a bonus, I did not have to scrounge around to find a patch as i did for the disk version i played countless hours of in the past.

												One of the gems of 4x games. For me personaly, its the 4x game of all times.Ignore the many flaws. find something good to do during horrific AI turn times in later game ( i finished like 3 books waiting for space empires ) and definetly get kaptain Kwoks ballance mod to make the game playable.Then youre set for one of the deepest 4x experiences. All lists and overviews in the game can be changed to your needs and preferences. Want the colony list to show the colonies able to build space ships, to show current construction and free space left on planet? just change the filters.Same for ship lists, or the known planets overview. ( Need to do that anyway, as presets are horrible )The technology and research in SEV +ballance mod feels overwhelming in the beginning and its hard to find out to what your research will actualy lead to on later levels, but the difficulties are rewarded with the huge amount of buildings, modules, weapons and technologies you get access to. Its one of the most detailed technology trees ive ever played withPlanetary construction and the ressource system are pretty simple to cut it short, but youre still left with absolute freedom on what to build on a planet. Make mining colonies full of extractos on rich planets, defend your citizens with planetary shield generators, or cure them with a medical center.Where SEV shines is the freedom in shipconstrucion. Only shipsize and form are given by the game.What the ship becomes depends on you. Want a Battleship, that carries some drones or fighters for support? do it. Drone carrier with strong ecm and anti missile systems? no problem. A mining ship, to harvest ressources from asteroids and inhabitated planets? just make one.Construct huge space fortresses to guard your jump points, or fill the space with ship building facilities and repairdocksIf you have some patience and can ignore outdated graphics, somwhat clumsy and mysterious overview and buttons,the horribly long turn times and sometimes dumb AI, you get to spend a lot of time in one of the most detailed and deep 4x universes ever made.You can take a nap during AI turns .. 10/10ps: some sound effects during the real time battle are more than painfull, recommend to play on low volume >,< "

												While I kind of love this game I'm on the verge between Yes and No to recommending, because it has a lot of pros, but even more cons. I'll admit that I never got into the previous games, and I don't have the time or nerves to try playing games from 2000 either, so my review is based on SEV alone.Pros:-The research tree is massive and really allows a lot of decisions on what to prioritize, some of the ideas and concepts in there are great-The stellar manipulation tech tree allows the player to change entire systems and even build sphere worlds which are pretty damn awesome-The ship building system (even though the component placing is nearly irrelevant, as demonstrated by the AI frequently) is pretty damn cool and it makes it possible to build ships and bases for all kinds of tasks, from tiny to huge-The UI is somewhat hard to understand, but once you understand it you can find everything quite easily, especially since the lists can be directly adjusted to search and display only certain objects-The gameplay and mechanics are generally okay and would be fun, if not for the cons...Cons:-The AI is horrible to say the least. Up to the point that within a typical game I can build dreadnaughts which waste entire enemy systems on their own, which might be fun to see the first time, or the second time, but yeah... not all the times after that (modding it to death does help somewhat, but at least for my playing style it just never managed to cut it, and searching for mods for hours to get something to work which should work out of the box is no particularly great fun)-And the AI is not just horrible, it's predictable, and don't ever expect the AI to use something like stellar manipulation at all-The micromanagement has some cool things going for it, but it get's really tedious after having a certain amount of planets, because appropriate mass commands and the likes are just missing-The turn processing just takes too damn long later in the game, and I'm talking many minutes on high-end machines...-...which in turn makes multiplayer games that much more unattractive, I never found anyone to play with, and thanks to these loading times I wouldn't want to bother either-The non-steam version was a ♥♥♥♥♥ to patch, and the support in general wasn't exactly outstanding-The game is moddable and it is pretty much the only game I seriously tried to mod, just to find a few senseless hardcoded things just about in the one wrong place (stellar manipulation is rather strictly limited to what it already is)-And all those cons add up to one problem: The game never felt like a game, only like a sandbox, which is fun for some hours but not moreAt the end of the day, if it's on sale and you're fine with a sandbox or just plain love big tech trees for the sake of imagination and creativity, grab it. If you want a game to just install and play then you should really stay away from this one.Nevertheless I'd love to see SE6 but I harshly assume that'll never happen...			"

												Space empires 5 like its predecessors has one of the depest most satisfying ship design systems.The game really allows you to feel like your designs have a real impact (if only the AI was a challenge this feature would really shine and allow players to feel a real sense of satisfaction, when their  ship design helps to turn the tide of war).Alas the game is plagued by a number of issues , the interface is quite poor but that issue has always  been the case in the series, the turn times are horrendously long, planetary combat is repetitive and i think completely pointless and the original research tree is way too long, although the balance mod helps to rectify this.Overall i would say that this is a great game but it has its flaws which are by no means game breaking, just slightly disappointing given the previous games in the series.

												This is a wonderful game for anyone who likes space empire building games. I've put 800 hours in so far, and despite its buggy nature (which can be fixed by utilizing a balance mod, google it) is one of my favorite games. I really wish there could be a sequal for this one.			"
