TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Space Colony is the Steam release version a 2003 game with the same title. The game was developed and self-published by FireFly Studios whose most notable work includes the popular Stronghold franchise. The game draws heavy inspiration from the well-known 'The Sims' games, the 'Tycoon' series of games, and FireFly's own Stronghold titles which is reflected by the existence of a combat mechanic.The game features a lengthy single-player campaign where the player takes on the role of Venus Jones and her diverse team of space colonists working for Blackwater Industries, a company hell-bent to increase profit and productivity at the expense of its own employees.  Travel to different worlds and follow one of the two branching storylines by either going through the military or civilian campaigns. Like a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game, it also features a 'skirmish' mode along side the campaign. Likewise, the game also has a sandbox mode like a regular Sim/Management game.PROS:+ Classical HD remake of the isometric view of old games with some enhancement on detail+ Colorful and goofy characters with different personalities and traits+ Story mode is fun and offers a variety of challenges (limited resources, colonists, etc.)+ Interesting new idea to mix different game elements such as: simulation (relationships, needs etc.), real time strategy (combat, base defenses and resource gathering), and management (resource management, work efficiency and trade)...but (See CON #1 and #2)+ Fully voice acted with decent voice acting and dialogue+ Branching story mode to showcase the civilian and military aspects of the game+ Upbeat techno soundtracks that fits the game very well+ Map Editor to make your own scenario or maps+ Steam Workshop support+ Contains all other bonus packages for the gameCONS:- The RTS elements are basic: It lacks essential features that should be mandatory for proper implementation of an RTS aspect of a game such as but not limited to: Unit groups (ctrl+1 etc.), Attack move, patrol, or just a hotkey to Stop units would be nice.- The 'Sim' aspect of the game is also lacking in its complexity when it comes to colonist relationships.- The isometric graphics does not allow you to rotate the screen or objects.- Lacking in option menu: Hotkeys cannot be rebound- Speed setting is lacking with only pause, normal, or fast as the only options.- Base construction follows the 'Sim style of creation' where items are available at anytime (unless you are in story mode). This is under CONS because they could have gone with the RTS style of base construction which would follow a technology tree system which unlocks specific options based on existing technology or structures. This, in my opinion, would have added to the game's complexity.CONCLUSION:NICE GAME with a lot of POTENTIAL.  The concept of mixing together the various aspects of Simulation, Real Time Strategy, and Management games is a great idea but only if the proper mechanics from each of those genres are implemented properly. Among other things for example, Space Colony severely lacks basic RTS controls such as unit grouping and waypoints which lead to some frustrating and clunky unit control. Another issue is with the Simulation aspect where the shallow relationship mechanics made for some boring relationship micromanagement and the lack of screen-rotation led to some mis-clicking accidents.  If these issues are ironed out, the experience would have been much better.Overall I still enjoyed my experience with Space Colony and I can RECOMMEND this game to anyone who's interested in this type of 'Frankenstein' genre. With its after-years graphics, this game is not system requirement heavy (unless your PC is powered by a potato) and can easily run even on netbook computers making this a nice game when you're on the move.--------------------------------------------------------- Like our Reviews?

												Space Colony was originally released in 2003 and then upgraded to HD in 2012. Steam Edition is now let loose in 2015 that adds all of the modern conveniences, including a brand new single-player campaign, achievements and both workshop and cloud support. Core of the game is focused on real-time strategy but it brings so much more. Great blend of  Sims, Time Management, City-Building, Strategy and Tower Defense gameplay along with a distinct 90s space vibe. Initially getting given options of playing through the campaign (including cut-scenes and stats that carryover between missions), galaxy mode (choose your own planets and pathway), sandbox mode (choose your own planets and given access to more equipment without upgrading) or loading user-created mods. Included are a bunch of community favorites but there is a huge selection to choose from. With the addition of a reasonably intuitive level editor and steam workshop support it would be very easy to spend many hours just playing custom games.Thankfully even though upgraded, Space Colony has kept all of it's original charm. The tacky yet amusing banter between odd-couple characters, the combination of 70s disco and elevator music and the space creatures straight out of your favorite B horror movies. For fans of the genres I mentioned above this is a game not to be missed, more so if you never had a chance to play the originals because (imo) you are in for an absolute treat. Just make sure you have the spare time as it can be quite addictive.Few small downsides, Inability to zoom your view (older engine) but the wonderfully detailed pixel art makes up for this and sometimes the UI can be a little clunky though more a matter of playing the game longer. Highly recommended game and one worth shortlisting. Cheers folks. :)(intro/tutorial)

												Played this (a bit too much) as a kid, and was over the moon when I saw it coming onto steam.  Thankfully they didn't 'improve' on it too much and kept all the story line and quirky humor the same.  They have however improved on the graphics enough to bring it up to date and now that it's on steam it will be more fun to make custom maps and scenarios to share with other people on here...we just have to wait for someone to start doing that and I'll be getting on with mines shortly too :PAll in all, a great game to play for both new and returning players of Space Colony.  Stig FTW :D			"

												Space Colony is a treasured part of my childhood.It was revolutionary at its conception in 2003, a fully working blend of the most popular PC genres at the time.12 years later, it retains its replayability by stepping into the modern age with improved graphics, higher resolutions, and endless potential workshop content; an entire universe of planets to colonize, available only through Steam.The premise itself is quite simple: Direct a team of uniquely skilled operatives to completion of their group task on a strange planet.  The operatives themselves being slaves to their bank, and the corporation running the galaxy, Blackwater Industries.  Blackwater industries will not often provide you with much to complete this task, and chaos often ensues.There are social aspects, as well as plenty of RTS combat.  Luckily there is a pause button, you'll need it.			"

												I own several copies of this game. The latest, before buying this, was the GoG.com HD version. In firefly's advertising they make claims about this steam version. A new single Player campaign? New missions and lots more. But this seems to be exactly the same as the HD version. Another former fan found it to be the same. He posted about it if you care to read it.http://steamcommunity.com/app/297920/discussions/0/620712364039558527/I didn't bother going to all that trouble. Verifying map files to see what was added. After buying the game I started playing and could not find any new campaign. Or anything else except for the launcher which is supposed to allow adding workshop items.Apparently I'm a sucker. I feel cheated. Good job firefly.The game itself is fun. But there is nothing new or worth while in the steam release.			"

												Ah Space Colony, one of those games that was a guilty pleasure and ate up hours of my time, yet I would never admit to any of my gamer friends that I actually played this game.It's great that an updated version has arrived on Steam. At the heart of it though is still the same game with the same flaws. You still can't rotate objects, you can't zoom in/out on the map, there's only two speeds (normal and turbo), and there's lots of actions to be done but none of it can be queued. The selection of buildings and decorations is rather basic and graphics are by today's standards, quite dated. However, when you get right down to gameplay and working with this group of highly dysfunctional misfits, Space Colony really comes to life. Keeping them sane and happy is no small task, plus romance can spring up amongst colonists in the most unlikely of places.It might be an older game, but I still recommend it.			"

												Fun game to play but you need some patience every once in a while. The crew has needs to be tended to but that goes for the most part on auto pilot. In this game you build up a corporate colony. Build resourcers, beds, chairs and laserturrets. You can put a shower room right in the middle of the colony hub and not one single crew member will care. Sauna next to the prisson? Not a problem. Counseling bot next to the dance floor? That can be arranged.In the campain mode, you start off with a small colony which you have to expand. At first it looks like you can't scroll across the screen, but thats only because the area around the base hasn't been explored with lights yet.After the first 5 or 6 mission you split off into two paths: a peaceful path and a war path. The missions can be pretty severe and even the peace route can be pretty violent. The first time i tried the peace route, my base got overrun with aliens and my entire crew got killed. I was then congratulated by the corporation for killing off my crew without having a mutiny, they were impressed. Haven't tried the war path yet and i think my crew won't survive that one either.Pro- good ol' fashioned building construction.- Shooting furry aliens- Somewhat dark sense of humor- Sims-light in space.- During the campaign, your entire base will be carried over as long as you play missions on the same planet.Con- Due to being an older game it has no zoom function. Can get irritating at times.- Iff an important crew member dies, it's basicly game over for the campaign.- TammyRating. 7/10 Would shoot hordes of small furry aliens again.			"

												As someone who plays a lot of tycoon, sim and strategy games. I would recommend this game quite highly.While it is kind of old, has the odd annoying feature, and is not really a giant in detail sim game. It is still a great game with plenty to do, as well as loads of interesting features. From mining resources to manufacture things with and trade, all the way up to trying to get members of your staff to have lesbian sex.I'd give this one a 7.5 of 10, or 8.5 out of 10 if you want to take into account that it is a few years old.

												Playing a game before its released does have its added advantages, the look and feel might not always be polished but it gives you a great experience about what the developers are trying to show you. In the case of Space Colony it was already polished, if you remember back to its first inception and the HD version of 2012 then you will be looking forward to this remastered edition to the game. To those wondering what this game is about, you are simple colonists trying to survive against hunger, aliens and sanity. Relationships are important, when you are in a small base with nowhere to go you need to get along with those with you otherwise chaos will ensure. To be productive and to survive you need everyone on board. While all my hours playing this game may have not fully registered on here this is a game I look forward to playing and can't wait to see what workshop creations will come and how the community here really embraces this great Sim like space survival.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434614811 "

												I played Space Colony back in the day and finaly its on Steam. Its still a great colony game with good humor and the charecters in the game makes a nice personal touch. If base building with a fantastic mission system is your kind of preference go get Space Colony: Steam Edition.And yes the graphics have been improved for the better.THE GOOD- A great upgrade of a 12 year old game.- Base management and people managing is a fun challenge.- Variety of objectives keeps the game fresh.- Map editor has a lot of depth.THE BAD- Story mode feels restrictive compared to Galaxy mode.- Industrial machines pass right through structures instead of around.- A few of the characters are unlikeable.DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												Space Colony is a casual overhead city-builder with both sandbox and campaign modes. Once one of the best games for the Macintosh, Space Colony is constantly referred to as ""The Sims"" in space. You play as god, moving around a dozenish people to improve their relationships with one another, limited in pace by an economy of space mining and farming.  The best part is the voice acting, as the quirks of each character bring out light comedy to keep you entertained for hours. These quirks will have you build different entertainment venues for each character, to maximize the benefits of each worker's work.  Or maybe you won't, because some characters are pretty useless.  This combination of micromanagement and macromanagement is far from tedious. The Steam adaptation of it has some flaws.  Modern day computers have bigger and HD screens so, the field of view is widened and the buttons are smaller.  This doesn't interfere with gameplay.  There's some problems with audio balance for some sound effects. Alt+tab (switching windows) crashes Space Colony.  I still think this is forgivable, and I'd be willing to give the game 5/5 stars.Well-done, 5 stars.			"

												I can absolutely recommend this game to those who enjoy old-school time/building/resource management games. The original may be from 2003, but it plays like games from the 90's with similar charm and quirkiness: Theme Hospital immediately comes to mind, for example.In a similar vein to Theme Hospital, a lot of the basics become a bit monotonous (once you've built one corridor, you've built them all), but there are enough new building types and scenario objectives to keep it interesting. There's a whole host of things to do too, ranging from harvesting crops to mining, keeping bugs at bay and cleaning up a dirty station, treating injured colonists, having them sit down at a restaurant...you get the idea, it's a long list.What really makes the game, for me, are the characters.They each have quirky phrases and character interactions, and can go from totally satisfied in a relationship to stir-crazy and requiring detention to calm them down pretty rapidly without the correct needs satisfied - the most obvious one being human interaction. They die if not looked after, have audible banter when they bump into each other, moan when things aren't going well...it's fun to work out how to achieve the objectives of a new mission, but far more so to try out the new characters as they appear in your base.

												I really like this game. It has been described as The Sims in Space. I have never liked The Sims games as I find that they are far too repetitive and boring. Space Colony is a good building game, The Sims element is that you do have to be aware of the needs of your operatives to improve production. This does give an extra twist to the game that you have to think about and some of the challenges are based around ensuring that your crew are reletively happy or they won't work. Any Building Sim worth it's salt should have an element of ensuring that you are providing basic things, such as food, so I don't find this particularly strange, as some have mentioned. Making sure your crew does not go mad while on an abandoned planet does give the game an additional challenge.The object of most of the challenges is to produce as much money or supplies as possible. Each crew member has his/her own specialism so the object of the game is to mangage your crew to get the highest productivity while protecting the base from space monsters. There does appear to be a few bugs, that I noticed. I have found that if you save your progress regularly, then when you encounter a bug re-load your progress and the bug goes away. The bugs do appear to be based around not recognising your progress. I also had an extractor that wasn't being recognised by the supply depot. These are all really small bugs which don't hinder game enjoyment but may mean loss in some progress if you don't save. I would put it in the same category as games like Dungeon Keeper or War for the overworld. Have fun building and watch out for the protoraptors, they are tougher then they look!			"

												7/10Anyone calling this The Sims in Space... no, not really.  Some elements are borrowed, but the same can be said for borrowing from Stronghold and any other number of games.  I'd skip that comparison.The game is fun, though dated.  You would expect this, give the initial release.  But when it was updated in 2012 it was nicely done.  Some of the building is frustrating... some of the planet surfaces seem like you should be able to build on them but you can't, and I've yet to see where you can terraform a bit to make a plot useful.  Also, laying paths out it sometimes a pain... it can be a little tricky.   Finally, it's a real drag that you can't rotate items to set them down exactly how you'd like them... something I take for granted in a mobile game like The Simpsons Tapped Out.  I would love to see this changed.Someone said in a review that the game was slow.  Funny, but my game has a game speed thingy where you can either pause, play at normal, or play at a much faster speed. This does at least give you the option to speed up during slower bits... and you will.As for the rest of it, the voice acting is pretty amusing, the characters are diverse and funky, the story campaign is deep, the sandbox mode can be challenging, and the music suits the game well.I think that the price is maybe a bit high, but I can't personally complain as I got this in a bundle.  So if you're interested, maybe wait for a sale.  You'll likely enjoy it.			"

Beware though, dispite its innocent appearance, some of the missions can be brutally difficult. Expect to fail a few times and take more than a few casualties.			"

												A RTS with god mechanics like the Sims. It blends the genre into something really fluid. The difficulty and replayability is there because while you might learn the game it will never be repetitive. The characters feel like my friends, after spending hours together I will still laugh at some of their lines.I got this game as a long time firefly fan, having never played the game before (published 2003). Even today with amazing computers, this game is pretty addicting. Like other firefly games it comes with a creation kit to make, share and play your own maps and assets. I spent about 10 hours figuring out how to play and all the nuances of the game. The sandbox for me is the most fun but some of the maps are really difficult. In every strategy (on some of the hardest difficulty worlds) I would fail. *queue creation kit* Now I have 5 more maps, which I created at just the perfect difficulty. Biggest consLimited items, orientations (can't rotate items) and general customizing options available to build your base. There are probably only 120 items in the entire game that create your world. That gets kindof old.All in all it's a good classic game with at least 20 hours of fun in it. :weed:			"

												I think this game has something good going for it. It's like the Sims and theme park. The problem is, its too much like the sims. You have to baby your crew, they forget to eat, sleep, clean, and all the basic human needs, so you have to monitor them heavily. Plus they have relationship requirements. I dont mind taking care of some issues, but it gets overwhelming quick, and they can be stubborn as a mule. I only have a limited time with the game, I mainly played the sandbox mode. I never had to face the aliens, but if I did, I feel like I would of been in deep, due to the fact I have to juggle the tiniest problems delicately. I wouldnt recommend this game unless your into macromanagement. Just too much going on and not enough reward for me to have fun.			"

												One could be forgiven for classifying this game as 'Sims in space'. This classic is essentially that; only with an aspect of danger and narritave progression added in. With simple graphics that are cartoony and clear enough to have aged very well even without the HDification for the two re-releases, even now this game compares well with newer indie titles of similar themes. But there can only really be one true Space Colony; and it is back.Note:The HD edition adds widescreen support, higer resolutions, improved stability on newer systems and new mini campaigns.The Steam edition adds all of the above, plus a further new mini campaign and Steam Workshop support.My advice: If you've got the HD edition, you don't really need to splurge cash on the Steam edition unless you have plenty of spare money lying around. If you've got the original Space Colony or are buying for the first time, you will want the Steam edition. The Steam edition is also the most likely to get further updates as it is considered to be the definitive version by the devs.			"

												This game is very ""Sims""-esque, but with a great story and missions. At first, these missions are very easy, but they do get really challenging. You must build your own colony, your own world, while dealing with the real world. A corporation will give you missions, mostly ways to make more money for them, that you have to take in account while watching over the people that you are also in charge of.

												Going to post a review for Space Colony and Planetbase in the same review, as the games are very similar, yet at the same time very different.I bought Space Colony first, expecting the game to play like Planetbase.  While both games involve planet exploration, and creating a base, and surviving and thriving, eventually making a profit, that's where the similarity ends.  Both games play alot alike in those aspects.  And both are quite fun with the ""base"" demands of the game.  As they both play like Space City sims.  If you like games like Banished, or maybe even Cities:Skylines (A bit of a stretch) you would probably enjoy both games.Now for the huge differences.  Planetbase plays alot like a simulator.  The base game is a bit more difficult, as you need more juggling to keep your base alive, as more colonists arrive, you need to balance alot of aspects such as food production, Oxygen production, Electricity production, water ect.  Even though the new colonists are a welcome sign to your base, they are also a detriment.  Your colonists themselves handle as you would expect them to.  They work to the best of their abilities, but need the basics including some relaxation to keep from losing morale.  The lower their morale, or the more injuries they have, the slower they will work.  But they are astronauts, and know what their job is.  They also aren't afraid to share beds, or other equipment. You also have to grow food for your astronauts, or create bio meat for your team to surviveSpace Colony on the other hand is more like Planetbase if it was on the Jerry Springer show.  The astronauts all have their own set of skills, and likes and dislikes.  The base game seems easier, but you have to deal with clashing personalities, and each astronaut has a very flamboyant personality.  And part of the job in the game is to get your astronauts to go talk to each other on couches, to help them gain friendships.  Some you get to fall in love with each other, and they all need separate assigned beds or they won't sleep.  You also have to deal with what seems like constant spawning of aliens, which will destroy your equipment in your rooms.  As far as food production, in this game, you build a mower, and you need to find plants growing on the planet and the mower turns the plants into green space juice.  Personally I find Planetbase to be the much more enjoyable game of the 2.Space Colony 5/10Planetbase 9/10			"

												Good concept, but bad implementation.Space Colony is just like The Sims, but in space, with mild violence, and major flaws.+ Good gameplay depthYou control some characters, trying to satisfy their needs, such as hygiene, social, monetary, and sleep.  You get to build a colony, gather resources, defend against alien attacks, train skills, and deal with tourism.  The game is divided into levels with specific goals to meet, such as having characters fall in love or gather a certain amount of resources.  It has more depth than the original The Sims, but not including the expansions to it.+ Great charactersEach character is unique, and they all come from different backgrounds.  There is an old Chinese man, a street-punk kid, a classy rich French woman, a Norwegian biker, a hippy girl, a Barbie girl, and more.  They are all stereotypical caricatures, and all have funny lines.  One line from the old Chinese man is: ""Fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth, or watching the guy next to you being ripped to shreds by a bug.""- Characters ""forget"" their current taskCharacters have a work shift and a break shift.  When the break shift is over, a character will drop what he or she is doing and go straight to work.  Everytime I would give a task, a character would walk a few seconds, but then turn around and walk all the way back to work.  If they were eating, then they would go back to work in the middle of eating, leaving their hunger only partially filled.  If they were going to converse with one another, they would leave the other hanging.  This is the biggest and most annoying design flaw of the game.  The developers knew about this problem but were still not able to program a fix.  Because of this flaw, I had to constantly pause the game and micro-manage everything, which was a pain in the butt.- No queuing of tasksYou have to watch your characters like a hawk.  Luckily, there are vocal responses when a person goes back to work, but that is only a quick fix to a bigger problem.  Each character can only do one thing at a time.  If a character finishes having fun or showering and you do not assign anything, that character goes back to work.  If that character is slow, you will have to spend another 15 seconds for that person to walk back from work and to a new task.  This too is a serious design flaw, requiring me to painfully micro-manage everything as well.- 2D view causes objects to hide other objectsPlacing objects can be a pain, since you cannot zoom in and the fading of anterior objects is poor.  Objects in the foreground will block out objects behind, so you have to keep that in mind.  This always means that you cannot conserve space by clumping things together.- BugsYou can't minimize the game, at least in Windows 10, or the game will crash.  Sometimes when you have two people converse, they don't talk; you have to assign the conversation task again.  Placing objects feels kind of buggy, where placement locations aren't clear and objects tend to snap along boundaries of other objects to avoid collisions.  In summary, there is a general overall feeling of bugginess to this game.This game had potential.  It had great characters and depth, but is held back by two serious design flaws.  A lot of time was wasted micro-managing characters.			"

												It's a great torture sim for all of you SimSadists out there.  Build a base with no entertainment, no sanitation, and no comforts at all, just grinding boring dangerous work.  Then add the crowning glory:  use the economy page to reduce their pay to NOTHING.  Set back and watch your lab rats/torture victims go cray-cray and riot against your tyranny.

												I really wanted to like the game but it falls down on it's execution. It all feels a little messy.The UI isn't as intuative as you want it to be, you can't rotate things you're putting down, they never quite fit into your biodomes in any sort of a way that makes you feel like you're making a coherent base.On top of that every character is basically a lazily written stereotype with voice acting that is laughable.:(			"

												This game is pretty much The Sims in Spaaaaaaaace!. Although there is a ton of content in this game that the dev doesn't make you pay large sums of money for. There is a load of content to this game, I personally found it a little too same-y for my taste, this is also a fairly old game that has been remade for Steam, so there are some quirks in the game here and there. But for the most part the layout is fine, graphically it's fine.There isn't much challenge until you get to the later levels. There's also workshop support and it's also easy to create your own levels and campaigns with the simple to use drag and drop map maker.Worth taking a look if you like The Sims and space.			"

												Considering the time this game got out, this is a great game. It has not aged well however as it is obvious it was made before UI control standards emerged. It take a while to get used to cancelling everything with the right mouse button instead of the opposite and to the fact the space bar is not the pause button... Once you get past this awkward experience this game turn into a funny satyre based on the original The Sims game... In space(tm)!I definitely recommend for fans of base building management games. This is one game you probably never heard of and which is worth playing at least once in your life.			"

												This is not a space colony simulator, it's ""Sims in Space"".Having tried the tutorial, everything is micromanaged to death for the colonists.  The only thing the tutorial does is teach you how to micromanage your colonists with already pre-built structures and nothing else.You have to tell them to do everything, sleep, work, have fun, etc. Only thing you don't have to tell them is when to eat, and that's the only thing.The video is deceptive, what it doesn't show you is the constant clicking on everything.I got this in a bundle, otherwise I'd be requesting a refund.

												I will tentatively say that this game is good. More like okayish than good actually.Price is right though for it.The game is that you build a small colony on a planet somewhere in the universe and you got peeps with needs of all kind that you must fulfill so that they can work efficiently at their jobs. Some of them hate each other or are pretty crazy, which should add color to the game but actually you just need to make them spend quality time togheter so they become friend. Eventually, everyone is friend with everybody and the game becomes so boooooring and repetitive.The game feel like a simplified SIMS game. You do have a mission to fulfill which is generally to reach a quota of a resource and sell it for some cash or something simple like that.The graphics aren't great even with a top computer. Voice acting is actually good. Different voice for each toon. Some emotions in them too. "

												I put a review down for this earlier but it seems to have disappeared.I expected more from this game. Having played games like StarTopia, The Spatials, and games in the similar vein, I was unimpressed by the way this game handles station personnel and security.In one mission you run into these space rats and can't get rid of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because you can't shoot at them. I went into freeplay and could not find a way to get rid of them there either. There's no hint or anything on how to get rid of them, but they muck up your base and keep you from putting down new buildings or items. They also make the worst noise ever.Then there's the plantlife which will swoop in and destroy your buildings, wasps that attack your stuff, and through all this you have these Sims-like idiots complaining you haven't given them the right assortment of furniture to keep them happy, so they stop doing their jobs, and your colony falls to pieces.The placement of items is sometimes not as clear as it should be, you are led through the most linear storyline I've seen in these games in a while (the only choice being whether you want to focus on a tactical or economics campaign fork), and even when you try to think tactically and plan things out, while you're trying to place items their visual representation does not align with how you think they align and you end up placing them several blocks away from where you wanted them to be.Overall it quickly gets more annoying than fun, and here I thought games were supposed to be fun...

												I wanted to like this game. The concept is decent, although the art is a bit dated. Ultimately what kills the appeal is the failure to develop a cohesive storyline. I played the first ""set"" of the story campaign, and it ended briefly without any real conclusion - heck, the drive for the characters was about as vague as it gets. I could not understand why I suddenly had to choose between a military or civilian path; nothing in the first campaign even hinted at this dichotomy nor helped me understand what each path meant. There is no real backstory on the characters, but I kept hoping for something more. I wanted to keep them alive, but only because I had spent time building them into a team... then I find that none of them stick around except for the main character who was just about as cookie-cutter as the rest of them. I don't care about multiplayer, and getting interrupted only gave me pause to ask whether I even cared to keep playing... and sadly this game fails to keep me interested enough for more.			"

												It's missing some pretty essential things that a colony builder should probably have: no windowed mode (not borderless window, straight up windowed mode with borders), no map rotation, no zoom, no building rotation. Plus, it'll crash sometimes if you alt-tab in and out of the game.It's fun and challenging, but the lack of quality-of-life features just drag it down. The base-building aspect feels nice and complex, but it's incredibly annoying to have to deal with the relationship mechanic between colonists. This isn't optional either: unhappy colonists work for less time, move slower and even destroy your own base assets in a worst-case scenario. When every other colonist need in the game is handled automatically, why couldn't this one be?Incredibly missed potential, especially considering the lack of games in this niche genre.			"

												So.... as someone that's never played any other versions of the games created by these people I have pro's and con's. Pros: The game is pretty awesome and interesting. It's pretty realistic as to what probably would happen if this was real life, with people's needs, salaries, etc. Cons: The game is pretty unstable. Every time you tab out of it for anything, it crashes and sometimes freezes your entire steam up. I tested this out on my laptop AND my desktop PC, both of which have this issues.  There is also no window mode, despite there being different options for the size of the game, it's all in ""full screen"" mode no matter what you do, and there aren't any files you can alter in the folder to make it windowed either. Despite how good the game COULD be, with the pure fact that you can't even tab out of it without crashing, makes it almost not enjoyable. Maybe if they ever decide to at least stabilize the game, I'll change it to recommended, other than that... don't bother.			"

There are no tooltips whatsoever, basic concepts like Power, Oxygen etc aren't properly explained, moving and assigning characters can be a pain, managing their needs and relationships even more so.This COULD have been a great game, but the lackluster interface (no tooltips, every piece of valuable information hidden in sub-menus etc) and controls that make the micro-managament a pain (and there's a lot of mm in this game, which isn't a bad thing with better controls/interface) make the game more of a chore than an enjoyable experience for me.

												I like this genre and I want to like this game.But social aspect of the game where characters have to communicate and interact with each other like in some sims game killed my desire to play it any further.I wish this feature could be switched off.Still I can't not recommend this game just because despite of that it is still a good game.And it is worth the money.

												Interface is too clunky.Lack of any in game explanantion or tooltips on 90% of items.No zoom (which can make selecting people harder.People only follow instructions about 50% of the time (instructions on work priority -and- direct commands)They way the RMB/LMB setup is, you end up clicking and selecting people and thing a LOT  that you don't want to select or click.This could have been good but it's lack of polish, bad control scheme and lack of in-game tooltips just leaves you frustrated until, like me, you no longer want to play.Addition:There was an update today.That update has now rendered my game un-launchable.

												I have a multimonitor setup. I always have a video or movie going on one monitor, a game on the second, and so on. I might have wiki pages open, or music going, or any number of other things. This is the way I use my computer all the time. I'm always going back and forth to queue up a new video, pause things, respond to skype calls, etc. Most games nowadays will let my curser leave the game's monitor and travel to my other monitors wikthout even minimizing the games. Some games require me to alt-tab out of them first.But Space Colony simply crashes. There is no way to focus on anything else without it crashing. It didn't occur to me to check this first; I've never run into this problem, even with other legacy games I've installed on Steam. Heck, even back when I ran Windows 98 I was an alt-tabber.If I had known Space Colony was not alt-tab friendly, I would not have bought it. I'm very disappointed. And I'm normally a huge fan of base-managment/sim games. :(			"

												This is the second-most disappointing game I've bought on Steam. It's a stripped-down micromanagement-heavy primitive version of The Sims in space. The tutorial demonstrates how much of a snore-fest the game is - the tutorial text is more itneresting than the gameplay it describes.Avoid this one. "

												I got this game from a bundle, so I didn't research it.  I thought it was a space town builder with deeper characers in it.  What it actually is is SIMS in space.  There are some funny characters and dialog.  But be warned that the main objective is to babysit your characters.  Keep their needs/requirements from dropping too low  (their pay, entertainment, hunger, etc.)  So it wasn't for me.  Maybe you like RTSs where instead of actually playing the game, you babysit.  Your characters cannot wipe their butt without given a command to do so.  If that is your cup of vodka then it is probably a better game than SIMS.  (Really hard for me to gauge whether a fork stabbed into my foot is better than a fork stabbed into my thigh. But it is on an alien planet so it is probably better than SIMS)			"

												****Update*****After writing this review I seemed to get the support I needed and after 6 days and 2 maybe 3 updates the bug is finally gone and I can get my hype on for this weekend. Still a shame I had to give it a negative review to get the support needed but it all worked out in the end!Would put this to thumb up status but at the time of writing the update 17 out of 85 people seemed to have had the same issue as me and it would be a shame to reset Its stats just to be back to 0/0 found this helpfull and no one knowing what a drain it was trying to play this game with the no movement of map bug.****Original review****Man I was hyped for playing this game but it just dosent seem to run right, dont get me wrong im sure the game is sweet and it all looks good but it just wont let me move around the map or zoom in and out!Iv tried asking for help on the forums but to no avail and iv even seen the devs posting the odd comment but just straight up skipping my post. Devs if your reading this get back to me and fill me in on why I cant move around my planet nor zoom in and out. Until then I just cant rate this up how ever much I would of liked to.Game looks funHasent aged abitTerrible support if you end up having the same issue as me!			"

												I loved this game and played it for many hours, when it first came out. Sadly I lent my edition to someone and never got it back, so I now bought the steam version for old times sake.The game hold up suprisingly well. The graphics overhaul makes it still good enough to look at. The characters are just as fun and quirky as I remember, the missions and maps are complex and diverse. The mix of Sims and strategy game is still rather unique and still as fun as I remembered.The editor is quite robust as well and easy to use on top so you can handcraft missions for yourself or others.My only gripe with the game is that the last few missions of the civilian campaign are military in content. If I want to play military I will play that branch. Meh.But apart from that - great game, well worth getting!			"

												A brilliant (strategy light) casual game.  It was obviously a labour of love for the developers and that shines through.Pros: Very addictive and enjoyable.  I played this a lot when I was young and dont regret picking it up on steam.  Fell in love with it all over again.Cons: There are occasional bugs that do upset the experience, also you cant change the camera angle - but after a while you completely forget about that.Recommendation: If it gets too easy, then try playing on a harder level in galaxy mode, even after many hours of gameplay there are some maps that I am not able to figure out a defence against.  Would love to see a Space Colony 2, but I can't imagine how they could improve this one in terms of actual gameplay. Very well balanced and a classic of good game design.			"

												Overall this game can be enjoyable and fun. Just as in the ""Sims"" you must take care of your workers needs such as food, cleanliness and entertainment.  If you don't then their work ethic will become more and more poor and thus lowering the overall happiness of your entire base.  The game feels very slow because they walk very slowly to wherever they need to go.  However once they get to where they need/want to go then the activity itself only lasts for a few seconds.  To me this game ends up feeling a tad hollow as they mainly sit in one place working and you don't neccessarily get to enjoy their other every day lives.  Buy this game because you like base building simulators and not people simulators.

												TL;DR Version: as an old classic i say its definately worth getting if you have never played it before, if you have...still get it. bit disapointed with the ""bonus campaign"" thoughAs an old game from my childhood i feel a little biased but that being said this game is awesome and there are two different campaigns with different playstyles (military and economic/civilian) and theres a few other planets in the galaxy mode to play after you finish the campaign and then after that there are sandbox planets to do whatever you want. now the steam edition advertises a new bonus campaign which admittedly frustrates me as it isnt actually a campaign its a single 4-5 mission planet on the galaxy mode with no real new sound assets so it doesnt really feel new at all. although i cant really mark down the game for that one flaw that i picked out as it is new content it just disappoints me that a bonus ""Campaign"" was advertised and what i played through felt short and lacked that something interesting that the acctual campaign levels of the past had. Combat wise this game hits the mark perfectly, you have different alien types that each have different ways to effectively kill them by using lasers, hover mine launchers, nukes, forcefields, clusterbombs and an arrays of various different robot combat units (sadly still no giant mechs), and if combat isnt your taste there is definately something here for the economist in you aswell. Plenty of different resource types that each require different buildings that in turn require different skills to run. Lasty moving on from skills are the colonists themselves, each have different personalities and skills. the skills can be trained into your colonists and you will need to build different recreational, food and health facilities to keep your colonists happy.

You can play maps that you need to concentrate on tourism, on sell materials or military defense/attack. Maybe you don't know it, and the game sounds a little bit old. Yes, maybe you're right.

												A surprisingly fun little sim/management game. It feels a little rough around the edges, as far as UI design, but I was able to find everything I needed and got used to the controls eventually.The game's style (humorous, cartoonish) is well implemented and consistent. The only problem I had was that it was nearly impossible to understand half of what the character Stig said, due to his incredibly heavy accent. But that was rarely a significant problem.The AI was good enough that it didn't feel like I was taking care of helpless infants, so I could instead keep track of a general view of the colony and send people to do what was most needed, which a good sim/management game should do.It isn't the best sim/management game I've ever played, but it does a good job, and I'll enjoy slowly getting all of the achivements over time.

SIMS IN SPAAAAAAACE....LOl. Seriously though, this pretty much is the sims in space. ALthough with more focused goals to which you must manage your charges towards. ALso, your playthings have rather well fleshed out quirks and personalities and lettiung them die is a bad thing since, well you kinda need them to run your base.I won't do my usual pros and cons thing because really, for this type of game, you already knew what they were if you were even tangentally aware of the Sims.. SO I'll just bounce to the summary..ahem...THe game holds up well and while the interface is somewhat confusing and unhelpful, it's really not a bad little game. You will easily find at least one or two colonists you like and a few that you outright hate (Tammi).  All in all, a challenging game best enjoyed in small bites. Give it a try and you won't regret it.			"
