												So I dug this game out of my library and have been playing it a lot recently.Started up a game as England because why not.I take over Whales and what's left of England. Then I start my war with Scotland. It goes as well as can be expected they have two cities I have...lots. It ends pretty fast. However just before Great Britan becomes unified I am excommunicated from the church. No matter William the Fatty dies soon enough and I am back in. I then set out on my duty like any good Catholic Lord does and Chritianize this land I have taken.Everything is going well. Our cities are growing in England, and on mainland Europe we managed to take over Brittany and Belgium and Holland. With this new base of man power I believe it is time to bring the word of Christ to the lands of the heretics in the east!However just as I am about ready to go on the Crusade, France decides I am too threatening to them and declares war on me. No matter English dreams can wait, we will just have to take over this damned country first.The war progresses quickly. France is overwhelmed by the veteran soldiers of the English army, mostly consisting of militia, but they are English Militia so they get the job done.We take over Western France and push farther into French homeland, we even take Paris. Just when the war seems to be wrapping up the French call in the Milanese to help them. I never liked Milan and it never surprises me when they declare war. Soon enough the English standard is flying over Metz and Dijon and all that is left is Marseille and Milan's Italian holdings, they will fall soon enough.However on my march to South France I accidentally declare war on Portugal when they came to the aid of France in a battle. It is only small little Portugal and their Iberian holdings will be great for bringing the Sign Of The Cross to the Moors....someday.But alas. It seems England became to big for its breeches. The Not-Holy-Nor-Roman-And-Certainly-Not-An-Empire Holy Roman Empire declares war. UGH. This is going to take much longer than expected. And to make matters worse it seems at some point I was removed from the Church.  I only notice because apparently a Crusade was called On Toulouse, which I own.Whether I am now the Anti-Christ or not I was still English and I wasn't about to let some European trash walk into my realm and take it. So I fortify my holdings and wait for the coming storm of armies. In quick succession France, Milan, HRE, Portugal, Hungry and Spain join the Crusade. Not good.Having lost a king and a large handful of family members in the war so far I needed to be careful. So instead of invading their lands I let them come to me. Quick enough three armies are outside my stronghold outbumering me 2:3 (I had reinforced with an army made of entire cavalry).First up is Spain. I let them wait outside and build up siege equipment. Then they attack. It is over before it starts, since apparently Spaniards are made up of weak soldiers who don't even know how to hold a spear properly. Defeating them with minimal losses I turn my gase to the next foe, Hungry.They put up a better fight than the Spanish but they too are not match for English bravery, and are soon defeated and sent home to Eastern Europe to have their silly fights with the Poles and Rus'.The last army to face is the Germans. However I am seriously lacking in soldiers defending Toulouse and have to attack with my Cavalry army. Though at the start of the battle my general warns me that their army is made up of many spears, they have studied me well and it seems that only they will put up a good fight, it truly is time for brave hearts and brave deeds.England has the high ground on the battlefield and we swarm over them like a hoard of.....well angry English. The battle is over disappointingly fast. Their army is in retreat, it seems that even their emperor came to the battle but he too flees from the field like a woman. Our Light Cavalry, those dashing fellows they, catch up to him before he knows what happens and is my prisoner.I demand a ransom but he ""claims"" he doesn't have the money something about the international jewery shafting his economy. Nonsense. If he can't pay with his Florins then he will pay WITH HIS HEAD!Maybe executing the German Emperor wasn't the best idea but no matter, there is still a war to be won. I defeat the French, Portugese, and Milanese Crusading Armies in time and even branch out into Iberia and across the Rhine. Somewhat expectedly the Pope dies and a new one is elected, not much of a surprise he is Italian, and he hates me. But I still have dreams of one day reclaiming the Holy Land in the Name of Our Lord and Savior. So I send an assassin to kill the Pope. The first one fails but the next one doesn't and the Pope dies soon enough.Disappointingly the next one is German, well that can't be so he dies as well. The next is Polish. Well I don't have any problems with Poland so he can live, for now. He even allows me to return to the Church, I think things might be turning around. But when I go to defend my homeland against...someone it is all a blur by now, I am excomunicated again, what a disappointment I had high hopes for this new Pope but it seems he will go the same route as the last.However my greatest assassin, Christopher the Christian Killer fails me, not only does he fail me he gets himself killed and I am now at war with all of Christendom. With my last King dying from ""mysterious causes"", and most of my armies heavily wounded from the continuing war, I retreat. Pulling my forces back across all of France seeing all that I had fought so hard to make. Metz, my most recent conquest gone like an instant. Toulouse that I had held out against all odds when I was deemed ""An Enemy Of The Faith"". Antwerp, where strong soldiers had held out against constant German invasions for over two decades, indeed to was a hard pain to swallow but it had to be done, with the peasantry in open revolt by home from being removed from the Church for so long. I always knew the people would betray me given the chance. So the great armies of victorious England headed home back to farming, waiting, watching for the time when we could once again sail across the Channel and bring the word of Christ to the heathen.

												I started with Rome: Total War and it was a great game. You picked an empire to control and used diplomacy, force, and cunning to grow. You manage armies, cities, and special units (spys/diplomats) in order to conquor Europe and surrounding areas.What Medieval II: Total War did was took Rome: Total War and made it even better. With the same mechanics and the addition of converting cities to forts and vice-versa the gameplay becomes even better. New units, new Factions, and a new map gave this series a well deserved title.I myself consider Medieval II: Total War to be the best game in the entire Total War franchise because instead of dumbing down the game (which is becoming rampant in the game industry) they took what they had and improved upon it instead.I recommend you buy this game if you are an intelligent person who enjoys to plan things out and act upon them with patience and coordination.Thanks for reading.

												This game has stood the test of time. In an age of decline and ruin in strategy gaming, one's mind wanders back to the glory of the past, and that glory is Medieval 2 Total War. Forget for a moment, the horror of poor optimization, leave behind the decadance of overpriced DLC, and remember the greatness of heroic men battling on fields of Medieval Europe. From the rocky crags of Scotland to the sands of Arabia, this game has it all. You ask for unique factions? Medieval 2 has many. Want a good campaign without horrible AI and bad diplomacy? This game delivers.  Do you desire frenetic Free-for-all battles? This game has those too. Now, take your mind back to the present. Total War is not what it once was. Mourn for our dying franchise, for there was greatness once. There once was a light in the civilized world, and this was it, this was our finest hour.11/10. Master of Total War and High Emperor of Creative Assembly. "

												I have clocked over 1000 hours on this game on the old retail DVD version. And all i can say is this is the best Total War game CA has released - and will probably ever release. Shogun and later games have their good sides but this one is still the best. Kingdoms expansion adds some 200-500 hours more of gameplay should you run out. Stainless Steel and some other unit expansion mods adds some hundreds more. Graphics are getting old and the good ol' AI is not that splendid. Not even with mods - but this game along with it's older brother in arms Rome Total War got things right on some things that CA persistently cannot reproduce anymore: pure fun, paper rock scissors -type of strategy that enables exciting and interesting meta-campaigns. (who cares about official campaign goals - these games are always more or less open ended). And lets not forget those exciting long battles. Later games brought more crashing and complexity and lost something on the road. Fun and entertainment value being the first ones who took a fatal trebuchet cow carcass shot to the neck.			"

												If you love the time period and liked Rome Total War then this game is for you.  I was not that happy with the game until I learned how to effectively charge knights. In Rome Total War you simply double clicked on what you wanted dead. In Medieval ll  you have to keep your formation in line before attacking. This is accomplished be judging the ground between you and the enemy unit you want to decimate.  When you are at a run with your knights and they are formed up in line hit the attack order (Double click).  Hitting them head on is a must (unless they are pike men then hit them from the back) spearmen don't stand a chance when a formed charge hits them. The diplomacy in  this game is involved and steeped in history. The different agents can help you do things like cement alliances with marriage or steal money from other nations with merchants.  The pope has impact on your decisions when you are a catholic nation. The crusades are very fun and a good mini quest which will help you groom princes to become better kings. The family tree adds a personnel touch which makes you actually care about your generals. The availability of mods also makes this a great game for instance if you get tired of the same old game then you can download something like Stainless steel mod which overhauls the entire game.			"

												TL;DRAn overall excellent game that I would highly recommend to anyone.Now, for the detail. First, I'd like to say that I have played this game for far longer than my steam hours. I played the gold edition disk for about 3 years before adding it to steam. I'd estimate I have something in the 600 realm of hours, 700 if you include steam time.EDIT: 600/700 on gold edition CD. Add that to steam time.On to the actual game. This game is a fantastic and educational experience about the middle ages. Even though some of it is innacurate 95% is correct, and you will most likely learn at least a few things you didn't know. To start with you have the option of 5 different factions, and by destroying other factions you unlock them as playayable. (orrrrrrr, you could just go into the files and change it so you can play as all of them straight away :)The campaign map is a well designed and easy to look at part of the overall game, with a clear layout so that you can tell what is going on instantly. The controls and design for building and recruiting are made easy also, and the advisors are helpful to new players. (though annoying for more experienced ones) and you can get involved straight away.Now for the best part. The battles are an overall incredible experience where you can lead an army into various types of battles; from raiding and capturing a castle to a field war of skill. As you play more, you can win fought out battles that you normally would not be able to or if the odds are stacked against you, and you become a true commander and build your empire.The DLC (Kingdoms pack) is actually a very worthwhile DLC, bringing in 4 new campaigns packed with new factions, units and maps, however I would not recommend playing these until you have at least got the hang of the main campaign, as these are far more in depth and you will get more out of them after obtaining a basic level of experience.To conclude, this masterpiece is my personal favourite in the series and I'd strongly recommend you play this over any other Total War title. If you are considering it, buy it. If it goes on sale, even better. Buy it as a gift. I'm sure someone will love it.			"

												 Getting slightly out of date now but still a fantastic game. The graphics for its time were groundbreaking and the scope of the game is huge but best of all manageable and keeps you involved. The real time battles are breathtaking and challenging but allow you to develop your skills as the campaigns unfold. Still one of my favourite Total War games and a great look at this fascinating period of history. A benchmark even today in the strategy game genre.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Medieval II Total WarDeveloper:  The Creative AssemblyPublisher:  SEGAGenre:  RTS/TBS hybridGeneral ImpressionI've been playing Medieval II Total War since it's launch in 2006. It was the first game in the Total War series to introduce texture diversity within the troops of a single unit. It remains one of my favorite strategy games, mainly for its easy to mod game engine, which sparked many high quality mods such as ""The Long Road"", ""La Guerre de Cent Ans - The Hundred Years War"" and ""For King or Country: The English Civil War"".Strong Points+ Pleasant graphics and sounds.+ High modding potential.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- 4 years per turn, in the vanilla campaigns.- No Achievements.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

 Despite it's old age, it's a masterpiece.Medieval II: Total War is one of the best strategy games I've played. It's both enjoyable in a strategical and personal sense.Lets just straight get into why.Gameplay- The game manages to be detailed with their strategy, forcing you to actually flank and position your troops. It doesn't just account to how large your force is or whose troops are more disciplined, though, those two are factors to consider as well. In multiplayer, you might even be able to factor in Psychological Warfare! It gets pretty in-depth. And I love that.- In the Campaign, your Generals, Merchants, Spies, Diplomats and Assassins can gain, lose, enhance and diminish traits. It forces you to treat them as actual people to win the war, not the game. Your General is too hot-headed? Have him take up an Administrative Role for a while...Oh, he's too scary? Have him spare the peasants. He's a good guy, despite all the villages he burned...Probably.- The building and unit descriptions are just superbly fun to read, I find myself spending minutes reading the buildings and units on the queue. As well as the trait descriptions..It makes the game more immersive.- General Speeches are just the best thing ever. They can either be very good, like ""Pray now for the intercession of Saint Michael in our Imperial Cause..If you ride a horse, add a prayer to Saint Martin for your devotions!"" Or they can be extremely savage, ""They say that the French are better loves than fighters, this is true: Ask any goat, pig or other farmyard animal."" And, my favorite, can be hilarious, ""Well, here's the thing. I look at our foes, and all I see are a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥weasels!"" These things don't matter. They don't. But they're so good. And the fact that the later Total War games remove this makes it feel like something was missing in their core.- If you're ever bored with native gameplay, the modding community is ready to make you waste more hours on their mods like Stainless Steel, Third Age, DarthMod, etc.- The dead bodies don't despawn. The unit sizes are 80-160 men per unit. Maybe even more. I think that speaks for itself. It does? Of course it does.- While the campaign is great, I can't deny, nor can anyone deny, the fact that the AI is bad. I'd like to take this short moment to just be thankful that it's not as dumb as Empire: Total War's..- The unit variety is very large at first, but after a few hours of gameplay, you'll start to realize how little it is..Community- The Community isn't very bad, but not very good either. From my experience, the people are usually nice, and everyone follows the rules given by the host. (And apologize if they accidentaly don't.) Though, you will still occassionaly run into rude people, cheaters, campers, etc. Still, I still find a lot of fun in Multiplayer.Graphics- The Graphics in Medieval II isn't very impressive, but it's not bad either. But hey, it's an old game, so the lack in graphics is justified. Besides, charging knights will still look epic in any Total War game, no matter the graphics.Experience- The best thing about any total war game, or any game, is the experience. I have so much misadventures and adventures in this great game. I had a great general who died in defense of our Great Capital. (His name was Richard the Fearless.) I had an Assassin who assassinated every Pope that was elected until only the Cardinal from my nation was left to be elected. (His name was Ezio Borgognion the Killer.) I had a faithful unit of Mailed Knights that I brought to in every single campaign since the moment they were recruited early into the campaign. It's just..It's great. To be honest, this is probably why Medieval II is considered one of the best strategy games, and one of the best Total War games. It's the adventures you get through this.TL;DRBattles - Multiplayer - 10/10 | Singleplayer - 8/10Campaign - Multiplayer - 9/10 | Singleplayer - 9/10Gameplay - 8/10Graphics - 8/10Community - 9/10Immersion - 13/10Overall - 10/10. Go get it, if you're a fan of Strategy, you won't regret it.Oh, I forgot to warn you. Do NOT ♥♥♥♥ with the Pope.			"

Huge invasion fleet destroyed by England. <- Realism.Suddenly, Black Plague. Lost 2/3 of my people. Can't have armies anymore.Suddenly, Mongols, not enough troops in the East, I retreat.I take Rome and kill the prisonner pope. New one is British. He don't like me. Every other Christian Nation hate me, I'm apparently the Anti-Christ. I got Crusades.I lost a lot of cities. Rebels everywhere. My kings are assassinated.Europe is now at open war as some nations decide to keep for themselves the towns, original owner declare war.Pope excomunicate everyone.""Christian"" Kingdoms wage war against each other.Mongols laugh and go forward to the west.Heresy, the whole world is plagued with Heretics. And Inquisitors too.I manage to hold the Mongols away, but now I feel alone on Scandinavia.Pope finnaly forgive me... 2 turns before he get killed my mongols.Whole World speak mongol now. But I'm happy because I'm Christian again.10/10 would plunge the world into chaos again.			"

												        Yet another amazing addition to the franchise! What Rome: Total War does, Medieval 2: Total War does better. The first thing  I would like to talk about are the graphics. They have tremendously been enhanced from Rome: Total War, and you don't need much of an upgrade if at all to play this game! Shining plate, and mail armor. A great amount of new units, and weapons. Even improved animations! Unlike Rome: Total War, many of the combat animations of the units have been synced with the enemies attacks and deaths as well. No longer is it a slash at the air and instantly killing the enemy, now it's a fluid stab to the ground that makes you feel like they are actually fighting. One of the features I found quite neat are the types of armor your unit has for their armor rating. Now your unit gets the look of their armor rating! If you have bronze, it is usually padded armor, silver is half-plate (Or mail, depending in unit type), and Gold is full plate (If your unit can be upgraded to gold)! Their weapons however, do not change, or at least I have not seen a difference. Combat is also quite different than Rome: total war. Your units take a second to actually respond to a command which makes more sense to me, and it is also much slower. The campaign map is nearly the same as Rome: Total War except it has some minor changes. Overall, if you like strategy games this is a must have in your library. Too long didn't read: Feature improvements, better animations, slower combat, new types of armor. Good game, buy.			"

												Medieval II: Total War is a strategy game from Creative Assembly and published by SEGA. It is a sequel to the previous games, Rome: Total War. This time the game is set on medieval era.Medieval II: Total War retain many elements of gameplay from Rome: Total War with many enhancement such as the improved religion system and world events like the Christian Crusade or the Islamic Jihad. As a Christian Kingdom you can answer the call of The Pope the conquer the land considered infedel by them. Settlement are now divided into 2 type, a castle and a city. Settlement can be converted between.Graphics of Medieval II: Total War are improved in many ways from the previous game. Each soldier has a varying number of elements to him, such as arms, legs, body armour, shield heraldry, and so forth. Each element has a varying number of styles. Arrow and fire arrow effects feels more alive. Blood effects has also been introduced, but without gore effects.Medieval II: Total War is a great sequel of Total War series. Medieval era especially the Crusade era is one of many interesting setting in Total War. With improved graphics, the performance of the game still great, the game runs very optimized. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												I went from conquering the Portugese, obliterating the Moors and waging war on France. The Pope disliked this, and ex-communicated me. As he called a crusade on my capital, I assassinated and replaced him with my own cardinal. My puppet pope brought me back to the Church, and called a crusade upon France, allowing me to take it with the help of most of the world. I then sailed to England, and took Scotland and burned their fields and exterminated their populace. The Mongols arrived and I eviscerated their horses upon my walls and stakes. After the Pope hailed me as a hero, I invaded Rome and the Papal State was no more, and I foguht my way through every Christian faction until I took Jerusalem, bringing a victory to my campaign.I then started in Middle Earth, Erebor being my new home. The people of Dale were nothing but an annoyance, so I siezed their homes and their docks, burning the MirkWood Elves to use as fuel for my fires. Sauron decided that I was to be removed, and sent his armies to my mountain. He broke upon Dwarven Steel like a water upon rock, and I marched upon Mordor, broke down the Black Gate and took Bara-Dur. Gondor cheered, as my armies marched on Minas Tirith and I became the new Chancellor of Gondor, putting an end to the reign of the Dark Lord and Men and Elves, and hailing a new age of Dwarven resolve.The Argonians were isolationists until I got a hold of them. We gathered our guerilla armies, and marched out of Black Marsh. We took the surrounding provinces, solidifying our hold upon Tamriel. The White City were threatened, but dared not oppose us. We fought a bloody war against the Khajiit, their deserts hindering our advance, but we triumphed in the end, putting an end to the bloody furbags. They became our armour and new home decorations. When the Daedric arrived, they could not hope to penetrate the Lizard agility of the armies, each one slipping through their grasp, their gates closing one by one, until finally their armies were defeated. Thus leaving the world in a state of uneasy peace.The amount of mods in this game makes it worth while, not to mention the large amount of content in the base game and DLC. I highly reccomend picking it up.			"

Knowing betrayal can lurk in this game, I simply war against all and trust none.My first conquest was britannia. Scotland put up a good fight, however fell to England's power. The rebels were taken care of quite early.Now with the british isles under my control, I set my eyes on France. They owned a large deal of land, however were bankrupt and didnt have enough money for a good military force. I took this as my chance. I send a few armies over to deal with the French, and proved successful. The french king was slain by the blade of mine.With France under my control, I set my gaze upon Spain and Portugal. However, they would be more of a problem. They have the advantage in seas. Therefore, I sent multiple of my general's armies over to deal with them. We proved successful and eventually cut down spain. Portugal denied becoming a vassal, and was therefore absorbed into our glorious English Empire.Now with most of Western Europe under my control, I set my eyes upon the Holy Roman empire.They were taken down, however we took a good beating from the HRE. The pope calls a crusade upon one of our major military cities. Luckily, this place was already heavily guarded by my men. We were able to last through the crusade.Feeling angered from the Papal State's foolish act, I set my eyes away from the last 2 cities of HRE and onto the Papal States. The pope was going to die.The papal states were weak, being small to begin with either way. Now, I have the papal states under my control, and the Holy Roman Empire left in a glimpse of its former self. I finished off HRE, and realized the mongols were invading. I swiftly remembered the mistakes of my past, and garrisoned my heaviest armies onto my borders, expanding it cautiously.The mongols were close to us when the Byzantine Empire fell. Now i have quite a bit to look forward to.			"

												Total War: Warhammer just came out huh?Total war: Medieval 2 Warhammer End times just came out as well, all you need is M2TW and Kingdoms, and now you have the entire Warhammer world, instead of just a small patch of it.Perhaps your not into Warhammer? How about Lord of the Rings? Want to play as the orcs of morder, and bring back the one ring and see what happens?Perhaps you want to just relive the medieval times as a loyal Crusader, or warmongering Jihadist?Then Medieval 2: Total war is what you want.The modding community for this game is INSANE! There are mods which allow you to improve upon the base campaign significantly, to completely overhauling the game. This is something no other Total war in the franchise has nearly achieved. This game's modding community can beat anything CA puts out, the new Medieval 2: Warhammer End times mod that came out roughly around the same time Total War Warhammer came out, proves this.Buy this game. NOW. (Be sure to buy Kingdoms!)			"

												Definately has to be one of the best strategy games I have ever played. First of all, the gameplay offers a massive choice of nations and units each with their own traits. 17 different factions on top of long and short campaigns give a lot of room for different story paths and immense replayability. The mix of battles, diplomacy, family traits and strategy AI create a truly realistic and immersive game that offers an infinate number of choices to your next move, although the turn-based elements often feel oversimplified. It does have a solid real time combat foundation, but the AI is either really good or really bad depending on the difficulty setting. There is no middle ground. If you are new to real time strategy games, this one has a pretty steep learning curve. Even seasoned players may feel overwhelmed.One campaign can take days, even months of play time. However, sometimes the game can become a bit taxing to less motivated players (not that I'm complaining) and the AI during battles can often glitch. Whilst these glitches are mostly minor, they nevertheless break your immerson in the game and can be quite annoying when your soldiers glitch about instead of doing as they're told. Despite all its weaknesses, Med 2 is still a briliantly crafted game, its strategy mixed in with impressive graphics and cinematic music will keep you wound up in the Medieval age for thousands of hours.It's one of CA's best (Total War) games. It beats Empire, it beats Napoleon (which was rather a pile of garbage so that wasn't hard) and it beats Shogun2. I still like Medieval 2 better than anything that came after it.			"

												  Medieval II Total War, Yes it may not have GREAT graphics but it is amazing for when it was made aka, 2006. This game did have a few glitches and all but was an amazing game, using the Rome One Engine, and also having an amazing Modding community for which expanded the Total War series, from different Genres, for which when you look at this now Total War era, you see the ability not allowing Modders to change the game full way but only about Half way. Medieval II Total war shows a mix from the past to the Present day, and I think THIS game was the gateway from old Total War to the new. I love this game and its mods, like Stainless steel, Third Age, And if your a games of Thrones, there is a mod for that too! So if you love the Medieval Era, You love Total War Series, I recommend this game for you, I rate it 8/10!			"

The game covers Crusades, Mongolian invasion and even early colonisation of America. Medieval features factions (both playable and AI controlled) ranging from Aztecs in The New World to Turks, Russians and Mongols in the East. All that in 1 vanilla game without any DLC or mods.			"

												Having played Rome 1 and its expansions, Empire, and Attila in addition to this one, I would have to say that Medieval II is still my favorite of the series. I spent countless hours, both on the disk version, and then later on the steam one conquering my enemies or desperately fighting off hordes of invaders from the East.There are plenty of excellent mods out there for just about anything you can imagine, but I never really felt the game needed mods to be enjoyable. In fact I probably have more time playing the stock version than I do with mods.For a game that's a little over 10 years old now, it's held up remarkably well, and I'd venture to say that it's one of my favorite strategy games of all time.Edit: Removed section about redeeming retail CD keys for a steam version, as that apparently no longer works. Sorry for the misinformation.			"

												This game was amazing at the time it came out. I totally loved it. But I would recommend to play it now, because attempts to bring the rich lore of the Lord of the Rings universe into the video game space have been about as successful as asking a hobbit to cut back to just five meals per day. Struggling under the weight of expectations and movie tie-ins, these games have left those desperate to explore Tolkien's engrossing world disappointed at best (looking at you Shadow of Mordor). It took a devoted team of modders to do what the triple-A titles could not, and the result is the mightily impressive Total War modification - The Third Age.


Medieval II is an old game, but it's worth playing again and again for the Lord of the Rings mod!

												My honest opinion:The AI is what really stands out. It's just as competent in battle as Attila's (the most recent TW title) is, and does well in the campaign, too.The tactical (battle) part of the game has aged incredibly well, all things considered. The combat mechanics are robust, and abilities are important (though a bit 'busy' in terms of interface, and fire-at-will is not always enabled by default on units that are meant to only fight at range). The asymetry in rosters means that combat can really vary a good deal, yet the balance feels just right.The strategic (campaign) part of the game aged less well. It's certainly playable, and it, too, feels balanced yet complex, but I'd be lying if I said the user-interface was all that good. As campaign UI goes, it's somewhat cluttered IMO, though I'd argue it's probably better than N:TW's was.In technical stuff, it's really, really stable, something that inexplicably was not the case in Empire and N:TW... in those games, I seemed to get sound glitches on the campaign screen, crash during battles, and so forth pretty much every campaign, forcing constant saving to be ready. Here, though, the game never seems to glitch up or break down.In artistic stuff, the game does quite well. For the era it was made in, the unit cards are good, and the unit models are surprisingly detailed when you zoom all the way in. The music is great, too. And the voice-over is, as always, the one mixed-bag (aside from the campaign UI, which was mentioned above). Voice-over work is terrible for units, but acceptable for in-game advisor and narration of pre-battle stuff (in historical battles, etc.).Overall, is it worth it for $20.00? Well, without mods I could see arguements that $20.00 is too high... but bear in mind how long the game has existed and how many people made mods for it, and it becomes evident that there will be plenty of mods to wade through and try.So, I marginally recommend it. A decade ago, I'd say to pick it up in a heart-beat... today, it's still just as good, but should really be a bit cheaper given that you will want to get the Kingdoms expansion as well and, hey, it's a pretty old title now (both it and the ex-pack).On sale, though, it's a no-brainer: pick it up.

												Now let me tell you, I am a great builder, the best in the buisness, I'm great, I know how to build things. But you know what's not great? Our country. We don't win anymore. We used to have clear victories, but we don't have them anymore. Our country's in serious trouble. I mean, when do we beat France in war? In an even battle, they kill us. When do we beat Scotland at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. We invite people from all over the world, including Syria, and we have no idea of who these people are. They are spies, they are sneaky diplomats, they are naffatunes, and some, I assume are good people. But we need a total and complete shutdown of Muslim immigration to England. We also need to build a great wall between us and Scotland, and it will be a beautiful wall with a big fat door where people can come in LEGALLY. Islam hates us, they really do. They exterminate and sack our villages, and I'll be sure to protect the Papist community from them. The pope questions my faith sometimes, but it's a disgrace to do so. I sent 4 cardinals into Ireland, I really did, and I built a great cathedral in York. Soon the Moors will declare a jihad on London at this rate. Anyways, when do we beat Venice at trade? They get 40 florins per turn on a resource, and we get 10! Let me tell you, if you crown me king, I'll bring back Blood Eagle and I'll bring back a hell of a lot worse. It'd be a pretty picture to see the Polish Queen on her knees. She's hot, just like my daughter, the future princess Ivanka. If she wasn't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her. Our country is weak! Our military is like number 20 on the turn report. At least that's what the experts tell me. I get a lot of pro players, they're calling me, they're saying ""king, you're gonna do something that's gonna be so tough"". And it's true.

												Step 1. Take over the world as England.Step 2. Take over the new world as England.Step 3. Get bored and try something else.So here is that ""something else"".Step 1. Launch Crusader Kings II.Step 2. Play Crusader Kings II. Everytime a battle occurs in the game, switch to Medieval II (You'll have to play one of the games not through steam for this to work).Step 3. Play through a similar battle in MedievalStep 4. Console through the outcome of the battle, now you can play Crusader Kings II with realtime battles, or Medieval II with more detailed campaign!Or just play the game by it's self. It's pretty good.

												Medieval II: Total War is probably my personal favorite entry in the Total War franchise. This is partially due to my love of the time period, partially due to my previous obsession with the original Medieval: Total War (if they added that to Steam, I'd snap it up in a heartbeat), but largely because it managed to find the perfect balance between complexity and simplicity when it comes to campaign options - a balance which later entries in the series have tried to reproduce but often fall to one side or the other in attempting.Like all Total War games, Medieval II features a turn-based strategy map where the player manages their armies and cities, and a real-time tactical battlefield where they play out combat against opponents' armies. Medieval II covers the medieval period of Europe (and includes northern Africa and portions of the Middle East), allowing your faction to attempt to conquer the entirety of the western world of the time.It's fantastic and an enormous timesink. The graphics hold up surprisingly well for a game that was almost released a decade ago, in large part because the spectacle is so based on the massive numbers in the armies instead of incredible detail on the individual units.Medieval II is a wonderful game, and I heartily recommend it to any strategy fans.

												Hey there! I'm gonna assume you're deciding about if you should buy this game. So here you go...Well, here's a quick summary of the game!1: It's obviously similar to many games made by Creative Assembly.2: It's somewhat ""cheap"" compared to other games3: Better AI than Total War: Rome II (as many others would say)4: Not split into little DLC peices, compared to today's Total War games5: This game is still active in multiplayer, 10+ years after it's release!My opinion: It is basically Total War: Rome II, but better and it is worth it's price, including the DLC (Kingdoms). So if you're thinking about buying this, I would say yes. However, this is just my opinion of the game, so you can choose if you would like to buy this or not. Anyways, have a nice day and I hope I've helped you make your decision today! ^-^EDIT 11/26/2016: Voted for the ""Test of Time"" Steam Awards!			"

												Medieval II Total War is an interesting game that lives up to most expectationsThere isn't that much to say here. It's a good game that has some very obvious flaws. Flaws that are amusing in their own ways and can be fixed with some good mods if they bother you. For those who don't know it, The Total War series has essentially two different games in it. The tactical battles, which are great and on nearly all the screenshots - Letting you be a commander of your army and lead your men to victory. And secondly a strategic campaign in which you manage your nation and try to take over the world(In a short time if you go for the game's objectives, but it's a game- your objective is having fun). The weak spot in all of this is the AI. The AI is, to put it lightly, comparable to an inbred dog with downs. While some parts such as the tactical battles don't show it as much and has the AI do decent at tactics, the diplomacy and campaign AI can't figure out what's going on and seems to exist purely as something to facilitate interesting tactical battles.But enough about the AI, it's still a good game that can show you the slow, interesting change from medieval warfare to guns and cannons, and lets you use it all in your battles to conquer the world. Along with this you will possibly end up exploring the new world, dealing with the mongols and crusading. In the end, you can be sure that plenty of things will happen to keep you interested and there will be plenty of places to conquer. Mechanics such as religion, your faction's family tree, and actually having to pay attention to your finances mean you will be busy with your empire's details without forcing you to micromanage it all. Though that is an option if you want toAll in all, it's pretty good. Decent graphics, good gameplay, and a big campaign to keep you busy. It's not the best Total War game out there, but it's trying its best!			"

												A great TW Game, with very good grahics, good campaign map, and many other cool features. Gameplay is easy, and simple, with little experience in other TW games needed, though it does help to have a knowledge of TW games in general when playing *any* Total War game. Diplomacy is greatly improved, giving   the feture of seeing what the proposal's strength is(a HUGE plus, when compared to Empire's rather un-responsive AI Diplo), and the Campaign Map is of excellent quality(obviously not Rome II quality, as i is some years older, but still very good, and very detailed) Battles are great, with a good UI allowing full control of the battlefield, and immersive maps that truly do the game justice. Again, the graphics here are great, and very detailed in the city/castle making. Another big plus is the inclusion of the Family Tree, later removed, which is great for viewing whom is within an ever growing family, and who should be king(a great plus over having to kill off the un-desired heir in the previous Medieval: Total War XD).I cant give this game enough positive reviews, and have yet to come across anytihg negative.10/10 for me, well worth the purchase. Highly recommend during the currant Total War Weekend, and still after.			"

												ok for people that saw my silly review about this game before, im gonna actually say why i like this game and not my blitzing recordpros:-great campaign with every faction being unique and religious wars like a jihad or a crusade-great events like the mongol invaision, the black death and the timurids that will put a hurt to you and maybe destroy you-multiplayer community stands really strong even if this game was made in 2006 (even if apollo drove out everyone from medieval 2 and makes them play third age and medieval kingdoms 1212ad)-like i said above, every faction is unique so that means that every faction has their own strategies, for example poland is more of a rush faction while spain is more of a missle faction and byz is more inf focused-A REAL expansion, not dlc whoring to make the game as it should feel like, oh did i also mentioned that this expansion adds 4 NEW EXPANSIONS? (americas, britannia, crusades, teutonic)-there is the ability (in expansions and mods) to make a hotseat. what a hotseat is, its like a multiplayer campaign but you can fill all the factions and play it with your friends (search more in videos at least)cons-its easy to exploit the ai and the game is kinda buggy when it comes to pathfinding (its still good tbh)-if you are a guy that likes only graphics then this is not the game for you (but i dont care about graphics)-i know that i said that the medieval 2 community is still big but it decreased recently (one of the reaons is because apollo left medieval 2 and plays only TA and medieval kingdoms and that forces them to play those mods to just send him replays)if i had an option i whould rate it a 10/10. its just the best total war with the best expansion. this is a MUST BUY TOTAL WAR			"

												TL:DRBest game ever. 9.95/10. Very good for strategy fans and those looking to get into strategy games. Fun!Long ReviewEasily my favourite and most played game of all time. Including my hours from before I had this amazing game on Steam I'd say I have 1000+, if not 2000+, hours. Perhaps even 3000+ hours. This is an amazing game.PROS Graphics are nice considering how old this game is. Spend most of your time zoomed out anyway so it looks good.Campaigns fun. The AI are abysmal at times but it's nice to have a laugh every once in a while. Campagins usually play out differently each time although patterns do emerge. Change this by changing your playstyle.Seemingly limitless possiblities. Want to try and tackle the Papal States straight away? Go for it. Want to rebild the Roman Empire? Go for it. Want to be a noble highlander reclaiming the Holy Lands and build  Scottish Empire in the arid desert? Go for it.Battles are fun. Crushing enemies beneath your feet is fun. Creating one empire to rule them all is fun. Planning your next strike and best targets is fun. Mods can enhance you playtime by many more hundreds of hours. Every con has a solution or silver lining. DLC is great. Expands game time by even more! Adds interesting mechanics to mix things up. Music really enhances the atmosphere.CONS AI can be too easy to beat sometimes. Solution: Play multiplayer! Gun units seem to be a bit buggy and dont work 100% of the time. Seems to mostly be musketeers. Not really much of a problem. Just use other gun units. Diplomacy. AI don't make the best choices. Solution: The series is called  Total War  for a reason! Naval battle will be lacklustre for those who enjoy naval battles. You have to auto resolve but perhaps that is a good think since most of the naval battles in the Total War series aren't great. Units bug out on walls sometimes. Usually issuing the order again or telling the unit to walk instead of run, or vice-versa, fixes this.ConclusionThis is the best Total War game ever! Everything is fun! Gametime to Price ratio is through the roof! The only real problem is lack of multiplayer campaign. I would love to play campagin with my friends. There is hotseat but then you can't fight battles with and/or against your fellow players. Perhaps an HD remaster with tiny tweaks to diplomacy and unit balance and you will have the perfect game!Christendom will be awed by the game reviewed here today!Great games are like sweet nectar, come let us play this most rare and glorious game!Note: This review will be edited a lot when I find things to add and reword it to be more fluid. My comments will also probably be deleted and reposted slightly differently. They really need an edit comment option for people like myself! "

Posted: August 14, 2016
												So I decided to start as France because I LOVE heavy cavalry and I doubt anyone has done it so far.     I started my campaign by absorbing the nearby rebel settlements into my empire.  The first battle goes poorly, I only just barely win and only from capturing the center of the town, I am beginning to doubt if  France was the right choice.  The second battle, however, goes very well.  I use proper cavalry tactics and completely descimate the rebel settlement, adding it to my glorious French empire.  After that I begin dominating the map, settlement after settlement, battle after battle.  Finally, My empire is the largest, the strongest, the richest, the most advanced, and the most populated in the world.  I have also allied with the British, the Polish, and the Holy Roman Empire, with dreams of conquering the British Isles.     I am soon given that chance when I recruit a mercinary fleet of ships.  I get Military access from the foolish British and set my armies in key strategic locations.  The next turn, I execute order 66.  The British are taken off guard and I kill all but two of their generals, king included.  I then turn my eyes to their last territory, where their pretender king awaits.  My king's army marches forth to this English coward, and just when we have our siege equipment ready and our swords drawn, the other British general attacks us from the west.  Nevertheless, we have the advantage and as my my ballistas are aimed for their gate and my horses crush their western army and my troops storm their city and kill their king, but at a cost, my king is bravely killed as well.  Which is good, because we had been excommunicated from the church just prior and were finally let in at news that my ""heathen"" king had been killed.    Just as I make preperations to incorporate these accursed Islands into my empire I am betrayed.  As it turned out, HRE actually hated my Polish allies and decided to attack me as well.  I am enraged to see their sorry yellow and black hides besiege my forces in Metz.  I quickly show these traitors whose boss and wipe out their troops.  But then, their leader, alone, attacks some of my forces near Metz.  I am surprised he beat me with few casualties as he charged DIRECTLY INTO MY LINE OF SPEARS!  He then retreated directly into the stygnian depths of Germany where I could not reach him. No matter, revenge can wait till he's watched his country burn.  I begin hitting him, hard, and end up splitting their empire in half.  Unfortunately, In my viscious assault I am, again, excommunicated from the church.  Thankfully the pope dies and I am reconciled, and to top that, the new one is polish so HRE is then excommunicated.  Sadly the pope calls a crusade on Cairo, and if I don't send my leader, I'll be excommunicated.  So, I do what I must, and before too long, have a crusading army worthy of many gasps.     The crusade goes poorly, to put it mildly.  I end up, for no reason, having my men continuously desert to ""find another party that will be more on track to the destination"".  So I end up wasting thousands of florins on disloyal mercinaries who constantly desert me.  By the time I make it to Cairo, the crusade is over and I am lacking in any reasonable army.  So I start back to paris.  On the way there I reach Constantinople and notice it is lacking in any good military, and just can't resist taking it from the Byzantines.  Back in Europe I have finally taken over the British Isles and was attacked by Spain, who happened to be allied with the HRE.  Now I am in a war on three fronts and have the number one military in the entire world.  And one more thing.  Word has reached me that the mongols have risen so now I seem doomed.     Nevertheless, I manage to take two spanish cities and most of Byzantium.  After that, all that happens are pointless bloody battles that leave thousands dead in their wake.  Finally, gunpowder is made, and France is pushed into a new golden age.  I conquer the Spaniards and the Moors, I take all of Germany and execute their king, and I destroy the rest of the Byzantines.  It seems france will never be beaten.  Then, just as I attack Jerusalem (my victory region), The Mongols attack me and a hopeless battle is fought.  My troops fight like true men, and for every dead Frenchman, 5 more Mongols die.  I loose the battle and swore vengeance on the Mongols.     I start World War 1 with all of Europe facing against the mongols.  And after years of costly battles, me and my allies make it to their main capital city which, ironically, is Cairo.  We barely win the battle.  For years the world is at peace.  Then, the Timurids attack, and it all goes awry.  They take over the Papal states, and much of eastern Europe (including Byzantium).  My troops are barely able to defend what is left of France, and I do not know if any other European nations survived.  The Pope betrays me and takes Cairo to start a new eastern catholic civilization.END RESULT:-Europe and Asia are controlled by only three major nations (France, Timurids, and Papal States), all of which are constantly at each others throats.-America is where the capital of France lies, and is slowly being taken from the Aztecs.-There are unconfirmed rumors that Milan survived and currently owns part of south-east Asia.-I hope for luck and divine intervention as the Timurids are slowly closing in on the America's.-The world is plagued with inquisitors and pagans, all whom corrupt the lands and murder people.-No one's faith is seen as ""satisfying"" from the Pope's perspective, and crusades/jihads are constantly being called on me.                                                             Fin(P.S. GLORY TO FRANCE!!!!!)			"

												Decided to start a game a england. Easy peasy i thought. In a 200 years i was already in control of the British Isles,all of France and even lil Scily. I was also one of the most christian of all the christain kingdoms. I could've called a crusade on ANYONE i didn't like. All was good right. Then the Milanese attacked. See during my entire game these spaghetti eating ♥♥♥♥s would constantly antagonize me. Whenever they attacked i would smash through their puny armies and march right up to Milan itself, sometimes taking it and forcing them  to relocate to Venice or Genoa. I've killed more Doges then i could count. But i've never been able to completly rid myself of them. See for some reason that litteraly god only knows, the pope would demand i end my war with them whenever i was about to finish them off. So for about 50 or so years we played this game of mudering each other until the pope forced us, mostly just me, to stop. Eventually i just had enough. My kingdom was begining to fall and i could not handle to pay my way out of another war i could have won. The plague was ravaging its way across europe and i feared the french Nobility might have been planing to rebel. So when Milan attacked like they always did i played the game right up to where it always ended. With their remaing forces cowering behind the walls of milan or Venice as my galliant Generals prepared to storm the city and fly the banner of the three Lions from its walls. Like always the pope decided that i had my fun and i should apologize to milan like usual. But not this time, no this time i said ♥♥♥♥ you Pope and took milan, Killing their doge and destroying their entire army. Now you'd think this is where the story would end right? The good guys defying the odds and finally defeating their age old rival right? sadly this isn't the end nor will the end be so Romantic.See after taking Milan, the Pope excomunicated me for defying him. Which made me public enemy Number 1 to even my closets allies. On top of that the Milanese regrouped in venice and trapped my men in Milan. If they went to take venice then they would lose milan to a greater force but if they stayed in milan then the Milanese would have more the time to rebuild. I was prepared to counter this by sending more forces into italy. But right as my men begin to enter italy from southern france, i get invaded. See my age old ally and undisputed ruler of Iberia, Spain, Decides to launch a full scale invasion over the mountains. Destroying what little resistance remained.So here i stand. Ruler of a heretical empire that's barely holding together and being betrayed by its closest allies hoping to carve out part of it before it collapses like vulchers circling a dying animal. All becuase the Pope refused to let me have justice.10/10			"

												When the units obey your orders, Medieval II is an amazing spectacle and a fun game to play. Not only are thousands of hand-chosen soldiers fighting at your command, but cities rise and fall at your leisure based on war, diplomacy, sabotage, and assassination. This game isn't perfect, but it deserves far higher than an 8.6 average rating, so I'm throwing in a 10 to make up for the lack of enthusiasm.			"

												One of the very best games ever made. Some of the old, great games perhaps do not age very well, but a few are timeless simply because of their quality. No frills, no gimmicks, no set pieces, no cover systems or achievements - just gameplay and game design in it's purest, most endearing form. Medieval II is one of these games.The game, in typical Total War fashion, involves economy, politics and army management with the ultimate aim of meeting  certain victory conditions, which will vary for each faction. A world map acts as the main user interface of the campaign, but the majority of gameplay will happen in the series' trademark - the battles.In my opinion, this is the greatest game in the Total War franchise. Rome I had more varied unit rosters and was truly groundbreaking for it's time, but Medieval II is just Total War perfection. Hitting the ""sweet spot"" for complexity, political obstacles and size of the campaign map, the game has, whether by design or accident, remained the most (obssessively!) playable Total War to date. The difficulty levels of the campaign feel ""just right"", whether you are new and play on easy or normal, or want more of a challenge and pick legendary. This was the first Total War game I played, and increasing the difficulty felt organic and like a real progression.Everything just comes together in a way which will be evident if you have played any other Total War titles, but regardless of that fact, the campaign is the best experience Total War has to offer. Battles are at their best in the series, with a level of strategic depth which keeps a dedicated online battling community alive to this day, but with an accessibility and satisfaction which makes you want to learn. Winning a campaign, defending a castle against the odds and winning online battles are some of the most rewarding feelings I've ever felt in games. The battles here are Total War at it's best. Every unit has a purpose and a counter, and winning a battle feels truly tactical. Unit speeds feel perfect, and units engaging each other feels crisp, unlike the floaty cluster effect seen in later games in the series. Losing a battle will always be down to a tactical error which will have you wanting to learn and coming back for more. If they managed to break your infantry lines with a clever charge strategy, you will feel like you were outsmarted. There are no gimmicks.The atmopshere of the game is good - the medieval setting and campaign map match the visuals and the soundtrack well. Despite being an old, outdated game, there is a certain charm to the graphics, which makes it stand the test of time as opposed to Rome I, which has poor visuals to the point where it intrudes on the gameplay. Very few games have charming visuals which can stand the test of time, and this is one of them. To illustrate what I mean, others might include the Pokemon series and the Jedi Knight series. Whilst not the strongest point of the game, it does not, however, detract from the gameplay, which is the important part.The only one gripe I can think of is that the armored knights and cavalry might be too cliché and similar for some. A conquistador in full plate armor and an English Knight in full plate armor look similar, with only the heraldry and colours making them identifiable. Personally, however, I never minded this, but it is one issue people have when discussing why Rome I might be better - Rome I had very varied and visually distinct units.An extremely engrossing game, one of the best of all time, I can't hesitate to recommend this. While not as groundbreaking for it's time as Rome I, which is the darling of the series, this is the better, more refined and perfected title.			"

 Medieval 2 Total War- where do I start...? Medieval 2 Total War is the fourth game in  the Total War series. It is a combination of turn-based camping and real time battles. Medieval 2 TW is a great game for every fan of the medieval time period and for every fan of a good strategy game. The Grand camping is great fun as in every Total War game, but when it comes to real time battles, Medieval 2 stands out. Player can set his own custom battles, where he can choose variety of factions to play. Custom battles can be ground battles or sieges of villages, towns, castles, forts etc. I find custom battles really epic and fun to watch. Watching artillery breaking down walls and killing loads of men is just great fun.Another great thing in this game is multiplayer. You can play coop camping with your buddy or join/host a loby and play some epic battles/sieges with up to 8 players.With M2TW Kingdons, you get 4 new DLCs and they come with their own campings, factions and units. Every DLC brings a new time period so you can experience the whole Middle Age from Crusades to finding America. And now, drums please...... The MODS. Oh, yes... Good mods are what TW games are known for. There is a great modding community for this game. Mods like Westeros Total War, Elder Scrolls Total War, Third Age Total War etc. make a whole new game out of Medieval 2. My favourite mod is Third Age Total War which adds 2 new campings (Third Age Camping and The Fellowship Camping). This mod changes all the faction in the game with factions from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books. There are Orcs of Misty Mountain, Mordor, Gundabad, Gondor, Rohan, Elves, Dwarves... Every faction has it's own units (yes, there are orcs, trolls, even Sauron, Balrog and  other iconic characters from the Middle Earth) and every unit looks like it came from the LotR movies. A good number of these mods can be played online! MY CONCLUSION If you like medieval time period, if you like knights and epic battles, hell even if you just like Lord of the Rings, get this game (with Kingdoms DLC if you want to mod it!). You can get this game for 1-5 dollars on sites like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and it is definitely worth it's full price! (not like some other Total War games, sadly).			"

												A much more ""modern"" version of Rome Total War. Only this time it takes place during the Medieval period.You run historical empires during this period as your object like all total war games is to rule over the land. Unlike in Rome: Total War where missions are everything and you have to complete these in order to ascend to the top. This loosen's those restraints and allows you to govern over your lands without the need to do an objective every five minutes. The new SPQR is the Roman Catholic Church. Pay your dues to the church within this game and the Pope will appericate you a lot and thereby will allow some things from you within good reason.The UI for both battle and strategy is a lot more better and a lot more direct than Rome:Total War. The game also provides another detailed tutorial for first timers so you won't have any headaches when your play hours on this game is done.If you want a more updated version of Rome: Total War then buy this today! I recommend it			"

												In my opinion, Medieval 2 is far more enjoyable than any Total War game that has come after it (out of the ones I have played, atleast: Empire, Napoleon, Shogun, and Rome 2). You get more of a classic sense immersion from this one. Taking a young lad to lead a meager peasant band to subjugate an independant city, having him gain experiance, a title, special traits and an army that contains hardened veterans aswell as mercenaries recruited from various campaigns all over the Meditarianian and beyond is simply pure fun. Units react more organically and tactics can truely overcome superior units, unlike some situations in newer titles. The mod scene really makes this game shine. Warhammer (Rage of the Dark Gods), Lord of the Rings (Third Age), or maybe just an enhanced Medieval experiance (Stainless Steel) add and increase tons more playability and enjoyment to an already very good game.

												This is still my favorite Total War (as of 2017), but I really just wanted to add another shout-out to the ""Third Age"" total conversion mod. I just repurchased M2TW here on steam, and after following a few community threads to the Third Age mod, I felt compelled to encourage others to try out Third Age : Total War. It's an incredible work of art, and an amazing addition to the TW library of campaigns and settings. Anyone who enjoyed Warhammer at all and still enjoys Medieval 2 should make the Third Age total conversion mod a priority on their to-play list--if you aren't playing it already.			"

												This game is the best Total War game in existence. This is by far my favourite. Not only are the vanilla and expansion campaigns a lot of fun, but the almost infinite fantastic mods adds the replayability of this game a thousand fold. Pros- Campaign experience is awesome. Lots of depth. Plenty to do. Complex enough that its not difficult to learn, but not easy to master either. It's so easy to get immersed into your kingdom and care about your subjucts. History is your oyster. You become what you want. You can be a benevolent king who's people adore, or a bloodthirsty tyrant that rules with an iron fist, a bumbling general that doesn't inspire his men at all, or the greatest commander alive who even peasants will fight to their death on his command. - More campaign stuff. Cities are realistic in that people actually live there and can be murdered upon sacking the city or plague occurs. The buildings you construct will be present on the battle map. Manpower limitations and recruitment pools disable players from spamming 1 unit type. You have to fill your ranks with a variety of units or wait a very long time for your perfect army. Crusades and Jihads are heaps of fun.- Battle pacing is perfect. The units don't kill each other in a matter of seconds with a bunch of fancy kill animations. They slug it out and get bloody. Everything depends on tactics. You don't just win because you bring lots of elite units. You have to outsmart your opponent or else your quality units won't count for much. - Sieges. No Total War game has more epic sieges than this. Sending four thousand men to assault a citadel garrisoned by half that number will take you a long time to win and push your tactical skills to the limit. 3 layers of walls require you to constantly think about reserving your artillery or your rams. If you run out of ammo or your rams break or theres nobody left to pick up a ladder with 1 wall ring left to go - well you're screwed and you have to retreat. It's awesome. If you are forced to retreat and come back the next turn and they haven't repaired the walls it's all damaged in the exact same way you left it. - The sound track is the best out of any Total War game- MODS. Third age, Westeros, Call of Warhammer, Stainless Steel. Just to name a few. Cons- The AI is pretty stupid and passive. If you're new to the game you might have some difficulty at first but once you understand the AI thought pattern its very easy to outsmart even on the hardest difficulty.  - The game is full of exploits and bugs that were never patched out. Overall I give this game 93/100. Which is pretty good considering I gave Warhammer 80/100. I'll still be playing Medieval 2 long after everyone forgets about Warhammer in a year or so.  "

""Despite it's high age, Medieval II is propably the best single player Total War game to date.""What makes this game's campaigns the most enjoyable for me are the historic events that pop during the game. Events like the Mongol or Timurid Invasion, the invention of gun power and the introduction of guns and cannons in the late game or even the discovery of the Americas are what makes this game so unique among the other games of the series.Also, if you own the addon, Medieval II has the best total conversion mods of any Total War game to offer, some of which more than equal the base game in quality and depth.tl;dr It's great.

												Decided to play this game again started a campaign as Byzantuim. Start the game and head east taking a few cities off Turks. But then Venice attacks one of the main Byzantine cities Thessalonica and takes it. I turn my attention West towards Venice I retake the city and head West. I reach the west coast and rather than head north, I build a fleet and attack Sicily taking Naples and the island of Sicily itself. Then I head north. You can probably see where this is going. I launch a succesfull attack on Rome and march further north and take Bolonga. By this point my army is highley exprience (some have gold exprience). But then Bolonga and Rome rebel I launch a second attack on rome which is unsuccesful. Rome was the entire objective of the campaign to reclaim Rome for true Romans (not like the Holy 'Roman' Empire). My Veteran army in Bolonga attacks the HRE army but they are reinforced.HRE - 4100 TroopsByzantuim - 1050 TroopsThis should of been the end of my Italian campaign but the 4100 strong HRE army was actually 3 armies the first army was quickly defeated and then the second came. My horse archers softened the second army up but soon ran out of ammo then the lines of infantry smash into each other my left flank had hidden troops that attacked the left of the HRE army. The HRE'S right broke and then the enemy army got outflanked they fled and we were so close to victory. And then another army came, this time roughly equal to the amount of men I had left but the last army had feudal knights, superior to my infantry who were also Exhausted. I sent every last man in... and then the HRE army completely shattered. After the defeats of the first 2 armies the 3rd army simply broke and ran. On that day 2000 HRE troops were captured and 1500 were killed but the Byzantine army took heavy casualties too. Nearly 50% of there army were killed but regardless they had won.Yes this really happened. Oh yeah the game yeah like uhhhh 10/10 Ign.			"

												Deus definitely vults it. Significantly better than Rome 2 in terms of battles, playability, load times, concise campaign experience. Seriously after retrying Rome 2, getting frustrated, uninstalling, reinstalling this, it's amazingly stark in terms of gameplay just how much better a game 7 years older is. Battles are waaaay less infuriating (clicking a unit to move makes them start walking, not immediately running - I had no idea how much this bugged me until now), get a line of units to walk towards the enemy, when they make contact, they start fight IN BATTLE FORMATION - no individually clicking each units specific attack orders. I could go on...It's just better. Why are you still reading? Go buy it and wash away those sins with the blood of infidels!			"

												Okay guys - brace yourselves! Long review incoming!*explosions*This game is exactly the sort of game I've been wanting. It sits in my library of Best Three Games: Medieval II: Total War, Age of Empires II (not the HD edition, that's a buggy mess), and Freedom Planet. :P (Grand Strategy, RTS, and.... platformer? What's this nutter up to! :P)It's a fantastic blend of turn-based strategy and real-time strategy.The whole Total War series is good, but Medieval II is extremely cheap. When on sale (and we all know how common those are!) you can get the game for $10 and the Kingdoms expansion for $5. Unlike later TW games, the Kingdoms expansion is a really really good DLC, adding FOUR WHOLE NEW CAMPIAGNS. Much better than one petty ""culture pack."" :PIf you don't know what Total War is, the screenshots & vidoes don't really do the game justice. Simply because there's SO MUCH to the game.Basically:On the campaign map, which in the main campaign goes from England to Russia to Egypt, you control things in a turn-based way. You make your moves, then another faction makes theirs, then another, etc. Because the game has about 20 factions for the Grand Campaign running it on a slow computer will be a bore. :PHowever, when you are attacked you don't fight in a turn-based way. Rather, you fight the battle in realtime. Whether you win or lose, your results are transferred to the main map. If you can't be bothered fighting (e.g. 10:1 odds or naval battles - in Med 2 you can't manually fight naval battles but it doesn't matter since navies are a side point), there is an autoresolve.There's spies, assassins, diplomats, merchants, wololos- er, priests which you can all use to further your objectives. Want to blitzkrieg? Open the gates with a spy. Can't be bothered killing a faction? Kill all their generals with assassins and rejoice in the Faction Destroyed notification. Send your Catholic Priests off to Egypt and laugh as either a) they cause Cairo to riot due to unrest or don't laugh because b) they all got assassinated.Don't fancy medieval times? Don't like the Pope? No problem - you can either assassinate the Pope and wait until you get gunpowder units for those, or you can browse the vast section of mods.Generally, mods are fairly easy to install and not too buggy.Medieval II also is the host of the most functional Lord of the Rings mod: Third Age Total War. It also has two subsets to that: Divide and Conquer, which stuffs the map full of factions / settlements, and Massive Overhaul Submod, which again expands... well, everything.And apparently there's ""Hyrule Total War,"" a mod, which is apparently Zelda. For some silly reason there's a Rome 1 mod for Med 2, despite the fact that Rome 1 is cheaper (get it on sale for $4 :P).And there's also the four expansion campaigns which you can play to your desire.Multiplayer is rather fun, though custom battles (in which you fight opponents out of the blue and the campaign map is utterly ignored) have the problem of no ranking - you can find yourself fighting battles with somebody who you can steamroll because his cavalry never charges, only walk, or find yourself fighting battles with somebody who can steamroll YOU. :PThere's also Play By Email games, which are for the campaign map. It's time-consuming (and difficult, partly 'cause timezones) to fight battles actually against the other human player - it is possible, just difficult - and hence most games just use autoresolve. Nevertheless, it's a fun feature which shouldn't be ignored.The great thing about it is that no matter what skill level you are, you will be able to play & enjoy the game. Complete newb? Set difficulty to Easy and you'll never be fully conquered if you're vaguely competent. Veteran? Put the difficulty up and laugh as you steamroll the AI that took you 300 turns to do when you started.Mind you, the difficulty settings are misleading. The same AI is used - all that happens is that as you go up the difficulty, they get combat bonuses, free money, and free public order. Normal tends to give the most balanced game (not because their Peasants are suddenly deadly, but because the AI leaves cities with even less garrison than usual).Furthermore, the more you play the more you'll realise the game has a surprising level of detail that isn't immediately visible. Generals (and Agents, but Generals are more noticeable) have a system that I heard described as ""RPG-like;"" fight the French 10 times with one general and voila, he gets the trait ""Hates the French:+2 command when fighting the French."" An assassin missed your general? He might get paranoid and thus decrease how likely he is to die from assassination. Keep on executing prisoners with one general? Enemies will rout & run away quicker. Leave a general in a city doing nothing? He might lose loyalty.The economic system is simply masterful. Creating farms? Population growth goes up. Building roads? Trade income goes up, not just for your settlement but for the settlements it's trading with. Building a Market in a city in the middle of nowhere? Surprise surprise, your trade income went up by +6 (most units cost 300-800). Got gold nearby? Watch your mining profit soar.Mind you, people who are new to the game can just build things that make them money and not bother about it. More experience players can see how much money it will make them and wonder if it's worth doing.This game isn't for everybody. People who like to run around with guns blazing, die, respawn, have 10s of shooting, die, respawn, etc etc etc will not enjoy this game. But as for me, it's the best thing since Windows XP came out.It is also the only game that I can play and feel tired - not physically tired, but mentally fatigued. You can play the game with little thought at all, but you'll progress slowly. The more attention you put in, the quicker your WORLD CONQUEST begins.Still not convinced? Go get Rome Total War for $4 next Steam sale, see if you like the way it plays, and if you want to spend $12 (on sale) for five whole campaigns (plus a bucketload of complete mods, not some petty statistics change) go for it.(Note: Later Total War games are extremely expensive in comparison, so go get Rome 1 & Med II)			"

												Short ReviewThis is a fun game. Much better than the first one. I love the middle ages units (we need a Fantasy Total War game). There are only two things I dislike about this game: 1. The Pope always intervenes so you cannot wipe anyone out. 2. The Mongols are way too tough.I still like the game. You can build up your cities, recruit troops and fight the battles on the battlefield where you can control all of the troops, and it is a cool empire building game. Europe, however, is getting really boring to me to fight in. Unlike Shogun the original Total War, it seems that the AI troops do not always run and hide when vastly outnumbered.Anyway, Medieval II is a little older but a really decent game.			"

												If you want the definitive Total War experience Medieval 2 is it. Unlike new Total War games, Medieval 2 is much more complex in its gameplay mechanics. From maintaining merchants and diplomats to army management. Medieval 2 feels more of an empire building simulator than newer games such as Rome 2.  Battles feel much heavier and units tend to react more realistically to commands. The sense of weight makes battle feel much more organic than Shogun 2, Rome 2 or even Fantasy Warhammer.  If you do choose to buy this game, be sure to install Stainless Steel as it provides a much more historical early and late game era campaign. You can check out some footage of it on my YouTube channel.			"

Medieval II: Total War (TRADE MARK) is pretty cool, I guess. If I had to pick my second favorite Total War game it would probably be this one. You play as ruler of a nation during the feudal era of Europe and parts of Western and Central Asia. As this ruler it is your job to spread the dominance of your culture and religion across the old world while trading, bartering, negotiating, and fighting with other nations who are more than likely just going to be more heads on the pikes at the end of your campaign. It is a time of great uncertainty. The powers of the world won't stop calling one another mean names and every now and then you have to send a priest out to deal with a heretic in what is essentially a bible fight. Like Rome, Shogun, Medieval I, and the games after it, Medieval II is split between a campaign map and a battle map that changes depending on what location on the campaign map the battle takes place in. You still have the usual things, you build your cities, do diplomacy, move your armies around on the map, command huge armies in battle, things like that. So lets talk about all the neat little things Medieval II adds to the formula.One, there's an obvious graphical improvement. Medieval II looks miles better than Rome, and adds other improvements such as a change in unit models depending on their weapon and armor levels. If your peasant spearmen are equipped with chainmail then the chainmail will actually show on their models instead of it just being implied to be there. Second, the addition of religion and mercantilism adds another level of roleplaying to your campaign as you attempt to convert peoples of other faith or do battle with other merchants for economic resources and business rights. Third, new animations and battle damage are added to your armies. So sometimes you get to see a cool little animation where a soldier will beat up an an enemy and call him mean names. There's also blood, while not as gory as later Total War games, your units will get drenched in blood the longer they fight, indicating how long that individual  soldier has before biting it. And fourth, the soundtrack is probably the best Total War soundtrack to date. My personal opinion, but my opinion is great. There have been also a few events added to the campaign mode. Things such as the Mongol invasion, the black plague, discovering the new world, Crusades, Jihads, the Pope excommunicating you because you're too radical and he's tired of your skateboard phase. etc. Wow, all these cool things! So what's wrong?A few things. First, the AI once again doesn't like to cooperate. They're ask for trade rights, map information, and an alliance one turn and then attack you the next. Broken armies of 50 or so people will gladly die to your thousands rather than end the war, and the Pope always seems to demand that you stop a war you're winning even though more than not you didn't start it. He's that kind of school principle. But should you play Medieval II: The one with the armies, not the one with the skeleton guy? When it comes to the mid 2000 Total War games I feel like it comes down to preference. Do you prefer antiquity to feudalism? Or do you like Knights over Legionarries and Hoplites? Either or you can't go wrong with Medieval II. The additions to campaign mode are welcomed and there's plenty of meat there if you treat the Total War games more like a roleplaying game than a strategy game. I have about as much time on the physical copy of this one as I do in Rome: total War. And if you want, you can still technically play as the Roman Empire in the form of the Byzantines. It's not really the same thing, but hey, they're there. Also, the modding scene is friggin astounding. Everything from gameplay tweaks to full out new games.Two that stand out to me are ""Thera: Legacy of The Great Torment"" and ""Third Age: Total War"", the latter being a Lord of the Rings total conversion of the Kingdoms expansion pack.Medieval II: Total War gets a big number out of a big number.Odontophobia is the fear of teeth.

												I bought this game a year ago whilst it was on sale and I thought, ""hey, this might be a cute little strategy game to play on my down time!"" I was wrong...It took me a few weeks to learns how to play, which is fine by me because I like my games to have a little bit of depth to them and this was my first total war (which is bittersweet, because that's like being a virgin and having sex with a pornstar, only to have the rest of your experiences wanting). Anyways, I loaded up the game and started a new campaign as Scotland on very hard difficulty. I managed to conquer the British Isles in the name of Mel Gibson, which was good because my economy was sky rocketing. After a few years in game I had built up five full stacked armies of knights, armoured footmen, and archers. It was time to invade Normandy to liberate France from the HRE. I studied Allied WWII invasion plans for a while before I actually comitted to my attack. So I declared war on the factions inhabiting the Italian penisula and invaded mainland Europe on two fronts. Whilst I was fighting battle after battle, I got Russia to ally with me and attack the countries to the east of HRE. After a while, Russia and I completely obliterated the mainland. However, Russia wanted more land. A few turns later Russia declared war on me and we fought tooth and nail to secure our newly conquered lands. Russia was winning for a while, but then everything changed when the Mongols attack. We were both weak from fighting a mock WWII so the Mongols just steamrolled Russia. I tried to ally with the mighty Khan, but he refused me. In my weakened state, the factions of Iberia declared war on me and invaded the British Isles while the Mogols savaged my holdings in the mainland. Despite my best effort, Spain, Portugal, and the Mongols defeated my glorious empire. In the end, I failed my people, my God, and most importantly Mel Gibson.11/10 would fight a medieval WWII again.			"

												As with the entire Total War series, Medieval II is guaranteed to keep you entertained for weeks on end as you prepare to conquer the old continent. Once you get bored with it (which you won't because there are lots of factions to chose) you can also download awesome mods for it, like LoRd of the Rings themed factions.Pros:Real time massive battles where strategy and deployment makes a difference. Great graphics, that also run great on older PCs.Satisfying turn base campaign map where you level up settlements and put your generals and their troops on the move.Pretty good AI and diplomacy.You get to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the pope.Cons:Don't♥♥♥♥♥♥off the pope.Battles can get a little repetitive if you get good enough. Like when you end up using the same units all the time. But you can always change that and also try to play at higher difficulties.Losing sucks and the AI does seem to chose the worst times to break alliances with you  or like create full stack armies out of thin air. But such is life, you won't always know where your enemy is.			"

												Whilst the graphics for this are slighlty outdated it has to be one of my favourite games of the series. The mechanics of the game feel fluid and very easy to grasp. Whether you have played the rest of the games in the series or this is where you want to start this game is fantastic. The mechanic to prevent you from recruiting armies of the best troops available and forces you to recruit a few lesser equipt units to bulk out your army.Overall the game for me would score 8/10, it loses points down to the outdated graphics and the factions having very similar units along with the lack of naval battles. It does gain points due to the recruitment system and the fact that it feels very fluid and immersive			"

Thats it cant think of anything else wrong.Ignore how many hours it says i have played on steam the real time is too embarrassing to state, this is the game that got me hooked on this series and i still come back to it 2 or 3 times a year for the single player campaign.oh and the mod community, what can i say but bravo. This is a real game for the gamers!!!			"

												NOTE: I only recently bought this on steam - though I have played this since release with well over 2000 hours into it.My review in short? = If you dont own Medieval II - you dont know what Total War franchise is all about. Medieval II - is still the #1 Total War game in the entire franchise.Stand-alone, it is the best balance of gameplay, game design and war + empire building that is core to what TW is all about.But with mods? This game is easily the only game in the TW franchise that you need to own if there is any question about it.Relive not only perfect European history with KGCM mod; but lord of the rings, game of thrones, the elder scrolls, roman periods, and more.This is the #1 most modded game in the franchise which tells you how dedicated the player community has also been to this title.

												First ı played as holy roman empire and allied with everyone around me because ı was afraid that they would ♥♥♥♥ me up at the start. After taking all rebel castles ı realised ı was the only one with a good army . So being an hungarian ı didnt wanted to kill hungarians. Nordic people were too far and too weak to worth it and south was already allied with papal states ı wanted to keep my♥♥♥♥♥♥good with the old guy so he doesnt start crusades on me. I saw huge lands of france ı thought a worthy foe and ordered 4 armies (2 merc armies) to invade atleast 4 castles. at start ı had all the allies and france was weak with no allies which is good ı didnt even need any allies so france was keep loosing region.Soon it only left with one or 2 castles which ı was already SuperPower with 7 armies.As ı was getting ready to destroy france ı realised other nations wanted my♥♥♥♥♥♥and kept ruining my merchants ı was getting annoyed. soon as my army arrived to last castle of france old man of papal states told me to hold my horse ' U AİNT KİLLİNG NO FRENCH AİGHT OR IMMA KİCK YO OUT OF MY RELİGİON' he said ı was like fine then ı just wait for that mission to end while ı was waiting damn france took all my allies and made them against me which again papal states didnt let me kill them too ı wasnt loosing ground but it was ruining my trade you know. After realising that my first ally hungary tryed to kill my people and take my land ı lost my♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was at war with everyone even with the egypt which ı had never seen them whole game. I attacked them all and killed more people then black death. İn the end ı was a heretic empire thats trying to negotiate with mongols and russians so ı can find their castles and destroy . it was really fun ı have to say and the multi is nice too specially playing with friends. İf you like strategy games and medieval times as the name of the game says this is your game.			"

												Played hundreds of hours before I got it on steam on what I believe to be the best total war game in the series.Great campaign with a good selection of factions however AI can sometimes be a bit stupid, paired with fun battles with good unit rosters and maps.Kingdom expansion is much better than the dlc CA push out now which adds 4 new campaigns streaching from the scorching sands of the Middle East in the Crusades to the dense forests of the New World.I would reccomend trying some of the many game changing mods the community has made to add hundreds of more hours to this masterpiece.

Loads of good mods out there, that either tweak this or that, or improve or expand this or that, not to mention a slew of total convesion mods that take the game to a different era or genre entirely. Just finished making a map pack with 15 new vanilla MP maps that draw locations off the campaign map, so only the host needs the files & anyone can join without downloading anything. I have it on steam now, but got the game on disc when it came out. A workshop on steam would be nice, but that's what www.twcenter.net is for. Highly recommended.			"

												Our last king restored Hungary to it's rightful place in the Christian church. We must not let it fall!My western border with The Holy Roman Empire is secured and christianty is almost fully restored, we must restore our eastern front! Many of our greatest builders were sent to build churches, chapels and Abbeys, we trained our greatest priests to become bishops and cleanse our eastern territory from the heretical thought. Our eastern border wasn't protected though, so we had to make alliances, Georgia came to us in request to trade, it was a perfect moment to make a diplomatic action and propose an alliance, gladly they accepted. We both had a common enemy of course, the heretics who call them selves ""Byzantines"".They are nothing but a dying empire, after we aided Georgia in their wars and the world was shown the true strengh of Mother Hungary, the Russian and Polish embassies embraced our relations and proposed an alliance. Of course we agreed, now that we have Georgia in the east, Kievan Rus' in the north east and Poland in the north, we can direct our forces to the west!The Holy Roman Empire is in constant war with our polish allies, but my advisor said that it's best to build up our economy. So we did, in a matter of years Hungary became the richest country in Europe and maybe in the whole world, soon we started buying cities from Poland and Kievan Rus', our borders grew and my kingdom strenghened. Our Polish friends were also getting stronger and our relations were better than ever. But Poland was too concerned with wars than with their own faith! The church has excomunicated them, and I had to declare war on my closest friend. I hasitated but I shudder to think that I could ever betray them...The church was unpleased with my actions, but I can't betray my own friend, I still think there is hope for him, I just need to meet him once more, have a drink and discuss his issues with the church. But alas I was too late, he has fallen in battle trying to defend his lands, his entire city butchered, women and children.And now I have to pay for my actions, I have been excomunicated. I am writing now as I'm waiting for the inevitable.Soon, a crusade will begin.			"

												Six massive armies of heavily upgraded Byzantine cavalry with five to eight star generals got destroyed by a single ten-star Hungarian general with twenty bodyguards, and then the Hungarian forced me to pay 3000 dollars to ransom out ten of my soldiers.11/10 would get destroyed by Hungarians again.In all seriousness, this is tied with Rome 1 as best Total War IMO. As an avid Rome 1 player, Medieval 2 took a while to get used to, with all of it's new features, but it is extremely fun once you get the hang of it. AI and graphics are not the best, but this game was made years ago(and who really cares about that anyways?) Highly recommended to fans of medieval warfare, Total War games, or just strategy games in general.			"

												The two perfect works of Creative Assembly = Rome and Medieval total war. Probably medieval total war has the most perfect tempo i have seen in turn based strategy games. The battle scenes, the horsemen, the catapults, the merchant and diplomat actions. It's just awesome. -The only con of this game is diplomacy is kind of too agressive. You might get betrayed by 5 nations in one turn The Pope would'nt even care. But oh?! HOW DARE YOU ATACKING THE HOLY EMPIRE AS THEY ARE PILLAGING YOUR LANDS! this kind of diplomacy i'm talking about.

												Medieval II Total War is a good game, a fun game. But when put beside it's predecessors, it's also a very small game. I am not talking about size here, or even the scope of the game but more it's advancement over the previous installment. It's that same question you always have to ask yourself every time a franchise you enjoy comes out with a new installment.Should I get the new one or just replay the old one? In the case of Medieval II the answer is, you might as well go play another campaign in Rome.While Medieval by itself is a great game that promises hours of entertainment it doesn't really do anything that you couldn't already do in Rome. Most of the new features are minor in nature or simply cosmetic the lack of advancement is instantly noticeable when you realize that Medieval even managed to bring over a few bugs from Rome that were never quite fixed.For the newcomers to the series, Medieval II Total War is a mix between a real time strategy game and a turn based grand strategy game. The turn based aspect focuses mainly on empire management, improving your cities, raising and moving armies and conducting diplomacy with other factions. This area has traditionally been the weak spot of Total War games and Medieval makes no changes there. The system is clunky and bugged, the AI is completely worthless and the diplomacy might as well not have been included. Anything the grand strategy aspect of Total War tries to do has already been done a thousand times better in pretty much every other grand strategy game.But then again, you don't buy a Total War game for the cerebral strategy. You buy it for the guts and glory of the the real time battles where armies clash and legion perish all for the hope of victory and while the satisfaction you get from a successful maneuver is still present so is the complete lack of any sort of intelligence on the part of your opponents. As with all other Total War games, the AI is incapable of doing anything beyond the classic attack move with no concern for formation, flanking or skirmishing leading to almost every battle being a cakewalk unless you are terribly outnumbered.Graphically the series still impress although the uniformity with your units is beginning to show, the sounds work well enough that you are never taken out of the action and the soundtrack is acceptable most of the time.All in all Medieval II is a good and fun game that you can spend hundreds of hours in easily. Should you buy it still comes down to that same question however. If you have never played a Total War game I would always recommend you get the newest in the series. Medieval II is still an advancement over Rome, albeit a very minor one. If you already own Rome however then there is little new for you here and you would probably be better off saving your money for further down the line when another installment in the series comes along with a more profound leap in mechanics and technology.

												To start off, you should probably buy this game. I say probably, because $20 is a little pricey, but if its on sale for $10 or under get it! It is a great strategy game with two main modes. The campaign map is like an overall strategy game where you try to conquer the world, and the tactical battles are individual battles where you control an army. Although the graphics are outdated, the strategy in this game is priceless. Played a game as Portugal, and first killed Spain. Then fought and made peace with France, then went south and killed the Moors, then kept going east and killed sicily, kept going and am currently about to kill Egypt. I also conquered Rome from Sicily and returned it to the pope, who became my bestie for all of 2 turns until he died. The next pope hated me, but at the moment I am not excommunicated. And so,If you read it through this far you probably should  buy the game.Just do it.Update:I just discovered the plethora of mods for this game, and they are truely amazing. Mods like third age make it seem like an entirely new game, and add so much replayability to the game. Another great reason to get this game.			"

												Medieval II... Wooft. Got to be the best Total War game there is atm.- = Negatives+ = Positives+ Of course the graphics and mechanics are a little outdated (but are still better than Atilla.. Just sayin).+ Battles are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing! Unit Variety is not a problem here at all.+ Campaign is extremely detailed. Still has the best UI for a Campaign I think.+ Mods are amazing (Third age and Call of Warhammer)+ Factions all have interesting and different units from eachother.+ DLC has 3x more content than the original game (3 new campaign packs and units).+ Most interesting era (in my opinion).+ Most units are balanced.- Two handed glitch in Vanilla game. (Not in Expansions).+ Castles and settlements are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.- Cavalry (If you can use them well) seems slightly OP in some ways.- Lack of special abilities for units.+ UI is easy to get used too.- AI is extremely stupid if you don't turn the difficulty up.+ Familiar factions and units. Such as Scottish Highlanders and English Longbowmen ect.+ Gameplay seems extremely smooth compared to more recent TW games. Might just be me though.+ Great endgame challenges. Which you can find out for yourself XP.- Mods can be quite a challenge to install if you don't know what your doing. But there are good tutorials out there.- There are a few factions that are more powerful than others, but that is to be expected.. *cough cough* Venice.And there you go! Did this help? If it did be sure to like :)			"

												Medieval 2 Total War is a fantastic game its visually very nice it continues the great trend its predecessor set while bringing its own game mechanics which are enjoyable and well balanced. It has a very entertaining campaign that adds more historical events such as the Crusades and the Mongol Invasion. Personally in my opinion it shines best in the multiplayer realm though with intersting maps and good variation of tactics and faction styles. Truly it is one of the best Total War games and well worth what you pay for it			"

I find that the ''Fog of War'' works better here than with NTW. I also like the religious aspectwhich isn't really present in NTW. I recommend this to all TW players. Enjoy !			"

												Medieval 2 total war was released in 2006 and it still holds itself well. The graphics do not feel dated and the game mechanics are similar to other total war games, making it easy to get into. The singleplayer suffers due to the stupid A.I. but there is enough variety to keep you entertained and there are mods that improve the campaign game further.The greatest part of this game however is its dedicated community and its multiplayer experience. The multiplayer is still very much alive and kicking. Whether you are new to total war or experienced in similar games you will fing something for you. From siege battles, 1v1, team battles or free for alls, you can usually keep the multiplayer experience varied through a variety of game types, factions and rule sets.There is a host of youtube commentators that give this game the support and attention it deserves. It was a great investment when I got the game all those years ago, and is definitely worth a go, especially if you can pick it up on offer.			"

												Medieval II Total War (M2) must have been one of the best RTS games I have played. I have clocked in about 1,200 hours between the main game and the expansion pack. Pros Battles have great terrains, AI, and strats for the course.Great political system/relations interaction between nations and the church system.Content is never dull, each game has unique aspects as to whom does what.Each nation has a different play style on the world map "

												For how old this game is it's still one of the best strategy games I've ever played. The game starts in the dark ages and progresses through the Renaissance. You take control of a faction (the Holy Roman Empire, Egypt, England, France to name a few) and run the trade, religion (including joining/launching Jihads and Crusades), family (via marrying into other  royal families or having worthy generals married into yours), exploration (once the technology is available you can lead your faction to settling the new world) and military. When battles occur you can choose to skip them or fight them in real time which is a blast. This game has so much in it and it is so immersive that it is definately worth playing even now.			"

												I must have played thousands of hours of the vanilla version of Medieval 2. Then I discovered the mods.A review of the game, as it is now for 20 Euro, is that it is still a great strategy game with awesome tactical battles. If you haven't played any Total War, then I would recommend to start with Medieval 2. There are newer games, but those are tweaked away from what I think are the best features in the Total War series. And yes, buy the collection so you get Kingdoms (4 new game modes that each feels like a proper expansion, compatibility with Third Age mod) for 3 Euro more.My only major complaint with Medieval 2 is the AI. The difficulty scaling is just how soon the AI will declare war on you. Even if you have a tiny neighbour that you've been allied with for hundreds of years and protected through dozens of war, it is only a matter of time before they will declare war on you. The tactical AI will form a solid battle line and try to flank you with cavalry. And do exactly that in nearly all situations.Longbowmen (and some other archers as well, can't remember which ones) are also way overpowered, since the most lethal thing known to (horse)man in this game are wooden stakes, and longbowmen can plant those in the deployment phase of a battle.

												Do I reccomend this game, hell yes I do. This to me is one of the greatest total wars ever made. I have invested so much time online and offline of steam and this is just a breath taking game. Sure the graphics are out dated but it really doesnt matter is so much fun.The battles are amazing. The Settlements are fun to besiege althought Medieval II settelments are really annoying at times to place units in but still fun. A large variety of factions to choose from to build an empire that you want. The Kingdoms expansion is incredable, I gives you four brand new campaigns to conquer with even more faction, and unit variety. And the best part are the mods. This games has incredable mods for it I have only played one but that one is enough. I absolutley reccomend thsi game its among my top 10 games ever. It is extrodinary for its time and still stands tall and proud.			"

 Even though Medieval 2: Total War was released in 2006 it still rocks with the best of today!The graphics are a touch out dated but the strategic game play is powerful fun when comanding a massive army about to seige a castle. You order to fire the catapults! You then witness flaming boulders slam into the castle gates and walls! The sound will cause you to turn up the volume!  Your next order is for the footmen to carry ladders to the castle walls and attack the archers! They yell as they run towards possible death and yet none show second thought. Just then the catapults have just destroyed the castle gates and your horsemen charge full speed and enter the castle. Sorry, lost my self in memories of M2:TW. This game is that good with no signs of fading! How do I know this? Well, I bumped into Medieval II - Total War Gaming Group (MTWGG) that plays regularly and will be happy to help you. They are great international people and an even better group leader named Dark Angel. So when you purchase M2:TW make sure you check them out.  Here is a link to their group page. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MTWGG Buy the game, join MTWGG and enjoy some of the best strategic gaming on Steam right now!  :)			"

												My god this game is epic.Alright so I was playing as England and I first went and got York, Dublic, ect.Then i went and declared war on scotland, that war lasted all of about four turns.Then, and I know I had this game for 63 hours but I actually did not ever complete the game.I stuck to custom and multiplayer battles. But anyway I went and fought France. Now I did notdo it out of the blue. the French were always threatening to invade me unless I paid a tax, normally like560 or something. So anyway that was really cool. Massive armies clashing against eachother. Choosingthe better ground, it was like a game of thrones war. I gave my characters backstories and named the battles. I will give an example of one at the end. But anyway I was playing a short campaign and when I finished it and toppled the final French castle with the Milan and Holy Roman Empire at my side I suddenly get this epic music in ears.Next thing I know Im in a throne room, like, once again, game of thrones and the Narrator goes on about how epic the""English Empire"" Is and how King Rufus, first of his name, protector of all of Christendom is the ""Best king that will ever be. So yeah that was epic. Do I recommend this game? @£$% yeah I would! But anyway onto the battle.King Rufus looks over his men. Wearing their mail coifs and wielding swords of iron and steel. Infront of them stands an army of scots. It was led by a family member, he paused for a moment. He could not remember the mans name. He lined his spearmen in a straight line facing the highlanders and the rabble. Rufus saw the man Edenheart, he thought to himself Edenheart. Rufus ordered his men to fire upon the now charging highland horde. Two hundred arrows filled the sky, near blocking out the sun. Many casualties were theirs. Then the highlanders crashed into a line of iron spears. The line broke. He ordered his border horse to chase down the fleeing enemy. Then the young family member seeing the battle lost, rallied a small portion of men and charged down the hill in which his steed stood upon. Rufus stroked his horses mane. He then road through the line of men and crashed into the unsupecting scots. He met the young man, Edenheart. With one stroke of his blade he cut the man down. He looked at the young man that now lay in the mud, he had no remorse. He jumped down and cut the head of the man. He ordered one of the spear men to stab it unto their spear and march it around like a banner. Edenheart was brother to the king of the scots, the king that had killed his own father. He would have his vengenece no matter how many lives it took. FinPs (Sorry for my English :))			"

Posted: November 27, 2014
												THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!     so yeah i'm sure by my title you can guess where i stand on my opinion of the game. Now before i begin i will say that i have played many games of this category. for instance there is nearly all the total war titles and europa univeralis 4, hearts of iron 3. So i am not unfamiliar with this (and for those who are you will find it is VERY easy to get into). Pretty much everything about this game is perfect i mean the gameplay when you command your troops in battle is so immersive and spotless it is hard to find a complaint. Not to mention this game is weirdly more advanced and realistic compared to later total war game, like empire total war and napoleon or even the newest rome 2. I mean you actually have to have your diplomats move and not just be lazy and click a button and open up the diplomatic menu. Not to mention the soldiers actually act like people! now if you haven't noticed the troops from shogun 2 and rome 2 DESPERATLEY need to take notes from this MASTERPIECE of a game. the troops in Medieval 2 move so fluently it is unreal, in rome 2 they feel like bricks with legs, shogun 2 (and empire and napoleon) are slightly better with this which adds to my earlier topic of how earlier games are better than the new ones. empire and napoleon makes more sense with how they soldiers move though because of the timeline, shogun 2 kinda does because it does have a couple gun regiments. but rome 2 i have no idea.And another thing is that Medieval 2 is not arcady like rome 2 and empire napoleon and shogun 2. in rome 2 there is a timer in the fortress in a siege so if you just have one dude step in that stupid circle you will win in 2min it is crazy, now i know there is one in Medieval 2 but considering it is in they WAY back of the fortress it is not even there. another thing is the maps are very different and unique and are just generally much better than what i've seen in rome 2. (by the way if you are wondering why i am comparing so much to rome 2 it is because it is the newest game of the total war series and this just goes to show that pretty graphics can only take you so far, because that is all rome 2 is to me) Also the gameplay in the battles in Medieval 2 are so much more stratigic and are just generally perfect in everyway possible, unlike rome 2. Now the whole point of the total war games is to have an easy political view game and a very complicated and stratigic battling system in between. THAT IS WHAT A TOTAL WAR GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. (which is why Medieval 2 is so amazing) in rome 2 the battling system is so horride and awful it makes me want to puke, and the diplomatic gameplay just.....i can't even describe my disgust with that, in Medieval 2 it is just so perfect and amazing that my only explanation for how good it is, is probably that a god crafted Medival 2. Now i could go on and on about how Medieval 2 is the best total war game i've played. Like the music is so amazing and inspiring and immersive. Medieval 2 also is SUPER IMMERSIVE AND PERFECT IN NEARLY EVERY WAY POSSIBLE! now i could talk for the rest of my life on how good this game is, but i am pretty sure that whoever read this long probably got the idea already, so yeah Medieval 2 is 10/10 in my book			"

												Medieval 2: Total War is a highpoint of the Total War series. It is certainly the longest supported and one of the most highly modded of the Total War games. On a surface level it's an empire management game requiring economic management of cities and regions. On a secondary level it's a diplomacy game, requiring careful decision making regarding allies and opponents as well as currying favour with the powers that be i.e. the Papacy and thirdly it still blends in the faster paced action of the tactical battles that allows one to actively witness and control sieges and battle upon the open field. As an older game the graphics are poor but not terrible, due to the usually zoomed out perspective, that doesn't show up poor unit models. It's challenging and has only the barest introduction for new players, requiring learning through trial and error, (which is more effective), and has a UI that contains as little or as much detail as you like, depending on how far through the menus you progress, something newer games tend to try to oversimplify and thus lack detail. Medieval 2: TW is more than likely going to be around for a long time yet, with it's continuing active player base, and it is that more than any review online that speaks for the quality of this game.

												Once upon a time, I had carved out a worthy empire in northern Germany, and Scandanavia, and was steadily working up to a war againist the HRE, until they finally struck and began to attack. By then, I was having horrible money issues, due to poor upkeep, and an insane abundance of generals. I had an army far superior to the HRE's but they had immense numbers, I carved my way through atleast 3 armies before my own was reduced to less than a hundred and I was forced to retreat. But, with no cash to rebuild a defence I decided it was time to leave behind the dozen generals and the deadly enemy I had made for a much more peaceful living. My ally, Venice gladly traded Tripoli to me for all my cities. In no time, I was able to stablize myself with just 2 generals, all the rest died in a horrible accident with the English navy. However, I had no room to expand and was forced to battle Sicily. It was suprisingly easy after I had taken Tunis. But the Mongols had begun to capture every city they could. They wanted Tripoli too, so I easily gave it to them, their navies and armies scared me. But before I left, I renamed the city to Mongoliassholia. Now, in Tunis I built up my economy and made up enough money to get 3 Carracks to sail me to Sicily and Sardinia, which I easily conquered as the Sicilians somehow lost their entire forces defending Tunis. After much conquering, I had Corsica, Florence too, and was well on my way to finish off Sicily off east. When Portugal, and Milan decided I was in the way of their expansion. By then Germany, Egypt, and the Turks had been destroyed. Scotland reduced to Ireland, the Netherlands, and a city in the Baltics somehow. Portugal had made Spain and the Moors into vassals. Russia had been reduced to their original size, by the Timurids. The Mongols stretched out from Tripoli, to the Ukraine. Venice, once a power thanks to me had been too stretched out, and France, had managed to move all the way out to Poland, and Hungary, and were steadily taking out the rest of Venice in Europe, and eagerly awaiting to finish the ones off in Scandanavia. They wouldn't attack me though, we were in good standing. Now, as my eagar axemen, and sword-bearers are ready to invade Bologna, the Mongols come knocking again, and the max turns are reached. This is where I ended my game. Sandwiched between enemies. My allies, far gone. The moral of the story is use condoms, so your generals don't make 20 god damn children.			"

												Medieval 2: Total War is the 4th game in the Total War series and was released in 2006. It shows it's age a little when standing next to the newer games in the series, but is still fun to play. Medieval 2 is set in the latter half of the middle ages, between 1080 and the 1500's. Medieval 2, only allows you to play as 5 Factions when you first start out. All of these factions were the historically powerful factions of the age. Defeating additional factions unlocks them for play up to 17 different playable factions in total through campaign mode.A mixture of real-time tactics and strategy, as well as turn-based gameplay, exploration and expansion, Medieval 2 is fun to play, but is starting to show it's age a little. I suppose we are getting spoiled in 2015 with games that have realistic looking characters; However, it is still fun and would be recommended to anyone who enjoys the Total War series.			"

												My favourite and most played of the Total War series, with probably closer to 400 hours, before I bought again on Steam.A stand out element is the music – I have been known to boot up into the main menu, just to savour the fantastic score, I believe entitled “Time And Again”, accompanied with the crashing of thunder and lightning, and watching the silhouetted troops march by.Part of the reason Medieval II (and Kingdoms) is my favourite, is likely because I just have not invested the time in the newer incarnations (the following 2 just didn’t grab me), but undoubtedly the combat style of the era is much more to my taste.All in all a really great game, with more than enough to keep you enjoying well beyond the purchase price. Fully recommended.			"

												This is one of not THE best total war games of its time and for many reasons.It has epic battles with lots of strategy to fill the poetential of your wide roster of units at your disposal with cavalry,artillery(Catapults,Trebuchets,Cannons etc.),Musketeers,Swords,Pikes,Spears,Bows. I could go on about the whole variety of units and how each faction has different specialities and playstyles depending on the type of units there best with.I have spent over 800 hours into this game and im not even bored yet due to the epic battles,battle music  and just the intensity of it all. This game was made in what 2005 soemthing like that and i still rate it THE BEST game to ever of come in existence with 0 games even coming close to being better than this one is.I would put this on the top of your wishlist and highley reccommend you should play this game "

												This game is super fun. 2nd best total war game to Rome Total War. The game is super fun, especially Grand Campaign and the British Isles DLC the only thing bad about the game is that every faction basically has the same type of units just different names and sometimes not even different names. In Rome there was a lot of diversity by every faction having totally different troops but not the case in Med 2. Sorry Med 2, this is why you are the 2nd best.			"

												The Christian priests in the church proposed a Holy War to take Palestine, the barbaric bloodthirsty Crusaders invades and attacks the Islamic lands. The Islamic Imams proposed a defensive war against the crusaders to protect our lands, the mighty Islamic Empire (Caliphate) (Ottoman Empire) smashes them to bits repelled by the fierce Islamic warriors.After many years Genghis Khan came, and spread like fire, slaughtering everyone in its way.only issue is the UI is awkward and graphics are a bit old now, but still one of the best game ever made.

												I started the game for the first time as England because I am a noob. I invaded france and Scotland. The pope excomunicated me and called crusade upon me. Then I got butt ♥♥♥♥ed by the Holy Roman Empire.Huh. I wonder what it would be like it Remus started the Roman Empire rather than Romulus.We would instead be talking about the great army of Reme. The Reman empire. In school we would be reading The Rise and Fall of the Reman Empire.And I suppose I would be talking about how I invaded France and Scotland, got excommunicated, then got butt ♥♥♥♥ed by the Holy Reman Empire.

												M2TW is a fun cheap game, that will cause you to stay up much to late telling yourself ""just one more turn"". The game runs well on nearly any PC and its unbelivably well-priced for how entertaining and detailed it is. Now, I am sure someone could argue that there are better RTS games out currently, but considering the release date of this game and its price it is definitely worth the buy. I would say my favorite part of the game is how many variables and details are incorporated in the logistics involved in the campaign (such as financial, military, domestic, diplomatic, and geopolitical elements). Every time I play through a campaign I learn something different.Basically, if you want an addictive and engaging RTS to play, and you want to spend as little cash as possible I would absolutely get this game.

												This game will grab you by the chin hairs, and pull you in it! The diplomacy is terrific, the battles are beautiful, and the options are steep! It's like burning raiders to death with a flamethrower! Great stuff. The campaign is insanely fun, every battle you do will affect how others think of your kingdom, and it will all affect your general, prince, king, whoever is leading your men to victory. I myself prefer to slaughter everything, as it sends a message, and it turned a loving, nice prince into a cruel, hateful one! Brilliant! My king is a tyrant, and everybody who rebels meets the same fate as the armies which attempt to destroy my castle. What I am saying is, in this game you get to be a conquerer! Trust me on this, I know my charisma is only at 4, but my perceptation is at 8. You will adore this game. This game, is the shining turd of all other Total War games.			"

												Probably the greatest Total War game to ever be released. Shame it didn't get the advertising campaign like Rome: Total War did. Truly an underappreciated masterpiece. My biggest wish is that Creative Assembly can achieve this level of mastery once again. If you can withstand graphics from 2006, I highly suggest playing it. As you build your kingdom over the course of 400 years, don't forget to discover America, declare a Crusade/Jihad, assassinate the last 3 heirs of a family line to take over half of their kingdom, use your recently converted christian populace to stir up unrest and rebellion in the local muslim kingdom or vice versa, develop gunpowder, have one of your priests elected pope, get excommunicated, have your merchants systematically take advantage of another nation's trade resources, assassinate your own king, and watch as everything you worked for crumbles when the Black Death hits. This game had it all.			"

												Even though I think Rome Total War is the best in the franchise Medieval II Total War is my personal favorite. Despite it's old age this game has an outstanding unit variety, beautiful graphics which still hold up, a huge campaign map with a great variety of factions each with different enemies to face, different problems to solve and unique warfare and units to fight with. I finished the long campaign with all the factions at least once so I'm pretty sure I put around 1000-1500 hours into this game. 10/10 this game is glorious and epic, it's on the top of my all time top ten list.

												Medieval 2 is the first game in the Total War series that I have purchased, but after watching many gameplay videos on Youtube and various other sites, I had very high expectations for the game. Within less than an hour, all of my expectations were met. Medieval 2 has a fairly straight forward learning curve, and is very forgiving to those who are new to the game. With both skirmishes and a grand campaign, there is plenty to do, with many different factions to choose from, each with their own unique units and specialties. With a fantastic engine and good graphics, the game feels very realistic. The campaign is very deep, with many different agents and battles, making you come up with new strategy's every time you play. Beating the campaign unlocks the rest of the factions to play as, with you only starting with five. Overall I would rate this game as an 8/10, as there are some minor bugs.			"

 A Must Have for Total War Enthusiasts This turn-based game literally offers you the title of its in its gameplay: a total war. A great experience that will hook you up for hours with fun, joy, sadness, anger and truimph... This is the second game of the Total War series that I played. First game was the Rome Total War and this game was huge improved version of the Rome. Visuals and game mechanics may be outdated by its successors but after all years I have been playing this game I totally recommend this game to those who like strategy and RTS games.Gameplay: 10/10Visuals: 8.5/10Story: 10/10Overall: 9.5/10Deus Vult!

												Even though I think Rome Total War is the best in the franchise Medieval II Total War is my personal favorite. Despite it's old age this game has an outstanding unit variety, beautiful graphics which still hold up, a huge campaign map with a great variety of factions each with different enemies to face, different problems to solve and unique warfare and units to fight with. I finished the long campaign with all the factions at least once so I'm pretty sure I put around 1000-1500 hours into this game. 10/10 this game is glorious and epic, it's on the top of my all time top ten list.

												Another great game from the franchise series. I thoroughly enjoyed this and still do as my ingame time will show that. Hours of fun and still many more hours of fun and still not bored of it yet. I like the added merchant and the incorporation of pleasing the pope is a good in game dynamic. This game has a wide assortment of units but could do with more but thats me being a bit greedy and picky. Overall its a smooth game with good in game mechanics that met my needs and the price I paid for the game on a wonderous Steam sale and I can say I have definitely got my money's worth and more. I would reccommend this game highly especially if you like the totalwar franchise and into strategy games. Not to mention the various mods that are out there for this game also makes it a endearing, dynamic, multi platformed game that is one big adventure. I highly recommend.			"

												This, with Rome Total War, is the best Total War game (this being more stable and less laggy with huge armies than Rome). Don't hesitate to buy this game as your money will buy you hours and hours of entertainment. - A serious warning and only negative to the game: This game is very addictive. It will drain hours from your free time. It will make you trying to quit playing it to start being productive again, but you will install it ""just for one more time"" again and again. It will drive you crazy. For the love of God, if you have a busy schedule (exams, things to be done at home etc) do not even look at this page.			"

												Don't know why I haven't gotten around to recommending this game yet since I've been playing it on and off for years, but, quite simply, Medieval 2 is a masterpiece of grand strategy.  I am a big fan of the Total War series, and I can say without question that this game has the best diplomacy and politics of any TW and the best mods for any TW game.  Whether you simply want a more refined experience in the form of mods such as Stainless Steel or a total conversion that puts you centerstage in the War of the Ring with Third Age TW, the Medieval 2 modding scene has much to offer.  Truly one of the highlights of the series and if you're a fan of the genre or just ancient history in general, buying this game is a no-brainer.  Do it now!(p.s. be sure to get Kingdoms as well)			"

I know I am!  There are many games that allow you to wield a sword or axe or bow, but, really, why do that when you can wield thousands of them?  The beauty of Medieval II, like the rest of the Total War series, is that it does an out-standing job of capturing the tactical nuances of combat from pre-modern eras, as well as doing the strategic piece pretty well also, insofar as you can manage your cities in a variety of different ways as well as control agents.  This is definitely a game for those that like to think and who like a game that rewards them for thinking.  MTW2, like the rest of the TW series, has diplomacy, agents, merchants, assassins, and priests, and captures the dimensions that these bring to the strategy.  However, these elements, like all others, are there, ultimately, as an element related to combat, which is where this series shines.  It is called Total War, after all, not Total Diplomacy, or Total Economic and Cultural dominance.  Additionally, the game events throw at you some unique challenges of the period which really do quite a lot to keep the challenge and pressure on even as your empire becomes more and more mighty.  For the period, the graphics are incredible, and like other TW games, it's a lot of fun to just zoom in and watch your units work.  All in all, this series is unique and indispensible to the PC gaming world.			"

I used to play this game all the time back in the day, truly one of the best games i have played. I love this game. Thats why I was shocked to find this game with the expansion sold for $1 on humble bundle, with shogun 1 included and some other random crap. That must be the bargain of century. So yeah, I recommend. Its worth of thousands and thousands of hours, especially when there is quite a selection of mods on internet. Only cons I can give is the stupidy of the AI, which has been curse in every TW game. But despite that, its a fantastic video game.			"

												This is the only review I've ever written for a game on Steam. After playing Medieval 2, Rome, Empire, and Rome 2, I can safely say that Medieval is still my favorite in the series. Yes, the later iterations ARE prettier. This game was released in 2006 after all. However, in my opinion, you can't beat the game engine they used. The Warscape engine that is utilized by the newer games (empire onwards) has taken a loooooong time to reach the same level of melee combat satisfaction that I got from M2. Sure, there are no fancy one v one animations. BUT, those animations also wrecked havoc with how many battles played out. I don't think I ever saw two soldiers gang up on one soldier in any game other than M2 and Rome 1. Battles are played out more by training stats, upgrades, and tactics vs. a boat ton of special abilities and badas* animations. I know there are plenty of people who won't agree, but it's just my experience. The biggest reason why I always come back to this game is the modding community. I had the game running on a virtual version of windows on my mac (years before the mac version was released) JUST so I could play Third Age Total War. Not to mention all the unit mods, engine and animation tweaks, etc. This is still probably the most mod friendy total war game out there. I spent dozens of hours over the last 8-9 years compiling units and tweaks to get my game just right, enduring hundreds of coding errors and game re-installs. Little by little (and somehow without taking over my life) Medieval 2 became a near-perfect game. And this is a guy with little to no mod creation or coding experience whatsoever. All in all, it's a wonderful game that won't be surpassed until they potentialy do a new Total War in the Medieval setting. It's perfectly fine without mods, but if you're like me and discovered just how awesome the modding community is, it's the best Total War game to mod in my opinion.			"

												One of the best Historical turn based Strategy games i have ever played. You can choose from a selection of nations to play and decide to trade,make alliances,go to war and negotiate with other countries. The campaign map, like all total war games is incredible. The battles are great, where you can confront your enemies in open fields, or assault (or defend) towns and cities. You can also choose random battles at the menu for a quick skirmish battle. The graphics and gameplay are superb and it always leaves you coming back for more. Oh and if you play as England, you can create Sherwood archers (Robin Hood XD) 94%			"

This is the grand campaign, and fixs a lot of , if not all the things that made the shogun and medival one verions such a pain! Medival 2 gives you one of the most diverse unit combat systems, out of all the total wars and doesnt limit army size and expansion by random rebels and lack of viable ecomony opitons,and omg............ No Reapers! Thank you SEGA =) Not to say the other totals wars are bad. Just that this is the most polished verison, of the old total wars. Before they try to really force  you more into commanding from the front in battles. Rather than playing from the map! Crusades, Jihads, Popes, Reglions, Marriages, Family ties, Death, all play a part in this dynamic point in histroy, in this game!Cant Recommend Enough 10/10 in my book!!!!!!!			"

												The successor to the classic Rome: Total War, Medieval II: Total War is a fun game that introduces new concepts and deals with a period of time from shortly after the Norman Conquest of England to the Age of Discovery. Among other events that will be affecting you in this time period are the Mongols showing up, gunpowder being introduced, the Black Death arriving and killing most of your population (don't worry it does the same to everybody), the Timurids following their Mongol ancestors, and then the beginning of the Age of Discovery. Castles and Cities develop in two separate ways, and produce different units.If playing a Catholic nation, you have to deal with the Pope. He can make or break your nation, so keep an eye on your approval rating with him. After a victory, most of the factions are then unlocked. They are also unlocked individually if you happen to be the one to land the killing blow.Side note: If you do unlock all the nations, three are the Moors, Egypt, and the Turks. Do take care of your volume at that time, because when you click a unit, move them, or attack with them, they do have a slight vocalization. Which at times could make people nervous (about killing infidels and the like). Some who hear you play may also get a bit nervous when you play the Holy Roman Empire (or the First Reich).			"

												OH BOY this is really gonna be hard since i've never actually run into a difficult to play Total War game. Medieval II: Total War is a great game both for its setting, factions, and great campaign elements that really drive the game. The only problem I have with this game is its incredibly wonky camera (the worst of any Total War game i've played). Its so difficult to do battles in the campaign I resort to autoresolving most of the time. This isn't game breaking but it definitely keeps me from playing the battles all too often. Thats just a little something that bothers me but don't let it keep you from getting the game sicne it truly is another great game to a great series.			"

-Quick Review-Medieval II: Total War is a Medieval strategy game developed by The Creative Assembly and released 2006. Medieval II: Total War is full of country-micromanaging with strong emphasis on historical context, strategies, and battle planning.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There is a Campaign where the player takes on the role of the selected nation, and develops said nation militarily and economically. The story is generally trying to follow historically accurate events, foes, allies, and important key leaders.

Gameplay: There are two game modes in Medieval II: Total war (or in this genre of Strategy game in general): Battle Mode, when it's opposing armies clashing against each other. The other mode requiring just as much skill as battle strategy (probably requiring more) is World Mode, where you navigate the map, edit city construction, politics, religion,  army movement, and much more.There's a lot to learn going into Medieval II: Total War, if you haven't played any of the previous franchise games. (Which I hadn't; this was my personal first Total War game) The game starts out with a tutorial campaign explaining basic combat concepts to battle warfare and gives the player a rudimentary introduction to camera movement, and unit controls. While the tutorial is effective at helping you learn, there is far more information to learn about the franchise inner workings, and for that: your best friend is the in game advisers (I like to think of them as my F1 key).

Achievements: There are no steam achievements for Medieval II: Total War. There are historical battles that you can try your hand at, and in my opinion winning a historical battle that is usually lost, is a huge achievement.Price: Medieval II: Total war is priced at $19.99, most strategy games eat up time like it's nobodies business, I personally like to spend an hour for every dollar I spend and Medieval II: Total War will do just that, and then some.(Personal note: I do feel the need to thank the person who bought Medieval II: Total war for me as a gift many years ago. Thanks Golag, maybe someday I'll finally beat you in it.)Conclusion: Story: Emphasis on Historical facts and events (Very cool). Gameplay: Difficult to learn if you haven't played any other Total War games. Achievements: None, however there is no lack in difficulty. Price: Fair, almost all strategy games are worth their weight in game hours played.I recommend this game to Gamers who enjoy either History and/or strategy games. Generally it takes a fair amount of time to learn how a strategy game works, after you learn the mechanics then the game goes faster and it's very easy to get sucked into it.

												Medieval II: Total War Positives:+ Nice music soundtrack which fits the Medieval theme of the game.+ Great unit variety, with swordsmen, spearmen, archers, cavalry and siege engines like trebuchets and catapults available to use.+ Many buildings to construct in your towns or castles, such as farms, roads, churches, leather tanneries and so on, each providing different benefits to your kingdom. + Dated graphics but they are still acceptable. Units like templar knights are quite colourful.+ A really cool religious system. Catholic countries in Europe have a reputation among the Pope which can be improved through completing religious missions or building churches. The higher your reputation the more sway you have with the holy leader, so you can order crusades in Muslim lands for honour and glory. If you play as an Islamic faction, you can order jihads lol.+ Decent map size extending across Europe and the Middle East.+ Expansion packs are huge and offer even more gameplay. + Command thousands of troops on screen at once in epic battles.+ Nice mix of agents on the campaign map, each with different purposes. Priests can convert regions to your religion and denounce witches or heretics, but if they are unsuccessful, could turn to a life of heresy themselves. Assassins are another key unit, skilled in the art of killing enemy generals or family members. Then there's merchants, which can capitalise on trade goods across the world map and send the profits back to your kingdom, but foreign merchants may try to drive you out of business! Diplomats are fairly self explanatory and royal princesses can visit other kingdoms to find a husband, while also acting as a diplomat too. + Hundreds of hours of gameplay here.Negatives:- Unit animations on the battlefield aren't very good. They're difficult to see and not that interesting. Later installments of the Total War series improved this. - Diplomacy is virtually useless, allies are unreliable and will attack for literally no reason, your relationship with them does not impact the likelihood of whether they will attack you. This is a major problem with the game, mods don't seem to fix anything (I've tried multiple ones.) - This game has constant warfare due to the broken diplomacy system. You never do get a break from conquering other kingdoms. Anyone who has played a total war game before knows that it can be quite overwhelming, tiresome and boring fighting turn after turn. It's nice to build your empire in peace sometimes. You don't really get that opportunity in Medieval II: Total War.- Overpowered Mongol hordes that appear during the late-game can be very irritating. For some unknown reason, Creative Assembly (the developers) like to throw a curve ball at the players in almost every single total war title they release. Total War: Shogun 2 had realm divide, where every Japanese faction declared war on you after you became too powerful, Total War: Rome II had civil wars, where massive armies spawn in your territory to take over. Medieval II: Total War has....the Mongols. All I can say is good luck and be prepared for when they arrive.Overall Score: 8/10Even though Medieval II: Total War is an old game which struggles with diplomacy and realism, it has a lot of fun features and micro-management which the more modern total war games seem to neglect. The use of priests to remove witches and heretics, the inquisition trialling your family's characters for blasphemy, the crusades, merchants who fight over resources  - this is all good, interesting gameplay on top of the real time battles. It's an excellent if not exhausting game, due to the AI's constant affinity for wanting to attack you.			"

												Pretty much like Civilization 4/5, only instead of some goofy animation of one dude/mechanical killing another, you get taken down to a map and engage in RTS action. You can compose armies of many unit types of the time period, and each one has an information card telling you about that unit and a description of their historical use. You can play as 5-ish factions initially, though you can unlock more.Just like Civ4/5, while on the overmap you can upgrade cities/castles and engage in trade/sabotage/war/diplomacy with other nations, only you can't build new cities, only take over others, though you can repurpose them to Towns(Money Makers) or make them into a Castle(Troop Maker), though both can make money or troops, their respective ones do it better.For those who have played Rome: Total War, Medieval is extremely similar, except during a different time period. There are improvements, such as improvements and supporting modern resolutions without mods.Speaking of mods. there are two very good ones, called ""The Elder Scrolls: Total War"", which let's you play in the Elder Scrolls world with all their empires and factions. And also ""The Third Age: Total War"", which let's you play in The Lord of the Rings world, in GREAT detail, and is rated one of the best mods for Medieval II: Total War, and is currently(March 5th, 2015) ranked #1 on ModDB.I greatly recommend this to any Total War or RTS fan.

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who has been a fan of the Total war games, strategy games, or even has a interest in the Medieval times. Having played over 100 hours and only completing one faction out of 17 playable factions for campaign.Even if you don't want to start a campaign they have custom battles that you can make the rules for or even historical battle in which you reenact famous battles fought during this time period. There is so much replayability and each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses such as England has really good longbowmen but lack in good cavalry compaired to other factions. So if you are looking for a great strategy game that will keep you busy for multiple hours at a time and are intrested in Medieval  history then Medieval 2 Total war is the game for you!			"

												Even 9 years later, Medieval II Total War is still the best strategy game out there.  A huge amount of different factions and hundreds of different units means that each faction will have their own battlefield strategy.  On top of that, little details like the weather and elevation can come into play, not to mention how tired your own units are.  Despite all that complexity, the user interface is very simple and straightforward-even a novice can master the game's mechanics in as little as an hour of gameplay.  And if you somehow manage to exhaust the main campaign, the modding world has kept this game very much alive, with new mods always in the pipeline.			"

												After putting several thousand hours of time in to retail disc copy of M2TW, and having played all the other TW games, this is the best of the TW series when modded with Third age or Stainless Steel (available here http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?556-Kingdoms-Hosted-Modifications ).  Many of the other mods available for M2 are really good warhammer, EB2, Last Kingdom are worth trying out. (admittedly Shogun 2 is the best vanilla TW game)M2 has weight to its combat, that is lacking in the more frantic, less unit based style of R2 and Attila.  M2 has family tree integrated into the dynamics kingdom management, which is much reduced in later TW games, in M2 I care about family and generals in a way that I never do in subsequent.  With Third age mod the graphics are pretty close to as good as you'll get in later TW games (I run a Titan card so max out all settings in all TW games).M2 demonstrates why modding makes PC gaming the master race.

Higher difficulty levels can actually cause a little problem, however, for a true strategist this isn't impossible to pass obstacle, actually it's quite opposite, it's even greater joy in the destruction of nations that was constantly bothering us. Game worth it's money, from time to time there are great discounts on Total War game series, so are You ready to set new orders in medieval Europe?			"

												Ignore the low play time... hundreds of hours have been amassed on a retail copy.Medieval II is, quite simply, one of the finest games I have ever played. It's the game that got me back into strategy games after a long hiatus, and that introduced me to what is now one of my favorite game series ever.But will you like it?Well, let's start from the beginning.Medieval II is a combination turn-based and real-time tactics strategy game that takes place in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East during the Middle Ages. You can play as one of 17 different factions in the campaign mode (plus four others in skirmishes) that have a wide variety of playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses. As 450 years go by, the Old World is thrown into chaos- or Total War, as the narrator would say- as it endures Crusades and Jihads, rebellion and betrayal, infighting among the Christian nations, two monstrous hordes from the East, and that terrible calamity known as the Black Death, all while the slow wheel of time turns and technology continues to advance from the simple spear to the crossbow to the terrible might of gunpowder. The Kingdoms expansion essentially adds four entirely new games, with campaigns in more localized areas of the normal TW map with over a dozen new factions to play from, in scenarios that all present very different challenges.You will spend half of your time on the grand campaign map, a sort of political overworld where you manage the large affairs of your empire and move about your units. Here is where alliances are made and broken, provinces are developed, units are recruited, money is managed, and the dark tasks of espionage and assassination are undertaken. While a battle might change the course of a war, this is where you make sure that you have every chance of winning it in the first place.But most people play Total War for the battles. With the capacity to have thousands of units on the field at any given time, they're as much spectacle as strategy, as the ordered chaos of the battlefield threatens to overwhelm even the greatest captains. With a rich unit roster and a wide array of special abilities, your armies will be versatile and able to employ any number of tactics, from slowly whittling enemy numbers down with a stream of arrow fire to forming a defensive circle to protect your captain to employing a devastating hammer and anvil strike with your cavalry to launching diseased cow carcasses at their generals. Morale, terrain, weather, and energy levels all play important roles in how well your soldiers will be able to fight, and how well you will be able to govern the events of the battle.While there are some common strategies that can be undertaken for any nation or situation, no two campaigns or battles are the same, as the game can and will throw out surprises for you that you'll have to think quickly about to overcome. You may think you're doing well as France, fighting off England and preparing to make an invasion of the isles, when suddenly those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Portugal declare war on you and blockade all of your provinces, forcing you to stretch yourself out along two fronts. And while you may be able to overcome this obstacle, His Holiness the Pope probably won't take kindly to your conquests against your Catholic brethren, and may excommunicate you. All eventualities need to be prepared for in Total War if you want to survive.While this game is nearly a decade old, it still has a sizable and dedicated community of players to turn to if you want to fight a battle, try out a mod, or just get some friendly advice on how to deal with the Timurids. And as one of the easiest TW games to modify, it also has one of the best mod communities you'll be able to find, with an active base of players uploading and supporting their mods to this day. I highly recommend Stainless Steel, an expanded version of the base game with more provinces, factions, and units, and better AI, and also Third Age, a total conversion mod for Lord of the Rings that in my humble opinion is arguably the best TW game ever created, despite being a mod. If those two don't suit you, I'm sure you can find others that will.As for performance, the game still runs fine almost a decade after release, and still looks great. I can start a battle with 5,000 troops on the field and have little to no lag on my less than stellar computer. The score is also one of the finest I've had the pleasure of listening to in any game, and fits it very well.So, what are you waiting for? Go get the game! Europe won't conquer itself!			"

												This game is very fun and will keep you busy for many hours. Even with new total war games like shogun w and rome 2 coming out with better graphics and more game mechanics, medieval 2 is still one of my favorite if not my favorite total war game. If you like the total war series this is a must have game.			"

												Very nice strategy game. It remounts to around the 10th-11th century, from there you have to choose a faction, and conquer territories. To do that you have to manage your cities through creating buildings and setting taxes to raise income. Command your armies, set trades routes between factions, make alliances and conquer cities either through the power of the pen or the sword.			"

												Old game but still holds up. This game will seem a bit antique when set beside other modern total war games. But fundamentaly the game is still fun and challenging and being a less modern strategy game will no doubt be a fine choice for gamers on a strict budget.Secondly it will not stress your rig to it's limit like a modern title such as shogun 2 total war.which is a graphicly impressive game at max settings but is simply to much for some rigs to handleThere are some unit balancing issues however that will make some factions feel over-powered and cheap.overall though a nice budget title with lots a replay value due to the large number of playable factions			"

												Pretty much like Civilization 4/5, only instead of some goofy animation of one dude/mechanical killing another, you get taken down to a map and engage in RTS action. You can compose armies of many unit types of the time period, and each one has an information card telling you about that unit and a description of their historical use. You can play as 5-ish factions initially, though you can unlock more.Just like Civ4/5, while on the overmap you can upgrade cities/castles and engage in trade/sabotage/war/diplomacy with other nations, only you can't build new cities, only take over others, though you can repurpose them to Towns(Money Makers) or make them into a Castle(Troop Maker), though both can make money or troops, their respective ones do it better.For those who have played Rome: Total War, Medieval is extremely similar, except during a different time period. There are improvements, such as improvements and supporting modern resolutions without mods.Speaking of mods. there are two very good ones, called ""The Elder Scrolls: Total War"", which let's you play in the Elder Scrolls world with all their empires and factions. And also ""The Third Age: Total War"", which let's you play in The Lord of the Rings world, in GREAT detail, and is rated one of the best mods for Medieval II: Total War, and is currently(March 5th, 2015) ranked #1 on ModDB.I greatly recommend this to any Total War or RTS fan.

												Another game from the Total War game series and another hours spent conquering the map. This time we have the opportunity to dominate medieval europe and the surrounding area. Higher difficulty levels can actually cause a little problem, however, for a true strategist this isn't impossible to pass obstacle, actually it's quite opposite, it's even greater joy in the destruction of nations that was constantly bothering us. Game worth it's money, from time to time there are great discounts on Total War game series, so are You ready to set new orders in medieval Europe?			"

												Im new to total war i have only had this game for about 4 weeks and i have few problems with the game.  I love this game, but the one thing that ruins the game is the stupid AI, i can win seige battles outnumberd 3 to 1 because the AI charges in one choke point, and the  AI don't leave big garrisons of troops to defend their citys, even their capitals. the combat is perfect and realistic, battles are sluggish, and they don't end as fast as in other total wars. some factions are better then others like France and England, some are mediocre like poland, which is not a really popular faction or the paple states. campaign is fun and somewhat difficult,but again the AI ruins it. the time period itself makes the  best expeirence so far bringing me right into the world, you get to live the life of a medieval knight, or a king leading his army into battle as you take citys, and defend you're own . i give this game a 8.5/10			"

There is a huge variety of factions and each have their own unique units to choose from. A fantastic campaign map which covers the Holy lands, Northern Africa, Europe and also America(which you discover later in the game).The only bad thing is that the graphics arent the best and i suppose that is because the game did come out in 2006.

												Don't be fooled by my hours, I've played for much much longer offline. In my first campagin as England, I ended up losing, but I didn't care, I had a blast with the battles, politics and everything else. I've had so many different adventures and scenarios, from a French invasion of England, culminating in a fatal last stand across the River Tent outside Nottingham, to a battle between my Spansh Musketeers, Conquistadors and Sword and buckler men against a massive Aztec army, ending with a mass route of the Aztec army after my cavalry charged down the side of a hill, Lord of the Rings style, into the Aztec's flank. And this was basically before I tried the mods. Stainless Steel adds a bigger map, more factions, more units, and tons more content, adding even MORE adventures and scenarios. How about a Russian conquest of Eastern Europe and Asia Minor circa 13th century, with a medival NATO of England, France, Denmark and Germany allyign to stop you? I've done it, and still haven't finished it yet. Rebuilding the Roman Empire with the Byzantine Empire? Was easy at first, until the Mongols showed up. I've got so many campaigns to get back to and start, I don't see myself ever deleting this game off my machine if I need space, or even out of boredom. If anyone offers you this game, it's cheap, or you're just thinking ""Looks pretty cool"", pick it up. You will not regret it. This is easily one of, if not the greatest, strategy games I've ever played in my life. Just one word of advice; prepare for the Mongol inavsion before hand, or you're going to have a BAAAD time :)			"

												Following up the highly popular Rome, Medieval II is, perhaps not surprisingly, very similar to its immediate predecessor. Anyone who has played Rome can look at Medieval II and see essentially the same gameplay with a few added bits. Thankfully those added bits improve the core game enough that Medieval II stands on its own, managing to escape Rome's shadow... a bit.There are some silly issues that are often found in TW games: The AI is bad. Bad in the ""I am suicidal with my generals"" sort of way. At least they can actually fight battles competently enough, since this series has always (until Fall of the Samurai, perhaps) been at its best with swords, bows, and catapults. You do get the beginnings of the ""pike and shot"" era in this game, but really the focus is on the lovely middle ages.As for the good bits, the Grand Campaign is, well, grand. A big map that can be made even bigger with mods, plenty of events that sometimes herald the arrival of new factions (ze Mongols!), and lots of fun with religion and crusades and burning  heretics. You have to unlock the rest of the factions by playing one of the starter nations (England, France, Spain, etc), but once you do there is plenty of replay value to be found here. And, of course, there are mods. Plenty for Medieval II, though the real gems require its Kingdoms expansion. So, if you want to lead big armies in the middle ages and charge around Europe setting stuff on fire, this game is plenty good for that. It's similarity to Rome might lead some players to get bored a little faster, but they can just get mods and play something fresh. Also get the Kingdoms expansion so you can delve into some of the best mods ever made.			"

												     This, in my opinion, is THE best total war game that they've made. And in addition, it is my favorite strategy game. The only RTS game that I can think of that is better, would be C&C Generals, but EA never made a second one!!!Back to medieval, for a bit of an outdated game it still looks amazing, and it runs flawlessly, highest settings, even on my computer which only has 2 lousy GB of RAM. They campaign is fun, and it feels more in-depth, and more ""wholesome"" than the newer TW games like ROME 2. Just little things that you'll notice throughout the game that'll  make it just SO much more fun. The kingdoms expansion is even better!!! 90% of my logged game time is just the brittania campaign. I can't get enough of this game, I spend hours on end glued to my screen witnessing my armies conquer, and my ""light"" Ostmen slaughtering heavy Scottish Nobleman like they were pigs. And unlike ROME 2 where in melee combat, infantry just gets into a giant clusterf@#k and it takes forever for one side to win, melee combat in this game is so much better, each soldier in a unit has their own little fight and they're pals may jump in and help em out with a quick axe-to-the-head. I can go on and on about how amazing this game is, but then you'd be reading this for hours. Just buy the game. And see how amazing it is for yourselves. And you wont regret it. 10/10 one of the greatest games EVER made.P.S. - ELEPHANTS WITH CANNONS. end of story...			"

And this was basically before I tried the mods. Stainless Steel adds a bigger map, more factions, more units, and tons more content, adding even MORE adventures and scenarios. How about a Russian conquest of Eastern Europe and Asia Minor circa 13th century, with a medival NATO of England, France, Denmark and Germany allyign to stop you? I've done it, and still haven't finished it yet. Rebuilding the Roman Empire with the Byzantine Empire? Was easy at first, until the Mongols showed up. I've got so many campaigns to get back to and start, I don't see myself ever deleting this game off my machine if I need space, or even out of boredom. If anyone offers you this game, it's cheap, or you're just thinking ""Looks pretty cool"", pick it up. You will not regret it. This is easily one of, if not the greatest, strategy games I've ever played in my life. Just one word of advice; prepare for the Mongol inavsion before hand, or you're going to have a BAAAD time :)			"

												Played about 167 hours on the steam version, well more on the disc version. The game is brillant, very easy to run and extremely easy to play than alot of the more modern total wars. There is a huge variety of factions and each have their own unique units to choose from. A fantastic campaign map which covers the Holy lands, Northern Africa, Europe and also America(which you discover later in the game).The only bad thing is that the graphics arent the best and i suppose that is because the game did come out in 2006. Overall 9/10			"

												  So this was my first Total war game. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy the RTS genre of games. It is a perfect blend of Turn based strategy and risk style of game in the grand campaign. But with the cool feature where you command Thousands of troops and you decide the outcome of each battle. The tricky bit for me to learn was the economy and how trade works and how to manage it the best, but with a little patience and a bit of cunning even you can slaughter the helpless annoying pope who excomunnicates you when you pet a kitten that is homeless. My favorite nation was the Holy Roman Empire (one of the five startering nations to pick from) I suggest new players play as ether as England or France they are the simplest nations. To start with, KEEP in mind every little action you do as a christian country will  affect the pope. So ether slaughter the old guy or give him boxes and boxes of chocolates and stay away from his anger. This is my first review I hope it was a decent one.			"

												After putting several thousand hours of time in to retail disc copy of M2TW, and having played all the other TW games, this is the best of the TW series when modded with Third age or Stainless Steel (available here http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?556-Kingdoms-Hosted-Modifications ).  Many of the other mods available for M2 are really good warhammer, EB2, Last Kingdom are worth trying out. (admittedly Shogun 2 is the best vanilla TW game)M2 has weight to its combat, that is lacking in the more frantic, less unit based style of R2 and Attila.  M2 has family tree integrated into the dynamics kingdom management, which is much reduced in later TW games, in M2 I care about family and generals in a way that I never do in subsequent.  With Third age mod the graphics are pretty close to as good as you'll get in later TW games (I run a Titan card so max out all settings in all TW games).M2 demonstrates why modding makes PC gaming the master race.

												This game is absolutely amazing. The tactics and strategy are extremely simple, making it less difficult. Some factions are obviously ridiculously powerful with more starting regions, better units and technology, but it is still an absolutely amazing game. I've played as the Holy Roman Empire, France, England, Russia, and Spain, and they're all extremely fun and they all deserve a 10/10. Incredible modding capabilities, too. Definitely worth it, especially if you get it on a good sale.			"

												Where have you been all my life?I purchased Medieval II: Total War when it was on a sale a while back, but never 'opened' it. I bought it because I remember seeing a friend playing it when it first came out, and two things stuck in my mind:1. WOW! 8 GB on my hard drive?! That's too much space!2. Man, these battles are huge! And you have to manage the governance? That's insane!I'm a big fan of the Age of Empires series, so I was very used to a simpler, more combat-focused game series. M2TW's size (legitimately, that wasn't just a joke) as well as the amount of managing you needed to do looked intimidating to me, so I never tried it.How wrong I was.This game is absolutely glorious. Managing your nation, commanding your armies, working through all the inner workings of medieval society: this game found a way to make it work together. Here's an example: In the short British campaign, you have to conquer both Scotland and France. Scotland has few allies, so they weren't difficult to invade. However, France was a whole different story. France was not only allied with many of my neighbours (The Holy Roman Empire and Milan), but they were highly regarded by the Pope of the Catholic Church. If I tried to invade France, not only did I have to also fight against their allies, but I risked becoming excommunicated. I went for the risk, becoming both excommunicated and enemies to nearly all Catholic nations, and that made my French conquest significantly harder. I had to stop playing that campaign because, while my nation was the strongest, my borders were constantly under attack every turn, and I'd rather start a new campaign and learn from my mistakes.Albeit still a computer program and not reality, Medieval II feels like the closest thing to a simulator of Medieval combat. It's almost as if they intended to create a game series and engine to emulate that!I have not checked out the other Total War games, but I am going to once I'm done with my campaign on this one. So, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Strategy games and haven't tried these games, go for it! It has quickly become one of my favourite games, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for something new.Or old. I'm really behind the curve on this.			"

												This is the last pre-warscape CA Total War game, and really the last that could be successfully modded extensively.  This latter piece of the puzzle matters because some of the community dating back to when the game originallly released went to a lot of trouble to make mods, such as Stainless Steel and the total conversion for Lord of the Rings: Third Age.For me, the charm of Medieval 2 though is really centered around the game itself, the time period is so well suited for the style of game play that CA makes with the turn based stragegy map combined with the real time tactical battles that the result is just endless amounts of fantastic game play.This and Shogun 2 are for me the two best games CA has ever created.

												I played this on CD to the point that the disk stopped working. I don't have an hour total, but I can assure you I spent a good two or three years putting about as much time into this as I did my full time job.Probably the last really well thought out Total War game, and one of the least buggy. There is no stupidly awkward city management system (Empire), most of the factions are reasonably well balanced (with the exception of the Italian States, who are crushingly overpowered in a player's hands - still better than pretty well all the other total war games out there), and things move at a pace that doesn't feel to relaxed or too rushed (shogun, napolean).It's not a masterpiece by any means, but now that I revisit them, I don't think any of the Total War games really are. It is a pretty fun game though, and certainly worth getting if you've are looking to get into the series.Edit: When I say ""the least buggy"", I'm just refering to the Steam versions. Rome:TW on CD, from like a decade ago, remains stable as a ♥♥♥♥ing rock resting on the surface of a giant steel cube with the gravitational pull of a black hole. There is also a 6 billion ton weight sitting on top of the rock. I've been told the Steam version doesn't work that well, but haven't had to try it despite having lost my Rome CD recently, because Rome is from an era where devs depended on human decency and CD codes as DRM.

												While overall this game is great, squalor and the pope completely destroys the campaignThere are obviously meant to be some balancing to stop exponential growth, but there is no way to stop squalor and it just makes the game's campaign really annoyingAs for the pope, he constantly sends missions to stop attacking factions, even if it is defensively but the worst part is, he doesn't do the same to the faction you cant attck, this means that when I'm fighting the french not only am I not allowed to take the settlement which I was so close to before but also they can both siege my settlements which I cannot send a relief force for but they can also blockade my ports wihout be even being able to defend			"

												I love this game. It looks a bit dated now after some of the more recent Total War series, but this is an extremely interesting time period for warfare. The game suffers a bit on the campaign map by being a bit too ambitious; there are a bit too many merchants, priests, spies, assassins, princesses to move around. But the real-time battles can be simply glorious, and the historical accuracy make the experience ultimately fulfilling. If you're patient, the Grand Campaign can be a true strategic adventure.  Be warned! This game has a third-party launcher that has a bug and it may need to be killed from the task-manager under ""processes"" most times that you play. There may also be a problem with the Kingdoms DLC, so check the forums first! Don't be put off, though, this game is pretty damn good!			"

A great game that will consume many hours of your life to engage in a great campaign in Medieval Europe,North Africa,Middle East and little bit of Asia too (America also but that's a secret shhh). Make your way as a crappy faction and conquer the world or a great faction and relive history as it was or as you think it should have been. 10/10 would kill French with my awesome English army again.

												This is probably my second favorite Total War game after Shogun 2. The middle age setting is amazing and the graphics hold up pretty well for how old it is now. Nothing beats slaughtering thousands of enemies using English Longbowmen or Venetian Heavy infantry, the battles are just so large and require knowledge of tactics. One thing that anoys me is the enemy campaign AI and the diplomacy, the AI doesn't raise balanced armies and is usually just lots of the same unit type. The differences that set apart all of the factions really make a difference when playing, for exapmle using the English you want to be building armies that are focused on using Longbowmen but other factions don't have that option. I have had hundreds of hours fun on this game over the years and i'm sure I will be playing it for many more years!			"

												Medievil 2 is one of the best games i have ever played.Why?The game's combat is a little easy (Use alot cavilry and you'll win alot of engagments), but the game is good. I can't say the game is incredibly hard to play, because it isn't, it's easy to learn. But the game is hard to master...The base game is a little broken, for instance im playing as the Holy Roman Empire right now and i'm being invaded on all sides. I got poland, venice, millan, and france all attacking me, yet im alive because i win the battles (but my economy is taking a toll for the worse).But if this is bugging you, you want a total war game where it's more realistic? Get the 'Stainless Steal' mod that improves the core game to be more realistic and hard. Essentially making the game a tonne better.but i'm not really all for that, but i do lord of the rings. The lord of the rings mod allowed me to  take back moria and kill balrog as the drawves, there were so many dead drawves... 	 but it also allowed me to get a good feel of lotr as it has everything that the books have and the movies missed (though based on the movies visually). But alot of people want to get the new total war warhammer game, but you probably have heard (or you haven't whatever) of the ""Rage of the dark gods"" which is so indepth that you have chaos drawves, orks, drawves, vampire counts, empire, all the different chaos gods, kislev, beast men and more. So you have a free mods that's probably more indepth than the new game comming out.So in the end, if you want a medievil tw game then get it, you want a realistic tw medevil game then get Stainless steal mod when you get it, you want a lord of the rings strategy game then get this and the mod, you want to get total war warhammer then get it.Do mind that the mods require kingdoms, which is a dlc that adds (i think) 5 new campaigns that are each build on the base game (they include NEW campaigns, not just factions like in rome2/atilla)			"

												A great game that I have poured over 100s of hours into. There are plenty of options as to how you want to raise your kingdom to be the greatest of all time. WIll your king be an honourable man, one who releases all his prisoners? Or a dreadful man, whose subjects follow him not out of loyalty, but fear? Will you cement a lasting alliance with the kingdom on your borders by marrying off your young princess to their prince, or will you slaughter them, burning their towns and villages and killing all their lords? Although the game lacks extreme political intrigue, there is enough there to keep you playing for a loong time. You can use covert ops (such as assassins and spies) to eliminate the lords and ladies of the enemy, weakening their forces before you ride in, killing everyone. There is so much to do in this game, and the RTS combat is fantastic. True strategy is necessary to win on the field of battle. A competent commander will triumph over the greatest of odds if his enemies blunder about like fools. There is also a great deal of diversity throughout the units for each faction. And, despite how old this game is, I assure you, the multiplayer community is very much alive and well. A must buy for TW fans, and strategy fans in general.			"

												-Be Playing Medieval II:Total War as England, get an alliance with France, Spain and Poland/Germany-Brothels are keeping my morale in my cities somewhat steady after conquering all of Britain and Sweden despite constant Rebel armies appearing for no real reason (REBEL SCUM)-France keeps asking for money, politely tell them to go♥♥♥♥♥♥off and settle for giving them a part of Sweden.-France give me the seen..no contact for a few turns.-We team up upon getting attacked by Portugal and attack Rebel bases and Portugal together (Screw you Portugal and your infinite Navy)-Think to myself ""France is okay after all""-France then turns around along with Spain and Poland and the new German Empire and declares on me.-Decide to not go down like a b!tch and lay siege to Paris, get kicked from the catholic church over and over again for defending myself.-After 90ish turns I have wiped out the Germans (dont know what the factions called), SEEMINGLY all of the French (Traitor Scum). Then Annihalate most of Venice, Spain, Sicily and Portugal as well as Russia but lucky for them i'm low on troops and funds at this point despite owning all of West Europe and a part of East Europe.-SUDDENLY, the Mongols invade. Due to my absolute war machine I have dismantled and crippled most of the AI's in Europe leaving a huge power vacuum.-7 turns after the Mongols showed up they have invaded Poland, Russia and anyone east/southeast of Italy asides from Egypt and Turkey have been destroyed.-10 turns after the Mongols showed up they have massacred my forces that were spread too thin.-Rush to get all my troops from France,England and North Italy to stop the onslaught.-SUDDENLY it turns out France had been hiding in North Africa all along and they send troops up via ships (Was too busy with the Mongols to even notice)-France proceeds to pretty much screw me up with cannons and I get tea bagged for a few more turns before turning off the Laptop and crying tears of anger as I see the French throwing baguettes at my dying ecosystem (RIP Britain and Ireland 02/01/16 - 06/01/16).10/10Would get fisted by France and the Mongols again.

												hands down the best total war game. its still undisputed. it still has an active modding community. it offers great mods.the battles look way better than the newer titles. the campaign map is not a needlessly complicated mess.its sad that a game released 11 years ago is still better than its successors. the founders of medieval 2 had a clear vision, which is why medieval 2 ended up being a great game.the new CA has no vision at all. instead you get games that are a jack of all trades, master of none.

												Such a great game. Well worth the money, well worth getting the Kingdoms DLC with it, just adds more to do really. Honestly, I would say this is the best out of the Total War series. I like the feature of being able to put units under AI command, have the AI take control of an army during a battle, though the AI is bad, it is still a handy feature if you want to witness giant battles. It is a shame they didn't include it in the later games. I love being able to buid up armies and attack huge castles with mighty siege equipment, it is just awesome.The game lacks some things, but it is old. There can be stressful moments, where the AI acts like a complete idiot, you cannot position your troops where you want to position them, some slight issues, but the game is still awesome and playable. Has some great mods out there for it, so you can go and experience them too.Highly recommend it.			"

I enjoy this game very much and encourage anyone who has not played it to get it, I don't think you wil disappointed, unless ofcourse these style games are not your cup of tea then well, your in the wrong place because this game is a shining example of Medieval blood shed at it 's best.

Easy to learn difficult to master especially playing against a human scum ..the ai is good for its era but will declare war at you if its on higher difficulty  and on the battlefield yet it does some noob stuff like having its archers alone and ahead of the main firce etc.One of the games that i would love to write a whole essay yet its a review of the game.... i think its a must have, could be run in a potatoe ,massive slaughter  game  and its very low priced nowadays so its a win for you and a win for volvo  "

												I am going to compare this game to Rome: Total War, an older entry of the series.Improvements I instantly notice:Naval combat feels very rewarding! It is still autocalculated, but 2 ships will go up against 1 and you will probably win. 6 ship can go against 5 enemy ships, and you might just win a heroic victory with 0 losses! Instead of the SPQR for Roman Factions, you have a Pope for the many different Catholic factions! This is a good addition in my opinion, as now more factions feel fleshed out. Graphics are better here and there, but the way my settings are, I don't really notice major differences. Not that the graphics hold anything back!Pre-battle speeches feel nice and Medieval-like! Though they are slightly repetitive, they're still a joy to listen to. There is no balance issues that I can see, but the Byzantines/Turks and the Holy Roman Empire seem to have it easier early on when they're played by AI. Crusades are a nice new addition as well! For the most part, the Campaign map feels the same. However, a key difference is that you can swap a settlement between being a Castle or a Town. Castles offer military power, whilst Towns offer economic power. The choice is yours!Agent system feels a lot more immersive.There are tons of cinematics! It feels like an achievement just to have a Spy take a look at a few stray enemy units.MP is still kicking, but Rome 1's MP is also alive. It is also only worth $20, with a very cheap DLC! That is a complete steal for a game like this. That said, Rome 1 is cheaper.Probably one of the best things this game has is the fact that the map is more immersive! There was historical events in Rome 1 like volcanoes and floods, but now you can witness the spawn of the Mongols, or contact Aztecs when you have been confined to Europe all this time!10/10Would marry off my daughters to Genghis Khan again!

												I absolutely love this game. I've been playing it since it came out, I have the original DVD box which came with the soundtrack on a CD. So many factions to choose from, although I usually tend to stick with England, or Spain in the New World (Kingdoms is so worth the download). Sadly, Steam can't count the amount of hours I've had on this game when I had it installed from a DVD disk. As soon as I saw this on sale, I immediately bought it, downloaded it, and played. I can't seem to get the same feeling I have when playing this game, when I've play ROME II. It's just not the same.			"

												Wanna know how I got these hours? I'll sum it up in one word. Mods. Without all the beautiful mods, that have been created by an amazing community, I wouldn't have loved this game as much as I currently do. Without the mods it is still an amazing game. One of the best, if not the best current Total War. Amazing cavalry charge, beautiful arrow stagger, and even those awesome armor upgrades. If you want to start playing Total War then I urge you to buy this game. Does it have it's cons? Yes, yes it does. There are many bugs and glitches. I've encountered a few crashes, and since this an older game be ready for lag if you try to have the graphics and unit sizes to the highest setting. There have been a couple bugs that annoy the ever-living crap outta me. Such as during Sieges, you try to run your archers off the walls but half of them stay there. If you try to set them up behind the wall they were just on, prepare for stupid unit Ai. They form up against the buildings or something stupid like that.Even with the oldness, the bugs, the crashes. I still give this game a 10/10 because of the amazing mods it has.Third Age: Total WarElder Scrolls: Total WarCall of Warhammer: Total WarPlanetary War: Total WarJust to name the four I use. So buy it, buy Kingdoms with it. Then go on to download all the mods. If you don't then get excommunicated scrub.THIS MOD FOR TEST OF TIME NOMINATION!			"

												This game is very fun. Im a huge fan of the total war series and this is  a great title and probably better than rome 2 or some of the other newer titles. Great combat, awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet, but what really make this game for me is the mods. The mods are the best, making total overhauls or just small adjustments. Its what makes this game long lasting for me. My favourite would be age of Petty Kings,  A Game of thrones mod. Great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls. The generals also have alot of character as they evolve over    your playthrough. The spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough.  Also on my desktop which has windows eight the game crashes every time i open it, be carefull about that.Recomend you get this, fantastic game and replay value over 10000			"

												I grew up with this game, form the age of seven. I still play it regulary. I have downloaded tenfolds of mods. This is the pinnacle of Total War. The raw brutality, the strategy adn the epic fights. And the mods. The oh so glorious mods. It says have 544 hrs on record, but with the cd version and the Kingdoms expansion (which got removed after the steam update), I must have played it for several thousand hours. The DLC is also great. It is what a DLC is supposed to be. You have the base game, fully fleshed out (Unlike Warhammer etc), and then it adds  not one, not two, but FOUR whole new maps, with new factions and units to play as, for really cheap. That is what a DLC should be. The mods are also fantastic, ranging from Warhammer, LOTR, Italy in the 16th century, Japan, even the whole world. Even crazy mods, such as Planetwar, with klingons, aliens v Predator, Shrek and Romans in one group. There is so much to say about the mods, I could spend hours writing about them.While to community might not be the largest, it's certianly one of the best I've seen. Everyone is friendly, and gives advise. There might be some salt here and there, but that's the exeption that confirms the rule.If you are interested in strategy, buy this. If you like massive battles, buy this. If you like mods, buy this. If you have a little extra money to spend, this is the game to buy.			"

The family tree and the crusades/jihads will make your own story. 3.Historicly acurate. 4. As time passes you will face new challenes, I will only say one but it is big......MONGOL INVASION. 5. so many units and factions. most in any game I might say. 6.Kingdoms expansion. Its not like the dlcs of the new total war games. It is 4 of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t dlcs for a smaller price and more content. 7.You can rename cities. 8. no annoying and glitchy ship battles(there are none). 9. Multiplayer is large and in charge. 10. CHEAP. Now I gave you 10 reasons to buy it. I will give you a bonus one. 11. Third Age Total War. NOW BUY IT AND EXPANSION			"

												This is honestly my favorite game currently, the engine is better than... others *cough* *cough* Empire. It is a classic no doubt. It is in the medieval time period which is one of my favorites. Also the game has some of the greatest mods such as Third Age and Stainless Steel. Another bonus is the campaign, it has so many balancing aspects such as the preventation of elite unit spaming. Another bonus is the factions, their is a big variety and the fact that England has their longbows, France has their variety of good cavalry, well not the Lancers or Gendarms. The Polish have their good cheep cavalry and Egypt has their naphatunes, but so does turkey and others that I can not name off the top of my head. Anyways, the main downfall I find in this game is the fact that it is old, so the graphics aren't perfect and the game can't run huge battles, regardless you PC. To sum it up, it is rediculasly fun and deserves all the praise it gets. I managed to put around 100 hours into this game after the first month of having it. I HEAVLY recomend this game to anyone into RTS TS and the medieval genre. Sorry for my spelling by the way:)			"

												My favorite of the Total War series. Medieval was the first with in-depth politics and diplomacy. In combination with the DLCs, this game has the Medieval Ages served on a silver platter for the player. The battles are ofcourse the heart of the game. Cinematic and breath taking, you will never get tired of seeing your heavy cavalry charging defenseless swordmen and archers, seeing them flying around like bowling targets!Among the greatest games of all time!10/10			"

												hands down the best total war game. its still undisputed. it still has an active modding community. it offers great mods.the battles look way better than the newer titles. the campaign map is not a needlessly complicated mess.its sad that a game released 11 years ago is still better than its successors. the founders of medieval 2 had a clear vision, which is why medieval 2 ended up being a great game.the new CA has no vision at all. instead you get games that are a jack of all trades, master of none.

												This was my latest game in Medieval 2: Total WarI started playing as HRE (Holy Roman Empire). Things was peaceful, all I did was conquering nearby barbarian cities, so did all my other neighbors. Suddenly Venice attacks me. Some few battles and the lines are at a stalemate. Milan attacks me and they ally with Venice. Milan is excommunicated by the Pope for attacking me. Pope declares crusade against Cairo. My heir joins a crusade and marches down through East Europe, through the holy lands and after nearly 10 years he arrives and conquers Cairo just before Poland reaches there. Pope loves me. I then conquer Alexandria so that I can create a Mediterranean fleet so that my Heir Henry the Crusader can come back to his father before he dies of old age. Pope dies of old age. Archbishop of Milan is voted as Pope. Milan is not anymore excommunicated and is now loved by Pope. Papal state declares war against me and allies with Milan and Venice. My emperor dies in Bologna. Bologna is just after conquered by Papal state with the Pope himself in the army. Suddenly there is no secure land to land my new Emperor Henry the Crusader. Pope starts a new crusade. Again it is against Cairo, only this time it's under my control... 2 years after a Jihad is started, also against Cairo. My hatred for the newly vided Pope is great. I use more years and create an even bigger fleet so that the venetian fleet can't outmatch it. I then send Emperor Henry the Crusader and his crusader army (the ones that conquered Cairo and Alexandria). Because of little troops after my emperor left Alexandria, it rebels and all surviving troops are sent to Cairo. Some years after Emperor Henry the Crusader lands outside of Rome and attacks the Pope himself. Emperor Henry the Crusader kills the Pope with his crusader army. 11/10 Best game ever <3			"

												I grew up with this game, form the age of seven. I still play it regulary. I have downloaded tenfolds of mods. This is the pinnacle of Total War. The raw brutality, the strategy adn the epic fights. And the mods. The oh so glorious mods. It says have 544 hrs on record, but with the cd version and the Kingdoms expansion (which got removed after the steam update), I must have played it for several thousand hours. The DLC is also great. It is what a DLC is supposed to be. You have the base game, fully fleshed out (Unlike Warhammer etc), and then it adds  not one, not two, but FOUR whole new maps, with new factions and units to play as, for really cheap. That is what a DLC should be. The mods are also fantastic, ranging from Warhammer, LOTR, Italy in the 16th century, Japan, even the whole world. Even crazy mods, such as Planetwar, with klingons, aliens v Predator, Shrek and Romans in one group. There is so much to say about the mods, I could spend hours writing about them.While to community might not be the largest, it's certianly one of the best I've seen. Everyone is friendly, and gives advise. There might be some salt here and there, but that's the exeption that confirms the rule.If you are interested in strategy, buy this. If you like massive battles, buy this. If you like mods, buy this. If you have a little extra money to spend, this is the game to buy.			"

												This game is very fun. Im a huge fan of the total war series and this is  a great title and probably better than rome 2 or some of the other newer titles. Great combat, awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet, but what really make this game for me is the mods. The mods are the best, making total overhauls or just small adjustments. Its what makes this game long lasting for me. My favourite would be age of Petty Kings,  A Game of thrones mod. Great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls. The generals also have alot of character as they evolve over    your playthrough. The spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough.  Also on my desktop which has windows eight the game crashes every time i open it, be carefull about that.Recomend you get this, fantastic game and replay value over 10000			"

												One of the finest RTS games I have played and probably my only real favourite in the Total War series.  Within this game you start off as one of the monarchies of the medieval era, England, France, Spain etc, inhabiting the West with the Turks, Egyptians, the Moors etc controlling most of the Eastern regions.  And I use control loosely, for this game is about constant strife, border control and damning your so called allies to your own religious hierarchies.  The gameplay itself is split into two halves.  One half is the typical RTS strategic combat, where two armies with varied units, face each other on the battlefield to determine a victor!  In this part of the game, there is a Rock Paper Scissors style of strategy, with Spears besting Knights, Knights besting Archers and Archers besting Spears, though as your own technology expands and your coffers grow larger, more diverse units will be available to you.The AI can be a little stupid at times, often forgetting your commands or taking an insanely longer route than it needs to travel to reach it's destination.  So some micromanagement is needed there.  The second part of the gameplay is entirely Turn-Based.  You begin with a selection of territories relevant to your faction's Monarchy, you also have your own Royal Family who each have their own needs and quirks which affect your overall strategy.  And in this phase of the game you'll be charged with building your resources, exploring the world, and interacting with your neighbours.  Honestly I find this part of the game to actually be rather interesting, it's always fun to approach your neighbours with peace offerings and treaties, only to plan treachery for when the time is right.  And there are numerous and inventive ways you can attempt to accomplish this through, in a very Game of Thrones style of diplomacy if you're familiar with the subject matter.I found this to be the better of the Total War series.  Others will have their preferences to Rome, Shogun or maybe even the Napoleonic Wars, but if you have any doubts of either, just do your research.  I hope my review will help contribute to that. "

												I am officially addicted to this game. Like the Football Manager series before me playing this game, it is very addictive and so much fun. Prior to purchasing Medieval II: Total War, I had only heard of the 'Rome II' edition which is the latest game in the series and the reviews didn't look too good for it, so I chose this, which I find a fascinating period in history. Anybody who is thinking of playing this game for the first time, give a couple of hours on a new campaign and once you get your head around how to play it, Medieval II: Total War is crackin' - Graphics are good, slightly dated, but the graphics aren't the sole reason you'd buy this game. I also bought the extensoin pack [Kingdoms] which allows you to pick from another variety of factions [eg Jerusalem/Crusades etc] - I can't praise the game enough. I love it and if you're looking for a great strategy game, steeped in history, this is for you. Enjoy.			"

												Best strategy game ever.  1000's of hours of gameplay.  Never, ever the same game twice.  Bought on Steam because I was wearing out my DVD.  If Steam had my real time played, would be a likely 5000+ hours, and that may be a conservative guess.Start with pitchfork armies, end with Chivalric hammer wielding mayhem.  Play enough, and you unlock even more armies.  Spoiler, kinda? But seriously, playing a good, mid-late game, very hard/very hard setting epic defense against five or more allied Mongol armies in one turn isn't even the end, however epic that may be...  Rarely seen, the Timurids also lurk over the horizon.Buy it.			"

												Medieval ll: Total War is the 2nd game in the TW seriese. With many grafical updates and new mixed unit meshes it was supposed to be better then the Rome counterpart but thats not the case. The AI in Medieval seems to be more defensive, I found in many cases where I put the all the setting in the favor of another faction such as high unit count major upgrades and anyother thing I was able to do but the same outcome was presented. Camping in the same spot till I go for them, then again the game douse has its up sides such as double walls and many gatehouses. Also their is a massive amount of units such as spearmen, swordmen and so-on and so-forth. Ill give it a 7-10. The AI really takes a chunk out of this game. *At times*			"

												My personal favorite in the Total War series. Medieval 2 gains a lot by being set in a time and place that is more or less easily recognizable to westerners. Assuming you start the game as the default English or French, you'll be mostly battling accross Europe with late game forays into northern Africa, western Russia, and the Middle East. Your units will, for the most part, also be familiar and easily understood. Even a casual student of medieval European history will understand why charging a spear wall with calvary is a bad idea, or why you don't use tight formations to advance into arrow or catapult fire. The game's medieval atmosphere is further boosted by a provocative musical score, accurate sound effects, and nation-themed voice dialogue. Gamplay in Medieval II, like any Total War game, is dividied between the strategic global campaign map and tactical maps where battles are played out. The strategic gameplay is solid, and players will be required to juggle tax income, religion, unrest, noble desires, and public health with the logistical demands of supporting your armies between battles. While the game lacks the research tech tree introduced in Empire, technology pacing is present through city building. As you build and upgrade your stables, archery ranges, and barracks you'll gain access to new troop types while smithies, jousting fields, and swordsmen guilds will enhance the equipment and quality of troops. Tactical gameplay is fantastic with players having strong control over formations, positioning, and abilities. Complexity is added in with morale and stamina mechanics, both of which are easily understood and implemented in a way that makes sense. The few faults that do exist in the tactical gameplay only emerge when directly comparing the game to more recent Total Wars, like Shogun 2 or Rome 2. Combat and unit cohesion in Medieval 2 can feel more rigid and unresponsive than its successors, but never enough to seriously impede gameplay.  "

Replayability is 10/10, graphics considering how old it is 10/10, The expansions are excellent and improve's AI. The modding community is excellent and still active, the multiplayer community is excellent and still active. 10.5/10 is my overall review because of buggy AI at times. $20 for the base game. $25 for the expansion. Your wasting your time if you haven't played this game yet, guarenteed to get your money's worth and I consider it the best in the Total War franchise.			"

												Medieval II is an magnificent game that will steal hours if not days from your life.  Important note though,  this game has a mix between  Turn-Based kingdom management  and  Real Time battles  so  if you don't like TBS or RTS games i don't think MII is for you.  Vanilla MII is a great game, but i personally suggest that you download either the StainlessSteel or the DarthMod mod conversions which change several game parameter and drastically increases the difficulty and adds tons of new content to the game. Diplomacy is pretty light but it is a forgivable feature due to this being a  Total War  game and the whole point is to wage war and conquer everything in sight. Vanilla AI pathfinding i horrible in sieges, but there are some mods that can fix it, although not fully. In conclusion, MII is a unforgettable game that is certainly worth the low price you pay for tons of hours of war and conquest.			"

												Wanna know how I got these hours? I'll sum it up in one word. Mods. Without all the beautiful mods, that have been created by an amazing community, I wouldn't have loved this game as much as I currently do. Without the mods it is still an amazing game. One of the best, if not the best current Total War. Amazing cavalry charge, beautiful arrow stagger, and even those awesome armor upgrades. If you want to start playing Total War then I urge you to buy this game. Does it have it's cons? Yes, yes it does. There are many bugs and glitches. I've encountered a few crashes, and since this an older game be ready for lag if you try to have the graphics and unit sizes to the highest setting. There have been a couple bugs that annoy the ever-living crap outta me. Such as during Sieges, you try to run your archers off the walls but half of them stay there. If you try to set them up behind the wall they were just on, prepare for stupid unit Ai. They form up against the buildings or something stupid like that.Even with the oldness, the bugs, the crashes. I still give this game a 10/10 because of the amazing mods it has.Third Age: Total WarElder Scrolls: Total WarCall of Warhammer: Total WarPlanetary War: Total WarJust to name the four I use. So buy it, buy Kingdoms with it. Then go on to download all the mods. If you don't then get excommunicated scrub.THIS MOD FOR TEST OF TIME NOMINATION!			"

												I love this game. It looks a bit dated now after some of the more recent Total War series, but this is an extremely interesting time period for warfare. The game suffers a bit on the campaign map by being a bit too ambitious; there are a bit too many merchants, priests, spies, assassins, princesses to move around. But the real-time battles can be simply glorious, and the historical accuracy make the experience ultimately fulfilling. If you're patient, the Grand Campaign can be a true strategic adventure.  Be warned! This game has a third-party launcher that has a bug and it may need to be killed from the task-manager under ""processes"" most times that you play. There may also be a problem with the Kingdoms DLC, so check the forums first! Don't be put off, though, this game is pretty damn good!			"

												Out of all the Total War games, I've liked Medieval II the most, mainly since it has enough mechanics to the gameplay without adding too much complexity that you end up using in the end.  As an example of this, I found the merchant mechanics pointless in Empire Total War when you're going for a conquest victory.  There's also a lot of content here with the new world discovery, and the Kingdoms expansion, which do more than just change the map around, especially with the new world scenario.  The downside is the AI can be very stupid at times, like when you're being sieged you can sallly out, and the enemy will for the most part stand still until you're close.  So for instance, you can use a balista or archers to take them all out if you position them on the flanks of the sieging army and you won't take any casualities.Aside from that, a really good buy, especially if you can get it on sale.

												Medievil 2 is one of the best games i have ever played.Why?The game's combat is a little easy (Use alot cavilry and you'll win alot of engagments), but the game is good. I can't say the game is incredibly hard to play, because it isn't, it's easy to learn. But the game is hard to master...The base game is a little broken, for instance im playing as the Holy Roman Empire right now and i'm being invaded on all sides. I got poland, venice, millan, and france all attacking me, yet im alive because i win the battles (but my economy is taking a toll for the worse).But if this is bugging you, you want a total war game where it's more realistic? Get the 'Stainless Steal' mod that improves the core game to be more realistic and hard. Essentially making the game a tonne better.but i'm not really all for that, but i do lord of the rings. The lord of the rings mod allowed me to  take back moria and kill balrog as the drawves, there were so many dead drawves... 	 but it also allowed me to get a good feel of lotr as it has everything that the books have and the movies missed (though based on the movies visually). But alot of people want to get the new total war warhammer game, but you probably have heard (or you haven't whatever) of the ""Rage of the dark gods"" which is so indepth that you have chaos drawves, orks, drawves, vampire counts, empire, all the different chaos gods, kislev, beast men and more. So you have a free mods that's probably more indepth than the new game comming out.So in the end, if you want a medievil tw game then get it, you want a realistic tw medevil game then get Stainless steal mod when you get it, you want a lord of the rings strategy game then get this and the mod, you want to get total war warhammer then get it.Do mind that the mods require kingdoms, which is a dlc that adds (i think) 5 new campaigns that are each build on the base game (they include NEW campaigns, not just factions like in rome2/atilla)			"

												  Played this game for over 400 hours and loved every minute. The base game was fantastic and offered a great mix of intellectual organization and also the opprotunity for roleplay elements, the world map being large enough to keep you satisfied with whichever nation you choose as it will always provide a challenge to turn that map one colour.  The DLC was also some of the best I've played in most likely any of the Total war Series. Each capturing a different period of medieval history while also providing a range of challenges. The America campaign being one of my favorites since it shifts the atmosphere of the game so radically.  Now as if the base game and DLC wasn't enough. the community has picked every piece of meat from the bone in terms of mods for the game which allow you to play as a lord of the Seven kingdoms of Westeros, the Uruks of Isengard or even just mods that increase realism and immersion.  This game has captured my attention for over 400 hours, and its been a solid experiance the entire time.9/10			"

												For a game this old it sure is fun. I'm pretty sure it's like 10 years old at this point and it looks that way too, but it plays great. Second only to Shogun II. Seriously, Warhammer is nothing compared to this thing. Set in, of course, medieval europe. Fight in the crusades, conquer the americas, whatever you want. Call a crusade, even. Or, if you're not a fan of the church, you can kill the pope in battle and burn rome to the ground. Not even joking, the pope is a general, and if you edit some scripts you can play as him too. Look it up, it's quite simple, just most it from Non playable to unlocked and bam, play as the pope. You're welcome. Now go kill some popes, or be the pope, whatever you want.			"

												I am officially addicted to this game. Like the Football Manager series before me playing this game, it is very addictive and so much fun. Prior to purchasing Medieval II: Total War, I had only heard of the 'Rome II' edition which is the latest game in the series and the reviews didn't look too good for it, so I chose this, which I find a fascinating period in history. Anybody who is thinking of playing this game for the first time, give a couple of hours on a new campaign and once you get your head around how to play it, Medieval II: Total War is crackin' - Graphics are good, slightly dated, but the graphics aren't the sole reason you'd buy this game. I also bought the extensoin pack [Kingdoms] which allows you to pick from another variety of factions [eg Jerusalem/Crusades etc] - I can't praise the game enough. I love it and if you're looking for a great strategy game, steeped in history, this is for you. Enjoy.			"

												This was my latest game in Medieval 2: Total WarI started playing as HRE (Holy Roman Empire). Things was peaceful, all I did was conquering nearby barbarian cities, so did all my other neighbors. Suddenly Venice attacks me. Some few battles and the lines are at a stalemate. Milan attacks me and they ally with Venice. Milan is excommunicated by the Pope for attacking me. Pope declares crusade against Cairo. My heir joins a crusade and marches down through East Europe, through the holy lands and after nearly 10 years he arrives and conquers Cairo just before Poland reaches there. Pope loves me. I then conquer Alexandria so that I can create a Mediterranean fleet so that my Heir Henry the Crusader can come back to his father before he dies of old age. Pope dies of old age. Archbishop of Milan is voted as Pope. Milan is not anymore excommunicated and is now loved by Pope. Papal state declares war against me and allies with Milan and Venice. My emperor dies in Bologna. Bologna is just after conquered by Papal state with the Pope himself in the army. Suddenly there is no secure land to land my new Emperor Henry the Crusader. Pope starts a new crusade. Again it is against Cairo, only this time it's under my control... 2 years after a Jihad is started, also against Cairo. My hatred for the newly vided Pope is great. I use more years and create an even bigger fleet so that the venetian fleet can't outmatch it. I then send Emperor Henry the Crusader and his crusader army (the ones that conquered Cairo and Alexandria). Because of little troops after my emperor left Alexandria, it rebels and all surviving troops are sent to Cairo. Some years after Emperor Henry the Crusader lands outside of Rome and attacks the Pope himself. Emperor Henry the Crusader kills the Pope with his crusader army. 11/10 Best game ever <3			"

												-Be Playing Medieval II:Total War as England, get an alliance with France, Spain and Poland/Germany-Brothels are keeping my morale in my cities somewhat steady after conquering all of Britain and Sweden despite constant Rebel armies appearing for no real reason (REBEL SCUM)-France keeps asking for money, politely tell them to go♥♥♥♥♥♥off and settle for giving them a part of Sweden.-France give me the seen..no contact for a few turns.-We team up upon getting attacked by Portugal and attack Rebel bases and Portugal together (Screw you Portugal and your infinite Navy)-Think to myself ""France is okay after all""-France then turns around along with Spain and Poland and the new German Empire and declares on me.-Decide to not go down like a b!tch and lay siege to Paris, get kicked from the catholic church over and over again for defending myself.-After 90ish turns I have wiped out the Germans (dont know what the factions called), SEEMINGLY all of the French (Traitor Scum). Then Annihalate most of Venice, Spain, Sicily and Portugal as well as Russia but lucky for them i'm low on troops and funds at this point despite owning all of West Europe and a part of East Europe.-SUDDENLY, the Mongols invade. Due to my absolute war machine I have dismantled and crippled most of the AI's in Europe leaving a huge power vacuum.-7 turns after the Mongols showed up they have invaded Poland, Russia and anyone east/southeast of Italy asides from Egypt and Turkey have been destroyed.-10 turns after the Mongols showed up they have massacred my forces that were spread too thin.-Rush to get all my troops from France,England and North Italy to stop the onslaught.-SUDDENLY it turns out France had been hiding in North Africa all along and they send troops up via ships (Was too busy with the Mongols to even notice)-France proceeds to pretty much screw me up with cannons and I get tea bagged for a few more turns before turning off the Laptop and crying tears of anger as I see the French throwing baguettes at my dying ecosystem (RIP Britain and Ireland 02/01/16 - 06/01/16).10/10Would get fisted by France and the Mongols again.

												Medieval 2: Total War is one of the best games from the Total War series. The game itself is really in-depth, and the strategy is so immersive and complex. Even the campaign map has hidden strategies for managing the diplomacy of your kingdom, which makes the seemingly uncalled for attacks from neighboring nations look a lot less random. The battlefields and units are designed very well and the whole game looks very polished. Battle strategies can be somewhat complex, but once you get the hang of them you will feel like a 5 star general. Not to mention the fact that you can even modify the game to play as the papal states, which has influence over most European factions. I haven't tried any big mods for this game yet, but I've heard about many of them, so it's nice to know that there are options out there in the unlikely event that I ever get bored with the main game. If you're looking to buy anything on Steam, this is a game you should seriously consider adding to your library. Happy warmongering!			"

												This game is very fun. Im a huge fan of the total war series and this is  a great title and probably better than rome 2 or some of the other newer titles. Great combat, awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet, but what really make this game for me is the mods. The mods are the best, making total overhauls or just small adjustments. Its what makes this game long lasting for me. My favourite would be age of Petty Kings,  A Game of thrones mod. Great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls. The generals also have alot of character as they evolve over    your playthrough. The spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough.  Also on my desktop which has windows eight the game crashes every time i open it, be carefull about that.Recomend you get this, fantastic game and replay value over 10000			"

												Despite it's age, this game still holds up today for those that like epic 3d real time battles or grand strategy games.  Plus, thanks to this, it's usually cheap, and it should run well on most pcs/laptops.  Though I feel I should warn prospective buyers the ai isn't allways perfect, the end game can get bogged down and it's graphics have long been superseded, considering it's price and scale, it's hard not to recommend.

												This game is a turn-based strategy game set in the Medieval Era(1080-1530). Build up your faction with armies and buildings and become stronger as time goes on. Play through the Crusades, Experience Everything from Peaseants to Knights, and Gunpowder units to Unique Archers. This game has a great feel for it and it provides historical descriptions on all soldiers and buildings if you want to improve your History. I recommened this game because you can spend hours of great fun and concentration. Fight battles and build castles and conquer all Europe!			"

												Um dos mais famosos títulos da franquia Total War, é esse lindo e maravilhoso, Medieval II. Eles conseguiram evoluir e muito dos jogo anteriores, adicionaram muitos features no modo diplomacia, além das formações e unidades no modo de batalha.A única coisa que eu acho muito sacanagem, é colocarem poucas facções no jogo original como jogável e da os mesmos números de facções nos outros jogos, Crusades Campaing, Americas, Britannia e Teutonics.Mas no geral é um jogo muito sólido onde você vai gastar muitas horas neles tentando conquistar o máximo possível.

												YES!!! This game is a most definite 4 thumbs up! If you love strategy and have always wanted to test your skills then here is the PERFECT game for you! There's so many campaigns and each one for each faction is differernt in its own way. Also, each faction has a few perks that none of the others have; for instamce: English, Longbowmen; French, Courageous Knights; HRE (Holy Roman Empire), has average everything; so on and so forth. There's so many different factions that if I wrote down all their strengths and weaknesses it would take me about an hour to do so! And even on the lowest graphics setting it still doesn't look half bad. It also has historical battles like Agincourt, Hastings, I think it has Stamford Bridge but not for sure. Please don't hesitate to buy it because of the price its well worth it! (in fact, i bought it for $5 while it was on sale :D) I hope to see you on guys!Please play this game guys you'd love it especially if you download the Kingdoms DLC whick isn't needed or anything but it adds a lot more campaigns to be played.Also, this game alerts you to events that are happening in the world (like the Black Plague or the Mongolian invasion). Thus forcing you to respond to the changes in your environment by either building more defensive structures and training more troops in one area or maneuvering soldiers to another position. I absolutely love this game it is one of my all-time favorites.			"

												It's really no wonder this game is considered the best Total War ever made.With a large faction selection, variety of units to choose from, and a notepad file to edit so that you can play as the Papal State and crush all the heathens, it's clear that Medieval 2 was made in the prime time of the Total War series, it boasts a brilliant upgrade system with miles of things to choose from.I was wondering whether to buy this game due to the fact that it's old, but it honestly doesn't matter how old it is, this game is the epitome of what a Total War game should be. It's a shame that the latest games are 95% money making schemes.Buy this game. You would have to be literally insane not to buy it.			"

The campaign map is turn based, but all battles are fought in real time.  when this game came out it was cutting edge and the battles were jaw dropping, they still look allright in 2015 but are far from stunning.  if it is on sale and you prefer the medieval setting then this is the totatl war for you, otherwise maybe get shogun.

												Bought this game for 2.50 for the mods, play this game with mods exclusively. The base game is kind of meh in my opinion, but its value is in the dozens of full conversion mods that do everything from historical earth to a game that features Shrek vs Gungans. Its flawed, its old, its buggy, but it’s a canvas for new experiences. I've played this game for like 500 hours (this used to be 2 games before they merged the expansion into DLC for the base game) and the ONLY reason why is because of mods. You'll find some truly creative stuff out there, and no other TW game has the extensive modding community after this one. "

												For a game this old it sure is fun. I'm pretty sure it's like 10 years old at this point and it looks that way too, but it plays great. Second only to Shogun II. Seriously, Warhammer is nothing compared to this thing. Set in, of course, medieval europe. Fight in the crusades, conquer the americas, whatever you want. Call a crusade, even. Or, if you're not a fan of the church, you can kill the pope in battle and burn rome to the ground. Not even joking, the pope is a general, and if you edit some scripts you can play as him too. Look it up, it's quite simple, just most it from Non playable to unlocked and bam, play as the pope. You're welcome. Now go kill some popes, or be the pope, whatever you want.			"

												Such a great game. Well worth the money, well worth getting the Kingdoms DLC with it, just adds more to do really. Honestly, I would say this is the best out of the Total War series. I like the feature of being able to put units under AI command, have the AI take control of an army during a battle, though the AI is bad, it is still a handy feature if you want to witness giant battles. It is a shame they didn't include it in the later games. I love being able to buid up armies and attack huge castles with mighty siege equipment, it is just awesome.The game lacks some things, but it is old. There can be stressful moments, where the AI acts like a complete idiot, you cannot position your troops where you want to position them, some slight issues, but the game is still awesome and playable. Has some great mods out there for it, so you can go and experience them too.Highly recommend it.			"

												Played this game since its release in 2006, bought a digital copy via steam when my old CD stopped working.You'll like this game if you like history. It certainly isn't ""perfectly accurate"" (is anything?), but it tries a lot harder than most games. At least, at the outset. The point of this series is to screw with history. I once played as the Almoravids of al-Andalus and crossed the Atlantic, converting the Americas to Islam. I once played as the Byzantine Empire and transplanted the entire dynasty to sub-Saharan Africa, watching as the rest of the world was eclipsed by the Mongol tide.The other great thing about this game is the mods. The best ones I know of are Third Age, Rage of the Dark Gods, and Hyrule. You can find one to suit almost any fancy. I just got done ravaging the Shire and Rivendell as Isengard.Seriously, pick up this game if you have $20 to spare. You won't be disappointed.			"

												If you have a short attention span or get frustrated really easy then this is NOT the game for you. However, when you get passed the learning curve its a really addictive game.  There are moments where it feels like it stutters, after computer moves for one. The camera controls i found really annoying to get used to, i keep using wasd when its numpad for movement but you can scroll with the mouse to an extent. Once your used to this its fine. There is no better feeling than crushing an army of 900 men when you only have 450 yourself.  This is one game i can see me poking me head back into for a while, there are many aspects to manage at once and i was never a fan of turn based strategy untill i took a gamble and brought it to see what this total war genre was all about.This is one game a recommend for a sunday afternoon when you have alot of time on your hands.

Historical battles such as the Battle of Agincourt,Pavia,Otumba,Hastings and ofcourse the Battle of  Arsuf2. Epic Sound system,supports EAX 4.03. Detailed Campaign map4. The Game Mechanics5. It also features the Crusade era,Pope,Spanish Conquest of Latin America etcRecommanded game!!			"

												While this game may be almost 10 years old, it's still a fantastic game and IMO one of the best games of the Total War series.  While there are a few bugs with the AI sometimes (they'll be blocked by a simple wall sometimes...) they aren't major and don't really detract from the gameplay enough to make an impact.  If you're a fan of more war-oriented RTS games, I can't recomend this one enough.			"

												I wish they would keep making Total War games like this, the new ones are getting bad. I really hope CA and Sega have read reviews on Attila and Rome 2 cause I really hope they get their act together. I have prepurchased Warhammer Total War and im scared ive wasted $80. Ive been playing Total War games for 4 years now and I shall send a very strongly worded Email to CA and Sega if Warhammer is another addition to the list of flawed Total War games.			"

												Medieval 2 stands the test of time. I've been playing this game long before it was ever on my steam account (which I believe I added it on here 7 years ago? Could be wrong) but even to this day I find myself playing it for hours on end. The base game itself is excellent for casual playing. If you want to sit back and relax as the English and build up your settlements on the British Isles before sweeping through France, you can. If you wish to conquer the Easetern world as the Egyptians, you can. If you wish to unite Italy under one banner long before it ever was in the history books, you can.On top of this, the Kingdoms expansion allows for not only 4 more campaigns, but for an excellent modding community. Third Age: Total War is perhaps the greatest mod for any game I have ever witnessed and it accounts for over half the hours I've put into M2:TW.Could not reccomend this game enough, it's a must have for your Steam library.

												I've played Shogun TW, Medieval TW, Medieval 2 TW, Empire TW and Shogun 2 TW and this game by far is the best of them all. It's one of the best strategy games I've ever played. I'm speaking from a strictly SP POV though. The game is pretty old now but it still looks quite nice with the settings turned up.I've never been able to figure out diplomacy in this game so I always just end up making a lot of enemies and crushing them by brute force. I'm not sure if that's my play style or a flaw in the game's diplomacy system though.The AI is decently intelligent both on the campaign map and on the battlefield.I absolutely hate and despise naval battles in all TW games after this one. It's one of the main reasons I haven't been able to enjoy any newer TW titles. Naval battles in Medieval 2 are simple. You build a fleet and all battles are auto resolved. Easy, fast and out of the way so you can concentrate on the really fun stuff - land battles and expansion. I don't know if I'm alone in thinking that naval battles are trash and have ruined the newer TW games, but you definitely don't have to worry about that in this game.There are a lot of factions you can play and they all have small differences but you can generalize all of them into 4 super factions that share a lot of similar traits and units: western Europe, eastern Europe, north Africa and middle east. Playing through the campaign as different factions is fun and rewarding.The bottom line is this game is pretty amazing and you should definitely give it a try.			"

												I highly recommend this game. Whether you want to take over countries with diplomacy (which tends to not help), or you take them over with pure brute strength. I find myself zooming in to watch as the enemy horsemen try in vain to get through my lines of spearmen, and watch the enemy retreat away like cowards as they have discovered that their general is lying on the ground dead. It is a perfect balance of need for money and need for military power. Overall though this game is quite old it is still one of the best games I own.			"

Out of all the games, Medieval in my opinion has limitless amounts of fun packed into one tight amazing game. The base game is alright, a few bugs here or there but its the mods that definitely make up for it. Third Age Total War and Stainless Steel are some of the most amazing mods for this game and will keep you playing for more than 100+ hours if your into it. I give this game a 6/10 without mods and a 10/10 with mods.			"

												An excellent game of stratagy and fun to play on a rainy sunday afternoon. It is my personal favorite out of all the total war games as it comes without the somewhat irritating complexities of the games and expansions added more recently such as Rome II and Shogun II. Although these may arguably make the games slightly more realistic to play, I find Medieval II much easier and more enjoyable to play as although it may lack the nitty gritty aspects of realism included in the later games, it still retains the brainturning strategic nececity which we all love as well as having a fairly decent AI to challenge you.

												The Total War game that had everything. The newer iterations of the series keep removing features and depth to the game.Obviously this is not a perfect game, the engine can only run in 1 CPU core and that really hurts when having a huge battle with unlimited units on the field.It has lots of exploits and bugs, the pikemen are basically useless. The vanilla AI has some serious issues with pathfinding, especially when you select a group of units and try to move them in a siege battle.Now, most of this issues, except of course those caused by the engine itself are addressed by the excellent modding community this game STILL has. Go browse the Total War Center website and see by yourself the mods this game has to offer. Recommended at full price.			"

Is got 6 years but is still not old and is gonna resist more time because :               -The campaign is totaly great it got a lot of diplomacy, a lot of wars and I like the thing with the pope and the crusades.The hotseats are amazing because you can play a campaign with friends not only online battles.              -The units are great I like the factions but i recomand for the future game to have naval battles like rome 2 total war or other titles.         Note 10/10 The Creative Assembly you did an amazing job !!			"

												My favorite game of all time, and one of the best, if not THE best, Total War titles.It doesn't have the improved politics, economy, replenishemnt, and public order systems of the later titles, but it M2 has it where it counts, visceral battles, free-form campaigns, amazing soundtrack, and a lot of personality that the later titles have lost. Before I had the steam version I logged 600 hours on this game, and that was WITHOUT mods. The major strength is that you can pretty much play the campaigns any way you want with minimal interference from the ""story"" , unlike Napoleon, R2, and Attila. You create your own history instead of being pushed into following actual history.The AI might be a bit dumb and it has its fair sure of bugs and glitches, but there's no DLC.Supposedly the latest steam version doesn't let you use certain mods, hasn't been an issue for me. I'd recommend two mods that I always use: Retrofit (takes kindoms features into the M2 grand campaign) and Crimson Tide (lots more blood and dirt).			"

												Battle : Great. Compare to other historical games which describes the battle. It is good. You can command your troopps and get your triumph by using your clever tactics. I can say that Battle is the greatest factor in this game. Naval Battle : Like Rome Total War, It is Auto-Battle. It is quite despend on your fortune :D Diplomacy : If you expect it like Crusader Kings II, You will be disappointed. Unlike the Crusader Kings II, It hasn't the concept that Vassal like Crusader Kings II. All Your realm is yours. But You can vassalize other countries and use the papacy by increasing the relation between pope and you if you are playing as Catholic faction. You can assassinate agents, generals and Kings. But Only way to get rid of your inferior general is sending him to the Battlefield like the case of David and Uriah in Bible.Management : Build the building and just managing the tax rate and subdue damn rebel scums. And burn the heretics, witches.Reality : Not Good Reality.			"

Maybe it is because rome 2 total war did not satisfy me. Anyway, play this game, you will be pleasured.			"

												my favorite total war game in the series.  you'll spend hours fighting, conquering and most importantly having fun. the game is  full of tiny details that seem to never make it in contemporary titles. the sound effects and music give a truly medieval feeling and the battles are simply epic, from grand decisive battles with full stacks, to minor skirmishes with small groups of soldiers. this game is the peak of the total war games and combines the best features that were removed along with excellence that inspires players to continue to play the newer titles. if you were a fan of the newer or older games in the total war series, or if you are looking for a fun new game you haven't played before, I highly suggest you pick this up.

												I recommend this game to anyone who loves the Medieval era. In this game you will have to manage your economy as well as satisfying your people's religious needs, and the popes obviously. Managing your relationships with other countries plays a vital role in this game unless you want to end up balls deep in war with powerful factions.The game is: easy to master, fun, competitive and quite hard for someone who prefers fast-paced games. However just like any other game it has its flaws. Just one actually; Ai pathfinding is clunky and buggy, but besides this minor flaw the game is.........................50/10 would spam peasants again			"

												I am finally writing a review about this game.  I did play this game for many hours(it reset after deleting the game due to mod problems) and don't believe adding another review will help an older and known game as such.  However, I do write this review in hopes to provide a small aid to communities that are trying to revert Total War series to what it was.  I love Rome II and liked Attila.  The graphcis, battles and the settings were all to my likings.  However, they seem to lack so much compared to Medieval II.  The campaign in Medieval II are so much more dramatic and rich with random events that all together weave a great story.  The Crusade and the Pope, Jihad, and Americas made the campaign much more interesting than just alliance wars.  I can sit here and list all the features that I like better than the newer games.  The newers games do have impressive visuals and smoother combat, as Medieval units sometimes seem completely mindless of the battle.  As far as the advantage of the newer games go, that is it.  Overall, Medieval II has much more culture varieties, random happenings to keep the faction instable, and more events to drive the campaign and make it feel fresh even after several turns.  When the next historical Total War comes out, I believe it should model itself more like Medieval II than the newer games.			"

												My friend Kept the bulk of his filthy lowborn Braveheart Wannabe forces in the town centre so I surrounded it and charged in with the glorious British Super Whale Knight Heavy Assualt Squad(If you get that reference you can have a cookie)! What a foolish tactic-- Hey what are those flaming arrows doing?""OH GOD THE CITY IS ON FIRE!, MY FRIEND IS ON FIRE!, AND SO IS MY FACE!, EVERYONE PANIC AND RUN!"" -- My supposed elite force as archers rain destruction all over the angles of retreat and through the slits of my Knights' helmets10/10 Would be outsmarted by disposable Peasant bait again and set on fire for my Hubris, A truly SHAMEFURDISPR-- Oh wrong game :PWhat I am trying to say is:+ Tactics are the core of this game, a smart commander can win with nearly any competent force composition as opposed to just buying top tier unit spam.+ Great Political/Kingdom Management System outside of battles.+ Ungodly 22 factions, each with their own nuances and tactics to master, but still realistic.+Beautifully done melee and archery combat, the fights are fully animated with their own brutal kills and flying corpses, which is kind of a must for a medieval RTS- Learning Curve is not for the faint of heart- Games take a very long time, especially when good players can fight each other to a stand still- Sometimes its unclear how quickly your units break, especially in some circumstances where they seem like they will win, but the AI is generally very good and this along with a few smattering of bugs (Not on Rome TW2 Level) make up a small portion of the Game Overall.9/10 one of the best in the series next to Shogun and won't require any too fancy a PC to run me thinks hMMM? So what is your excuse hmm?, picking this up, you should be! -- Yoda "

												Excellent game. WIll keep you interested and have fun for days. Even if its not the latest release in Total War series it is still as good as any current titles of this genre. There are some secondary areas which could have been designed to require more active attention from players resulting in more depth. But as the title says its all about WAR and you get plenty of that in detail.Having more information regarding how different types of troops compare against each other would have been helpfull but I guess discovering that on your own the hard way on the battlefield instead of just the unit card stats adds to the challenge.

												Medieval II: Total War has to be my current favorite of the Total War series. I'll get the bad parts out of the way first...Issuing commands to units can sometimes be clunky, such as cavalry not pursuing broken enemies or simply dancing around them without actually killing or capturing any, or only a minor percentage of soldiers actually complying with your order to march, run or charge. Moving troops through settlements can be irritating as well as they often decide against using a straight path leading to the centre because it's slightly more narrow than the normal pathways.The AI in the campaign also behaves with very little forward thinking, even on the hardest difficulty, being more than willing to break off an alliance and trade rights for the sake of attacking a settlement that is lightly defended, or to blockade an empty port for some extra money, oblivious to the outcome of their actions. Diplomacy can be irritating in later turns, especially against enemy factions, even when they are completely outmatched they will stubbornly refuse a ceasefire even at the cost of total defeat, all because of a war that started with a minor battle over some trivial port or minor town. The chivalry/ dread levels are only of real use for role play, if you're just going for world domination it's completely pointless. Finally the agents skills don't appear to be as relevant to successful missions as they should be, I myself have experienced a surprisingly high number of failed acquisitions, spy infiltrations, etc despite the chance of success being at 95%So what do I actually LIKE about this game? For one. the time period. Western Europe is struggling to recover from the fall of Western Rome, the surviving Eastern Empire struggles to reclaim it's losses while fending off the strength of the Turks, the Reconquista in Iberia, the Crusades to reclaim the lands that saw the birth of Christianity and so much more.Unit types still follow patterns of weaknesses/ strengths similar to the system in Rome TW but has been adapted to fit medieval warfare very well. Knights, while they are of a high quality, are not overpowered super-soldiers and in the early campaign their costly upkeep makes them a less appealing choice. I also really admire how weapon and armour upgrades are actually visible on the soldiers now. While weapon upgrades are limited to bronze and armours varying from Gold to non-existent, it adds more realism to the situation. The type of armour also varies depending on the type of unit - Light or Heavy.The campaign, while irritating at times, does have some feeling of authenticity to it. The AI behaves in a way that leaves you wondering ""what are you thinking?"" which matches the unpredictable nature of any human, often acting in a way that leaves outsiders confused at their motivations or goals. Diplomacy can be tricky as even establishing trade with a faction, for example France, can lead to a rival of that faction becoming hostile toward you. If you want to play this game diplomatically then I wish you luck because politics in this campaign are very delicate and complicated right from the get go. The campaign continues to flow forward with new developments always happening, new technologies from Asia to learn and master, new locations to go to and discover, new enemies to face or evade and the constant concerns of managing your country to adapt and survive an ever changing world.Then there's the inclusion of settlement types - cultural and military hubs. Instead of building armies inside your own cities you now focus the military in castles while cities are used for finance, religion and more cultural acitivities. Managing which territories will house a castle/ city puts a new twist into the campaign in terms of growing your own faction, espionage and war in general. I.e. Taking enemy castles weakens their military but frees up their economy, taking enemy cities weakens their economy but leaves their military more intact.To sum up, this game has my favorite campaign of the series thus far and battles, while not my favorite, can still be entertaining and still presents the same amount of challenge of previous installments. I would rate this game 8/10 very good, not perfect but I would recommend it for any fan of of the series and any fan of turn based strategy.			"

												I bought this game originally by the DVD, the gold edition. It was the first Total War game I'd ever played. It made me play Rome: Total War, and then I explored the rest of the series. I fell in love with this game at first sight. I found this game by a youtube series that was really interactive. It was amazing. I found the setting amazing, I found the ability to forge my own history amazing. Commanding your troops as you use tactics or sheer numbers and brute force to bring victory. I think this is what got me in to History.  It is an excellent game, especially if you value gameplay over age.			"

												""What is best in life?""""To crush God's enemies,to see them converted before you,and to hear the lamentations of their Imams.""-Conan the Barbarian (said during his stint as a mercenary for the Pope)Seriously though, this game is still awesome, even after all these years later! In fact, M2:TW just celebrated its 10th birthday, this November 2016! And its still easily one of the best, if not the best, of the Total War series!Improving upon, and outdoing most everything in the previous M:TW and Rome:TW (whose engine it uses) games, Medieval II was a triumph of RTS when it was first released. And a year later, it only got better with the best Total War expansion to date, Kingdoms. And thats not even considering all the many wonderful fan-made mods this title has available, thus extending its greatness even more so! Even fantasy lands are game! Want to wage war in Middle-Earth? There's a mod for that! Feel like fighting for The Elder Scrolls' Tamriel? There's a mod for that! How about waylaying the Warhammer world? Well, actually, that game was released earlier this year. But..there's still mods that predate that!Caution: this game is a time consumer! You can EASILY spend 50+ hours on just one campaign alone, and given that there are 17 playable factions available (eventually) in just the base game alone, and that there is NO END DATE for any campaign (only an end to the campaign objectives, but the game still goes on, so you can play a medieval kingdom all the way into the 21st century and beyond, take that modernity! #ProgressIsForSuckers), you can rack up a kingdom's worth of time spent on this game! Rome wasn't built in a day, they say, but it sure was completed faster than this game is!Whether it be conquering your back-stabbing neighbors (all the italian powers, always!!), managing your empire (where is the govenator when you need him?), retaking the Holy Land from the infidel (ya jerks!), converting the heathen (come on fellas, its ""A.D."" now, get with the program already!), or making a heroic last stand for all of Christendom against the rapacious onslaught of the Golden Horde (which is what you get when you don't tip the chinese food delivery guy on one too many occasions), yes sir, Medieval II has it all. Even the possibility of having one of your generals get so cuckholded by his nakedly adulterous wife, that he loses it, becomes the most shameless man on earth, and shacks up with a tranny, thus bringing eternal shame to your kingdom! As I said, Medieval II has it all. Even things the developers really should have just left alone...*ahem*.If your a strategy gaming fan, there are certain games in the genre you just have to have played in your lifetime, like Age of Empires II: Age of Kings. This is that kind of game. Don't miss out. And here's to hoping that the developers go back on their ""we don't make games with the number '3' in their titles"" statement, and, once they are done with (the also fantastic, well-worth-your-time) Warhammer: Total War, they start developing Medieval III. Deus Vult, Creative Assembly, Deus Vult!			"

TL;DRI got to execute the Pope, declare a Crusade on the Holy Roman Empire, and conquer the world and spread Milanese Italian fashion under the flag of Duke Bernardo the Mad, son of Duke Giorgio the Cuckold.9/10A MUST HAVE MEDIEVAL GENOCIDE SIMULATORPersonal InsightsThere's a myriad of sources out there that can cover the intricacies of gameplay far better than I could, so I'll try not to waste your time reading my review, when you could be in Medieval II fighting off 8 invading factions simultaneously, and outsmarting every enemy general on the battlefield.The GoodOutmaneuver enemy armies of better equipped knights and professional crossbowmen and win by epic, narrow margins with your  town militia and peasant archers in the early game, then laugh when you yourself raise armies of knights, and crush peasant armies with K/D ratios of 1:100 in the late game when you have so much excessive gold, you find yourself building Huge Cathedrals and Brothels in every corner of your empire just to drain your bloated treasury.There is no better feeling than when you've crushed all other factions except Denmark, Russia, Turkey, and Egypt, who then decide to form a super-alliance to prevent you from conquering the 20 remaining territories on the map, which you then do anyway.Unrest growing in a city? Raise taxes to Very High, move your entire garrison outside the city, and then wait. When the city rebels in 3-5 turns, besiege the city, kill the rebel soldiers, and then exterminate the populace to reestablish peace in your empire.Tired of using battering rams? Send 5 spies into an enemy castle for guaranteed access to Didney Worl! Laugh as the gates open as your troops surge through, and kill the French King to punish them for their crime of daring to proclaim French cuisine as superior to Italian.Artillery Elephants.When your general kills enough prisoners of war and exterminates the populations of enough cities, he can earn the epithet, ""The Butcher"". With 10 stars of command and 10 skulls of dread, Bindello the Butcher held off the Mongol invaders with little more than armies of Spear Militia and Peasant Crossbowmen. Unfortunately for him, Bindello the Butcher eventually died in an earthquake when I sent him to retire on the Iberian Peninsula.The BadVanilla AI sometimes fails to attack you with large enough armies. Vanilla AI sometimes lets you siege their capital for several turns, even though they have a full army nearby that could attack your besieging army, and break the siege.Executing Prisoners makes your faction ""Untrustworthy"". Why should enforcing capital punishment have any effect on trust?Vanilla AI will break a 50+ year old alliance to attack one of your lowest income villages, even though your army, wealth, and territories outnumber theirs by a ratio of 6:1.Vanilla AI will declare war by blockading one of your ports, and then failing to attack or do anything else for the next 80 years.Although Battle AI is mostly competent, if not brilliant, there have been a few scenarios in which opposing generals appear brain dead. If you siege a castle, and the AI has external reinforcements, the reinforcements have a decent chance of just camping outside the castle, and letting you slaughter its defenders without trying to aid their own faction.OnlineOnline experiences are limited to battles in the base game, although it appears you can run hotseat campaigns in the expansions. My experience with online multiplayer as been extremely limited, as my first online match was this year, more than a decade after this game was released. Nevertheless, I have been extremely satisfied with the handful of matches that I have had. Be warned though; in 2017 and beyond, it will be hard, if not impossible, to join an open match. Join some Medieval II groups, or tell your friends to buy this game if you want the most out of the online battles.ModsMy recommendations for modding the game? Play the game totally Vanilla for at least one long Grand Campaign, and then think carefully about what you would like changed. I put in over 200 hours in the Vanilla game before deciding to provide some tweaks to add some more options for gameplay. My current mods include Ultimate AI for the Campaign AI, and about 8 changes to the game files. Those changes are:Movement Speed increase for agents (but not armies)Increasing Age limit for Generals, so my 10 Star Generals stop dying at age 60.Increased Garrisons (free upkeep slots) for Cities and CastlesTrainable GeneralsStronger Walls/Gates, to make sieges a bigger challenge.Added Schiltrom (defense formation) to more unitsMisc. Diplomacy Fixes (easier Military Access)Misc. Mission FixesClosing ThoughtsMy experience with the Total War series actually began with the original Medieval: Total War. Medieval II has proven to be an improvement over nearly every asset of that game, and is actually compatible with modern hardware. If you like any other of the games in the Total War series, fictional Medieval scenarios, RTS's, or Eurocentricism simulators, I strongly recommend this game.TL;DRAs Milan, my faction was excommunicated for failing to stop annexing the territories of my Catholic neighbors. The Pope declared a Crusade to take back Rome, which I had annexed from the Papal States several turns earlier. Seeing as I controlled all of Europe except for England at that point, I decided to hunker down at Rome, and let the lone English Crusading army actually reach its intended destination. At Rome, I had a full garrison of high quality Milanese militia, led by three generals. Outside of Rome, I had placed another full army ouside the gates as reinforcements. When the English Crusaders arrived, I was somewhat worried, as the English had brought proper Knights and Armored Swordsmen, whereas I had Spear Militia and Cavalry Militia. Nevertheless, I waited for the English assault. Sure enough, the English began their assault on the walls of Rome with catapults and trebuchets. Yet, they never managed to see Rome's interior. My Cavalry Militia sallied out of the gates, and killed the artillery crew, while my reinforcements attacked the would-be Crusaders from the rear. The English Crusading army was destroyed, and as equal and just retaliation, I annexed the entire British Isles and exterminated their citizens for good measure.9/10This game is Machiavelli's wet dream.

The number of times I have clicked the ""End Turn"" button ""for the last time""...   (sigh)The award could have gone to nearly any Total War game really.			"

												Medieval II: Total War has to be my current favorite of the Total War series. I'll get the bad parts out of the way first...Issuing commands to units can sometimes be clunky, such as cavalry not pursuing broken enemies or simply dancing around them without actually killing or capturing any, or only a minor percentage of soldiers actually complying with your order to march, run or charge. Moving troops through settlements can be irritating as well as they often decide against using a straight path leading to the centre because it's slightly more narrow than the normal pathways.The AI in the campaign also behaves with very little forward thinking, even on the hardest difficulty, being more than willing to break off an alliance and trade rights for the sake of attacking a settlement that is lightly defended, or to blockade an empty port for some extra money, oblivious to the outcome of their actions. Diplomacy can be irritating in later turns, especially against enemy factions, even when they are completely outmatched they will stubbornly refuse a ceasefire even at the cost of total defeat, all because of a war that started with a minor battle over some trivial port or minor town. The chivalry/ dread levels are only of real use for role play, if you're just going for world domination it's completely pointless. Finally the agents skills don't appear to be as relevant to successful missions as they should be, I myself have experienced a surprisingly high number of failed acquisitions, spy infiltrations, etc despite the chance of success being at 95%So what do I actually LIKE about this game? For one. the time period. Western Europe is struggling to recover from the fall of Western Rome, the surviving Eastern Empire struggles to reclaim it's losses while fending off the strength of the Turks, the Reconquista in Iberia, the Crusades to reclaim the lands that saw the birth of Christianity and so much more.Unit types still follow patterns of weaknesses/ strengths similar to the system in Rome TW but has been adapted to fit medieval warfare very well. Knights, while they are of a high quality, are not overpowered super-soldiers and in the early campaign their costly upkeep makes them a less appealing choice. I also really admire how weapon and armour upgrades are actually visible on the soldiers now. While weapon upgrades are limited to bronze and armours varying from Gold to non-existent, it adds more realism to the situation. The type of armour also varies depending on the type of unit - Light or Heavy.The campaign, while irritating at times, does have some feeling of authenticity to it. The AI behaves in a way that leaves you wondering ""what are you thinking?"" which matches the unpredictable nature of any human, often acting in a way that leaves outsiders confused at their motivations or goals. Diplomacy can be tricky as even establishing trade with a faction, for example France, can lead to a rival of that faction becoming hostile toward you. If you want to play this game diplomatically then I wish you luck because politics in this campaign are very delicate and complicated right from the get go. The campaign continues to flow forward with new developments always happening, new technologies from Asia to learn and master, new locations to go to and discover, new enemies to face or evade and the constant concerns of managing your country to adapt and survive an ever changing world.Then there's the inclusion of settlement types - cultural and military hubs. Instead of building armies inside your own cities you now focus the military in castles while cities are used for finance, religion and more cultural acitivities. Managing which territories will house a castle/ city puts a new twist into the campaign in terms of growing your own faction, espionage and war in general. I.e. Taking enemy castles weakens their military but frees up their economy, taking enemy cities weakens their economy but leaves their military more intact.To sum up, this game has my favorite campaign of the series thus far and battles, while not my favorite, can still be entertaining and still presents the same amount of challenge of previous installments. I would rate this game 8/10 very good, not perfect but I would recommend it for any fan of of the series and any fan of turn based strategy.			"

												Quite a good base game. 9.2/10Pros-Very balanced. Good for multiplayer battles.-Great, intense battles!-Large map-Graphics are pretty good for the time.-Can be challenging if you want it to be.-Doing crusades can be fun.-Merchants can help you financially.-Burning heretics.-Discovery of America gives a new objective to the base campaign (extermination of the Native Americans)-Factions generally  follow historical accuracy.-As goes with most Total War games you can do whatever you want.-The ability to take over the Catholic church.-Variation of tower defenses and boats.-Siege battles are fun.-Relations between factions.-Cool cutscenes -When talking through diplomacy the characters you speak to use the accents that would be typical to their country. Cons-Autocompletion isn't great unless you are on Easy difficulty.-Most factions stay loyal to the Catholic church despite the hatred of the Catholic church in this time period. Meaning there is no Protestant formation. (This is more of a nitpick though)-Can't play as the Mongols or Timurids without messing with the game files :(-Inquisitors. Way too many Inquisitors.-If you want to do something fun the Pope hates whatever it is.-Diplomacy can be odd sometimes-Crusade targets are hard to get to. The soldiers also will desert if you don't get to the target fast enough.-Rival merchants stealing resources.-When invading the Americas you are limited to the Yucatán Peninsula, South eastern north america, and Brazil. (In the DLC you can do much more in a specific Americas campaign) -The Pope often gets mad. Generally after he asks you to do a very hard and stupid task.			"

												I have been playing this game well before it was put on Steam. I'm actually really happy its on Steam now since I lost my old CD keys, this game is quite a gem. This Total War game is the one I compare every Total War game to and none of them ever come close to this one in terms of fun and replayability. The seige battles for both attack and defence in this game feel genuinely better than the ones in future installments. They are satisfying to play, whether you are taking down the walls with catapults/cannons, storming a citadel with seige equipment like rams and ladders, or just defending against invading forces storming your city.The units in this game matter, but its how you use them that makes for the most interesting battles. Clearly when the professional (late game) units go up against peasants and such, especially in an open field, we know who is ultimately going to lose (in most cases), but with right combination of units, including peasants, and the right kind of placement, you can easily defending a settlement against even the most advanced/elite units. This also depends on difficulty too as the AI can be vicious if given the chance.I aslo enjoyed the religion system in this game, but mainly for the catholic factions. The Papal states are not a minor faction and they will wreck you with not only their own units (which are pretty powerful) but all of Christendom will come together to crusade your face in should you get excommunicated or if the pope doesn't favor your faction nearly as much as the others (meaning he'll look the other way for a bit). For what it is, it is a complex, but straightforward system that can either be used to your advantage or used against you. The modding community for this game is pretty awesome too. Hyrule: Total War and Stainless Steel are both mods I love and they work so well with this game that it gives me endless hours of entertainment even to this day. The game still has a rather active modding community for something of its age, which is great since it just makes a great game even better. Finally, the game is just all around fun. How you play this game can easily make for a great time or just a great way to waste time in general all the while being entertained. I wish Sega and the Total War series in general looked back to this game and Rome: Total War (the first one) to see what they got so right about their game series and just put that + whatever improvements and mechanics (like naval battles) into the game. If they were to make a modern day version of this game with everything that made this game great, I would buy it in a heartbeat. But in the meantime, there is this game, so if you are looking to pick it up, do so and enjoy!			"

Play the game totally Vanilla for at least one long Grand Campaign, and then think carefully about what you would like changed. I put in over 200 hours in the Vanilla game before deciding to provide some tweaks to add some more options for gameplay. My current mods include Ultimate AI for the Campaign AI, and about 8 changes to the game files. Those changes are:Movement Speed increase for agents (but not armies)Increasing Age limit for Generals, so my 10 Star Generals stop dying at age 60.Increased Garrisons (free upkeep slots) for Cities and CastlesTrainable GeneralsStronger Walls/Gates, to make sieges a bigger challenge.Added Schiltrom (defense formation) to more unitsMisc. Diplomacy Fixes (easier Military Access)Misc. Mission FixesClosing ThoughtsMy experience with the Total War series actually began with the original Medieval: Total War. Medieval II has proven to be an improvement over nearly every asset of that game, and is actually compatible with modern hardware. If you like any other of the games in the Total War series, fictional Medieval scenarios, RTS's, or Eurocentricism simulators, I strongly recommend this game.TL;DRAs Milan, my faction was excommunicated for failing to stop annexing the territories of my Catholic neighbors. The Pope declared a Crusade to take back Rome, which I had annexed from the Papal States several turns earlier. Seeing as I controlled all of Europe except for England at that point, I decided to hunker down at Rome, and let the lone English Crusading army actually reach its intended destination. At Rome, I had a full garrison of high quality Milanese militia, led by three generals. Outside of Rome, I had placed another full army ouside the gates as reinforcements. When the English Crusaders arrived, I was somewhat worried, as the English had brought proper Knights and Armored Swordsmen, whereas I had Spear Militia and Cavalry Militia. Nevertheless, I waited for the English assault. Sure enough, the English began their assault on the walls of Rome with catapults and trebuchets. Yet, they never managed to see Rome's interior. My Cavalry Militia sallied out of the gates, and killed the artillery crew, while my reinforcements attacked the would-be Crusaders from the rear. The English Crusading army was destroyed, and as equal and just retaliation, I annexed the entire British Isles and exterminated their citizens for good measure.9/10This game is Machiavelli's wet dream.

												""What is best in life?""""To crush God's enemies,to see them converted before you,and to hear the lamentations of their Imams.""-Conan the Barbarian (said during his stint as a mercenary for the Pope)Seriously though, this game is still awesome, even after all these years later! In fact, M2:TW just celebrated its 10th birthday, this November 2016! And its still easily one of the best, if not the best, of the Total War series!Improving upon, and outdoing most everything in the previous M:TW and Rome:TW (whose engine it uses) games, Medieval II was a triumph of RTS when it was first released. And a year later, it only got better with the best Total War expansion to date, Kingdoms. And thats not even considering all the many wonderful fan-made mods this title has available, thus extending its greatness even more so! Even fantasy lands are game! Want to wage war in Middle-Earth? There's a mod for that! Feel like fighting for The Elder Scrolls' Tamriel? There's a mod for that! How about waylaying the Warhammer world? Well, actually, that game was released earlier this year. But..there's still mods that predate that!Caution: this game is a time consumer! You can EASILY spend 50+ hours on just one campaign alone, and given that there are 17 playable factions available (eventually) in just the base game alone, and that there is NO END DATE for any campaign (only an end to the campaign objectives, but the game still goes on, so you can play a medieval kingdom all the way into the 21st century and beyond, take that modernity! #ProgressIsForSuckers), you can rack up a kingdom's worth of time spent on this game! Rome wasn't built in a day, they say, but it sure was completed faster than this game is!Whether it be conquering your back-stabbing neighbors (all the italian powers, always!!), managing your empire (where is the govenator when you need him?), retaking the Holy Land from the infidel (ya jerks!), converting the heathen (come on fellas, its ""A.D."" now, get with the program already!), or making a heroic last stand for all of Christendom against the rapacious onslaught of the Golden Horde (which is what you get when you don't tip the chinese food delivery guy on one too many occasions), yes sir, Medieval II has it all. Even the possibility of having one of your generals get so cuckholded by his nakedly adulterous wife, that he loses it, becomes the most shameless man on earth, and shacks up with a tranny, thus bringing eternal shame to your kingdom! As I said, Medieval II has it all. Even things the developers really should have just left alone...*ahem*.If your a strategy gaming fan, there are certain games in the genre you just have to have played in your lifetime, like Age of Empires II: Age of Kings. This is that kind of game. Don't miss out. And here's to hoping that the developers go back on their ""we don't make games with the number '3' in their titles"" statement, and, once they are done with (the also fantastic, well-worth-your-time) Warhammer: Total War, they start developing Medieval III.

												I bought this game originally by the DVD, the gold edition. It was the first Total War game I'd ever played. It made me play Rome: Total War, and then I explored the rest of the series. I fell in love with this game at first sight. I found this game by a youtube series that was really interactive. It was amazing. I found the setting amazing, I found the ability to forge my own history amazing. Commanding your troops as you use tactics or sheer numbers and brute force to bring victory. I think this is what got me in to History.  It is an excellent game, especially if you value gameplay over age.			"

												One of the best games to have been produced. Honestly.And this is before you even get to the mods, which can be just improving the AI in battles to entirely new games altogether. Truly astounding.Unfortunately, Steam, for whatever reason, doesn't have this game in the Workshop, so mods have to be found elsewhere - that doesn't take up too much time, unless you decide to download something like Third Age.

												The Total War game that had everything. The newer iterations of the series keep removing features and depth to the game.Obviously this is not a perfect game, the engine can only run in 1 CPU core and that really hurts when having a huge battle with unlimited units on the field.It has lots of exploits and bugs, the pikemen are basically useless. The vanilla AI has some serious issues with pathfinding, especially when you select a group of units and try to move them in a siege battle.Now, most of this issues, except of course those caused by the engine itself are addressed by the excellent modding community this game STILL has. Go browse the Total War Center website and see by yourself the mods this game has to offer. Recommended at full price.			"

												This is an excellent entry in the Total War series, better than its predecessor (Rome) and its next 2 successors (Empire and Napolean). The time period allows for exciting gameplay and lots of variety. The campaign mode fixed a lot of the problems from Rome (late game issues like being unable to deal with large cities and distance from capital). This game also introduced randomization of soldiers, so they all look different instead of being an army of clones. This game has one of the best experiences of building a globe spanning kingdom from 1 or 2 settlements. AI isn't amazing, but smart enough to put you in some tough situations now and again, especially on higher difficulty settings.DLC campaigns are fun and add interesting scenarios.All in all, lots of fun, tons of nations to play with, meaningful differences in unit types, and challenging strategy.

												This game is one of the best Total War games, in my opinion at least, to this day. My review is pretty late. Don't let my hours fool you, since I played lots of the disc copy before I got it on steam. The campaign is great, and features a lot of historically accurate versions of countries/kingdoms/empires for it's time. I'd reccommend it to anyone, new and old, to the Total War franchise. It's also worth picking up the Kingdoms expansion, as it features 4 campaingns, new units and features, and it can make a few mods a lot more viable without having to replace the base game. But yeah, this game's modding community is reasonably active, with lots of great mods such as Stainless Steel and Third Age Total War, this game really is worth it. It's also worth noting that the game is 10GB, later games being higher than that, so unless you are prepared to waste a lot of time on a poor connection, it's probably better to pick up a hard disc.

												Great game and the best of all the Total War series for me personally, partly because of the time period and partly because of it being the first Total War game I ever bought. It has some issues now in terms of poor wide screen support and stuff like difficulty of mod installing for steam version, but its still a great and addictive game. Over the years communnity around it made it only better with lots of amazing mods like LotR themed Third Age:Total War and Warhammer fantasy themed Age Of Warhammer:Total War(which is btw without doubt is one of the reasons we get Warhammer:Total War now). I played hundreds of hours of this game and never got tired of it, and I could tell you hell of a lot of stories what happened within it in that time, but it would take too long. So just know that like any good game, this one allows you to come up with stories of your own while having a great time playing and enjoying most of its aspects.			"

												my favorite total war game in the series.  you'll spend hours fighting, conquering and most importantly having fun. the game is  full of tiny details that seem to never make it in contemporary titles. the sound effects and music give a truly medieval feeling and the battles are simply epic, from grand decisive battles with full stacks, to minor skirmishes with small groups of soldiers. this game is the peak of the total war games and combines the best features that were removed along with excellence that inspires players to continue to play the newer titles. if you were a fan of the newer or older games in the total war series, or if you are looking for a fun new game you haven't played before, I highly suggest you pick this up.

This puppy here became my first dream come true concerning world domination! 10 years on, I finally have a grasp on the game and all it's aspects and still learn something new everytime I install it and take it for a spin.Vanilla has plenty to offer for various playthroughs, once that's doesn't do it anymore, you're free to change many things in the game files to increase the difficulty of the game or get rid of some annoyances. If you want to get away from Vanilla however, then there's more to offer in the form of mods. Many mods either completely overhaul the game and there are others that bring changes to the existing game and expand on the European theathre. The only other game I've found that had such an extinsive amount of overhaul mods it's Mount and Blade Warband, which, by all rights, is another great game. Where Warband puts you in the thick of the action, Medieval 2 allows you to direct all the action.			"

I can say that Battle is the greatest factor in this game. Naval Battle : Like Rome Total War, It is Auto-Battle. It is quite despend on your fortune :D Diplomacy : If you expect it like Crusader Kings II, You will be disappointed. Unlike the Crusader Kings II, It hasn't the concept that Vassal like Crusader Kings II. All Your realm is yours. But You can vassalize other countries and use the papacy by increasing the relation between pope and you if you are playing as Catholic faction. You can assassinate agents, generals and Kings. But Only way to get rid of your inferior general is sending him to the Battlefield like the case of David and Uriah in Bible.Management : Build the building and just managing the tax rate and subdue damn rebel scums.

												My favorite game of all time, and one of the best, if not THE best, Total War titles.It doesn't have the improved politics, economy, replenishemnt, and public order systems of the later titles, but it M2 has it where it counts, visceral battles, free-form campaigns, amazing soundtrack, and a lot of personality that the later titles have lost. Before I had the steam version I logged 600 hours on this game, and that was WITHOUT mods. The major strength is that you can pretty much play the campaigns any way you want with minimal interference from the ""story"" , unlike Napoleon, R2, and Attila. You create your own history instead of being pushed into following actual history.The AI might be a bit dumb and it has its fair sure of bugs and glitches, but there's no DLC.Supposedly the latest steam version doesn't let you use certain mods, hasn't been an issue for me. I'd recommend two mods that I always use: Retrofit (takes kindoms features into the M2 grand campaign) and Crimson Tide (lots more blood and dirt).			"

												I have Medieval 2 and Kingdoms on disc already and I only recently bought this on Steam again as a backup. I have sunk countless hours on the disc version.This game is a massive improvement on Rome 1 that was before this and of course is far better with the amount of mods that are availiable for it. Especially if you have the Kingdoms Expansion which I recomend you should get as well. Vanilla is very good and holds its own but like most Total Wargames it is improved further with mods. To improve historical accuracy and provide total overhauls. I recomend you have a look on twcenter.net for what modders have made availiable. This game covers 300 years of history from just after the Norman invasion of Britain, the Crusades, the Mongol invasion, the discovery of gun powder to the exploring of the Americas. I don't think i'll ever get bored with this game as I've always come back to it even after playing more recent games such as Shogun 2, Empire and Rome 2 which I also enjoy. So my love for this game has not anything to do with rose tinted glasses.			"

												In my opinion, this is still the king of medieval strategy games. While Crusader Kings II can't really be topped in terms of depth and the sheer amount of intricacy on offer, at the time of its release Medieval II offered players a chance at some cunning diplomacy using spies, priests and even princesses to influence the enemy factions, in addition to an updated battle engine.Definitely worth picking up, especially if you're curious about the more recent Total War games and want a slightly less complex entry into the military strategy world.

												This game is more attractive than Netporn.You're gonna love this if you loved the older and the newer games of the franchise I havent experienced any kind of Hiccups or bugs until now during my gameplay so i think it's very well optimized to Windows7.I have also purchased the Kingdoms Expansion(NOT DLC)Which adds 4 individual mods to the Game,and thats amazing for the price of like in the example of newer total war games:2 culture pack in Attila And you get like 4 Unique game for this price.I highly recommend the mod called :stainless steel which is also as amazing as the Kingdoms if not even better.Plus the very big benefit of the game is that it supports all kind of modding it contains many mods(the number of them is gradually increasing UNTIL THIS DAY TOO)ANd its i think also worth a mention that this game has a Lord Of Rings mod either....i cannot express my interest to this game so i have 1 word to say:TRY THIS IMMEDIATELY!!!!!

												It says that I have 463 hours on this game but since I played it back when the Kingdoms launcher was mixed with the regular one, it should be near a thousand. This is THE game to play if you are into medieval style strategy games with a heavy emphasis on combat. You can play as the already might Holy Roman Empire or start off as Scotland and create a new empire through conquest. The game play itself is done in a way where even if you have never played a strategy game before, you will soon be able to understand and pick up the time of game play this game has to offer. What makes this game even more amazing is the modding community behind it. This is easily one of my all time favorite games and I recommend that anyone who can get their hands on it should play it.10/10			"

												Medieval II: Total War, where to even begin? Before I even bought this game on Steam I had over 1000 hours on it and thats without even having mods! This game without mods has so much time to spend on it you'll be hooked for days! The DLC Kingdoms is probably one of the best expansions for a Total War game ever, from adding four new campaigns to all the mods you can have! My favorite mod would have to the Third Age Total War which is basically a COMPLETE conversion of the base game into the world of J. R. R. Tolkien and you can fight the war of Middle Earth from a startegy perspective! I never really play the multiplayer to be honest because I'm mainly a singleplayer kinda guy when it comes to Total War games. I would highly recommend you to buy this game along with the DLC Kingdoms so you have (again) the four new Campaigns and all the mods! 10/10			"

FIRST OF ALLFirst of all i'd like to say that i'm not going to review this game basing on what people say or else and that i am a fan of the Total War saga,i own every total war title,except from attila,3 of them on steam and the other ones on DVD so i'm going to be really precise and straight in this review.The good points.This game has some key points that makes it one of the best,if not the best,Total War title.-Game has just made steps forward and none backwards from its predecessor,Rome.-Campaign AI is Smart and operates well-Jihads and Crusuades are super fun.-Now you have a reason to defeat a enemy family member,because his ransom will gain you an absurd ammount of money.-Many units to choose from-Best overall Total War title in my Opinion.The bad points-Too much inaggressive AI,it will rarely attack you.-Sometimes your allies betray you for no reason at all.-Pope excomunicates you even if you dont smile at him when he walks near you-AI Sometimes lays some suicidal sieges with the leader of his faction toward a full fortified town.-Pathfinding is terrible. Really. To chase down routing enemies with cavalry sometimes you dont have to attack them directly but just move your unit near the routing target or your men will start just going in senseless positions.

												One of my altime favorites.  I got 2 copies of the disk versions as well.  From the time ths game came out I played it so much I wore out the disks.  Strange, that's never happened with any other disk game for me.  Maybe poor quality disks?			"

												Simply put one of the greatest strategy games ever. Not only do you have to use a wide range of battle tactics and pay attention to your geography and playing field, but you also must balance your empires economy, military power, diplomacy, trade relations, and many more. Basically Black & White 2 on crack + the game of Risk with a city manager thrown into it. 10/10 game that requires intellect, beats mashing WoW hotkeys or getting quickscoped by 12 year olds on CoD.

												When I chose Very Hard Campaign mode, I didn't just expect all of the other nations to despise me and their diplomats to be completely unyielding in their offers. ""Become a vassal"" was the only option I ever had when trying to negotiate a peace deal with Hungary, even though we, The Holy Roman Empire, had been fighting a war in which tens of thousands had died during a period of over 100 turns without any significant changes in the war. Despite this, Hungary, which at this point was the most powerful nation in the world,( the HRE being second despite endless attacks by also Milan, Venice, France,Denmark and the Moors, which also all lasted 50 -100+ turns without any peace seen except with the Moors) continued to attack ME, even though it was clear that I could always barely irk by despite my desire for peace and my many attempts to SEE peace through acts of goodwill by releasing their endlesss armies of men only for them to attack me once anew. That being said, when I chose Very Hard Combat mode, I expected a challenge, not in that the enemy forces would just have superior forces and troops, but that the enemy generals, atleast when it happened to be a unique character with good command, would be at all competent in their decision making, and not that they would just let my cavalry always destroy their artillery and missile infantry as they were never in a position to defend them.Having played CK2 for 100s of hours, I can say that the diplomacy system and the general decision-making of other nations is not only extensively dumbed down(which is not that big of a deal since Total War is mostly centralized around battles) but also completely unreasonable. I did not ask for every major nation around me to declare war on me, I asked for a diplomacy system that would present an intriguing challenge, like in CK2. I still give it a 9/10, minus the serious AI and diplomacy issues it is still one of the most entertaining games I've ever played.			"

You can control Europe and fight holy wars, grand scale campaign and seige's are beast.   Take it from me, in Scotland there is a claymore waiting for you to handle and take up the fight.			"

												I have played all of the total war games and this is by far the best.  No tech trees, just build the right buildings.  Beautiful system.  Why Sega chose to change a winning formula in later TW releases is beyond me.  Even when I switched to a Mac, I found a why to port this over (Thanks to Paulthetall).  I just hope Sega goes back to this title for the upcoming Warhammer release.  If there is only one thing to change, I would like to play as the rebels or turn them off (without a mod).  Don't let the hours played fool you, I have been playing this since its initial release.  Please make a native port for the Mac, it will sell fast.			"

												This game is old, but it is a very great Total War game. This game is set in a Medieval timeline you can play as anyone in Europe and North Africa ranging from Scotland all the way to Egypt, and the timelines are pretty accurate. From the Mongols arriving to Timurids arriving to the finding of the ""New World"" (America) But I very highly recommend buying it.			"

												My thoughts on this game- Well made- Very enjoyable - Can give you hours of fun in one run conquering your enemies and trying to over rule all of the factions - Amazing map details - Can run on a decent computer- Amazing AI- Great land details- Great GUI / Graphics - Wars are pretty fair and you cant predict what you're getting yourself into too- Troops look and act amazingly to whats going on the battlefield - Great Agent Mechanics (E.g. Assassins will help you win battles by secretly attacking the enemy thats trying to or already attacking your settlement and with the wide ranged movement it can overturn any can overturn any seige) )Another example is even a diplomat for making with an alliance with another country or even a cease fire on a country)- Alot of different places to overtake (E.g. France)Cons- Ai randomly get tired and we lose the battle Ex: I had 1000 people fighting 350 and 80% of them we're dead (Note: General wasn't dead) and we some how lose (Note:41% of my team was dead)- Forces love to randomly rebel after taking A ""Outpost""			"

The campaign is great, online battles are awesome with many players in the lobby and even tho the game is around 10 years old the graphics are still awesome. The game has a ton of mods including: Stainless stell, Broken cresent kingdoms and Third age Total war a mod about the world of Tolkien. if you wanna get to know the game better check out Pixeltaed Apollo for online battles and legendoftotalwar for Campaign on youtube.9/10 the vanilla can get borning if you play it all the time so i recomment buying the Kingdoms DLC and install mods.

Posted: December 16, 2015
												I love this game, Medieval 2 Total War in my opinion is the best Total War game to date, Rome Total War polished, and I enjoy the medieval era more than the Roman era. Objectively speaking there is an undeniable quantity of value in this game, before I downloaded mods I had about 200 hours. The vanilla version of this game is excellent. I could even play the campaign mode of the vanilla version after playing the campaign mode of these mods. Battles in this game are the best it will ever be and with multiple medieval eras from early to high to late where you have musket men and cannons. I could have an army of Mongolian cavalry fight an army of French pikemen and musket men. Possibilities in the battles are endless! Also, battles require tactical positioning, flanking, planning and using your brain in general. If you don’t like to use your brain, than don’t buy this game. If you do, however, you will find very interesting and creative ways to defeat your enemies. When to attack the enemy or hold position and send spearmen to the front, when you should retreat or hold fast. There is just so much fun to have in battles. The Campaign mode has no story, like every other Total War game, based on the situation of your nation and other nations, plans and ambitions, you make your own story. Be the king of England and defeat the French once and for all, forge an empire of 2 land masses. Play as Byzantium and retake lost lands and lost lands of the Roman empire. When it comes to recruitment and construction it is balanced. Recruitment pools determine how many units you can recruit per turn and how long you must wait until you can recruit another one of the same unit. This prevents large and massive armies of heavy infantry running all over the place. Diplomacy feels real as in the medieval times there were no phones to call other leaders. Countries had to send a diplomat and wait for a response. Diplomacy is not as in depth as it could be, but this game is focused around war and military. Keep that in mind when you play the campaign mode. Trade, alliances, embargos, vassals, military access, the basics are all there. Events happen in the campaign mode throughout such as the Mongolian invasion, the discovery of gunpowder and the new world, and yes, this game includes the plague.Overall, unless you are too stupid to use your brain in coordination and deep thought, you will enjoy this game and get your money’s worth without a doubt. Even at full retail price I would still find my money’s worth. Go buy it on sale if you are still sceptical, I did it, too.I give this game a full 10/10!			"

												Awesome entry in the Total War series. The kingdoms expansion was simply amazing. Building your empire and managing your armies is extremly satisfying. Slight learning curve for players new to the series but can be picked up easily by Total War and stratagie vets. There are also many incredible mods that can add even more play time to this already expansive game. A must for stratagie fans.			"

												A fantastic game even by todays standards. The graphics are perfectly acceptable and game runs flawlessly. It has a lot of great additions and cool features like Princess', Priests etc. The campaign is very gripping and more challenging than most of the TW titles partly because of the size of the other factions. I really like the upgrading and recruiting system of Medieval 2 as unlike other TW games, you cant have the best soldiers in every settlement and often dont have a perfect army, so it forces you to thing and plan around your weaknesses. The soundtrack is also very good, it loads super fast and is a blast to play. I much prefer this game to Rome 2 and im convinced Medieval 2 is a close rival with Rome 1 to be the best TW game ever!!!!!Got to be rated a 5/5 or 9/10 - I defenitely recommend this game for peoples who like TW, or the Medieval period. But even if you have no interest in eather theres a good chance you will still love this game!!!!!!			"

												when you first feel your blood pumping as your soldiers charge forward knowing that this the key battle to a very important war and whether you will win or lose your city that is what this game is about. If you want to know how every man can make a difference then this is the game for you. Unfortunatly this games technology does run behind the newer titles in the total war series but it is a must buy and must play.10/10 :)			"

I remember watching Deadliest Warrior and just wondering what would happen in that simulation, but hey now im sorta like the simulation. I bought this game and I command the armies of the north, telling my cities to create buildings and/or troops, or declaring war on worthless rebel cities that are scum.

												I bought this game long ago on CD and recently rediscovered it on Steam. Thanks to Steam I was able to activate the game without purchase using my old CD key and got the Kingdoms expansion as bonus... great. Additionally being able to play this game on Linux is great...So this game feels deep and engrossing. There are so many options that it seems overwhelming at first. Luckily you are not drowning in micromanagement unlike some other games. And yes, battles are fun but you can choose to auto-resolve them if you are focussed on the bigger picture.So, the politics of this game seems very deep. I started out with Holy Roman Empire. I built a high standing with the Pope. Then allied with the Papal States. Pope called for a crusade. I didn't join initially. In the meantime the Pope died and elections were called for. My cardinal became the Pope. Immediately became the most favoured nation with Pope. Joined the crusade with my king at the head of the crusading army... What with managing your family tree, choosing your potential heirs, marrying off your family members, managing diplomacy with other factions etc. etc. you have your hands full. Unlike the Civ titles, there is no sense of randomness or emptiness when it comes to international politics as the game is founded in a historic setting, and every diplomatic move feels like it matters. Haven't played further, but looking forward to smashing the enemies!			"

You can start off as Venice, Spain, England or France, and from there on any country you conquer will be avaliable for you to play as when you start a new game. There isn't really anything wrong with this game except for the broken diplomacy as your allies don't attack your enemies and aren't any diffrent than nuetral factions.			"

												One of the best Total War for me. The game keep the original ""taste"" of the old ones. I played Napoleon: Total War and Rome 2, and i have to say that MTW2 looks much better in some parts. The battles are more ""bloody"" than the new ones. Also, Rome 2, looks unfinished and is poorly optimized (some stupid people say that Rome 2 the best Total War ever hahaha). I was ""lucky"" to play the 4 days trial. Many lag. Battles are clunky and the units looks like plastic T_T.Anyway, MT2 it still be amazing game with that graphics (2006). I played with some graphic mods for enjoy it with my powerful PC. I will not think it more, and buy this AWASOME RTS game :)I give this game 9 / 10 "

												After so long of not palying this game, I went back and played as both the Holy Roman Empire and England. I had completely forgotten just how much content depth this game has as well as the amazing dynamic combat and cavalry charges. Nothing beats watching your heavy mounted knights charge to the rear of enemy troops being held in place by your men-at-arms. There's always something to do in the game. Whether it's building up your empire with the constant upgrads to cities and castles, to you participating in crusades or squashing rebellions. And those general speaches are absolutely amazing. This game isn't without its faults. The ai can be quite stupid at times, but that's the case with all TW games so it isn't too bad considering it's not broken. The game itself (the campaign) has no real story but the one you make with whatever events unfold during your playtime. The game has 2 phases: one is a turn based campaign map where you manage your empire. How you manage your empire is really up to you but keep in mind that this isn't Rome 2 or Attila, there are consequences to your actions. Too much war mongering against other factions that share your religion and you'll be excommunicated by your religious leader meaning that you could find yourself in the middle of both a Jihad AND a holy crusade. Your generals are also EXTREMELY important! I cannot stress that enough! You need generals not only to lead your troops in battle, but also to build up your empire. If a city or castle doesn't have a governer (a general either a family member or just some general in your family) you cannot choose what to build or what units to recruit. It will be automanaged. One of the downsides to this game though is the annoyance of having to hire a diplomat in order to take diplomatic actions with other factions. It may be a bit more immersive, sure, but it's still a pain. that's one of the things newer TW games have done right. The game also has missions that are sent to you. From taking certain cities or castles to joining crusades, as stated before there's always something to do. However, some missions can be absolutely stupid and won't benifit you in any way or are nearly impossible to truly accomplish and it sucks because if they're not done, you lose reputation. be it with other factions or with your respective religious leader. But other than that, this game really doesn't have much to complain about. The 2nd phase is the real time battle map with thousands of men under your command. The best trategy here is the best strategy in any TW game: Take the high grounds and if none are available, use the ""hammer and anvil strategy. It works extremely well in this game because of the powerful heavy cavalry. Overall this is a phenominal game and has earned all its praise and love. It's not perfect and has some glaring flaws, but they're easily overshadowed by the sheer amount of content and high quality of the game.			"

												Top 5 reasons you should play this game. 5. The Pope. Playing as a catholic faction, the pope tells you to so many things. But it makes the game more difficult and everybody likes a challenge. 4. The fact that you can play as every faction (not the rebels, mongols trimuids or aztect. But it would not make sence to play as them, since the rebels are everywere and the mongols, trimuids and aztect comes in many turn after you start). 3. Crusades and Jihads. Crusade: The Pope calls a crusade when he wants and all christian factions have to join, if not, they won't be liked by the Pope. Jihad: The same as crusade but for the muslim factions. 2. Events that really happened back in the medievals. 1. Being able to screw the Pope and take controll over the catholic church.			"

												Medieval 2 Total war is a awesome Medieval Strategy game! This game will take up hours of you time as you try to conquer the world.  It features great battles from open hills to castle sieges which no matter how many times you play them will be different and fun to play. This game can be challenging sometimes but even so it is fun. Just watching Huge battles is great! This game also features an online mode where people face each other off in huge battles. These are very fun too as each battle is different and you get to witness other peoples strategies. I would recommend this for any strategy game fans out there as it is quite easy to get a hand of the game and start winning epic battles!			"

												Despite the short time I have played on Steam, I had this game on a seperate disk but it broke. In short, this game was a good quarter of all the games I played as a child. I played it whilst I was eating Number 5 gum a lot and whenever I smell that smell it brings me back to some memories of the best days of my life. Unfortunatly this game in my eyes was the best Total War until Shogun 2.			"

												Take command of your nation offline or on multiplayer, better to be played with friends but amazing game non the less. Running htis game at full specs is reccomended to capture the realism it presents. Not exretmely detailed unit faces but otehr than that youll be happy with each map you play on. River battles, massive land battles, sieging castles and much more.			"

												This is still the best Total War, and will continue to be the best Total War until Creative Assembly dumps the Warscape engine, which has become a serious handicap for every Total War after this one. That, and hiring competent AI programmers so they can stop oversimplifying and removing basic game mechanics just so that AI has less things to ♥♥♥♥ up.Here's a short list of things M2TW does better than the later titles:-To start, this is by far the most moddable Total War in the series. Everything from units to animations to the campaign and battle maps are completely moddable. Even the AI is moddable to a limited extent.-Has by far the best recruitment system of any Total War game. Every unit has a limited pool to recruit from that replenishes at variable rates based on the building they're recruited from. Higher quality professional soldiers replenished slower than lower quality militia units, which prevents churning out stacks of elite units in quick order, atleast until you get to the point where you own half of Europe. I'm actually baffled as to why they moved away from this, but it was probably due to Creative Assembly being incapable of making the AI work with it.-NO LIMITED BUILDING SLOT NONSENSE. And no idiotic food mechanics that further restricted your building choices either. In M2TW's cities/castles, you could pretty much build everything in every city/castle. BUT you can only build one building at a time, so to be optimal you still had to specialize each city/castle for a specific purpose early on. -Agents that actually served a strategic purpose, rather than just being a general nuisance or generic regional stat buff.-Battles that last more than 5 minutes. This is again probably due to CA's AI short comings, as the battle AI throughout the years has yet to evolve beyond ""engage front line, flank with any extra cavaly, suicide general"". The shorter the battles the are the less this is a problem, but the longer battles go it becomes easier for the player to out manuver and smash the AI.-Soldiers have actual mass. Heavier units will actually force weaker units backwards in melee. In the later Warscape plagued titles, a few dozen of the weakest unit imaginable can literally prevent hundreds of heavy infantry from moving forwards. -Sieges that were, at the very least, fun to defend and attack on. M2TW certainly has the most complicated siege battles, with the highest level castles having 3 sets of walls to overcome. The AI can have a tough time with it, but it usually does okay. Total War AI has always been a little extra special when it comes to siege battles, but other than Shogun 2 the AI has gotten significantly worse at them since M2TW, despite siege battles being significantly simplified.As superior M2TW undoubtably is, there are a number of things later Total Wars do better:-Graphics, an obvious one, though the graphics in M2TW still look pretty decent today.-UI. M2TW's UI is big, ugly, and clunky, and scales poorly on widescreen resolutions. Definitely has not aged well.-No ♥♥♥♥in diplomats. All diplomacy can be done instantly without the need of an agent running around all of Europe just to die of the plague right when you need him the most.			"

												I love this beauty of a game. I have spent a lot of time conquering the French, The Holy Roman Empire and Spain as England. Although I have yet to have an army of Dismounted English Knights, or Armoured Swordsmen legitimatly, I have only got up to a few of each in an army. There are countless mods for this game, making it even better. My favorites are Rage of Dark Gods, which takes place in the Warhammer universe. Another is Third Age, a Lord of the Rings mod. They are both great mods. I have spent countless hours on this game. Even though it says '99 Hours Played.' Thats a lie. I have played 200 hours easily in this game. Even when you have no internet, this game CAN be played. One of my go to games if we have no internet. Some Pros and ConsPros:- You get to have your own army - You are a king of an empire, many to choose from- Not laggy at all, even with a good computer- Very challenging, I consider this a good thing- Historical Characters in game- Historical Battles you can play- You get to play in custom battles, with OP(Over Powered) units.- 5 types of mods w/ Kingdoms expansion. (As of now, I think it comes just with base game.) Base Game, Americas, Crusades, Brittania, and Teutonic.Cons:- Bad Graphics (Im a texture kinda guy.)- Tends to bug out sometimes, its an old game.- Other Kingdoms may have an advantage over you in early game depending on their Pros and Cons (Says when you got to pick a kingdom)Overall, this game is really good. I love it so much, it would definetly recommend you get it right away. Although I have yet to play with my friends, its still fun playing by yourself.			"

												Solid so far, pretty sure i have way more than 7 hours in, as I play offline mostly, idk if it counts those hours or not. Windows 10, AMD A10, Radeon R5, nothing fancy imo, basic little laptop from a ""big box"" store. A FEW crashes, standard ""unspecified error"" crash, which were all negated by aggressive game saving habits. I can not seem to duplicate the crash either; ie: during a 200+ turn campaign, it did the crash mid game but never did it again afterwards. Playing Vanilla game with the graphics turned down slightly from the ""auto detect"" settings to (maybe?) help minimize crashing lol. HAve not tried mods yet, but I am interested in them for sure. Gotta research which ones work well with the current steam version, as i just DL'd the game about a month ago. All in all the vanilla game (I bought the whole ""Kingdoms Expansion bundle"" to hopefully get the best version) runs GREAT, couple crashes, and personally I have not experienced ANY bugs or flaws that were game breaking. Again, this is exp on the Vanilla game from a TW vet who just recently got back into this series, playing at least 2 hours a day since I bought it.			"

Though the game is almost ten years old, it still looks pretty sweet in my opinion.If you want to play as neat german emperor, kick the pope in his old balls and hunt down some fleeing frenchmen, this game is just right for you.

												This could have been a great game... indeed many contend that it is. I disagree however, because my criteria for a great game includes controls that are not broken.Go on the internet and you will see legions of fanboys jumping through hoops to defend the obvious lazy programming and lack of anything even resembling QA testing that has resulted in controls so broken that even the simplest of maneuvers can reduce even normally patient gamers to shouting, fist-pounding emotional wrecks as they watch what should have been a gimme battle devolve into an embarrassing defeat simply due to the fact that it is next to impossible to get your troops to do as they are told.Fanboys respond to this by saying ""you just have to learn how to micro it properly"", or ""maybe if you learned to do it properly..."" blah blah blah, ad nauseum. I call shenanigans. I'm not talking about advanced maneuvers. Not even the cavalry charges. I'm talking about ""you three units, go over here and stand in a line"". Ten minutes later, they are still milling around where they were before, apparently totally defeated by the entrance to a city street. And now you're out of position, and your strategy collapses as your longbowmen are outflanked by the cavalry your spearmen were supposed to be defending against. There is no excuse for this. And if it isn't getting stuck on each other and milling around, it's running *past* the spot where you told them to go, triggering a battle you're not ready for and resulting in units routing and strategies failing. No excuse. Cavalry is similarly broken. You cannot have more than one unit of cavalry at a time, because one unit requires constant micromanagement just to charge properly. They have to be lined up *just so*, the enemy has to be clicked on *just so*, they have to be watched all the way to their target lest they encounter a tree or a slight rise and begin milling around in confusion, and they have to be told to retreat the instant they hit, or even the lowliest of peasants will begin to bowl them over like ninepins. If you can have more than one unit of cavalry in this game; never play it again because you can click fast enough to make money playing Starcraft professionally.			"

												I played a bit before i linked up my retail key to Steam when i read up not long ago that when Gamespy started pushing up daisies, the key you got can be linked up to steam for a copy. Since i could no longer play the game because of some windows incompatibility with the DRM on the disc, i installed here and it works now.Having played a bit again, i remember now why i have not touched this game in a long time compared to Rome TW. Mostly to do with unit movement orders; Horses don't charge their enemies almost all the time. Ordering a unit of troops through an enemy gate, sometimes they go through and just stand in formation on the other side until you tell them to move again, when attacking a fleeing enemy some units stop following and stand around, some units on a wall or on the ground finished attacking an enemy and as you tell them to move they are still in fighting until you tell them to stop and move again and so on. It is one of the most annoying features on the game that i remember. i have lost a few fights because my forces spread out during fighting instead of charging in and attacking.Compared to Rome TW, this game has more features and looks better, but i would take Rome TW over this any day.

												Medieval II: Total War is perhaps my favorite in the line of Total War games. Though it lacks some of the newer mechanics and complexities that are in the latest Total Wars, the game still stands out as having some of the most satisfying battles I have ever played. When I think Total War, I think Medieval II. The graphics still look great, and the gameplay still holds up.  I don't know why my steam account says I've only played a couple hours, because I have definitely sunk multiple lazy weekends into this game. If you love the more recent Total War games, give this one a shot, it is a step above the rest.			"

												I thought this was a GREAT game for the 2 days i played it... a good Medieval styled Rome Total War in my oppinion... for those who want a challenge, get this gamefor those who love Medieval times, get this gamefor those who hate Rome II Total War, get this gamefor those who love strategy, get this gamefor those who love Total War..... GET THIS GAME!!!ok, enough ♥♥♥♥in around, now this IS a near perfect game in my eyes so if this sounds biased... dont tear me up for it :/Ok well for 1 in my opinion this is 10x better than Rome II even though the graphicas arent excellent. And as i usually say to friends when i recomend this that the BEST thing about this game are the Events! The Events are TOTALLY the best part of this game, they can be GAME CHANGING things at time like when the Black Death hits and it when it did for me i ALMOST lost the game by losing my entire family tree, and also i ended up with 1 family member alive with no wife... Or when the the New World is discovered where you fight HORDES of Natives that outnumber you 10-1Now on to the thing EVERYONE does in MIITW, the battles, they are awesome, 9/10 because their are some glitches but its grandious Vs. say our latest Total War games... and also, heres something i know for a fact i might get♥♥♥♥♥♥for, THE DLC ACTUALLY ADDS TO THE ENTIRE GAME AND ITS NOT ♥♥♥♥♥ING LEVELS. Yeah... only 1 piece of DLC on this game.. and it adds a bunch of campaigns that are AWSOME and also it makes it possible for mods to change your game and make it look like a entirelly new one! For instence, i have Third Age Total War installed and i am IN LOVE with it! Now compared to newer mods for newer Total War's the MIITW mods actually CHANGE the game and add on instead of fixing it...Well thats my review, my rating of this game, well ill borrow Angry Joe's rating system and give this a 9/10, a LEGENDARY status and a MUST own, and i bet if he did review this, he would put the Badass Seal of Approval on this! Well thats all.			"

												one of, if not the best total war game in the series.pros -lot's of playable factions with good unit variety-things like crusades/jihads, mongol and timurid invasions to make things more interesting-family tree -only 1 dlc pack and is totally worth it (adds 4 new campaigns)-hotseat -graphics are still not that bad even compared to todays standardscons-alliances don't seem to last very long and sometimes seems like making alliances guarantees they'll attack you next turn (♥♥♥♥ you milan)-battle ai can be a bit derpy but you kind of expect that with total war games and isn't a big dealoverall 9/10, not perfect but pretty close			"

												The vanilla game is very entertaining. It will definitely provide hours of entertainment and no new game will ever be the same. Some downsides include; some troop types can feel very similar, some factions aren't able to get later technology (i.e, cannons, Arquebusier's), and the campaign does feel short in the long term.Overall, the default game is great, but some minor areas fall flat of the target, as most games do. Once you mod this game however, you'll find it difficult to play the vanilla version again.8/10			"

												An extraordinary classic that required me 72 hours of play to complete (full campaign).It's a game of years ago so it requires a lot of micromanagement but it's enjoyable to play if you are looking for an RTS that defined the genere on the PC.There are a couple of annoying things gameplay-wise (your merchants get put off business regularly by other merchants, and spies and assassins fail and die regardless of they mission success), but when you get a solid game economy, those problems become secondary.

												amazing game, best stragagy game series. The graphics my lack but that means that it works for non-gaming cpus which may benifit people that dont want to spend thousands of dollars on a high-end laptop or computer. The gamplay is amazing, not needing a billion troops for but allowing you to realise your inner gamer by turning the tides of a battle with your own tatics.if the enemy is puting up a good fight you can run behind ur archers and have them shoot the enemy down. The tatical and stratigic opertunitys are endless. the game concept is very good and realistic for example, u cant just buy infinite amounts of troops because u need to have money in your treasury. you can make skilled armys and improve them to best your emenmy. there is also a terrific multiplayer mode were u can use ur tatical skills to best an oppent or your friend.to sum it up i would give it a 8.5 for being great game but lacking the graphics now known today.

												If there was such thing as an ""In the middle"" choice, I'd choose that. You see, Med II is a very intersting girlfriend. I have never seen her before, but when I did see her I knew what I had to do. This girl was gorgeous! It was my ideal women, and when I finally mustered up the courage and bought her... stuff happened. She was great at first, but it was hard maintaining a relationship, mainly because she was a little old school in the graphics department, but she was happy at least. Then her A.I became very predictable, and despite numreous attempts at trying to make her a little bit more suprising I changed the difficulty and other settings that didn't help all to much. It came to the point where I was getting tired of the same old Med II, and then I forced her to get mods, specifically Third Age Divivde and Conquer.If you didn't understand any of that, than here it is in different wording. Med II is fun at first but the A.I gets very predictable and eventually either to easy or way too hard. A very good substitute for this is downloading the Divide and Conquer which is still being patched and made to this day (only thing is is that this is a Lord of the Rings mod).			"

												576 hours on record and I still have so much try on this game. It is in my opinion the ultimate strategy game and best of the Total War series. The main menu music and background instantly give you a taste of the grand scale and epic setting. Even compared to Rome 2 it is visually stunning and will run great on most newer systems, although I remember when it first came out it was brutally demanding of graphics power. One aspect that sets this game out from the others in the series is the religion factor. Yes, the other games have it also, but not to the lenghts of this game. Sending a massive crusading army across Europe and into the Middle East, and than being met by an opposing Jihad force is simply stunning. Than depending on the outcome of the crusade you will either be greatly rewarded by the church for victory, or for failure you may be excommunicated and cast as an enemy to the Christiandom! Another unique feature is the guilds. While their effects and purpose are hard to see at first, they will progressively become more helpful to your nation and will lead to some awesome and elite troops specific to different factions. For example, England can develop a woodsmen guild in Nottingham and once it reaches a certain level, you can recruit Sherwood archers that can camoflauge in the woods and have tremendous range. The powerful Knights Templar are another guild specific to Christian Nations, while eastern nations have the Hashassins guild. If there is one thing that frustrates me during combat, it is that sometimes archers don't fire directly at the enemy when there on walls, but it just takes some practice mastering their line of sight and taking advantage of their range. I also wish there were more historical battles as they provide some awesome scenerios and challenging battles. I recommend going through atleat one play through as the vanilla game, and than trying out the VAST amounts of full and partial mods that have been made for this game. You can even try your own costumizations to the script and combinations of different modification until you find the perfect balance for you. All in all, this a game for the ages and is better than 99% of the garbage that comes out nowadays. 9.8/10			"

												Medieval II: Total War is one of my earlier games I had to get again, and now that I know more because when I WAS playing this game I was around 6 or 7, but now I understand a whole lot more and I love it again, Tons of strategy, Fighting, and more are in this game, Sadly, you control your units and not a guy. But if you want a feel how it's like playing in his eyes, Play Mount And Blade.			"

												I have so many more hours on the Non-Steam version of this game. I really liked it. It's challenging, and at some times unforgiving but it gets really great, especially on those battles that you fight really hard in and  become victorious.  I liked it, and if they came out with a Medieval 3 I would definitely buy it. (Unless Sega ruins it)9/10  would siege again			"

												Loved it, a little to simple, but I loved it. Why couldnt the expansion nclude the New World and the old. It would have been cool to go from fighting to unify Spain, defend from France & England and setteling the New World all while plaeseing the Pope, or not...  But the way you did it sucked... Why not go from 1000 AD to 1700 and open the Atlantic?			"

												Total War is a great series that you should really get into, Medieval 2 Total War is the game that will get you into the Total War series I have recommended this game to countless people and most if not all of them have thanked me for it while some games like Attila are pricey they still deliver the experience of being in a battle.Medieval 2 Total War is one of the best strategy games I have ever played, it's simple to understand interface and mechanics are very effective when it comes to cramming them into one small easy to access UI.You can have fun by playing the expansive campaign to conquer Europe and the middle-east or play a historical battle that actually happened hundreds of years ago or create your own battle with your choice of map armies and roster. You can even spice your game up a bit by installing mods (you will probably need the Kingdoms DLC to do so) onto your computer, like Third Age or The Elder Scrolls Total War, to say that this game was released in 2006 Creative Assembly have done a great job making this game.Gameplay is simple: build an army, attack a castle, expand your kingdom, WIN, but where this game really shines is in the battles themselves have up to a maximum of 24,000 soldiers on the battlefield and witness the true bloody history of Medieval battles.The downside of this game are the graphics although they are playable the fact that the game was released in 2006 tells us that the graphics aren't going to be as good as other Total War games, you'll know what I mean if you compare the graphics to Total War: Attila.KIMBOF1's Score = 5/5Yes the graphics are a bit rubbish but you kinda forget about them when your deeply immersed in the heat of a battle.

												The vanilla game is very entertaining. It will definitely provide hours of entertainment and no new game will ever be the same. Some downsides include; some troop types can feel very similar, some factions aren't able to get later technology (i.e, cannons, Arquebusier's), and the campaign does feel short in the long term.Overall, the default game is great, but some minor areas fall flat of the target, as most games do. Once you mod this game however, you'll find it difficult to play the vanilla version again.8/10			"

												An extraordinary classic that required me 72 hours of play to complete (full campaign).It's a game of years ago so it requires a lot of micromanagement but it's enjoyable to play if you are looking for an RTS that defined the genere on the PC.There are a couple of annoying things gameplay-wise (your merchants get put off business regularly by other merchants, and spies and assassins fail and die regardless of they mission success), but when you get a solid game economy, those problems become secondary.

												576 hours on record and I still have so much try on this game. It is in my opinion the ultimate strategy game and best of the Total War series. The main menu music and background instantly give you a taste of the grand scale and epic setting. Even compared to Rome 2 it is visually stunning and will run great on most newer systems, although I remember when it first came out it was brutally demanding of graphics power. One aspect that sets this game out from the others in the series is the religion factor. Yes, the other games have it also, but not to the lenghts of this game. Sending a massive crusading army across Europe and into the Middle East, and than being met by an opposing Jihad force is simply stunning. Than depending on the outcome of the crusade you will either be greatly rewarded by the church for victory, or for failure you may be excommunicated and cast as an enemy to the Christiandom! Another unique feature is the guilds. While their effects and purpose are hard to see at first, they will progressively become more helpful to your nation and will lead to some awesome and elite troops specific to different factions. For example, England can develop a woodsmen guild in Nottingham and once it reaches a certain level, you can recruit Sherwood archers that can camoflauge in the woods and have tremendous range. The powerful Knights Templar are another guild specific to Christian Nations, while eastern nations have the Hashassins guild. If there is one thing that frustrates me during combat, it is that sometimes archers don't fire directly at the enemy when there on walls, but it just takes some practice mastering their line of sight and taking advantage of their range. I also wish there were more historical battles as they provide some awesome scenerios and challenging battles. I recommend going through atleat one play through as the vanilla game, and than trying out the VAST amounts of full and partial mods that have been made for this game. You can even try your own costumizations to the script and combinations of different modification until you find the perfect balance for you. All in all, this a game for the ages and is better than 99% of the garbage that comes out nowadays. 9.8/10			"

All joking aside I have played every total war game except the original Shogun, this is by far the best and after trying Rome 2 and Shogun 2 I am gravely disappointed with CA. Shogun 2 was alright but Rome 2 is flat out horrible in comparison to Medieval 2 and Rome. The Factions are more accurate in this than Rome 2 and at least in this you can unlock all factions without shelling more money. Anyway this game is easily the Best total war ever...			"

												If there was such thing as an ""In the middle"" choice, I'd choose that. You see, Med II is a very intersting girlfriend. I have never seen her before, but when I did see her I knew what I had to do. This girl was gorgeous! It was my ideal women, and when I finally mustered up the courage and bought her... stuff happened. She was great at first, but it was hard maintaining a relationship, mainly because she was a little old school in the graphics department, but she was happy at least. Then her A.I became very predictable, and despite numreous attempts at trying to make her a little bit more suprising I changed the difficulty and other settings that didn't help all to much. It came to the point where I was getting tired of the same old Med II, and then I forced her to get mods, specifically Third Age Divivde and Conquer.If you didn't understand any of that, than here it is in different wording. Med II is fun at first but the A.I gets very predictable and eventually either to easy or way too hard. A very good substitute for this is downloading the Divide and Conquer which is still being patched and made to this day (only thing is is that this is a Lord of the Rings mod).			"

Feel like making a alliance with certain factions for your advantage only to back-stab them once you reach your goals? Go ahead! All in all, what i'm trying to say, is that this game is a perfect mix of combat and campaigns. If you want, you can completely ditch the campaign and go straight to the combat, with a more than friendly community that is BLOOMING with players! Feel like playing historical battles that actually happened? This is the game for you my friends!			"

												Don't let my hours fool you. I have easily clocked in 1000 hours into this game in the past half decade on the cd version of the game. This is MY favorite of all total war games. I was about 12 or 13 when I started playing this and kept playing this until I graduated from high school. I've played every faction, played many mods, and thoroughly played the Kingdoms campaigns. My favorite campaign being the Crusades and Americas. I used to cheat on all my campaigns when it got rough when I was younger but as I grew up I learned that playing without cheats made this game a hell a lot funner. Being forced to fight with a single stack army against the 4 stacks the cheating ai mustered in just a few turns lead towards very fun and epic battles. Battles mostly won by me of course. ;P Although it's not as advanced and glamourous as the new total war games(Shogun2 is pretty fantastic too), it definitely earned its spot as one of the best total war games out there. I easily recommend this to Strategy players.			"

												I am not a competent or experienced gamer, but even I can appreciate the scope and texture of this game as compared to Rome II. The battle maps are exensive and intuitive when it comes to tactics. The faction rosters are exquisitely detailed. One great thing about this game is the extent to which it's as hard as you want it to be. If you feel like getting your backside handed to you, turn all the advice off and jump in at medium difficulty or above. If, like me, you're a little more timid, start with low difficulty, start with the advice turned on and, if in doubt, turn to youtube or similar for advice. Swissman15, Pixelatedapollo and many others have huge numbers of instructional and demo videos which can tell you useful things, like how to make enemies rout, how to make the best of itwhen you've got vastly superior or inferior troops in one area, what to do about hills and so forthYou can make this a 40-hours-a-run strategy game, a 20 minute hit-and-run tactics game, an RPG of sorts, go achievement hunting... the choice is yours.

												Played this game quite a bit before I activated it through Steam.This game is awesome and I love it but one thing that irks me is that you cannot train like 5 units of the same type in the same province because of limitations which although I do agree that this is accurate during the timeframe (you aren't just going to be able to raise an army of noble knights repeatedly) makes sense, it irks me.Besides me being irked from that, it's a great game. Though if you like the 2nd one, I'd recommend you get the 1st one, I love the first one with all my heart (not on Steam), it's a great game to play and I spent 5x more hours in Medieval 1 than Medieval 2.Out of all the Total War games that I've played (all except their MMO type ones and Shogun 1), Medieval 1, Empire and Rome 2 are my favorites.Get this game and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.

												Second best Total War title to date, second only to Rome 1. Only thing that makes it worse is the Castle/City feature, where each settlement is divided into two categories: Castles and Cities. Castles are obviously hard to attack, having up to 3 layers of walls, and recruit much better units. They are poor for getting money or raising population, you can't even set taxes to the castles. Cities recruit worse units (though depending on your faction sometimes the city parts are better than their castle counterparts, Italian Spear Milita and Venetian/Genoean Crossbowmen being examples of this) but are so much better for economy. Most of the time your armies will be composed of units that can only be recruited in castles, but if you take a city with it and lose a lot of troops there is no way to replenish them unless you send them to another castle. That is literally my only gripe with this game. Graphics still kind of hold up, even 9 (holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is 9 years old?!?!) years later. Massive scale armies are often seen, the AI isn't entirely stupid and can be logical in their choices after you think hard enough. There is a stereotype (much like Civ V) that the AI will randomly attack you for no reason, but there are always logical reasons. Either they see you as weak and easy pickings, you are attacking (and beating) one of their allies, or you've taken lands that they wanted. If you really want to avoid war with a certain faction, just avoid those three things. The game can be challenging at times, often times you will think you've won a war and then suddenly they have a full army besieging your capital, that carefully hid in the forests so you couldn't see them. The economy isn't as challenging as I'd like it to be, you can simply raise taxes as high as you can without having the happiness go below 100% (Yea for some reason the happiness can go well over 100%, it's weird) and don't garrison your cities with expensive units. As long as you're using your armies to conquer cities you'll never go into the red. The game is challenging and interesting, no two campaigns will ever be the same. A lot of things are predictable, such as for me Milan always seems to be a huge power that gobbles up France and the Holy Roman Empire with ease, and Egypt always ends up winning in the east unless the Mongols decide to head that direction (they always beeline straight for Poland/Hungary/Russia in my games and get destroyed by knights). There are in game events such as the Mongol invasion, the Black Death, the Timurid invasion, Gunpowder being invented, and you can even travel to the New World late in the game. You will quickly learn to love and hate some factions, personally I hate fighting any italian faction just because their Italian Spear Militia are rediculous and their crossbowmen do waaay too much damage without taking much in return. Overall the game is a 9,9/10 for me. It's my second favorite strategy game of all time, and there is a still active modding community that can spice up your games should you ever get bored of the same map/factions. Definetly worth the 20$, but you'll often find it on sale for much less. The DLC is definetly worth at least a try, it adds 4 new campaigns (different maps and factions, it doesn't add anything to the main game they're basically 4 smaller standalone games) which are pretty fun but a tad bit small and limited, which is to be expected given how small the regions are. If you liked any other Total War game or are interested in buying one to see if you do like it, definetly buy either this one or Rome 1 first.			"

												Great game! Good diplomacy and economy, swift battles. I repeat, it's a greaat game, if it's on sale, you should definetly buy it! Just some minor things I'd like to tell people that are intesrested:1) AI is kinda dumb, they usually tend to war more than to diplomacy. 2) Some units might get stuck and/or run towards nowhere, specially on those siege battles.3)Frozen and crashed a couple times in the lest few days, but the autosave is very good. Isn't that hard to get started, tutorial and assistant very good.Even without the DLC's you can have a great experience and tons of gameplay hours.Overall 9/10(The pope will hate you no matter what, that sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)			"

												I have so many more hours on the Non-Steam version of this game. I really liked it. It's challenging, and at some times unforgiving but it gets really great, especially on those battles that you fight really hard in and  become victorious.  I liked it, and if they came out with a Medieval 3 I would definitely buy it. (Unless Sega ruins it)9/10  would siege again			"

												Medieval II: Total War is one of my earlier games I had to get again, and now that I know more because when I WAS playing this game I was around 6 or 7, but now I understand a whole lot more and I love it again, Tons of strategy, Fighting, and more are in this game, Sadly, you control your units and not a guy. But if you want a feel how it's like playing in his eyes, Play Mount And Blade.			"

												Very good :)The game is awesome however there are a few bugs that need fixing like in sieges sometimes units would just stand on walls not attacking nor routing once their broken(This only happens with the AI on Huge scale armies). That's the only problem I have with combat against AI. Medieval 2 is a great game but there are some things that can be improved like making the units more unique because it looks weird seeing the same unit over and over again even though they're called english knights but they look the same as french nobles just with different colors and flags. Some factions have very similar colors so it can get confusing when the french and the portuguese go head to head on a battlefield. I know that's the reason why the banners are there but they dont really help when you're trying to watch the heat of battle and you dont know who's fighting.the campaign difficulty of the AI is great and is very challenging although when it comes to the battle difficulty it's lacking a little bit.It would also be great if the islamic factions would be buffed and the mongols and timurids would be playable factions because there are on 3 playable islamic factions in the game and they're all too similar.I just wish that every faction offers a different playstyle that I can adjust to. It makes the game more challenging and less repetitive if I have to change the way I plan.			"

												Heres why you should buy an play this gameIts cheap , and the stories it creates through gameplay. All I have to do is write about a battle I had in my latest Campaign as France.So I was fighting a battle against the English, these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s had to gual to stab me in the back while I was off fighting the Moor's in Spain, they laid siege to Paris. What I did was raise a small army of elite soldiers coupled with peseants and drove back there full stack army. I chased them back towards there motherland, then they decided to send ANOTHER army to back them up that was roughly half a stack, I shrugged since the combined force I had gotten from Paris was about 1 and a half stacks of troops, not only that I had feudal knights and armored swordsmen.So I started the battle and decimated the first enemy wave, not even the english Billmen could not stop my swordsmen charge, and my feudal knights broke whatever resistance was left. I had taken a decent amount of casualties, my feudal knights were a bit poorly managed and took alot of casualties and my peseants took a beating. So I reform and prepare to face the 2nd english army, the full one. What I had realized is that this full army was not a pushover, it was composed of fuedal knights, lowbowmen and even armoured swordsmen, AND EVEN ARTILLERY. I quickly matched his front line, charged and flanked with cavalry, his artillery killed over 100 men before I managed to hit it with one of my feudal knights, then I turn them unto the enemy flank just in the knick of time to prevent my men from routing, I have my general rally as well to make sure my men chase the enemy down. Once back on the campaign map, I ransom the men I captured back to england for 7,500 gold (which is alot at turn 45)other things; ♥♥♥♥ the pope if you have more than 10 regions, unlike Crusader Kings 2 there is no official way to fight factions that are christian as a christian, even if enemies are the agressor they get a free pass to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up on you while you will get commands from the pope with threat of excommunication, which is pretty bad place to be in btw.Also, this is a great mod platform. There is a LORD OF THE RINGS MOD that is amazing, as well as a Game of Thrones mod, and many more total conversions as well as basic modifications like overhauls to the game.			"

I am keeping an old laptop I have just to run this game in the future for them.If this isn't a recommendation I don't know what is. I rarely give a game a review.Enjoy!			"

												From this to Rome2/Atilla in ten years.When you come back and play this after playing the other two its hard to say that the series has improved. Graphically at least in combat ME2 looks almost as good as the others and everything else they have added in the other 2 such as agents and settlement development has been poor. Ten years and I'm still playing better mods on ME2 than the vanilla and even some mods on the other 2 combined. As much as I want Total War Warhammer too it just doesnt look that good to pay full price for.......seems the only way to play Total War is wait for the sales a year later and as this shows they dont change much for the better over the years so why not wait.As for ME2 in its day it was the Best and even now its still Great and you could easily argue as good as if not better than most of the recent Total War products...........and back in those days they used to release complete games with a worth while expansion pack.

												Now, this game is fun and addicting, even when its over half a decade old.The reason I don't recommend it is because of the ""medieval 2 has encountered an unspecified error"" crash.After 30 hours into my first campaign, I could not progress onto my next turn without running into that issue.A quick google search will show you that not only is this a common problem, but it has no solution yet. Even half a decade later.Until that changes, I would highly not recommend this game to anyone, as it is very dissapointing to not continue the empire you built.			"

												The game is clunky, at best. Trying to complete the tutorial and it won't allow it. Stuck on trying to right-click a fleet in the second mission. I can select a unit and then right-click in a big red circle, any monkey can, but this never works and I cannot progress past that. If you played this when it was new, I guess you'll like it, but it's got really bad controls and the graphics are seriously dated. Not worth buying.			"

												Ok. I'm giving this one the thumbs down because there are better TW games on the market that you should buy.Yes,  I have tons of hours on medieval II. Yes, I think it's a good game. But that's because I'm:1. A MASSIVE TW FAN2. A MASSIVE FAN OF THIS TIME PERIODSo for me, I'm probably adding 3 extra points on the scale out of 10 than a regular RTS/G.S. gamer will.Now then, I want to talk about a few things here:1. AI is BAD- - - 1.a. Campaign AI:Sometimes factions will go to war with you just because. This is a problem because weak factions will go to war with you, and then they will ask for a peace treaty. You can really game the system because you can demand money as part of the peace treaty. Soooooooo a weak faction goes to war with you and then pays you money to stop the war. That's a problem.Also, the game throws stacks at you without generals. That means those stacks always lose if you have a general.- - - 1.b. Battle AI:Battle AI is generally bad for a few reasons. [1] The game mixes unit types in armies, but some of the unit types are super weak. Specifically archers/siege units are very weak in field battles. But sometimes the AI will have a lot of ranged/siege units and just attack you even though it has no chance of winning. [2] The AI doesn't try and use the battle field terrain. You can easily manipulate the AI to give up the high ground. Also, chain routing is easy to do in this TW game, so the AI will almost always chain route if you flank properly. 2. Game doesn't make sense!Say you play Scotland. You become an ally of England. England betrays your alliance and goes to war with you. The Pope gets MAD AT YOU because you're fighting England, which is a Christian faction. So the AI goes to war with you and then gets mad at you because you're at war! 3. Rebellions/enemy agents show up just because.You can have a conetent city and a rebel army just shows up. You can have a territory that's mostly your faction's religion and an evil witch/priest will show up just because. If you set campaign difficulty to max difficulty this will happen. I understand that ""very hard"" should be very hard.... but to get rebellions when the territories are content just doesn't make sense and seems to be something they put into the game to justify the ""very hard"" difficulty setting.4. You can't customize generals.Generals will generate their own traits as they live. Sometimes the traits are useful, sometimes not so much. You don't really have control over any of this. You could make a general fight in a bunch of battles and he will naturally gain command, but you can't fine tune your generals to fit very specific roles.5. Generals die quickly.You progress through the years quickly. This is kinda sucks because you usually lose your faction leader in the early part of your game due to how old he is. Characters age quickly, so you can't get too attached to generals or use them for a very long period of time like you can in TW games like Shogun 2 - where you can use your faction leader for the entire game! This kind of makes sense because you start off in the Medieval era and your late game units are early rifle units, so it would make sense for you to burn through a few generations before you got to the late game.6. Ranged units are usually not good (not including rifles).Archers are either useful or terrible. They're useful for using fire arrows as a moral shock/setting siege engines on fire. But, they do almost no damage to enemy units. So you're always better off trying to flank an enemy army and causing it to route rather than use ranked units. In defense, a few ranged units are OK, but overall archers just aren't that great in this version of TW with the exception of a few.If Medieval II is on sale, yeah - give it a try. But if you're interested in TW and want a solid game I highly recommend Shogun 2. The AI is good, the combat is good, and the game is frequently on sale, as well as FOTS.Overall, I love Medieval II, but there are so many other better, more polished, modern Total War games you can buy and enjoy.

												Didn't think it was possible but this game is even more buggy than Rome: Total War.Don't ask me how they managed to downgrade a game in terms of bugs.Pathfinding worse than anything else:You tell a troop to go North, they go South and ride into sunset.They completely screwed over the sieges.In RTW you could capture turrets and walk on the walls.In this game the pathfinding is that buggy that you're most often unable to reach the gatehouse once you're on the wall with your troops.

												I'd heard about this game when I got into shogun 2 and I really wanted to like it but after playing shogun 2 it just isn't tolerable.The camera is painfully clunky and hard to control. It's not intuitive in the slightest and I found myself constantly having to pause just to readjust the camera so I could see what was going on.The units don't follow your commands very well, especially in seige battles, they won't form up they wander off, they go down ladders despite being set to stand guard. It's like trying to keep track of a small child in a zoo and it's just as frustrating.In the deployment phase there are areas your men should be able to stand where they simply won't do it. no explanation they just refuse to be placed where you want them. It's especially irritating when one guy of an enemy troop gets past your front line and ALL of your archers in a unit stop shooting just to fight that one guy. Speaking of archers that hand red line from Shogun 2 that tells you when you are in range? yeah that's gone you have no way of knowing just how far archers can fire and I see them constantly shooting into walls and at things they can't hit wasting tons of their ammo and doing nothing.The enemy AI is dumb as a rock, they ignore gates and funnel themselves into choke points making it really easy to win battles even when outnumbered.Overall the game feels dated and clunky especially when compared to the newer titles. I really wanted to like this game but at this point I'm 90% sure that this game's reputation comes from a nostalgic fan base and not from any real quality of the game. I'm sure it was good for it's time but considering the improvements in later games it just doesn't hold up well over time.			"

												The game is acutally OK, its not too bad, its just really realy dated... bug-wise.It seems that everything sega touches is either buggy or broken. The game has serious pathfinding problems, and the units respond strangely on the battlefield. All-in-all the battles aren't worth it, its just very predictable or downright broken.All the other aspects are ok, the graphics the sound, the presentation, its a big brand game, but it doesn't deliver really. The game pretends to be big, but its actually really, really small. And there aren't that many countries to play with, even if you count the entire map. It reminds me of Lords of the Realm 3 and how that sucked big time, but maybe I'm just spoiled by Paradox Interactive. The campain map is limiting in most ways, and the gameplay its self either has things that dont realy work for it, or that you can simply completely ignore.Maybe if this was all there was to it, ok, it could have been good... But we have Civilization 4, Europa Universalis 4 and many other real grand strategy games out there.Heck even Zeus: Master of Olympus is better than this.Big dissapointment, don't buy unless you are a TW fanatic.The game is much better/prettier/bigger if you install the Stainless Steal mod, so if you do buy it, get the mod asap.

												I've always thought Medieval II was rather bad, but after trying out newer, better Total Wars, I've discovered that Medieval II must be the worst game in the entire series. Don't get me wrong, this game would have been great if it weren't for the many oversights and bugs in it. The campaign map, meh, could be better with the AI and stuff. But what really gets to me is the ridiculously poorly made battle map. For starters, it takes ages for artillery units to prepare to fire. Imagine it, the enemy infantry is coming, and you have ballistas or later in the game, cannons, ready to fire when they get within range. The enemy is in range, but you notice that your artillery batteries aren't firing, you zoom in and it's because one guy is taking a seizure trying to get into the right position to load the artillery, when the guy should already be in position, and the artillery loaded anyway.And who the hell designed the UI? I've had this game for 2 years on Steam, and many years on CD before that, and it was only recently I learnt what I could really do on the campaign map. Due the the poor combat AI, battles are extremely unrealistic, whether it's two soldiers fighting eachother, or four armies. This is mainly because it takes hours for soldiers to do a 90 degrees turn due to the poor animations. What happened to the diplomacy? Why use ""diplomats"" on the campaign map? You should be able to contact any nation at any time. As far as I know, kings don't simply run out of diplomats. It certainly doesn't take years for them to reach another country either.Every problem I've listed here is about 10% of all problems in this game. Don't waste your money here. Total War is brilliant, just not this one. Creative Assembly, if you're reading this, please create a Medieval III so we can enjoy Total War in that time period without all of the bugs and problems. Thank you.Update: The real reason the Spanish Tercio formation failed was because in every instance, the musketeers refused to go back inside the pike square, because they were like: ""No, we're going to get ourselves killed so you lose the battle"" - And the ones who did actually go inside the square walked, despite being told to run, and unfortunately, they got run down by the enemy general's bodyguard, who, for some reason, risked his life even though he could defeat me with the bugs alone, despite the fact my army has superior training, equipment, and a tercio formation which doesn't even work.I see many people disagree with me, can somebody open up a conversation in the comments here? Because am I the only one here who has these problems with this game?			"

												I had played it a long time ago. I was recently confined to an older machine, and, being unable to play a newer TW game, I bought it on steam to replay. I was very disappointed to find it in this sorry state. At its heart, this game is as good a TW game as any, but at the same time it is thoroughly broken. I remembered this game being far from perfect, but I didn't remember it being nearly unplayable.There are many things I could mention, from disappearing units to the inexcusable lack of colour coordination of the menus. But the one thing that will really send you looking for a different TW title is the pathfinding. There's no way I can list all the things that go wrong. If you can think of it, it happens here. Ignoring commands? Sure. Spontaneously cancelling orders? Of course. Long ant-lines when turning corners? Always. How about a unit splitting into two parts that move at different speeds? How about one bugged guy sprinting in place causing your entire unit to become tired? You didn't think of that did you? Play this game and you'll learn all about broken pathfinding. Every decision you make needs to be explained to your units an average of 3 times, and, once it's working, you don't touch the unit or you'll ruin everything.			"

												I bought it.And it didn't work.Steam has done a great job legitimicing piracy.The classical argument for buying the games instead of downloading them is the guarantee that they will work and you'll support the developers.With pirated games it's not unusual that you have to deal with bugs and errors, googling for hours just to make the game work. With good reason, if you've stolen something, you don't have the privilege to use it.So why the ♥♥♥♥, valve? Why do I have to have these problems when I trust you to sell me a functional product? I paid you for this game. It's your legal responsibility that you've sold me a product which has the functionality you've marketed it with.Which is that it will:- THAT THE EXE WILL START UP AND WORK PROPERLY WHEN I CLICK PLAYThat's it. I have neither the time nor the stomach to google around for another x hours to make the game work. Who do I   contact on steam?			"

												A wargame of an exagerated fame. Decent graphics and with the good mechanics of Total Wars series, but thats is all. Maybe its wonderful for multiplayer mode, but in single player mode, the AI is cheater and treacherous: all are against the player; the enemies generate more units per turn, they come from far away left helpless his own territories to attack you, the diplomatic system is expensive, alliances are unstable and unrealistic historically...If you have played intensively the game and considerate this opinion exagerated, try with Bizantine Empire in normal level, and see what happens after turn 50 or 70...  The game breaks his own rules, and the factions shall attack to you without any diplomatic or strategic logic.There are many examples: the eastern hordes can ignore nearest, poorest or helpless factions only to search, sack or take your cities; a faction with only have one city, and no allies, can mantain two armies with expensive units, over his economic capacity; a great faction suddenly attacks you with all of his power, and soon collapses because no protect his rearguard, conquered by a lesser faction...There are a better wargame of historical medieval theme, called Kinights of Honor, that was published years before, with a more honest IA and a deeper mechanics.

Posted: September 27, 2015
												can i recommend a game where the devs has focused on mainly historic theme and feeling and forgotten all about balancing and general balanced gameplay? yes and no.When this game performs at it's best, you'll feel like a midieval commander taunting banter at your foes while you cavalry tramples them to death.Grand Campaign:like most total war games, the grand campaign is pretty straight forward. you have the tactical turn based map with figures representing armies, moving arround doing what you command them to. the build menu isn't too diffrerent if you played Rome Total war.what annoys me however is that there are a huge lack of political statistics. you never know who is on the edge to being agressive towards you because all you get is a welcomed enemy, or neutral. doesn't really tell you alot.another problem is that once you begun building up the begining of your empire, you would have to deal with the fact that 60% of your neighbourghs will almost instantly be hostile towards you, either by sending a ton of agents or simply entering an all out war with you.so now you are locked in a massive war that forces you to stay defensive for 50 turns and not expand in any way. if just one of your armies move the slightest amount towards an enemy stronghold, then they will just completely ignore the danger you put them in and attack you city. this will ultimately lead you in loop where you are stuck reclaiming and taking cities and using all of your Florins (the currecny ingame) to replenish your troops.the worst part about these wars is that a lot of the times where you ahve the advantages in unit type, strenght and numbers it can still lead to some of the nastiest possibilities you can get. expect an army of 240 knights, 80 militia and 45 archers wot win against 400 spear militia, 100 knights and a bombard? NOPEyou have the stronger units that counters the enemy in every way, but for some reason that game won't allow you to have fun and win the battles in a fair way. the reason why is simply due to the fact that some of these engages magicly halves your army so instead of having an attacking army of 350-400 you suddenly only have 250. this happened regularly and the worst part was the aftermath. because a defending army in the city was joined in, i automaticly lost the city after. this wouldn't have been so bad if the amount of troops i lost was under half of my army, but yet for some reason half of the half that didn't die was mysteriesly dispanded instead of going into the castle again.this wasn't just a one time fluke. it happened many times and not only for sieges. on top of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t battles you also run in to the fact that the enemies tend to get high end units atleast 30 turns before you do. which means that when you just got longbowmen as the brits, you are already fighting feudal knights which absolutely wreck everything you can muster at this point.now we get into multiplayer:in short a huge dislike from me about the multiplayer battles you can have.remember how broken a pike wall was in the first Rome total war? double that and you have a musket army or a crossbow army. unless you place your entire army furthest back you can, you will get attacked just after your spawn due to their overly high range. not only does crossbows have an incredible range (even outranging longbows) but also a decent firering speed, ammo capacity, accuracy and worst of all a cheap price. i made a high tech army of knights on foot and cavalry and a decent amount of cannon fodder and had almost 1000 more men that my friend (oponent) had.what he had was unfortunately 4 squads of militia crossbows. all i could see the first 2 minutes was piles after piles of dead knights and cannon fodder whilst i desperately tried to rush his crossbows to minimize damage. but when my army was locked in melee with his entire army it was too late. his crossbows had done the job and weakened my squads immensely.TL:DRDon't ever invest in this game if you want a decent game to play with and against friends and can't handle rage inducing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Authers note:This game has done what is impossible for 99% of all my games. it made me utterly violent to my environment out of pure rage over it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												I've been playing the total war games since the original and even though they all had bugs and issues I loved them none the less. Then when Medieval total war 2 was first released I bought that as well but it had more bugs than all other total war games combined and so I quickly stopped playing it.Fast pace 9 years forward and low and behold, it was on a steam sale and so I bought it again. I wish I hadn't though!My god I wish I hadn't! This game is broken in every way imaginable! I don't remember it being this bad. If I had a hard corpy I would break the cd and mail it to the developers with a note that said, fix me, I'm broken!Pro's:It was cheapThe strategy part is funCon'sUnit placement is impossible. I literally timed how long it took me to get one unit to accept the placement. I gave up!Placing Archers unit on walls makes the archers shoot up into the air instead of down at the enemy.Moving units down from the walls is impossible. See Unit placement issues above.Moving units away from imcomming enemy units has to be done an hour in advance. It doesn't respond. Takes about 10 seconds before units move after given orders. Cavalry units that are discribed as ruling the battlefield gets owned by peasants.Placing stakes in front of your own units to protect from enemy cavalry is great until you have to move your own cavalry. No matter how much space there is around the stakes. They go right through it I die.The automated battle option is completely random.Screen randomly decides to get stuck moving in one direction all the god danm time. unable to move the camera back save & load is what you'll be doing most of.I cannot recommend this game. Even if it was on a 99 cent sale I would not recommend it. Maybe they patched it wrong or whatever, but this is completely ridiculus. The game is broken and still it is being sold here.			"

												I'm sorry I guess I'm spoiled by the newer TW games; but I just can't find myself enjoying this game. The AI pathfinding is clunky and buggy, camera controls is outdated and slow. Combat is a hair-tearing affair as my units need to be told REPEATEDLY to attack an enemy right in front of them before they actually get the message. I'm playing the crusader campaign and without disabling FOW via console, the mission to send a diplomatic envoy to any unmet player is a headache as none but their capital city is shown on the unexplored terrain. That and the lack of showing roads/pathways on the map untill you're right on them could mean your diplomats are taking one heck of a scenic route as you're blindly wandering the earth hoping to bump into a city to make contact with.Yes I know this is an old as hell game, and for it's time it may have been good. But now? Get this only if you're in it for the nostalgia or just someone who wants ALL the TW games to date.			"

												Despite annoying Pope, the campaign is good. Where this game terribly fails is real time battles. I lost 99% of battles due to game bugs. You will often experience units not moving where ordered, units unabile to attack target, immobile units due to deployment on bad terrain, your siege equipment will often get stucked in streets, not aible to selecet which units will be used as reinforcements. If you play real time battles on open plain field then you are less likey to experience these problems, everyelse is pure frustration.			"

												In CA's infinite wisdom, they decided to ""patch"" the game for ""Steam integration"", which somehow involved removing trade from the game, borking the AI even further, removing a large portion of sounds, breaking a variety of mods, making it 6 times more difficult to install and play mods, adding big black textures to settlements, and f♥cking up the game's performance.Maybe this was down to gross incompetence (which any Total War player should be used to by now), or maybe this was just outright malicious behaviour to drum up support for Rome 2 (again, not a foreign concept to Creative Assembly).The fact is that Med 2 used to be the best TW game. On Steam, it's an absolute sh♥tfest. Better off pirating it.			"

												Certainly not the best total war game but it certainly deserves it's 88 metascore in my opinion.  If you like total war this is a game you should try.EDIT REVIEW:It is my opinion that CA deliberately screwed up empire, Rome 2 and the steam version of medieval 2.  The main flaw of Shogun 2(non shinto-buddhist factions always having tremendous success) was also deliberate in my opinion.  I won't go into warhammer.The current steam version of medieval 2 has severe flaws which, as I've said, I think are deliberate:-crusade ALWAYS on Cairo until it is taken-broken historical battles-other thingsI can not recommend this game in it's current state.

Medieval 2: Total War... in my opinion, is way, wayy funner online. But it's hard to find a server since lots of them are private or when you join one there's people afk. :( I'd recommend Napoleon: Total War instead which has a great campaign and great multiplayer experience.

												First off, this is a SUPERB game. However, be careful buying it in any pack because Kingdoms is apparently NOT included. I purchased the Total War complete pack and CA/SEGA decided to make it so that any games you already own, you do not get a second copy of (to give to a friend, etc). No discount. I wanted about 6 titles I didn't have anymore so I thought, ""OK, that's irritating, but I'll give it a go."" I already had Med II but it was alright because I hate patching since they don't have the official patch up anymore. When Kingdoms was listed as DLC for another $12.00 I was unamused. I'll simply reinstall my old DVD copy and patch it up. PROS: At least there's a million amazing mods for Med II, back when modding was the name of the game and CA wasn't just a dough monger looking to get another $2 here and $10 there.			"

Aspyr support said it requires video boards newer than three years old when playing on Linux. My thumb down is for this, if you want to play M2 on Linux in 2016 better make sure you own some kind of helicopter. I don't recommend this game because it cannot be played today, sure in the past it used to be great.			"

												This game is such a great concept. A no brainer, really. So whats the problem with every game in this franchise? The A.I. is also a no brainer. There is no challenge short of the lazy, overwhelm the player situation. Which is still hard since I just fought one of my armys ( around 1k troops) againts three seperate armies with 2x my numbers. I wish I could say it was because I made some impossible move that won the day. (it WAS a tough fight, toughest I have seen so far) I didn't do anything smart. I did the only thing I could do to win. Pelted the A.I from far away until they gave me no choice but to engage them. once routed, I pulled my forces back, remorfed my lines and repeated. 2 other armys form into this and it becomes more of a timing game.Right after this, I go to defend a castle under siege. The problem? EVERY TIME the computer attacks my castles, they just sit there. 100% of the time I had to go after them. At best, I can send out 1 calvalry unit to gode them into doing something, but that rarely works. They siege my castle, I have to leave the castle and go after them. yay...I would sum up the Total War fanchise as follows: great ideas, HORRIBLE execution. NONE of it matters if the computer can't at least attack you during THEIR invasion of your territory. Everything else could be prefection, but with an A.I. that does little more then shuffle it's troops around, it wouldn't matter. I hate to say it, but stay clear of the entire franchise until a new game is released that shows an A.I. I couldn't trick into drowning itself. :(			"

Generally, I let most things go and am generally nice about how I handle most games.However, I found that in comparison to the other Total War games I've played and Empire, which I own, Medieval II just wasn't that good. Mostly, I didn't like the graphics and how it was different in some controls from Empire Total War. For me, this game just wasn't worth it. Perhaps if you can get over the graphics and are willing to let it grow on you though, it may be alright.			"

It happens that already 2 years ago good people of (its still a mystery who is responsible for decesion) Valve and SEGA decided to kill it. The Total War modding community through years have brought the game to whole new level and have added an amount of content which is bigger then whole Attila. Mods like Stainless Steel or Deus lo vult will bring you unforgettable expierence. Oh, sorry, my mistake - ""would have bring"". The decision that killed the game lies in merging 2 launcher files in 1, while every single one of modds required 2 files intially. No matter how fans tried to reach devs or fix themselves - no result. And thats why I being a big fan of game have 2 hours only on it because I am SO NOT downloaded it from trackers, so i could play Darth Mod 1.4d. Nonoono thats not me. Because I am SO happy with buying the game which not works the way i hopped. Not me,again.			"

												Wow... I still remember many night hours spent with Medieval I and how much I enjoyed it... So, naturally I was pretty excited to try Medieval II...But... No 1440x900 resolution (at least I couldn't find it)... Ok, nothing too bad, will survive without everything looking perfect... Every other time I started the game, cursor location and click location were not aligned... Very frustrating... But, then again, ok, you get used to it, and it's a slow game...And, I started playing... With England... France attacked me, I started to conquer their cities, after which pope was angry... I tried to sign the white peace, and they declined... Ok, so I just conquered a few of your cities, my army is much larger then yours, and you are declining WHITE PEACE?! They attacked my army, pope excomunicated me (?!)... I conquered few of his cities, pope died, I was back in church again, new pope angry because of war, tried to sign the white peace, again... they declined (ok, suicidal idiots, I understand)... Spain allied with France, they attack, too... Try to sign peace with them, white peace, me giving tribute, they decline... Conquer 2 of their cities, and offer them all my money to sign peace, they decline...  Went ""I don't give a ♥♥♥♥""... started destroying France, and left them with 1 city... They declined White Peace again... Game is starting to be extremely funny... Ok, trying to bribe french and spanish small armies, they usually decline, or take enormous amounts of money for a 2-3 units... Not important, anyway... I attack French last city... My enormous army is crossing the bridge, they are bribed... All of them... Ok, I have another one in vicinity, will attack with them while I gather more troops... They cross the bridge and are bribed... By whom!? How?! What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with that river?!So, this is the most annoying thing that happened... There were more small things... Much more... On the other hand, I understand that people will like the battle parts of this game, and I cannot say too many things about it, because I don't play it...I hate this game... it's definitely the worst strategy game I have ever played... Buy Knights of Honor if you want something similar but good (not just good, it's a great)... Of course, I can always recommend Crusader Kings II, as one of the best games ever made...			"

												I like the game, but I hate the fact that I have ask Steam  to let me play my game before I'am allowed to play it.   The fact that I have log into Steam and steam then check what other games  I have on my PC and what is hooked up to my network, makes me not want to paly.    To me it takes all the joy of playing this game, and it's the reason why I don't buy any of the new games because of the being froced to use steam and then being forced to log in  and be online, just to play my games.   It sucks , and makes this game suck, and it really just drive me and other persons at my school to buy the new games from the Jewish kids that are set up so you don't have log in or be online to play them.

												From Rome total war I was going into this game with excitement and high expectations, I saw videos on it and it looked awesome. Get straight into the grand campaign, hard difficulty, no tutorial and ready for some world dominance. Nope. Major dissapointment. The Graphics are alright, but the user interface is disgusting its as if they went backwards with it. The settlement system took a little getting use to but sought of worked itself out. Diplomacy and religion - no negatives there. The biggest drawback is the battle gameplay, clumsy, incoherent, dissorganised - hate it. This really spoiled the game for me. A few hours in and thats all I will be giving this game.			"

												I just can't get the thing about TW series. The first Shogun I played for a while when it came out was fun, but sequels are just jarringly boring. The strategy aspect of the game is just uninteresting and has no impact on anything you do. You will develop every city in the same way, stack a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of units, assasinate the enemy army leader and enter the battle and winning via circling bumblingly unable AI troops. After few historical battles and after a while in the grand campaign I gave up. If I want to play strategy, I will play EU4 or any other Paradox game.As to battle layer of the game, Cossacks 2 are so much better and go actually beyond ""flank the enemy and masturbate"" than any of the TW game (I don't know about Shogun 2 though). There's nothing more depressing than 4 soldiers fight while the rest just stand there waiting for their turn.			"

												Medieval 2 was probably the biggest dissapointment in the Total War series for me personally. Certain aspects of the game just really didn't fit in, like the castle/town conversion and just the feel of combat in general was a huge turnoff for me. It just feels like they wanted to add in some new features, but it ended up being poorly executed and unnecessary in the long run. Mods help improve the experience quite a lot, but the game simply wasn't as fun as other Total War games.			"

												This has got to be the worst installment of the Total War series ever. As a massive fan of the series, his game really ruined the whole experience for me. The AI is atrocious, the units feel like empty sock puppets that never actually contact the enemy and just play their own dumb animations, they move so slowly that most of the time im playing it on 6X speed for any progress to be made. The AI, oh my. All your units have the IQ and memory span of a Dory fish, meaning they will obey your command for about 6 seconds, then abruptly stop for no apparent reason. I have to keep furiously clicking on an enemy unit for them to actually continue attacking/pursuing. The game, especially the combat just doesnt have a solid feel, its like playing with paper if you know what i mean. There are also stability issues, meaning it will freeze every few hours or so, this is very annoying. With more than 800 hours into the total war series (both on this computer and my old one), i cannot recommend this game. If you must, but it at 90% off. Thats all its worth.Edit - lol at all these fanboys attacking me. I learned a long time ago to ignore people of lesser intellect and to do/say what i want. Thats how i made my fortune, and thats why im fully retired before 30.			"

I enjoy being able to make choices such as what to do with prisoners however I suggest saving your money for a newer total war such as Shogun 2 or Rome 2.			"

												Possibly the best strategy/management game ever, the later games just do not have the same flair or scale and don't capture the same feel. There is nothing quite like being a fully armoured crusader charging into battle atop your warhorse while commanding an army!  The overall graphics are great given the age of the game they hold well against the test of time. The managing aspects of the game do not fall to many of the traps that other titles do and works brilliantly well. 9/10			"

As always Total War is known for being a giant in the world of Strategy gaming. This game is even worth considering putting XP back onto a decent computer just to play this game.			"

												Limitless replay value. My favorite of all TW games, I've found the AI works best with campaign difficulty set to Hard (this prevents AI from stacking tons of siege weapons) and battles set to Very Hard. There are plenty of mods but not integrated to steam workshop like the newer TW games, but worth giving a try. It's essentially Civ without map tiles, and battles are fought on landscapes generated mirroring the world map (i.e. If you are near/on a mountain or forest, that battlefield is going to have steep slopes or heavy foliage respectively) which works well, as most open field battles never feel the same. Sieges of towns and cities share similar layouts, however there is the opportunity to siege settlements a variety of ways: ladders, siege ram, siege towers, Spy infiltration, various siege units i.e Trebuchets, Catapults, Ballistae, Cannons.

												Medieval II Total War is a RTS (real time sratergy) of sorts that lets you play as one of the medieval super powers of that age, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.For example France has the best knights in the game but suffers when it comes to infantry whether they be archers or spear men. But England has worse knights but better foot soldiers.When starting the game the player has a number of options (besides the options menu and quiting the game of course). I have not covered  multiplayer in this review as I have no idea if any of the public servers work as I have never tried any of them,  but the single player,  oh boy i can tell you,  that it is good.First off the game gives you a custom battle mode. So, if you ever wondered what it would be like to have an army of nothing but peasants charge a fully equipped renaissance castle filled to the brim with archers with flaming arows, now you can find out!Then there's the campaign which might be confusing to some, but I suggest either looking up some hints and tips on the forums or replaying the tutorial. The campaign also has diplomacy, and very good diplomacy at that. And the best part is, the A.I does make deals with you that are in your favour, such as giving you gold or line of sight to where they live if you ally with them. As well as that there are spies for taking a peek at what your foes are doing and how big a force they have, as well as assasins for when you just need to go all stabby, stabby on that certain duke or king.Even though the graphics are not up to date whith what todays graphics are, they still look good even if you zoom right in on people's faces.That, and the way a castle looks when you bring its walls down with everyone on top falling through the new hole you just made, is awsome.The game also involves a lot of strategy. I can tell. And even if you sort of suck at it, like I do, you can still have a lot of fun witth this game. Basic tactics (allthough not as good) can still win you the game, at least against the medium A.I. as charging your entire hourse-back army down a hill to smash into your foe's unprotected rear is a tactic.Also, this game handles flaming projectiles really well, as hitting your enemy's peasants feels really satisfying, as well as making you really glad that you are not one of  those poor fools. This goes for catapults and trebuchets as well, exept bigger and much more deadly ones. You can also make enemy siege weapons burn down, which makes you feel like such a troll to the stupid A.I.  As you say ""nope!"" as your archers burn down an entire siege tower and the men who were just using it are forced to use ladders, only to be poked to death by your spear-men, now waiting at the top for them.So, all in all, I give it a 9/10 as there are some things that bug me a little, such as 1 guy with a leather shield blocking 10 arrows at once or a knight in full plate-mail bursting into flames at the first fire arrow.

												1) Start a game without Tutorial as Engliand2) Subdue all rebels on the isle3) Scot got angry with a bit spying and declare war, but they were my next target anyway4) Catch Edinburge off guard and its best general & army turned rebel and was soon crushed5) Try to be a good neighbour and quietly buide the Kingdom while building Watch Tower to get sight around the place6) Subdued a rebel city near France border and learnt that it was apparently theirs somehow.7) France invade without so much as giving a warning; trying to lay seign to a mainland fortress8) They were crushed and I retaliated by capturing theirs.9) Pope got angry; got excommunicated, but soon reconciled anyway. However Papal State seem determined to take France side by forcing me to make peace with them (unsuccessfully too since they're stubborn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)10) Annoyed with Popes, so assassins were sent to keep killing them (Yes plural!!) while making gain in France territory.11) Holy War against Cairo Declared and I was forced to take part in the campaign, so I gathered knights and Bowmans on the isle and made way downward. Somewhere along the way, Cairo got captured by Pole, so hey it's better this way, and I turned to France instead; keep killing French till they had one city left.12) Holy Roman Empire annoyed I try to eliminate her best friend, so she declared war, her army quickly repelled while Mongol invasion plagued the Eastern EU and the England was safely guarded behind the front line.13) Oh lucky number 13, I'll set sight on everything that's HOLY. First pillage Rome and sack Papal City. Second, Crushed the Holy Roman Empire while gaining friends in Dense, Morese, and Milan.To glory!Update 29 Nov, 2015With the entirety of Western Europe in the Great England's clutch; stretching from Scotland to Florence and from the edge of Southern Mediteranian Sea to the border of near-collapse Poland,Great English spreaded out to confront ever-growing menace of Mongol while at the same time confronting Jihadists Muslim at the heart of Holy Land Jerusalem. Friendship between Papalcy and England grew stronger than ever; twice the Crusade were called in English name, and twice it succeeded in distracting enemy from England's grand plan. The will of England is the will of Europe, and by extension; Papalcy.History is shaped by English hand.			"

												This game is probably one of the best Total War games to date. It takes the simplicity and fun from Rome and provided the much-needed improvements that are still present in the new games, such as recruiting more than one unit at a time and implementing actual fighting animations rather than just watching some Principes poke the air in front of some hoplites. Great game over all and a ton of fun to get in to, though the relations between nations and the random declarations of war tied with the fact that the starting nations are limited by threats of excommunications sometimes makes me want to cringe. Definitely a must-have for Total War fans and history geeks alike.			"

												Although i personally prefer the newer, Shogun Total war installment of the series. This game has definitely got to be up there as one of the best games i have ever played, and especially as a strategy game. Medieval 2 definitely satisfies more than one of the gaming tastebuds, with great gameplay whilst also being a rather pretty game to look at, with its rather impressive graphics. I would reccomend this game to anyone interested in the franchise, who loves strategy games and also to anyone who loves a certain aura of historical accuracy in terms of certain events and being able to play key historical battles. ALSO this game has some pretty nifty mods and expansion packs available so although the story will end. It will take a bloody long time to get there so you can be sattisfied for hours on end. Personally i reccomend getting hold of the Kingdoms expansion and then downloading the Third Age Total War mod, because it is bloody epic!  8/10			"

												Medieval 2, like any game in Total War series combines Global Campaign strategy with individual battle tactics. So far, it's the only series that do justice to the concept. It leaves a special feeling as you build up cities and castles, hire armies and send them out on conquests or to defend your own lands. Game maintains the sence of epicness in every aspect, from your expansion across Europe to massive battle where thousands of soldiers face of against each other. Though the ""thousands"" part is dependant on what setting you select in unit scale option.While the only competitor to this game is only the later installments of Total War series, so many  flaws arise as you progress through the campaigns:  The AI is overly poor. Both in battles and campaign.  Diplomacy is rudimentary at best.  As you expand, your play session becomes a micromanagerial nightmare.  Attacking and defending castles, rather than playing out as multilevel dramas where armies fall back to secondary gates, or fight for each cross street, turn out to be decided at the main gate or outer wall. The complexity of highly developed citadels seems like a wasted opportunity.   Religion and Pope mechanism while novel at first, later on either becomes too easy to exploit or an absolute niusance.With all it's flaws and shortcommings, unfortunatelly there isn't a better game of this nature. Not outside Total War series atleast. "

												This game is worthy, very good at its time, still fun. Yet the strongest reason to buy this game is the mod Europa Barbarorum II mod, which is one of the most EPIC games ever made even if its a mod, its better than retail version. Also there is a Warhammer mod for this game called Rage of the Dark Gods which is another reason to get this game.			"
