Posted: September 20, 2014
												First up, I am writing this review as how it plays today.  It's annoying reading someone's review and it starts out something like this:  ""I remember when this first came out and blah blah blah""  and they're reminiscing of the good old days and basing their review on the experience they had when it was new.  I mean, the original Wolfenstein and Doom was awesome back in its time but to rate it on todays standards they're pretty crappy..  Although this game is dated in its appearance, it is stll loads of fun!  You can literally sit on it for hours it's one of those games you lose track of time with as you start to hear birds outside for the sun is coming up.. I have this game on GoG but got it in a package here on Steam, and after reading in other people's reviews they said its buggy and keeps crashing, I thought I'd test it out to see if it runs OK.. Well, 4 hours whooshed by as I got stuck into a new game of it as a blacksmith, worked my way up to goldsmith and now I'm looking for a wife coz if you dont have any kids there's no one to carry on your business and estates! As for bugs and/or crashed?  Zero.. Game runs fine on Windows 7 with a nvidia graphics card.  The graphics are quite dated as to be expected it's over 10 years old.  Perhaps other users didn't run the graphics first time set up correctly?  It does ask for your primary graphics, and an option when you click play ""Launch with newer graphics card""...  Well everyone's rig is different so who knows what is conflicting with them, but as for me I didn't have any problems but I'm sure there are ways to fix it if you do experience any faults.The learning curve seems a bit steep at first.  If you jump into a new game with no knowledge how the mechanics work I doubt you will get far.  There are tutorials to go thru accessed in the main menu, enough to get you started and once you pick it up you can lose yourself in the game.  And there always seems to be new stuff to discover.  For example, you can run for government positions and the higher up you go, there are more perks such as additional income, and abilities to change tax rates, laws, etc..  So when you start a new game, you choose what profession you wish to be.  Blacksmith, Carpenter, Perfumer, Priest, Gravedigger, just to name some.  Each profession has different things to be done, and has different benefits that can help you.  And example here would be a carpenter can make a toy, and usually you would sell them at the marketplace but if you have kids, you want them to be happy and do well so you can give them as a gift.  You can still do that as a blacksmith but you would just have to buy the toy at the sell price from the marketplace.  A goldsmith can make jewellery to woo a potential wife, and so on.  There is so much to do in this game, while you're expanding your business, hiring more employees, improving your workshops, buying raw materials, selling finished products, extending your home, learning new skills, blackmailing an official, bribing a judge, finding a wife (especially good if she is rich, boost the ol' bank ballance!), having some kids, putting them though school, making sure they get into the best university so when you kick the bucket they have the best stats you can give them and then you carry on the game as them!Starting a new game as a different profession is almost an entire new game in itself.  Choosing a city to start in determines the difficutly, building areas, size, etc.. I haven't even tried them all yet, some are more difficult and require a whole different approach.  Some differ as in the trade you choose, the products and materials needed are different, as a thief you are pickpocketing and scouting homes and businesses, robbing trade carts, etc.  As a grave digger you're digging up bones and making stuff with it, as a priest you're in a church making paper and writing scrolls.. It really is pretty addicitive, and not quite like any other game.  It's very complex but only as much as you want it to be.  You can go thru an entire game just growing your business buy making and selling stuff... Or you apsire to be emperor, climbing your way up the political ladder, gathering dirt on your opponents, starting rumors, sabotaging, and all sorts of stuff... And if you pick it up on special for $1.99 like it is now, it's well worth it.. And if you're too late and it's back to its normal price of $9.99 then pop it on your wishlist and wait for the xmas sales ;)			"

												One of the best (if not the best) Simulation/strategy games I have ever played and I'm finally glad they added it to steam.I wouldn't even lie if I said I have at least 500+ hours on this game alone and while I played The Guild 2 a lot I still find The Guild 1 much more enjoyable then its sequal.Although this game is not for everyone I will still HIGHLY recommend playing this one if you want to try it out or if in fact you do love these types of games.Be aware though that you are going to put a lot of hours in a single playthrough.Here are my Pros & Cons with at least 500 hours+ of game time.Pros:- Different businesses/maps to start out.- Random events that can turn in or against your favor.- Courting, No need to feel down if you think you will lose everything cause your character died, have a child!- Offices in which you can rise high and become an important person - Set tax rates, building rates, allow dueling, and lots more, each office has it own powers.- Blackmail/bribe/spy on people and there is a lot more you can do.- Each profession has its ups and downs which also sets the difficulty, want an easy game? try thieves or priests, want a harder game? try landlord or a tailor.Cons:- Graphics, it is an old game.- Bugs, You will encounter bugs im pretty sure of it.- Some people seem to have a lot of problems running this game (I'm playing this game fine on a 21:9 screen with an Nvidia 970 card).- As a first time player it is incredible hard to get to know the game.

												First let me say I've never played this when it came out, so this review wont have any nostalgia.Pros:One of the best resource management games I've ever played.Really makes you feel like you're running a single business not a whole country like most of these types of games.Can speed up gameplay if you wish, so you don't have to wait too long for something to finish.Very intersting and unique jobs.Good trading system.Better than it's sequel in my opinion.Cons:Old and graphics are very dated.Can crash on ocasion.Has some bugs, and no mods or patches that fix them.Is very addictive.Overall I think this is a very good game.

												A lot of people complain about constant crashes. I have only encountered 2 so far, it DOES pay to save often, especially after major events, because, crashes not withstanding, you could literally get robbed or drop dead at any moment.Don't forget to get married and have kids to keep the dynasty alive.

												I waited to write my review until i had finished my first game. After finishing it and starting this review I realize i'm kinda sad/dissappointed that its done and that i had failed to have a child. But that feeling makes me want to have another go!So time for the real review. My first game took 6 hours to finish (for me that is alot)I would classify this game as a ""Lemonade stand"" game only you can burn down other ""Lemonade stands"" build more stands and there is politics involved. What suprised me was the depth that this game had and how much strategy you had to use to plan ahead the future of your character. Your first game will be rough, at the start you won't know what to do and you'll make mistakes! That is what makes this game fun though is how you learn from your mistakes and how Happy you'll be once you get past 10,000$! Now this game isn't for everyone and I would recommend getting this game on sale bundled with Guild II.			"

												A nice Medieval life simulator. It is quite old, so the graphics - especially the people animations - are almost painful to look at, while the buildings are still more or less ok. It is fun, even if on the long run it can get a bit boring; all in all, there is not that much that you can do: evolving your buildings, micro-managing the production of some goods to sell, fighting to rise the social ladder applying for jobs in the Empire. Someone really needs to explain to me why if you play in London, the highest authority is the Emperor - meaning the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, of which England has never been a part...I bought it together with The Guild II and all its expansions; I am pretty sure those are gonna have more to offer, but for less than 1 euro it was definitely worth my time!

Use the thieves to kill a robber den, take control of it, and steal essentially 5 dollars from some hated dude. Suddenly im thrown into court and have my hands chopped off.10/10 would train an army of thieves again			"

												I really like this game, and don't recommend it because it has a particular taste and is overpriced. If you really want a business sim in the 1400's, then this might be for you. If you are willing to do some odd workarounds and have patience with flaws then it's definitely for you. The core of it, a business sim, is still very good.The game is buggy and unfriendly and has a lot of things going on that it is hard to keep up the patience with. The UI is very very poorly designed - you can learn to like it, but it will take some time. Early game is somewhat ruined by the blatant cheating from the AI. Late game is somewhat ruined by the lack of working auto-features that makes you have to micromanage a lot of things. Sometimes you need to save and reload to be able do do stuff or progress. I hear that it doesn't work with all windows versions either, so check that before you buy it.And disregard my hours of play, I've had it before I got it on steam.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played.It's a terrible shame what has happened to it. It's more likely to fall apart than your great grandma, and steam hasn't done anything about it.Most people won't even be able to play it, out of the box, because you'll immediately be grappling with CTD and graphical errors (it crashes on widescreen monitors, unless you force it to play in a window, by editting the .ini file).Even after that, expect to grapple with the controls and the manual (if you can find it).But, if you like medieval settings, or mercantile simulations, or marrying wealthy widowers, just to quietly poison their tea, this is the game for you. This game is the store bought apple pie, to Dwarf Fortress' ""First you must create the universe"".			"

												Oh boy, One of my favorite all time games is finally on steam and im already hooked back into it. Dont let the time count fool you i played the original Guild for easily over 1k+ hours back during high school (minus all the patches...) and now we have a fully patched and somewhat great release of The Guild Gold on steam.I wont ramble too much but heres the jist of the game: You are a poor boy from a poor family out in the forest that comes to the big city to make yourself into something. Sounds simple right? Nope! you cant make yourself super big and successful on your first character so youll be making a Dynasty in the city you'll be playing in to which there are several cities spread across Europe who have their own politics and events to deal with with one of them being other dynasties.One of the great things about The Guild is that not only are you trying to run your business and not go broke, you also have to not only contend with other dynasties in the same town but also regional politics, everyone can at some point be eligible for every job in the game except for the Emperor/King itself, so while you are climbing the political and economic ladders your opponents and friends in other dynasties will be doing the same, it helps keep the game competitive as it wont take long for you and others to carve battle lines throughout the town (You and your allied Dynasties vs the others).The game with the expansion pack which is part of the Gold edition allows for a variety of careers to play with, some are downright impossible to play due to being at the mercy of the marketplace or the one place that you and 5 other dynasties are buying stock from while others are so laughably easy that once you have several of these businesses running you only need to focus on politics or underhanded methods to screw around with other dynasties.But as this is quite an old game it does have its problems, Gold does work on Windows 7 but for some it requires changing the desktop to 16bit to actually play, the game (as well as its sequels) were notoriously buggy at release and while the current final version of gold to my knowledge is bug free keep an eye out while playing as well as save often.All in all a very enjoyable and comfy game, definitely worth a buy so you can chill out and build your business as the seasons roll on by.

												I used to love this game as a child. The act of struggling through medieval europe as a craftsman; and all the buying, making and selling made this game very appealing. The charm is still holding its own. But as I progressed through the game, the many bugs became more and more apparent. For example, if you assume trading or banking, the game starts crashing frequently. Recently I played as showman and went on to own all the showmen's in london. And even though all of them were being run by master craftsmen (not as productive as me) and I was managing only one, the market actually became short of raw materials particularly gems were were low in quantity and meanwhile the quarry had become stuck on iron and silver production (at 17%). Even worse, I nearly had full storage for products (because I had enough money to go by easily and was waiting for the best prices to sell my products); then I switched to master craftsman for a while. He instantly dumped all my products (didn't even sell them) which was worth at least a million pounds.These bugs are only one of the few but they ruined the game for me. Even though I'm in love with this game, I just don't feel like playing it again anymore.I wish the developers had paid more attention to the technical details, because this game had a lot of potential. Its one of the few wasted games of our time (including trade empires by eidos).I wouldn't recommend serious gamers because of the bugs. But if you wanna kill time then go ahead and buy it when its on sale.			"

This fixes the issue for me and it runs perfectly smooth. :)			"

												Really pleasantly surprised with this one, and having a good time with it.  Came in with low expectations, and it's been a gem so far.  Interesting enough to play with my 10/13-year-old boys, and captures their interest too.  Has a lot of character and charm to it, and the occasional understated humor keeps it lively.  UI is definitely...  not quite painful, but uncomfortable and quirky.But the UI aside, it's just delightful with its variety and little surprises.  I love the variety there is between how the game plays with different professions.  I just wish multiplayer worked, but I guess when I get to The Guild 2 I'll do it there.The more I play it, the more I love it.  Heartily recommended.  You *will* have to be patient at first as you scale the learning curve, but it's very much worth the climb.sgd. Adulterator Luckspeare			"

												This game is probably best for those who like simplistic life simulation games. Pros: The ability to control politics, effect a town's growth, effect a town's crime, buy out an entire city, bribe, blackmail, kidnap, manipulate laws for your purposes, burglarise buildings, loot caravans, run a legitimate buisness, mediocore voice acting, level up system, become a ""Gold Digger"",etc. Another nice feature is that wars and other historic events happen ""behind the scenes"" and can affect your city.Cons: Somewhat dated graphics, slight learning curve (there are several tutorials though), simplified family tree, and quite a terrible combat system(not that you will usually be in combat often).For an example of what is possible, I had a guy who married a princess, outlived her, used her money to bribe his way into politics and bought a castle, set law severity to very high, and framed all my opponents, giving them the death sentence and winning the game. Occasionally though, enemy dynasties will die out on their own if they don't have any children. Overall, if the Guild 2 is too difficult for you or you are looking to get into the Guild series, I reccommend you try this one to lessen the learning curve before going back the the Guild 2,			"

												I am truly amused at how this game works. There are a few flaws, such as on a newer pc you may have to launch through steam to access the newer graphics card option. Otherwise your frame rate will be terrible along with sluggish performance. I do wish it went into a little more detail on each occupation and how the economics works however it is easily a fun and time consuming game. I would give it a 7 out of 10 given the small flaws it does contain.			"

												I play a lot of strategy games. More specifically, I play a lot of medieval themed strategy games. AoE, Civ and the like. This game had all the tags of a game I would enjoy, and indeed I have. It does tend to crash sometimes, but for an older game running on a modern computer that's to be expected. This game puts you as the head of a dynasty, starting off with one profession and business and developing into something more. Meanwhile, you are free to become elected within the town government. There are items to buy to help you and hinder your enemies, random chance events , the Black Plague visits every so once in a while and ambushes to avoid. It can be a lot at first, but once you get into it, it's a really immersive strategy game to play. Take my advice and don't forget to marry and have at least one heir to your dynasty.			"

Nope, crash on start.It seems Nvidia is not big on supporting older direct X games while AMD is fine even with the newest cards.But even with AMD, the resolution you will get is capped at 1156xYYYY and you will get troubles with dual monitors and fullscreen.

Time to start game.Why the hell is nothing confirmed in this game?Create the first heir to the glorious Dynasty of Donway, the honorable thieves.The dude is around 20 but looks like he's around his 60-70's...Oh well.Spend 5-10 years wondering how to court women.Smooth as ♥♥♥♥.Okay, I'm getting this game.So... My dude has been dying for 10 years now :lMy dude is over 70-80 years old, he is dying, but refuses to kick the bucket.I tried to jump from the window to my death.I can't, I am too weak.Oh... Better walk to the den of my thieves and tell those slackers to go to work.My glorious Donway is nearing an honorable age of 100 in a few turns.♥♥♥♥, my heirs are getting old as well.Spam the window, trying to jump from it.In the beginning of every turn, a notification appears, telling me I'm dying soon.""Yeah, I've been doing that for the past 20 years now.""Quit the game.Start it the next day or so. Smirk as the desktop flashes when you skip the intros.""You are now... Dead""Oh... So now the geezer kicked the bucket. K.Pick the next heir.Continue on the honorary path of thieves.Name everything you come in contact with ""Donway"". Except for the dens of thieves, 'cause that'd be suspicious, yo.Figure out some puns for those. Those city guards will never get those, hehee!Advance your way to a prince.Nice.A nice, young, talented heir.Marry him to some nobody from the street.They aren't having séx and babies, nor did I gain any money from this.Divorce would cost me a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money.""I KNOW! I'LL POISON THE ♥♥♥♥♥! HER FAULT FOR FALLING TO MY FLATTERY!""Proceed to poison the wife for 10+ years, with the strongest poisons available.She's not dying.♥♥♥♥...Conclude that the Donway-family has something to do with immortality.The ♥♥♥♥♥ probably got infected with immortality when she had séx with my fabulous, gypsy-looking prince.Game gets tired of my immortal family-line and unsuccessful poison attempts.Starts crashing every turn.10/10Being immortal is fun.But seriously, it's a fun game, especially if you play it with your friend and just laugh at the stuff happening. (Not sure how's the co-op of this one :l I think it used gamespy... I tried to play Guild II with a friend, but that didn't work. AT ALL. So, get a younger brother or someone behind your back, or a friend who doesn't mind watching you doing stuff *krhm*a voyeur*krhm*.Expect it to crash every few dozen of turns, but worry not, it autosaves at the beginning of each turn.It started crashing for me so often around 1650-1700 that I didn't have the patience to play it through to the 1800 anymore, I went and tried Guild II's singleplayer.Though, if you want it, I'd recommend waiting on sale. It has bugs and seems a bit unpolished for it's price.			"

												I remember playing this years ago  "" The Guild Gold Edition"" is unlike any other age of empire games, "" i love age of empires "" The Guild is awsome because it has extra features. its pretty kewl. Good memories and great game! xDEdit 7/30/2016, to those who dont know the gameplay of "" The Guild "", I said it is similar in a way that you have to create units, attack, defend, as well as your own character who grows old and dies but this feature is not in age of empires, only in "" The Guild "" but still very kewl. My review explains In my opinion that in a way the gameplay of "" The Guild "" is like age of empires but with added extra features, that is all			"

												This game is so awesome! The Guild is more simple and relaxed than The Guild II. There is more time to enjoy the story of your character and the lore. In my opinion The Guild is also more completed and structured than The Guild II.			"

												I really want to like this game, but I cannot even play it properly.  During the intial install, if you have a graphics card that can support dual monitors, there is a drop down with your graphics card listed twice.  Out of curiosity I picked the second option.Now, the game movies will play on my primary monitor as they should.  But the game itself plays on my secondary monitor.  I have never found that drop down again, even after uninstalling and reinstalling.  So I cannot recommend this game if it won't even let me change something like which monitor it plays on (AFTER FIRST GIVING ME THAT OPTION AT SETUP!)If someone can tell me how to fix this issue, I will change my recommendation.

												It will take at least a full game or two (or three) before you have any idea what you are doing, but even before you learn the ropes, The Guild gold can be strangely addictive but yet has so many rough edges that you might not want to play it at all. The biggest gripe I have with this game, that you can't alt-tab or run in windows mode. Before the gold edition, you could fix this problem with a registry edit. However, with the gold edition, the developers took that option away. Because of that, I refuse to recommend this game. It's not a bad game, it's the kind of game that either enthralls you for days on end or drives you up the wall to gnaw at the curtain rods. Regardless, the developers are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for disabling alt-tab and not including a windows mode. My advice, get this game in a humblebundle and make sure all the proceeds goes to charity. The developers deserve nothing!			"

												This game is balls. To play multiplayer, I had to download a program to emulate a LAN and edit the INI file, because the game is configured by default to load multiplayer files from the E drive. When I finally got it working, the loading screen to get in took an eternity. When I finally started playing, the game had a network error and closed almost immediately. Out of 10, I`d rate this game balls/10.			"

												The game is much better then Guild II, but, unfo, is higly bugged. Can't recommend it.I can't really recall all of the bugs, but game crashed few times and it corrupted my save - all under an hour. That was enough for me to refund.			"

												Much patience is required to sit through the klunky tutorials, only to be finally delivered to an unremarkable game with graphics that would have been considered poor even at the time of its first release.  Make any changes to graphics options and the game may not open and has to be uninstalled and reinstalled for any chance of playing again.  All in all, a typical JoWood ""kiss of death"" game -- most of the games this company was involved with or collaborated on at the time earned bad reviews, and from this one you will understand why.  Almost no effort has been put into making it good.			"

												Its an over complex game thats fiddily and hard to get into for beginnersand takes a long time for you to get anywhere.  I don't want to put it down because its just not my game, thats it so I'm not going to do an over the top negative review of both good and bad things, its just not for everyone.  I count myself as an ""casual gameplayer"" and feel this one isn't for me.  Therefore I presume its not for a lot of people.  I feel this is a game you'll love if you like it, but for 75% of the gamers out there, its not for them. "

												Now I have not played this game when it first came out. So you don't have to worry about me having any nostalgia.This game is amazing and they did a very good job making it. Not as many bugs as lets say The Guild II, (I am hoping that The Guild III will be better.). 7/10 That is my best review for this game there are a few things that made it not as good. Like the controls you right click to exit the window. And to rotate well I don't know how! So if you like the Guild series this is a total buy! And remember...Stay Pika!			"
