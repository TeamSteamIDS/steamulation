												After playing this game for a good amount of time and pursuing to beat it on Hard, I've noticed this game isn't the failure that most people deem it to be. In order to play this game, there must be a basic understanding of proper guerilla warfare, and knowing this is VERY useful. This game is not for everyone however. This game is a test of skill for those who are familiar with the Men of War series and its mechanics.A few thoughts after in-depth play (Post Scriptum Edition): First of all, if you can earn every achievement without cheating, kudos to you. It is not an easy task to earn all of these achievements, because the final US Mission can be quite intimidating on Hard difficulty. Expect to be screaming, ""OH MY GOD IT'S LIKE THE FALL OF SAIGON BUT WORSE!"" at the end.Second, a quick reading of Sun Tzu's Art of War woyld be useful. You'll know what part I'm referring to if you do read it.Third, the game is not broken. I've played it with no issue, so it seems the problem is originating from the user. Sorry, but that's the case. It certainly is not your average Men of War game, so I can understand why people would say this. Compared to Men of War: Condemned Heroes, which is coined as being another 'impossibly difficult' entry in the series, this game is flawless. I think the struggle players encountered with this game is symbolic. The United States certainly did struggle in Vietnam. Everything was about winning through attrition... the player has to win a mission of attrition as well because of how long a single mission can take without losing a single squad member. This was probably not intentional on the developer's part, but still an interesting characteristic.Men of War: Vietnam offers a unique experience that is not for everyone. If you are new to the series, please take care to avoid this game. This was my first game I bought in the Men of War series, and it was a bitter mistake at first, because most of my time was spent figuring out how to play the game. Definitely don't want to do that here.			"

												Awesome game, have'nt ploughed the hours into this like other MOW titles. However that is not to say this game isn't just as good as it predecessors. I stalled from buying this game for such a long time due to negative reviews and people rating it as 'too' difficult.That is part of the games attraction surely, something that presents itself as a challenge? Single player the game is great but multiplayer is where it shines. On comms with a mate (or mates) this game is just as good as the other MOW titles. infact I love the weapons on offer. So it is more unique and in a very politically sensitive backdrop.I would recommend this game as it is very much in th eflavour of all other MOW games, expect the high detail, anticipate the challenge and also the beautiful levels of micro admin. These series of games offer something very unique and it should be experienced with good mates who you can trust to run through in coop. Not some randoms who want to charge through it guns blazing. Digest the intel, scan the map and devise your path of action and you will be rewarded. Run in without covering your arcs and setting up fall back points for certain missions and you will fail miserably. COOP MP is a must, 4 of you working in unison is brilliant as you can set up multiple ambush points and often smash the enemy in one action, with a well coordinated strike.A great game, as the rest.

												As an Infantryman I love this game.  I have read alot of negative reviews on this game but for many of the levels I have found that a simple flanking manuever or a well executed ambush does the trick.  Still it is very hard and even when you plan and execute perfectly you can still take caualties which is frustrating considering you definatley do not ever have a 3:1 ratio   against your enemy, so save often!  The thick jungle while making it difficult to see at times is an invaluable asset and greatly contributes to the success of the players in the mission where guerilla style tactics are a must.  Overall one of the better RTS games I have played.			"

												Like the United States Army, I came back from the jungles of Vietnam with a bloody nose. This game is for Men of War fans who want more emphasis on small squad tactics and less huge battles. I personally love the jungle canopy as it makes things more challenging by simulating how hard it is to see and maneuver in a jungle environment. Overall its a very good game.			"

												MOW Vietnam is a good, stable solid game.  The mechanics of play are solid enough and the UI is basically same as the other in the series.  What makes this game interesting, is playing in the Vietnam War era.  Not many games touch on this time and more should.  So, at least for now, its a unique game that does a better than fair job in giving you the feeling of fightiing in that era.  Have fun!			"

												Guerilla Warfare from the US side (VERY CHALLENGING), and full fledge combat from the NVA side (mostly). Overall it's a decent game, very slow and tactical.  MP doesn't work since the GS shutdown and Co-Op is a mediocre experience compared to MoW AS, and the original. Buy it on sale.			"

												A really nice strategy game. Each mission you have a limited amount of people. Most of the time is 7 people vs 150 people. Each of your guys are good with certain weapons. This game you must take your time on trying to beat. The missions can take roughly and hour to beat.

Men of War: Vietnam Review - Rating: 7.8/10General ImpressionMen of War: Vietnam is a pretty nice strategy game. The graphics and the textures are relatively nice. The atmosphere mostly happens in jungles, obviously, since this game happens in Vietnam, as the title says. Some missions also have other types of atmosphere besides jungles, alike military bases, rivers and bamboo houses. The audio is pretty nice, I like the sounds of the vehicles. The helicopters’ sound should be a little more amplified, though. The music is nice. In this game, the music is are stunning and dynamic. The gameplay is complex, in each mission you have to accomplish several tasks, alike putting bombs in tanks, killing specific enemies, making enemies to retreat, and even others. Throughout the area of each mission, in this game, apparently you can’t steal the enemy’s batteries or tanks, being a pretty big disadvantage, because this game is pretty hard. Plus it cuts your freedom to do what you consider. The story is basically: the first campaign shows the American side, the second campaign shows the Vietnam side and the third one (which is available only if you buy the D.L.C.), some bonus missions on both sides. They are all pretty long. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. I also like the overall design of it. The controls are pretty good, except with one thing: you must use the arrows in order to move your units. I highly recommend changing those settings to the traditional W, A, S and D. The engines, just like in every Men of War game, are not perfect. The game has rarely crashes, and when it crashes, you obviously lose the progress of your mission. Try and save the game as often as you can, in order to avoid too much progress lose. You don't want to waste your time by restarting the mission from zero, right?  The mechanics are sophisticated, being pretty nice and everything moves well-optimized. Now, I’m going to talk a little about the G.E.M. editor. Just like in every Men of War game, you have a G.E.M. editor. You can create your own battles in it. It is complex and with a various number of functions. What I don’t like in this particular G.E.M. editor: first of all, the bug which displays 4 functions. If you press the right-click, it will display them. This does not happen in any other Men of War games. Secondly, the amount of content. There are not many infantry out there, neither vehicles. Oh, did I mention that you can’t even drive helicopters? Well, that’s pretty sad, in my opinion. But overall, the G.EM. editor is pretty nice, still. Overall, this game is a pretty nice simulation of the Cold War.Positive PointsRelatively nice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and nice musicFun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the 3 campaigns availableInfantry, batteries, vehicles, APCs, tanks, helicopters, and many other units available 3 difficulties availableA pretty nice designed user interfaceSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsTrading cards would be a nice featureMore units would be awesomeThe editor should have more content, including being able to drive helicoptersNegative PointsThe multiplayer is not alive anymoreThere are some rare crashes, like in all the Men of War gamesYou can’t steal the enemy’s stuff besides their ammunition, the biggest disadvantage "

												Compared to the other games in the Men of War series, this is atrocious. The game's difficulty in itself may turn off more casual members of the franchise, but the lack of material itself makes it not worth a single penny. The game, in comparison to Assault Squad, or the Original Men of War, is nearly empty. Not to mention the only multiplayer options are cooperative, with Skirmish and other competitive modes completely thrown out the window. Do NOT buy this game, unless you are a die-hard fan of the series, or simply want to complete the collection of the series. The game is far from meeting the standards of the Men of War series, and far from being worth $14.00			"

												This game (and all but 1 game in the MOW series) is very difficult. Like impossible difficult when the option you selected was easy. Like I need to follow the 70 page walkthrough for step by step, cover by cover instructions making the paths in this ""strategy"" game very narrow ones to follow. In sumary, you will not be able to develope your own strategy (which I though was the point of a strategy game) but have to follow the very narrow ones laid out in a guide or walkthrough. On top of that the interface, controls and feel for the game are annoying at best. (i.e. you must change camera angle in a hurry in order to shoot down a chopper, while switching your soldier's weapon to RPG). It also does not have a professional feel to it either, the voice acting is shoddy, the music is very repetitive (like just 3 guitar chords constantly repeating) and ""cut scenes"" do nothing to draw you into the story. Don't buy this if your looking for a professional strategy game like WARGAME, TOTAL WAR or even C&C games, you will be sorely dissappointed. However I do recommend MOW: Assault Squad. It is a very interesting take without the flaws of the other MOW games.  "

												Must admit really enjoying this game, it's game play is different to most games, it's all about tactics. Yes this game is hard but it's so pleasing when you do win a round, save as many times as you can your squad is wiped just reload and try a new tactic thats the way you win, keep trying, keep trying new tactics.This game has been a breath of fresh air it has really tested the way I approach playing this game and it will do to you too ......... just don't give up, it is a tactical stratagy game and it will frustrate you but when you win what a win, would only recomend to the die hard vietnam game fan boy or the hard core stratagy gamer or the gamer who likes stratagy games but wants a REAL challenge.Not regretted buying it, been great fun and loving everyminute.

A Men of War | Vietnam review ( How unexpected )  First of all!I  am a big  big Men Of War fan for about 7 years now. The only MOW game that I hadn´t played (for a long time) was Vietnam. So I looked it up on steam and was rly suprised why it got such ""bad reviews"". I still bought it and after 15 minutes I noticed the reason.PROS:+Vietnam :)+You can throw chickens at enemys :) (10/10 would throw myself again)+Relativly good grafiks+Good sound and ambient feeling.+Destructible environmentCONS:- Rly rly rly bad AI : But not from the enemys... From your team. It often happens (to me) that a solidier stands right in front of an enemy and doesn´t shoot. ( but get shoot)- Not rly a con : Hardest MOW I have ever played.   (THE REAL CON) :10% actually difficulty and 90% dump team AI (look the Con before).- Bad voice acting- Less units- Not able to use Helicopters :( (Why should you play a Vietnam game when you are not even possible to use a helicopter I mean ... Do you go     to a Bar too drink but you know you can´t ♥♥♥♥ anybody)- Not rly a con too:  It doesn´t feel like a real game.All in all I can say that MOW Vietnam is one of the badest MOW´s. It´s more like a mod to the Assoult Squad Series then a actually game. (If it is a ModStandAlone pls correct me) I can just give advice too  you that you should not buy this game. Instead waste your mony on Drugs or , even better ,Chickens belive me.( Buy Assoult Squad 2 and download some Mods ( Or play the game on it self) like : Read Rising, ROBz Realism Mod and so on. Also get some firends ( I know you don´t have one ;)) and play it in Multiplayer )			"

												MoW Vietnam is a good little game. It has good graphics (well... as much as can be in the series), the jungle environment is quite impressive and offers new strategies, there are two little campaigns (more or less half a dozen mission for each, alternating stealth and pure action), the music is... acceptable overall, and it keeps the complex gameplay well known in the Men Of War games, which I find really enjoyable. However, just like for all the games in the series, you are expected to master everything right from the beginning and you won't get a little bit of help (apart from hints during loading screens). And it is a difficult game. Therefore, I think that only regular players of the series will be able to enjoy it. Other than that, at more than 8 euros, it would be a waste of money in my opinion.

They have failed with this game. It is poorly put together missions, with quickly gathered music. Missions have almost no freedom of action. ""Do this or else you fail"" The difficulty is put to the extreme, mixed with the horrible level design make this game unplayable. If you are searching reviews whether to buy this game or not.

												The hoops you have to jump through in this game is so tight a frog's rear end would be jealous.  None of the impossibility was necessary in the level design. If you do not move HERE exactly in X number of seconds, most of your men will die in a 100:1 odds firefight. How you judge the quality of a level is how often is makes you save your game.I was saving my game every 5 seconds even when it took about 5 seconds to save it and about 20 seconds to retrieve my last save.This game is horrible, the level design is horrid and maps are reused shamelessly. Maybe they pushed this turd out to capitalize on the Men of War franchise.Either way, don't bother with this installment.			"

												I won this game too! It's actually modern and relatively playable. Crossed between Commando's and Company of Hero's, it can get a little bit overwhelming controlling a squad of 10 people each with their own inventory and skills from a RTS perspective but is certainly interesting at the very least.

Men Of War - VietnamIf you're a fan of this genre and RTS tactical games I would recommend this game.Otherwise you better stay away.Estimated gameplay hours: 16-20.Personally I don't have enough time nor patience to understand a game that is more complicated than it should be.For example:- Controls ; Many controls to use, caused confusion on my side.- Annoying Hud.- Stubborn camera angels and movement.- Struggled to move units and control them.Overall this game has some good points to offer on gameplay wise but this is not what I expected. I guess this game is not for everyone.I like more simple gameplay rather than taking minutes and focusing on certain things, that waste my time and takes away the satisfaction of playing the game.* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale.****** Recommended On Full Price.

Sucks to spend 5 min getting guys into position to get wiped out in 30 seconds. Have played many hours of Company of Heros and other similiar games and this is not nearly as good or enjoyable. Found it slow and forgettable no feel or flow to the game at all. Wasted my money again on a game thats not even playable or fun. Thank god I got it on sale.

												If you like to cry because the game you are playing is so difficult, get this. I bought this because I've been wanting to play vietnam games for a long while, but it's ridiculously hard (I like RTSs but I'm not good at them). Graphics are pretty good, campaign is APPARENTLY super short, but I keep rage-uninstalling my OS after the first few levels. Not recommended for baddies like me, or solo play. However, I DO recommend for co-op with someone who is not god awful.6/10			"

												Alright, considering my last review was not well received for how dismissive it was, let me try this again but make it known just why this sucks.Remember all the good things Assault Squad added to Men of War? None of them are here. Right mouse button being the move and action button like every other RTS made since the late 90s? Nah. Skirmish mode, with an AI who understands how to move its units around and a challenging, fun, and dynamic mode to play with friends? Nah. A campaign based both around the heroism of small units mixed with the grand scope and scale of an RTS game? Not really! (Note: that one was even in Men of War 1, so I have no idea why it isn't here)Combine that with the lack of vehicles, the lack of any sort of mutable tactics from their WW2 titles (I.E there is nothing really here that screams ""Vietnam,"" it could just as easily be ""Men of War: Japan in the Phillipines"") and you get one depressingly shallow cash in from the B developers of the Men of War series. Hell even for the B devs, they have done better, both Condemned Heroes and Red Tide were not terrible games.			"

												I have played most of the men of war games and they are great. To be honest, I'm not sure why so many people hate this game. It does have it's flaws, trust me, I have seen the AI do some really questionable things at times but mostly they are absoloutely fine.A lot of people have been criticising this game for it being ""too hard"". The fact that a game is challenging isn't inherently bad, it's the whole reason I am going back to it on harder difficulties and it's the reason I have enjoyed it as much as other games in the franchise. Overall, I would definitely say the game's pros outweigh the cons.If you like MOW games then, this game is for you. After all, It's only £7 at most and I got it on a sale for £2 or so.			"

Assault squad had a great system of reinforcements and constant battle, men of war vietnam although has you with about 6 troops faced with unbelievable tasks on overly and unrealistically hard missions, completely removing the tactical general feel previous games had and forcing a small tight knit group where if anyone dies you're most likely forced to reload a save as it's impossible to get reinforcements.

Also having your soldiers kiel over left and right without any discernable reason, any comment or anything...another bad design choice.Many people complained about Jagged Alliance Back in Action, but when it comes to squad size realtime tactical gameplay JA BA is a masterpiece of control, balance and oversight of the battle.

												I debated on getting this game or not, as I enjoy RTS games and I love Vietnam war themed games. I bought the game, and played it for a bit, and it was too ♥♥♥♥ing hard! I played the first mission for each campaign and they both were so ♥♥♥♥ing hard even on easy! Do not buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game, it's a waste of time and money!			"

												I was willing to give this game a chance because it was only $8 and it was Vietnam themed. Loading up the first mission, I first realized that it was difficult to see anything that was happening. Which is a problem, because most of the map consisted of jungle and you're meant to manuever through it in order to avoid being killed instantly.Nevertheless, I trudged on until one of my men suddenly keeled over after a short firefight. I shrugged and figured the game probably had traps as a mechanic since it's the Vietnam era, and sent another guy over to salavge the missing equipment.Who suddenly keeled over as well. And at that point I realized that I could probably kill off my entire squad by doing that, which I promptly did to my own amusement.I could see where this game might be fun for some people, but the average person isn't going to enjoy this. Even the average Men of War fan probably won't enjoy this. I have an affinity for both the Vietnam war and Men of War and I couldn't see myself putting up with it, if only because it's so difficult to properly navigate the levels, even without the addition of nigh-invisible booby traps.

												Deep tactical gameplay, a short but varied campaign, and a large variety of weapons and equipment are overshadowed by a horrid user interface, no form of tutorial, manual, wiki, mouseover info or guides whatsoever and an impressively broken pause feature, among other annoying flaws.I finished this game out of pure stubbornness and can't really recommend it to anyone but hardcore fans of the genre.

												I actually got this off a friend to help him review the game. I have never played any of the other Men of War games.  I played it in Multiplayer with him through a few levels. First thing I noticed was the - absolutely horrible voice acting. - No tutorials. Normally I don't care about that but how are you supposed to know you are supposed to fix a vehicle without ever indicating it? Didn't even know you could- The gameplay was slow and boring- There was no sense of satisfaction for me in anythingOn a good note, there were no lags at all. And... Well.... No, I ain't got nothing, I really dislike this game. It's a good thing I got it free. Mind you though it might just not be my type of game. For example I really enjoyed the original 2 Fallout games but I didn't like Fallout Tactics.			"

												I had my hopes up that this would be a good Nam game, but unfortunatetly it was not. This game revolves around spec ops missions using stealth and suprise, almost no helicopter action, and never in the campaign do you command a significant amount of units. HOWEVER, this does not mean that you won't be fighting an enemy that has 100+ units making it seem unrealistic and harder then it should be. Even in the NVA campaign, you lead a squad of 4 against dozens of American troops and WIN. I mean, come on is that BS or what? I cannot, however, complain about the complete lack of a tutorial, as i have other Men of War games. Overall i was expecting and hoping for some helicopter action and moderatly large battles, commanding at least a platoon sized unit, but the game is only about leading a squad against 1000 enemies with rather bad voice acting. GET BATTLEFIELD BAD COMPANY 2 VIETNAM FOR A TRUELY GOOD VIETNAM GAME.			"

												Well....First of all, this game is not as good as the old ones about ww2. Second the amount of weapons in this game is sad.I love MOW and even played the firstone whitch was called: Soldiers herose of ww2. Like all the MOW games i love the edititor, but when i get there i saldly discover that they were only 2 maybe 3 tanks on each side! that makes 6! tanks in the whole game! WOW! Thats sad, and think that i payed $20 when it was on sale was a total ripoff. I hope that they come up with more updates. The U.S did not just use chaffee and pattons in vietnam, where are the fks are the pershings? Super shermans? Really?			"

												I would say this would be an amazing thing to add to the Men Of War collection but this game is terrible and who ever decided to make both starting missions insanely difficult missions i damn you and most would just say ""Oh no you just suck at this game"" no im not that bad at the game its just stupid to make the first missions both recon and stealth missions is stupid and unfair and it is why i suggest other Men of War games like Men of War, Men of War Assault squad 2 and so forth but here are reasons WHY this game sucks. If you try to sneak around to get behind the bunkers in the mission ""What a Job!"" you can F@#$%& by traps and you are forced to run at a heavy mg that can kill your whole squad in 5 bursts and i did manage to get through one time and i tossed a grenade at the Mg it did NOTHING and on the mission ""When Trouble troubles you"" HOW IN THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FIGHT AN ARMY WITH 2 NVA AND 2 RUSSIANS!?!?!?!?!? well you ♥♥♥♥ing cant even with Rpg's and Draganovs but still this game is bad because of that so i hope the Developers step up their game instead of sit around with their thumbs up their asses and i highly doubt they give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this review but yeah this is why i do not Recommend this game at all.

So, I hummed and hawed, not sure if I should spend the money or not.  I'm glad I did because this game is not so challenging that it is frustrating and I abandon it.  It's challenging, but in the way that we want it to be so that we don't master it in two days and get bored.The attention to detail is fantastic as is the sheer number of orders you can command your squad(s) with.

But if you're willing to put just a bit more time into it -- not much -- then buy it.Conclusion . . . If you are into the Vietnam conflict, I give this game an 8.7 out of 10.  If you're just a fan of the genre in general, I give it a solid 7.8 out of 10.  My only advice is to stick with it for more than 5 or 10 minutes.			"

You'd think I hated it but that is not the case, because when you FINALLY get that assault or ambush to 'bang on all cylinders' it feels as rewarding as knockin' up the prom queen and skipping town with her tiara and crotchless panties.Oh, and if you don't already have PTSD, you will.

Enemies will wipe out your team, a lot.  Save often kids.  Make that your mantra.  You'd think I hated it but that is not the case, because when you FINALLY get that assault or ambush to 'bang on all cylinders' it feels as rewarding as knockin' up the prom queen and skipping town with her tiara and crotchless panties.Oh, and if you don't already have PTSD, you will.  From the game...not the prom queen...probably.			"

												Take everything you loved from Men of war: Assault squad.......and throw it in the trash, because Men Of War: Vietnam is nothing like it. At all. If you remember games like ""Commando's"", then you'll get a pretty good idea of how Men of War: Vietnam plays.If you don't, then it can be summed up with the term ""Quick save attrition"". Because that’s what you'll be doing constantly. Though I give it credit for instilling the same amount of frustration and anger in the participant as the war its based off of did for those involved. Go buy assault squad. its a much better game.			"

												I REALLY wanted this game to be awesome because there are no good Viet Nam RTS or TBS games out there.  I wish the controls were more like Company of Heroes. I hate giving a negative review, but I must.The controls are not intuitive.  There is no seemless way of attacking opponents, taking cover, or picking up weapons.  This really slows down game play and makes this game an arduous experience.			"

												Despite criticism, this game can stand on it's own merits very well. It's very deep and challenging. The missions are long and complex but leave you enough room to improvise when things don't go according to plan. The difficulty is punnishing even on easy. You must save A LOT! It's more a squad based action rpg than an rts. But that's fine by me. It's an interesting and fun perspective on the Vietnam war. The camera is close enough to the action that you get a sense of claustrophobic tension of jungle warfare. The AI can be deviously challenging and won't just stand around waiting to get shot. You really have to keep on your toes. The graphics are surprisingly good, despite it's age. There are no noteworthy bugs to mention. A great addition to the Men Of War series.			"

												one of the only different Men of War games out there lol i like this game a lot it has it's bugs though and sadly doesn't get any updates anymore i don't think which is a shame on the developer end since they'd rather focus on a game they've re-released 4 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ times now but for what it's worth it's a good game there is tons of fun to be had lol it's also a very hard it's not something that was made for casual gamers lol for me i guess it's a lot to do with the fact that it's something actually new and not another Men of War game set in WW2 with all the same units, vehicles and everything it's a new era with new vehicles, guns and a new nation ( can't say nations cause the US is already a nation in Men of War lol ) it's just new although it is lacking a bit there's no where nearly as many vehicles in this game like there is in Men of War Assualt Squad which is a shame cause this has something going for it i think and if it got the attention that Assualt Squad and the WW2 era got then it could have been even better but i guess the developers are just to lazy to put in any real effort to actually fleshout something new lol they'd rather make re-hashes			"

												It's a fun game, but basically deletes itself after awhile due to the dlc,so don't get it. Also,it does not have multiplayer,however you can have a fun time in editor but it is very hard to have decent vietnam battles,making it not feel like vietnam. The game has ww2 weapons,so not all weapons are replaced. Helicopters don't have a good animation,infact they just fly,the propeller doesn't even move. I would find this game at around 5/10. Its a ""Eh,it needs work,the game doesn't feel like Vietnam,it feels like a men of war reskin.""			"

I looked over and saw he had stepped in a booby trap. I was like Davidson I'll be right back hang in there!. I proceeded to pull out my knife came up behind this yeller feller(Viet Kong) Slit his throat and ripped it out. Then looked back to see Davidson being bayoneted, I then rushed them beating the ones head repeaditly off the tree. Davidson was spitting up blood saying I feel cold Rose I dunno if I can make it. I lifted him up and began carrying him accross a river, There were two bunkers there. I laid him down then over took the one and found ammo, We stayed in that bunker for awhile before I proceeded after Davidsons death. I took that one out and then help arrived a Cobra struck the bunker and began strafing the village saving my life.			"

												Not very good.Its short and missions are few and it has a tendency to crash and the autosave system is pretty bad. It has some cool moments and some interesting small unit jungle tactics but it just feels like a MOW mod and not a real expansion. Alot of inconsistencies here and a troubling amount of DSHKs all over the place and those things will destroy you.  You don't get anything really that you didn't see in the first MOW besides a focus on jungle small units stuff.Its a dissappointing boring mess. Nothing like your men dying from stepping in knee high water because your not supposed to walk that direction, or the truck your supposed to escape on getting stuck in a building and then flipping over because the AI can't drive. Theres not enough stuff and variance here. It sucks.			"

												I tried to like this game, but frankly, it's not very good. It feels like a downgrade to MOWAS2 in every single way. The campaign missions are not very good and they're really challenging on the easiest difficulty for some reason (I am able to do fine in MOWAS2 missions). The AI for the people you control is also pretty poor, my guys chased around a chopper and didn't switch to their RPGs to take it out or run to cover, they just stood out and died. Also, the ranges on weapons are way too short and not being able to get mods easily makes this more of an issue. As for the graphics, it looks pretty mediocre on maximum settings at 1080p. Shadows look jaggy with 4x antialiasing on, and the trees move very slowly in the wind, so they look terrible. I wanted to love this game because there is a serious lack of Vietnam War games, but this game isn't very good. I got it in a bundle I think, and am not a fan even at the $1 or less that I likely paid for it.			"

												The game handles well and is very frustrating in a realistic way, my only real issue is that the voice actors are all the same, meaning the russian narator had better be an American defector or else i dont even know. But that is a rather small detail, so if you can over look that, you'll find a fun and engaging games that will give you great memories of epic battles and daring escapes.It should be noted however that in true Viet Nam war style, the battles are more compact and frantic, this isnt like the other MoW where you could throw wave after wave of soldiers till you eventually win, you have to be careful, and make the best use of all your abilities and gear, as well as looting as much as you can from the corpses			"

												Hmm... okay. I played Soldiers HoWW2 and all the MOW-Games, but this one is different.I really do like the vietnam setting. And I like the idea of playing a small squad, gives a litte more control over your few units. Concentrate on small squad-assaults, gather ammo and weapons, reminds me a little of ""The Lost Patrol"", ""Seal Team"" and ""Vietcong"".But it just plays terrible. The whole game feels buggy and unbalanced, I can't really describe it. If you're an absolute and total fan of MOW you might like this game. Everyone else who just likes the Vietnam era should consider playing something else. Like Vietcong. Or even Platoon.04/10 cut ears.			"
