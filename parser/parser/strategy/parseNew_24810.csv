												Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is actually an expansion pack for Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, which I haven’t covered yet, and played these in the wrong order; that being said, I can still give a review on this game as an individual release. Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath was released in early 2008 before actually being released on the 360 console if you can believe it. This is the first C&C game I have played since Generals in 2003. This game takes place between the time of Tiberian Sun and the start of Tiberium Wars plot wise, so if you want to play the games chronologically, start with this one before Wars. The single player campaign has 13 levels which are divided up into three different sub-stories which follow Kane’s plot.  In all good C&C fashion, there are two types of missions, base building missions and more stealth operation missions. The base building missions can normally be completed by overrunning your enemy with your army of tanks an d troops, and just play the numbers game. There is a good amount of buildings to use, but there are only handfuls which actually have some real use in terms of game play. If  you want to be playing this game optimally, there are really only 4 or 5 buildings you’ll be using.  The second type of mission which gives you control of a smaller force of units, meaning you have to use an element of either stealth or well planned attacks in order to complete objectives. These missions are the hardest, but they present the greatest amount of fun in this title.  They really do give you a serious element of strategy and planning which is what you would expect to see from a C&C game. This game is eight years old now, and whilst none of the C&C games ever had super amazing graphics, some may be put off by the graphically old style to this game. There are some low texture qualities to be seen in abundance,  but you really only see these if you are zoomed as far in as you can go, and you will hardly ever want to do this as you are overseeing the whole battlefield anyway.  The game is fully voice acted and has very well made cut scenes in between levels which have live action taking place, with some celebrity cast members such as Joseph Kucan returning as Kane, Carl Lumbly, and Canadian actress and fashion model, Natasha Henstridge The base building missions are really quite ease – like I said you can just use the numbers game against the opponents and overrun them with a huge army. Where the game challenges is the other missions. The game can be played on varying levels of difficulty so you can tailor it to how much of a threat you want your adversaries to cause you. All of the thirteen missions come with their main objective, along with optional objectives for you to complete. Completing these bear no real game play bonus’ apart from a higher rank at the end of the mission, what they do offer you is a greater knowledge of the lore and plot going on behind the scenes, so fans of the series should definitely be taking the time to read through the extra bits of story you get. The game took me just about fifteen hours to finish; I am very happy with that length of time for a RTS game like this, and it matches the full price tag quite fairly too. The multiplayer scene is fairly dead on this game as the official servers were taken offline, so it’s only a single player experience from now on. The game has a few other game modes which include a Risk style game, and of course, just general skirmishes against the AI, all of which add to the replay ability of this game. The only major technical issue I had whilst playing, was that I could not get the game to run in 4k resolutions. Whilst it is an option in the menu, the game will crash when trying to select it. 1080p works fine and runs at over 60 FPS all of the time when maxed out.  Keyboard and mouse is an absolute must whilst playing too; even though the game was released on xbox360, the controller doesn’t work on the PC title for some reason? In conclusion, Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is a quality C&C release, whilst it may not be as fully polished as the previous games in the series, it still has some really stellar gameplay and an interesting plot. The price tag of £9,99 is right on point as well. You cannot go wrong with picking this game up now.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath.What a game, really. I've loved the CNC and Red Alert series since RA1, what a classic. But this is, sadly, the best, most recent game out of both series (in my opinion).I haven't played much of the single player, because WHY? The skirmishes are so fun, there are many different strategies to try out, try different challenges like vs one easy AI and two Hard, capture the easy base early game with minimal resources, e.g. engineer and a few troops, get their tech, have yourself TWO ultimate units, MARV and REDEEMER for example. The unit ranking system is basic but great, very rewarding for looking after your units and keeping them alive through battle trades.The graphics are great for its age, someone else mentioned about the sound design and yes, I agree, it's awesome. Explosions sound big, siege weapons sound like siege weapons, and units have some great dialogue which you'll catch yourself saying.Mammoth Tank - ""Armoured superiority"" ""Ready here""Nod Harvester - ""It's time for harvest"" ""The beautiful glow""There is still a community out there for multiplayer matches, another reviewer mentioned about the symmetry of the maps, but it's not ALL maps, it's mostly the ""tournament maps"" which is for... Tournaments. The symmetry is for balance.However, I do have a gripe for it, and it frustrates me a lot. With so much multiplayer and skirmish potential, I would have loved to have seen more community maps, challenges, missions. But there is almost none through steam. This game is probably past its time to have a big revival, but if you can grab it on a steam sale, I wouldn't hesitate a second.EA have recently cancelled their F2P model game, which I think is a good move. F2P CnC won't work, I am thoroughly looking forward to a new CnC which will hopefully keep up to this level and more. Don't let us down EA! (Wishful thinking I know)TL;DR - If the game is on sale, buy it, but don't expect there to be a massive community on Steam. However, there are plenty of people doing game commentaries, one I like is a guy called GreenZero over on YouTube. Check out gamereplays.org too for replays, have a search on google for some custom maps too. I've had many hours of fun with this game (as you can see) plus hours I had with a non-steam copy. Highly reccomended.My raiting - 4.5/5 I would give it 5/5 if there was better support and community here on Steam.Thanks for reading my review, I hope it helps!			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars ReviewCommand & Conquer 4: Tiberian TwilightINTRODUCTION:Command and Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is the official expansion pack to the critically acclaimed real-time strategy game Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars.Unlike its predecessors, Kane's Wrath handles its campaign in a more disjointed fashion rather than the linear approach of the older titles. This game follows the 'ascension' of L.E.G.I.O.N., a newly developed and highly experimental Combat A.I. The game has missions based on the various stages of the Tiberian Sun Story Arc such as the end of Tiberian Sun: Firestorm, the start of Tiberium Wars and the events that came after it.PROS:+ The game has good art style and graphics: (Both of which aged really well specially since this game was released back in 2008.)+ Very good Sound design and unit voice acting.+ Quality live action cinematics have returned along with the ever iconic Joseph D. Kucan as “Kane.”+ New 'Sub-factions' that are fun to use and adds variety to the gameplay+ Adds new units to play with+ Return of some of the Tiberian Sun favorites, such as GDI Titans and Wolverines as well as the NOD Cyborgs and Artillery. NOD infantry also got their iconic NOD Combat Armors back.+ Fast paced and intense action+ Lore and story continuity from the old games+ Campaign missions (specially the Stealth based ones are still as fun as ever)+ Fun new skirmish maps and multiplayer maps+ Adds a new game mode called “Global Conquest” similar to Red Alert 3: Uprising's 'Commander's Challenge'.CONS:- No online multiplayer due to GameSpy shutdown: FIX[cnc-online.net]- Some unit pathfinding quirks (specially with the massive 'Mega Units' like the Redeemer and MARV)- Balance issues - No GDI or Scrin Campaign- Relatively shorter Campaign game time: (mostly because there's only the NOD campaign which can last you at least 9-10 hours)- More expensive than the base game (Tiberium Wars) for some reasonNEUTRAL+/- The disjointed story may not appeal to most old school Command & Conquer fans+/- The story can only be understood by both Tiberian Sun and Tiberium Wars veteran players.CONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION that manages to spice up the C&C3 universe with new content and gameplay while at the same time being able to connect and reveal many untold stories about the Brotherhood of Nod and their leader Kane.WORTH IT?The game's full price is $20 (or your regional equivalent) which is $5 more expensive than the base game so I can only recommend this expansion pack only to Tiberian Sun and Tiberium Wars veteran players. If you're looking for your first RTS game, get Tiberium Wars instead.Again I have to point out the fact that the official multiplayer servers are now permanently offline so you'll have to use CNC:Online[cnc-online.net]  if you want to experience the game's online multiplayer feature.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												This was the last good Command and Conquer game ever released. I still like Tiberian Sun over it, but still. This brought back the classic CnC style for one last run.Why isn't the actor of Kane (Joseph D. Kucan)  in Hollywood? He does a very good job at portaying Kane.			"

												GAMEPLAY: Kanes Wrath further spices up the C&C3 universe in terms of gameplay by adding a handful of new units as well as multiple sub-factions. These sub-factions also have their own exclusive units and overall play styles; in addition there's a new game mode known as global conquest to which the player tries to achieve global domination. This game mode includes TBS & RTS gameplay elements .STORY: What really sells this game as a MUST PLAY is the story, assuming you're a Tiberium Universe fanatic. Overall, Kanes Wrath is an expansion pack soley intended to tell the story of Nod and Kanes actions that consist of 13 missions seperated into three acts. These acts cover just about two decades from 2034 to 2052. To avoid spoiling the campaign, I'll keep this brief. As the player, your perspective is LEGION -an A.I. created by Kane intended to be CABALS successor- and throughout the duration of this campaign, Kane instructs LEGION to do his bidding until the A.I's true purpose can be done (hint CABAL's purpose).As the player, you'll experience what Kane was up to post-Tiberian Sun (post-Second Tiberium War) as well as pre-C&C3 (pre-Third Tiberium War); in addition to actually experiencing battles of C&C3 from a different perspective. After that, you'll experience post-C&C3 events. MULTIPLAYER:As a heads up / tip, if you wish to play this game online as of 2015 then visit http://cnc-online.net/ONE VISION, ONE PURPOSE out of 10.

												Regrettably, Kane's Wrath doesn't deliver the same great single-player experience you'd hope to get after playing the previous game in the franchise, but it did iron out deficiencies and add a bunch more content without ruining the gameplay. I remember when I first played it the single player campaign was typical for an expansion (not so good), but the depth brought to the multiplayer game mode was very cool.

												I never played Command & Conquer because of their multiplayer. I played them because of their single campaign, of their story. Kane's Wrath has one! An exceptionally good one!This expansion aims to connect the previous Command & Conquer game, Tiberian Sun, with Tiberium Wars. While the game offers new missions and cutscenes, one downside is that we only have one new campaign this time (I guess the developers ran out of both money and time to complete the rest).You have new units, as usual, and the missions are a bit more difficult this being an expansion pack. This is normal as the creators always assume you've played the original one.Honestly? I don't remember much. I remember it being good and I remember that Kane could deliver once more. It was a decent expansion - you may not remember this word as in the gaming industry we have DLCs everywhere today. Highly recommended along with the vanilla game.			"

												I would give this game 4/5 starsThis is more of a DLC than an expansion pack. The campaign is NOD only, and walks you through the missing links across C&C 1-3. The campaign isn't anything to brag about, but the new units are. This expansion brings back some of the C&C2 units that we all missed in the base game, namely the wolverines and titans. The new units for both GDI and NOD are what make this game worth it.			"

This game just did everything right there. The factions are nicely balanced, even so each of the three known factions got two more, specialised, sub factions. Even with the shutdown of the old hosted servers the community lives on and got their own. By far the most played CnC game (i guess) for a reason. "

												The last Command and Conquer ever made that is truly, truly fantastic. They don't make them like this anymore sadly. Having played C&C since the very first title, this is the closest you will get to getting the classic RTS feel of base building, resource gathering and massing huge armies to defeat your enemies. It does so very well too. Still well worth a purchase in my opinion and despire the servers there are still ways to play online if thats what you're after. (C&C Online.)10/10 "

												SOLVED! Command & Conquer 3 Kane's Wrath not launching/working on Windows 10. after soo long trying to figure out some way to get the game to run on Windows 10, I FINALLY found a solution just when I was messing around in the display driver settings. First of all my laptop is the late 2016 Razer Blade with the GTX 1060 and Core i7 6700HQ. Okay here's how I got it to work on Windows 10, first, make sure the game is not running as an administrator and all the compatibility mode/settings are disabled, I know most people probably enabled these trying to get the game to work (including myself). Okay next, open settings, in the search bar type ""device manager"" then select it, next select ""display adaptors"" then ""Intel HD Graphics"" then go to ""driver"" and select ""Roll Back Driver..."" then just give it a minute, the screen may turn blue for a second or whatnot, and that's it! the game should run perfectly! you can adjust it to whatever graphics or resolution you want and you can use a dedicated GPU (if you have one). if this helped you please like this review so others will see! :) --Edit-- rolling back this driver can cause some other problems like videos on your system and on YouTube playing choppy in fullscreen mode and the only way to fix that is to update the driver back, fortunatly for me, C&C 3 Kane's Wrath still played just fine when I updated back to the latest driver.

												This game continues the C&C RTS tradition, and adds a lot of new factions and units to the game.  Gameplay hasn't changed that much since the original C&C3.Although the game is called ""Kane's Wrath"" it would have been much better to have a GDI campaign added to the game.  With that being said though the acting in this game is brilliant and Kane is one of the better characters, although the missions in the campaign are not that great.However you can still play as all 9 factions (each core faction has 2 subfactions).  Each faction has different units, upgrades and playstyles which does add some variety to the game.There's also a conquest mode which is a ""Risk"" type mode where you can play as either faction and have to take over the world (The console version replaces this with Kane's challenge), and is for the most part a solid experience.I can recommend this expansion pack, but not all full price.

												This pretty much the last good CnC game. After this game EA made CnC4 which pretty much killed off the series for everybody.This game fills the holes between CnC: Tiberian Sun and CnC: Tiberium Wars. For many of us fans of the series it was alittle weird to see Kane in that tube at the end of CnC: Tiberian Sun Firestorm and then in CnC: Tiberium Wars hes back without any explination whatsoever.The story starts right after the Firestorm crisis and you play as Legion and you take direct orders from Kane. You need to like help Kane out and♥♥♥♥♥♥because since hes recent disappearance the Brotherhood of Nod has been split up and such so it falls to you to fix all of that and unite Nod again.The gameplay is pretty nice and in muliplayer you can pick alot of factions to play as(Kinda like in CnC: Generals Zero Hour). I would myself recomend that you play as regular Nod and Steel Talons. Regular Nod since they are awesome(DUUUH) and Steel Talons since they got retro units like the Titan and Wolvorine.(It never really made any sense to me why GDI went from Mammoth tanks to Titans and then went back to Mammoth tanks again so thanks EA for the confussion.)I give this game a 8/10 because its still pretty awesome and it got that metal version of Act on Instinct			"

												Kane's Wrath (KW) is a close followup to the original Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars (C&C3) since it continues the story of Earth and its Tiberium infestation. If you enjoyed C&C3 then KW is an absolute must. Be aware, KW still uses the same game engine and mechanics, but adds a few deviant factions along with additional units for all armies. More variety equals more destructive mayhem!			"

												Command & Conquer: Kane's Wrath is more of a story expansion to Tiberium Wars than a gameplay one. It functions as an exposition piece giving you information about the events leading up to the third Tiberium War, during and the aftermath.You take the role of Legion, Kane's tactical AI mastermind and most of the in-game cut scenes are spent in one of his bunkers, listening to Kane's various rants. In general the live action quality of this expansion is well below C&C standards and most of them take place in dark rooms with very few actors involved.The gameplay element of this expansion is mostly centered around sub-factions each with it's own specialty, most notable is NOD's flame based sub-faction. The gameplay effects is however mostly negligible, particularly in terms of single player.All in all, it joins the ""Standard Expansion"" club. It adds a little of everything, doesn't rock the boat and in the end is only worth a buy if you really love the original.			"

												Okay, so let me start by saying that I had and always will love the CnC Franchise. Its probably my 2nd favorite franchise of all time, so don't think I hate command and conquer. I remember when I got my first computer and I was playing on it for a while, I noticed some old dvd games that were in a drawer, and one of the DVD's caught my eye. You might have guessed it, but if you didn't, it was the first command and conquer game (1995). I remember my dad was really shocked that I found it, and I asked if I could play it. My dad said sure, and at first, I didn't really understand the game, and I asked my dad for help alost every time. In December 2008, my parents suprised me with a game for christmas. Can you guess what it was? No? Well, it was Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars. I was beyond belief, I couldn't believe that I now had my own command and conquer game. I must have put ~500 hours on that game, and it never got old. I stopped playing it, cause I got a new computer, and I found other things to play *cough* roblox *cough*. But anyways, boring back story aside, I'm sure you don't want to know about my history of playing computer games. But anyways, Command and Conquer has to be the defining series of the RTS genre. I have had a lot of fun playing this and I would totally recommend other people to try it.			"

												In my own opinion it is the best command and conquer for its era. The races are a bit tacky and slightly pulled from other strategy games.However the gameplay blends Tiberian sun style mechanics with abilities on units and exicitng super powers with the huge screen filling battles reminicant of Red Alert 1.If you are a command and conquer fan I reccomend kanes wrath to you.

												Kane's Wrath marks the end of more than one era. It is one of the last old-school RTS games where the designers had both budget and creative freedom, one of the last full expansions before the days of piecemeal DLC and probably the last great Command & Conquer. It also meant something new in C&C history, namely an add-on dedicated to the Brotherhood of Nod.Those uninitiated in the lore would do best to start with Tiberium Wars and watching the preceding C&C cutscenes from Youtube. This is to ensure the plot makes at least some sense, not that C&C is meant to make one rethink ones life. The three chapters in the 13-mission campaign happen before, during and after Tiberium Wars thus completing the storyline. Joseph Kucan's Kane is still the greatest FMV villain in gaming history and I will never tire of his superhuman scheming. Carl Lumbly as Brother Marcion is an entertaining Evil Evangelist whereas Natasha Henstridge has blonde hair and says things. All three factions (the alien Scrin made their entrance in the base game) are further split into three sub-factions all of whom get new toys to conquer the digital Earth with. Not all are equally interesting or receive enough playtime in the campaign but enough changes are made to give the gameplay new freshness. The gameplay itself has stayed the same, of course, with units being built and lost quite quickly. A typical campaign mission does not go past the 30-minute mark and mission design is varied enough to maintain interest throughout. Sights and sounds are good even today, despite all the advancements and changes in hardware, with the deliciously evil unit quotes getting a special mention. There is also the Global Conquest mode, with it's Risk-style metagame built around the skirmishes. It is not greatness but as an added amusement it is worthwhile indeed.All this combines into a great 10 € package that I can wholeheartedly recommend for fans of commanding and conquering and real-time strategizing.

												Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is the expansion pack of Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars that you need the main game first to play this game.The game has a 13 missions Nod campaign that brings you to the three timelines, or ""acts""1st act: After the events of Firestorm Crisis (C&C Tiberian Sun Firestorm) that tells you how Nod has risen again. 2nd act: In the events of Third Tiberium War (C&C3: Tiberium Wars).3rd act: After the events of Third Tiberium War.This game will tells you more clearly about 3rd Tiberium War as I said above. You will play as LEGION, The succedor of CABAL created by Kane to give you orders.Pros:-6 new sub-factions to play in skirmish, 2 each for main factions: Steel Talons and ZOCOM for GDI, Black Hand and Marked of Kane for Nod, Reaper-17 and Traveler-59 for Scrin.-New epic unit for use.-Story to additional explain the story in the main game.-New units for all factions.Cons:-There are no GDI and Scrin Campaign-Shorter campaign playtime due to the fact that this game has only Nod campaign.-There is no online because of GameSpy shutdown. You need C&C Online[cnc-online.net] to play online (Note: This website can also use for the main game, C&C Red Alert 3, C&C Generals and it's expansion Zero Hour too!) If you ask does this game worth it? I can say: It does.			"

												My friend recommended this game for me, i have a rather average laptop, but this game works a charm! (other than when someone drops a huge bomb, then everyone lags :P ) but definately worth a buy if you enjoy fast paced, teeth baring strategy games that keep you on the edge of your seat!			"

												A solid expansion. Does what you would expect for this kind of game: loads of new units, new powers, new factions, new campaign, and a new Risk-style game mode appropriately titled ""Global Conquest"", wherein you pick one of the three major armies and attempt to take over the world. Cons? The story spans from the end of Tiberiun Sun through C&C 3 and beyond, helping fill in the blanks of Kane's motives to set the stage for Tiberium Twilight. Unfortunately I found certain aspects of it kind of confusing, and the ending very vague. Some of the missions feel superfluous. Global Conquest mode is a bit too glitchy-- I only ever crashed in this mode. Once I started a match with no base and no units and the ""surrender"" option didn't work. Another time, a match wouldn't end even though I had eliminated all enemy units, forcing me to surrender.But these are minor issues. Some consider this ""the last good C&C game"", which I disagree with, but I am in the minority on that one. Highly recommended for RTS fans.			"

												This is seriously the best RTS I've played so far. The problem wasn't me; it's just modern games are not creative enough. This game has moderately good graphics but plenty of soul (creativity). An avatar scavenging new for new parts by destroying one of its own unit is the most epic thing I've seen. I regret not buying this earlier. The actors were awesome for a game and that Kane guy is a legend.Trust me. I have a record for refunding games after just 5 mins of play time. If I rate a game 11/10, This must mean it is something out of the ordinary.			"

												C&C Kanes Wrath is a fast paced RTS game by itself, but what makes it great is its ability to incorporate diversity into each of the three races, allowing for sub fractions that have unique units and abilites, while at the same time removing certain units and structures from the whole race techtree, ie, play as Scrin you get a wide range of units, but play as the Reaper69, you loose the aireal portion of the techtree while gaining access to knew and deadlier ground forces. So, overral, I'm rating this C&C 7.5/10, because in comparision to other RTS games (Grey goo, Warhammer, etc) It just isn't that in-depth as the other games of its type. 100% Reccomended.			"

												Good addition to base CnC3 Tiberium Wars. This expansion focuses solely on the Brotherhood of Nod and Kane. It coveres three time frames, pre TW3, mid TW3 and post TW3. Only to find later than Legion was an AI that was sent over to the Scrin. I recommend this expansion. Lots of new units, lots of new ways and strategies to play. Multiplayer mode is off though. Game is too old. :(			"

												By far the best installment of the C&C Tiberium Wars series. C&C Tiberium Alliances today is a browsergame, substituting the scrapped Generals 2 even as it was in beta stage, and C&C4: Tiberian Twilight was a massive flop, EA has finally killed the C&C genre as a true RTS, for now everything has a timer attached to it and is played in turns, leaving fans of the Tiberium Wars series with a game that was brought out in 2008. GameSpy servers were taken down some time ago, so now we have to play on Tunngle, Hamachi, and since recently a server was created for all the games that were on the shut down GameSpy servers, namely: C&C Red Alert 3 and its expansion, C&C Generals and its expansion Zero Hour, C&C3: Tiberium Wars and Kane's wrath. Check Revora forums for more info. I already played it in 2008-2009, and find it's still the best C&C to date.Useful links:http://cnc-online.net/  -- the substitute server for all games that were on shutdown GameSpy servers, including a How-To to get you startedhttp://www.gamereplays.org/kaneswrath/  -- can find many (expert)replays here, and probably all the strats and BO's you could ever wish for.

												i've played this game for about 5 years now, but ever since the windows 10 update this game will not work. i've searched around for months and it seems to be an issue with the built in Intel HD Cores which for some bloody stupid reason now will not run Kanes Wrath or Tib wars. from what i've seen Nvidia users have had very little issue but myself and tonnes of others who use Intel have had this unresolvable issue. because of this i cannot reccommend this game, not because it's a bad game; don't get me wrong, I love this game; but Intel's stupid updates and lack of knowledge about older games is the reason why i downvote this game. i highly doubt this will be fixed because EA isn't pushing for it because it's 'not a viable source of income' anymore so they've just dumped it and screw people who can't play it because it's not in their plan.in summary: i loved this game, seriously poured hundereds of hours into it before EA and Intel screwed us over, but in it's current aged state i would not recommend buying unless you have a Nvidia graphics card.

												The only and least acceptable C&C Tiberium title made by EA LA. It has delivered moderately fun, offers the new fancy race SCRIN to try out and comes with each race +3 subfractions for different tactics with each different advantages and disadvantages. The graphics are more than good, sound design is very good too, but about the story i am not sure to agree with. What i especially dislike is the build-in badwords filter. Also the skirmish map's are almost all symmetric, which is not impressing me a little. This one also lacks of many skirmish options!!!Westwood Studios have done far better work than EA LA did and will be remembered, honored and mourned for every TRUE C&C Fan.			"

Nothing wrong with this game, if you love C&C type games you will love this, but sadly you won't be able to find any servers to play on . So it won't be smart to buy this game. only if you like playing single player.			"

This game was the most fantastic game i have ever seen, it was my favorite game but the developer company abandoned it = no multiplayer servers but you can still play it online. If you want play it on multiplayer you have to deal with a lot of stuff like downloading and searching some files via google.Moreover if u have windows 10 like me u will not able to run the game. I can change my review as positive but they have to release a little pach to fix the game at least i should make it run on windows 10			"

												Follow-up review to my C&C3 review.Yeah it's pretty good. New units, new story to fill the gap between Tiberian Sun and Tiberium Wars, as well as showing Nods movements before and after the Third Tiberium War. Six new factions to screw around as in Skirmish and Multiplayer, each with their own units and upgrades that provide considerable upsides and downsides to the player. I'd say the price could be a little lower but it's not super overpriced. If you enjoyed C&C3 you'll love Kane's Wrath. Buy it.also 8/10			"

												Home of the most insane upgrade I've ever seen in an RTS: ""Purifying Flame"".Think of Nod's flamethrower-using units from the vanilla C&C3. Now, make a Nod sub-faction that gives a Black Hand unit to all infantry units.And then give it an upgrade that turns flamethrower jets blue and increases their damage by a ludicrous amount. That is Purifying Flame. One flame tank takes 3-4 seconds to take down a big building.--Other than that, it features a third campaign that helps you see what happened between C&C2's aftermath and C&C3's campaign, 2 sub-factions for every one of the C&C3 factions (so, 2 GDI ones, 2 Nod ones and 2 Scrin ones).It also has the Purifying Flame upgrade for the Black Hand Nod sub-faction, which is insane. It bears repeating. The Purifying Flame upgrade is INSANE.			"

												Kane's Wrath builds on the story development in C&C3 but focuses solely on the NOD progression.  The chronology takes place shortly after C&C2 and includes the time of C&C3 and then beyond, and while it's interesting there's little reinforcement of  the concept, -it would have been nice to see stronger visual fidelity to C&C2, for instance.This expansion adds a plethora of new units with intriguing uses, but the new units are perhaps more specialized than is satisfying.  The grand reveal of Kane's ultimate weapon results in units that aren't so game-changing as you would be lead to believe.  The missions remain fun and not overlong but the story linking them is a little underwhelming with even more repetition of the backstabbing cliche's and a constant sense of being pushed around no matter how successful you are.Visuals and audio are exactly the same as C&C3, but the game does add in a sort of Risk-style ""conquer the world"" mode which is great fun on a strategic level.

												I was expecting this to be some expansion to C&C 3's awesome storyline focusing on the NOD. I was wrong. This is behind the scenes' events that occured during the main game's NOD campaign. I mean you get to see Kane victorious and all but I think that could be included in the main game. Some new units are available for both GDI and NOD but nothing special. What is special is that you get to build MARV and Redeemer hehe. Also the Global Conquest feature allows you play a more ""tactical"" sort of say C&C game implementing its real-time experience as well and was quite the surprise. I recommend the game only as a sale.			"

Desync problems are still prevalent despite the numerous patches since its release but all in all it is still a very fun game to play online with your friends (if you have any).I only wish EA would do something about the cheating AI, however.

												As far as quality goes, Kane’s Wrath provides everything a good RTS expansion should have.  The Scrin, Nod, and GDI are divided into 3 “sub-factions”, where 2 of the sub-factions have a unique military specialization.  The other sub-faction has its default features from Tiberium Wars.  Kane’s Wrath provides a ton of additional custom maps for skirmishes and gives the player plenty of extra content to continue enjoying C&C 3.   Overall: 9/10 … AWESOME "

												While Kane's Wrath is not that impressive of an expansion, the story is light years ahead of C & C 3. There are some additional units and sub-factions for NOD, GDI and my personal favorite, the Scrin. Even though the actaul campiagn is about 6-8 hours, you can have much more satisfying time playing the ""Conquer the World"" campaign which is not only longer, but more stragetic. If you are Command and Conquer fan or you bought C & C 3 at some point, I can recommend getting this. While the story has some plot holes, the sub-factions are not that unique, and the epic units can cheap in combat, this game is an improvement. Too bad EA completely destroyed the Command and Conquer franchise with the last game.			"

												Not everyone's favorite incarnation of C&C, but - for me - this is a great mix of decent graphics, great atmospheric music, and the usual resource balancing that drew me to the C&C series in the first place. If you want loads of management detail, head for the Civilization serries. If you'd rather spend as much time commanding your troops as you do commanding your civilian rsource-gatherers, this s a great entry-level strategy game.			"

												Follow-up review to my C&C3 review.Yeah it's pretty good. New units, new story to fill the gap between Tiberian Sun and Tiberium Wars, as well as showing Nods movements before and after the Third Tiberium War. Six new factions to screw around as in Skirmish and Multiplayer, each with their own units and upgrades that provide considerable upsides and downsides to the player. I'd say the price could be a little lower but it's not super overpriced. If you enjoyed C&C3 you'll love Kane's Wrath. Buy it.also 8/10			"

This is behind the scenes' events that occured during the main game's NOD campaign. I mean you get to see Kane victorious and all but I think that could be included in the main game. Some new units are available for both GDI and NOD but nothing special. What is special is that you get to build MARV and Redeemer hehe. Also the Global Conquest feature allows you play a more ""tactical"" sort of say C&C game implementing its real-time experience as well and was quite the surprise. I recommend the game only as a sale.			"

												I'm going to go ahead and review both C&C 3: Tiberium Wars and Kane's Wrath here, with Kane's Wrath essentially being an expanded version of the base game. If you've played the C&C series before, you won't find it hard to get into the story plot being presented, included with your all time favortie Joe Kucan as Kane, forever and always. Despite Electronics Arts beating the canon pretty hard, Kane is enough to usually keep me playing for a bit.The actual format of the game itself is pretty simple enough, sticking to the basics, you control your MCV, which acts as your headquarters and main building unit, thus losing one early game usually spells defeat. Much of the combat is rock paper scissor style, however a combination of units is usually required to mount succesful offensive and defense operations against the enemy. Unit garrison of buildings can provide for some amusing early game attrition warfare, until the game gradually reaches mid-game and late-game, in which the bigger and more ridiculous units make their approach.Being an old classic, I would recommend this game to most general strategists, however if you're looking for an intense strategy, this might not be what you're looking for.Kane lives!

												I got this game on CD from my grandfather when it first came out and I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. I must have logged over 300 hours of that game (This was before I had ever heard of Steam). Then one day my computer broke and I had to take it in for repairs. I accidentally left the CD in when I took it and when I got my PC back it was gone. I was devistated, but a year later when I jumped on the steam train, I bought it back. It was still the great game I know and love as one of my first games and the game that defines realtime strat for me. Unlinke most, I have always played the game on ""slow mode"". By slow mode I just turn the game speed to very low. I was a kid whe I first started so I needed it to be slow, but even now and I still keep it on slow because thats how I fell in love with it. But this game offers many things like that to help out people new to real time strats. I highly reccommend this game to any type of gamer of any age. This is my favorite game of all time and I hope will give this game a chance.			"

Pros:  It is a very simple game, and offers a fairly robust number of characters and buildings.Cons: It could have a story mode that included the other two factions, instead of just leaving it at a cliff hanger.If the game is on sale, i would highly recommend it, it has fun multiplayer mods for up to eight people, however the lack of online support makes it lacking for anything other than an old school lan party, but who does that naymore?

												Home of the most insane upgrade I've ever seen in an RTS: ""Purifying Flame"".Think of Nod's flamethrower-using units from the vanilla C&C3. Now, make a Nod sub-faction that gives a Black Hand unit to all infantry units.And then give it an upgrade that turns flamethrower jets blue and increases their damage by a ludicrous amount. That is Purifying Flame. One flame tank takes 3-4 seconds to take down a big building.--Other than that, it features a third campaign that helps you see what happened between C&C2's aftermath and C&C3's campaign, 2 sub-factions for every one of the C&C3 factions (so, 2 GDI ones, 2 Nod ones and 2 Scrin ones).It also has the Purifying Flame upgrade for the Black Hand Nod sub-faction, which is insane. It bears repeating. The Purifying Flame upgrade is INSANE.			"

But as a long time C&C player i am disapointed by the lack of depth, sure the units are cool but its the same old build a base build units send them against other units with no cover mechanics or interesting game types it feels bland and is more about having a big army as opposed to good positioning or having a stronger tactical position which are rare since the maps are very open and offer little in terms of a tactical advantage aside from resouce areas. ill give it a good reveiew since it has its moments and isnt complete♥♥♥♥♥♥like C&C4			"

												In my opinion, simply the best RTS to date, period. Though it is a bit old, the graphics and gameplay are exceptional, as well as balanced. This is a must have for RTS players.			"

												A fantastic game, runs very well on old hardware plus it looks pretty good on decent hardware (doesn't require much to run). Sadly its capped at 30 fps, but thats because the game depends on it. (15 fps = game literally running half as slow)			"

												I was expecting this to be some expansion to C&C 3's awesome storyline focusing on the NOD. I was wrong. This is behind the scenes' events that occured during the main game's NOD campaign. I mean you get to see Kane victorious and all but I think that could be included in the main game. Some new units are available for both GDI and NOD but nothing special. What is special is that you get to build MARV and Redeemer hehe. Also the Global Conquest feature allows you play a more ""tactical"" sort of say C&C game implementing its real-time experience as well and was quite the surprise. I recommend the game only as a sale.			"

												This game Is literally one of my childhood games My brother got me into it when i was like 6 or 7 I'm 16 now. And honestly This game is a must have but it requires C&C3 to play It has an intense storyline and I recommend it to anybody willing to play! It has bonus New Units and superweapons! It is an awesome game Franchise. Sadly Command and conquer 4 is nothing like it From what i've heard, I prefer This over any other command and conquer in general. If this game had Naval units it probably would have been the best command and conquer ever made compared to Red alert 3. I suggest you try it sometime. Also if you can't play online the old servers shut down But! there is still hope! Go to C&C online and they have servers to where you can PvP against others. Help them by donating to keep the servers up and running!!! KANE LIVES!			"

												Pretty much just C&C tiberium wars, just spiced up with some new units, new campaign and alot of other fixes.I absolutely love this game, but as of writing this review, the community is pretty dead, you can still find tournaments and some C&C based youtube channels.9/10			"

												you get units pretty much the size of buildings, if not about 1/4 size of the map, that can step on tanks like if they were toys.if you like tw but want more units without downloading mods because you're too stupid then get this game. jk but kw is still a good game to own.story it self is trash i honestly hate the story on singleplayer in this game, if you wanna play for the story play tw, its crap it self but its a lot better than this one. which leads to cnc4 a even more crappier story where the ending is just total garbage. i bought cnc4 on the first day i remember when i was 12 or some crap and i was so happy when my dad brought it home,  i snatched that game from him while it was still in the walmart bag. the cd case was so bad♥♥♥♥♥looking and when i installed the game i was jumping in my chair having a seizure then when i played it i was like wtf is this pile of trash???? only 10 units?? gotta level up 20 times just to use better units??? you only get certain types of units per mcv?? no resource collecting??? no buildings??? only mcdonald size defenses?? lol i uninstalled that game so fast and i got a refund. i was really upset, it broke my heart, then i saw generals 2 coming out and i was hyped too for 2015 to come, and 2015 came, and yet EA grabbed my heart and just slammed it into pieces again. EA doesn't care about command and conquer, they care about other games that are more profitable, thats just how it is for a company.so thats why im still playing cnc3, because of how crap cnc4 was. i barley played cnc4 for 5 minutes and here i am playing cnc3 still for nearly a decade. cnc3 was my child hood, i remember when i was 8 coming home from school and i just sat on the computer and forgot about school and all the jerks there. here i am still, come home after a crap fest test day and i just plop my self on the computer and play cnc3. i played cnc3 tw back in its demo stages. cnc3 is a never forgotten game despite EA not giving a crap about it, hence why they wanted to kill the game already, their attempt to give a ""EPIC ENDING"" as said on the box was pitiful and disgusting. people are still active on here, you gotta download some server crap though to play online though.
