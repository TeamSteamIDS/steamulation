												This, is a game for Die Hard Strategy fans, and I mean DIE Hard, the kind that will micromange and face extreme Difficulty and Realism, wait hours for anything to happen, and still be entertained. Well, I come from this point of view.This Game is not for the faint of heart, so if you've only played basic, or no RTS games, you really should steer clear of this one, and try some more popular titles. As for those who are experienced, this review is for you. Theatre of War is a very advanced strategy game, that is very hard, a challenge i'm sure you and I would gladly take. TOW combines Historical Accuracy and somewhat realistic gameplay to create a real platoon commanding feel. Extreme detail had been given to every object and how it interacts with others on the battlefield. You can play as the obvious All-Stars, USSR, USA, and UK, and some underdogs such as poland and frace are included (underdog if you look at it like I do), and each of these playable countries has a wide variety of units and missions to choose from. Missions are usually fun, however sometimes it can get tedious, defend this, attack that, over and over, but it varies in mission and out from time to time. Unfortunately, some common problems do plague this game, as with most realistic, large scale RTS games, the storys are quickly fed to you in a short amount of writing, and then its off to unscripted action, I know a lot of players enjoy a detailed RTS story, so you won't find one here. Further more, unit responsivness is slow, and will not act in a way a real battlefield scenario would play out, standing around, not reacting to rather obvious things, and would stare at an enemy, only firing a weapon slowly. However on a large scale, details can be put aside and the gameplay works and isnt unbalanced, using the right tactics and playing smart will always fetch you a win. This game really reflects 1C as a whole.--Pros--+ Realistic and Accurate+ Long Campaign Time with Plenty of missions+ Hundreds of different units all very well detailed--Cons--- Freindly and Enemy units are slow in response- Hardly a detailed story- Repeditive  "

												Steam must upgrade ToW because sell it without warning that the game doesnt work in Windows 7 or 8I bought ToW - the first - wich I consider a masterpiece of its kind, better than ToW2 Africa & Kursk, but I'm not able to play... The game seems doesnt work with Windows 7 & 8.Moreover I've wasted so many time to find a solution or even a explanation for it without success.I dont understand the Steam support team omission in this case!

												This is what I expected the Codename Panzer series to be (which was an huge disappointment beyond the graphics) and it is everything I have been looking for in a RTS/RTT type game. The level of realism is well beyond any other game of this type out there. Improper planning and use of tactics are punished over and over again by a good AI. Hundreds of units are modeled and at your fingertips and variants within each vehicle type are meticulously researched and detailed. Elements such as range, armor penetration and the intangibles such as shock and moral are accurately represented. I love the fact that you can actually use infantry for more than cannon fodder and can build an actual combined arms plan of attack for a given objective.   For those who are saying this game it too difficult or the scenarios take too long, fret not there is always the arcade build and unit-spam RTSs out there like Command and Conquer and Age of Empires……this one is for the big boys.

												Me like...lots of thinking involved.  Strategy does play a part in the mechanics of the game.  the AI does seem to deduct to the best course of action once it gets going.  That said, the opening moves of each map are obiviously scripted.  But this game does have all the cool tanks and all the cool things to do, and to get this game and all the other ToW games for under 15 bucks, hey, what a deal!			"

												I would really like to recommend this game: it is quite cheap now, it still looks good and it covers most of the European theatre of WWII. There are a lot of different units and it tries to be realistic.However there are so many issues that it turns into a definitely no:Aiming is unrealistic. If your tank crew is not exceptionally trained, they can't hit the enemy even from 20 meters. Fortunately it goes to the enemy as well. Same for penetration rules. Even when there is a hit from 20 meters and from the back, it just bounces off. I know that the gun of the R35 is not the ultimate tank killer, but it should be able to kill a Panzer IV with less then 8 shots from point blank range...The AI is terrible, but the enemy has the numerical advantage. In campaign most missions boil down to this: the useless infantry charges ahead, but they can be ignored, because in most cases they can't hurt the tanks. The player should have wait with its tanks and its highly trained crew until the enemy tanks get in shooting range, then the player should concentrate fire and destroy the enemy tanks one by one. Once it is done, the enemy infantry can be executed. It is important to protect the tank, bushes, terrain and especially buildings can help with that.Most campaign missions are setup in a way that it is disadvantageous to the player. The first step in almost every campaign mission is to concentrate the troops at one place or at a different place where the game suggests. If there is a small town on the map, it is the best just to collect the troops there, and wait till the enemy tanks come and can be shot down one by one.And let's not forget about loading times which are simply too long.

												Saw a stuart one shot a tiger 1 point blank to the front. ♥♥♥♥ this game. Saw a panzer 3 kill a Pershing point blank. The game is trash all around with poor workings.The idea of it is cool but it really is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. The infantry are just autistic and useless. Plus they really tried to copy Men of War, what pathetic garbage is this? Not worth your 5 bucks. DO NOT BUY IT.Secondly it is a not a die hard game for die hard RTS players. Whoever even says that must literally be off their nut. The game is very tedious yes, which makes it have good features of micromanagement. But the fact of the matter the AI is broken and predicts your moves a lot in the game and usually out guns you. Plus the Germans are just garbage in this game, yes suck it you Russian praising garbage. Russia lost 128k tanks in WW2, Germany lost 48k.Russia lost 14.8 million men in WW2, Germany lost 5.8.Germany was fighting two fronts and all over the place. I would not even dare review ♥♥♥♥♥Thunder the pay to win. Like how Anon showed the world conversation about the Dev's Nerfing American planes and giving unrealistic buff's that never happened to Russian aircraft. America is actually decent in the game. But other then swarm tactics they fall apart. Germany is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke the end, typical Russian superiority complex. Russian's are literally Goku and cannot die. The statistic's are beyond unrealistic.Britian for some reason is god tier as well. They boist good tank hunters.You can play as anyone and murder Germany really in this game. Whoever says this game is good is just the whatever to this game. Want a real review of a person who disliked this game? Not like 5 sentences and then a dislike? Because you people love downvoting their reviews. I can tell you now I sure as ♥♥♥♥ seen plenty of those. The game is a piece of trash and I am amazed a company spends to make a kraut killing simulator. I am not even a German main'er in games, But I can tell bs from fact. Now get butthurt and please just downvote me into oblivion.EditKEEP THE DOWNVOTES COMING, TRY TO WASH MY OPINION OUT~<3			"

												A bit hard to learn the basics, even with the tutorial, but easy to master after that. You take control of the German army and other armies, like the Polish, Russian, British, American), during real time battles inspired by real World War 2 battles (you can't change the outcome of World War 2). The gameplay is RTT (Real Time Tactics, you can still pause). You can't build bases but you might get reinforcements and call out for support aircraft and artillery, although I can't compare it with Sudden Strike or Blitzkrieg because it's much more realistic, the weapons and equipment (including the might Tiger and IS-2 tanks) are modeled after real life, with accurate range, armor, reload, speed, sounds, etc. so it's definitely not like in BF1942, for example, where hand grenades can take out a tank, you have to know how and with what to attack certain targets. The only thing I regret is that there aren't more games like this and that it's sorta limited in equipment and scenarios although it has what most of us probably want: the Battle of Kursk. 8/10			"

												Some tips:-Those who don't understand reverse slopes for placing artillery units will have a hard time in this game. Place AT guns on the reverse side peering just over the edge. Doing so will provide much needed cover.-Units zero in on enemies with each missed shot, move a tank or retreat a gun down a slope thats under fire to throw off enemy aim and force them to zero in again.-Caveat: Moving your own units, messes up their aim as well, trade-off accordingly. More experienced crews can fire while moving and maintain zero-in aim. (this is the era before gyrostabilizers)-Use tanks in hull down positions on slopes-Inexperienced gunners/drivers cannot fire while moving, they must come to a complete stop-Units with direct attack commands will zealously carry out their orders and chase enemies if they don't have clear line of sight. Be sure to cancel any attack orders with the stop command if you want them to acquire different targets.-Anti tank rifle infantry is great at finishing off wounded/disabled tanks. Remember that tanks poor vision near them and infantry can crawl around undetected.-Keep experienced soldiers alive during your campaign. An AT-rifleman/marksman or a tank gunner with good aim can make mincemeat of inexperiencd tanks--especially at a distance.-Units may panic if they have low leadership or no one nearby is around with a high leadership value.-Penetration values are ideal circumstances. That H35 with 35mm penetration probably won't kill a Panzer 4 with 30mm frontal armor unless some plating has already been blown off.			"

												Its kinda difficult to complete a mission on the hard difficulty setting (yeah I know) but for different reasons.Your tank crew cannot repair any damaged modules, so if you get your tracks blown off then good bye mobility.

Your guys suck as well so you need to be good.Otherwise I have no idea what to say..Hardcore realism based playerbase will enjoy it I know.I moderately did because of the reasons mentioned above.

												His name was Sergei. He was just 21 by the time war torn his life apart. He was given a rifle, an uniform, handful of bullets and an order - defend your country for any cost. He stood in the trench, seeing friendly tanks hopelessly shoot German beasts, his colleagues giving their last breaths with faces dug in the mud. Then, suddenly a new order came - regroup and organise a new line of defense. But he didn't. He ran across the battlefield with a deathwish until a 7,92mm Mauser bullet ended his life. He died because of his own insubordination. If you decide to play this unique RTS you need to prepare to have blood of hundreds of Sergeis on your hands, because nearly none of your men will follow your orders, and if they will it will always be too late.

												This should be an amazing game. Even if you aren't a history buff (I'm not) the idea of a realistic RTS that throws away the blunt rock-paper-scissors elements in favor of mechanics that accurately model real war, should make this an excellent purchase for those of us who despise games where a sniper takes 300 rounds of machine gun fire point blank, but does no die because the MG doesn't say ""good against snipers"" in it's description.Not to mention it's cheap. And I even liked this game at first, until I played some that are much better.  And it's not even that it's a legitimately bad game.Even if you overlook the bizarre inability to garrison units in structures and use cover. It just has some of the absolute worst A.I I have ever seen in a video game. I saw AT guns turn around and fire at things BEHIND them when there were still guys charging them from the front. Tanks will turn their backs to enemy armor when you need them to simply go in reverse. I told my infantry with an AT rifle to fire at a tank directly in front of him, but instead he slowly creeped up to the front of the tank and got run over. If you are looking for good war simulations you should look at Graviteam Tactics, or one of the many Combat Mission games. They are more expensive, but they are far better games.http://www.battlefront.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=26 "

												If you own anything with Windows 8* do not get this, it is bugged and won't run unless you wont to go through the entire process of coding in anti-bug codes in the files, besides paying $10.00 for a 4 yearold game is stupid, so save yourself the $ and don't get it.			"

												One of the best and realistic ww2 rts games ever made. Still looks good, still sounds good, still demanding and timeconsuming, still hurts when your best tank gets destroyed after he survived the first 2 missions, still gives your cpu tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to do :) No fast pew-pew-in-your-face company of heros gameplay.

												A poor man's ""Graviteam Tactics Operation Star,"" this game will give you a nice introduction to realistic WW2 tactical wargaming for a modest price. The game comes with several campaigns and includes events/nations rarely covered in the war (you can play the Invasion of Poland and France from both sides). The graphics really aren't terribly bad by today's standards, and the combat is slow and realistic. All of your units carry on from mission to mission in the campaigns, and they gain experience accordingly (they are all named and have semi-independent portraits so you can follow individual soldiers or squads if you are so inclined). The game also comes with a nice editor and plenty of user made missions on sites like Moddb. Overall, for $5 its a steal. It is the only game in the series that actually works on my PC without huge frame rate issues, and it is the most diverse in terms of units, dates, scenarios, environments, etc. You more than likely won't regret the dropping the modest price on it.

												Do you have an interest in weapons and armor encyclopedia? Do you want the sexy Panther/Tiger/T-34/Serman tanks that rotate around to showcase all their assets?Do you love to see the gun barrel of a Pak-40 75mm anti tank gun from the front?Do you love to see each of the halftracks wheels, sterring system, tracks, screws and metal?Do you love to read the rich history of each individual tanks, assault guns, artillery, tractors and vehicles?Do you love to read every detail in the weapon biodata? From gun calibre, ammunition type, vehicle crew etc etc?Do you wish you could hear them firing the actual sound of the gun rather than the generic ""pew pew pew""? Do you love realism?Do you love spending hours on end not playing the game but scrolling through the encyclopedia?Do you love spending the first few minutes playing you first mission? Then quit realized how difficult the game is and go online to search for solution?Do you love after playing, finally spending hours upon hours micromanage each individual unit to maximise success?Do you hate yourself?If you fullfilled the above criteria. congrats, you are more awesome than the CEOs of Ubisoft, EA, Warner Brothers! And have higher IQ than all the CEOs I mentioned!			"

												Back when I used to pre-order games, Theatre of War was among my most anticipated games of 2007.  However upon playing the game, I was terribly dissapointed in its abysmal performance and terrible ai, and generally extremely slow gameplay.  After less than one week of playing the game, I gave up on it.  Fast forward to late 2014 when I saw that this title was on sale for $0.99.   99 cents.  Wow, I had to give it another go, and sure enough the game has not only been patched to fix all of its early key problems from when it was first released, but also comes with the most important and critically acclaimed mod ready to install right away.  Right away I could tell that this game was reborn and risen like a phoenix.  Theatre of War has come from an abysmal early life to being without doubt THE BEST representation of company size combined arms warfare of the Second World War ever put in video game form.  I can not emphasize enough how fantastic and near perfect this game is.  In fact I could not believe that I was playing the same game that I first played seven years earlier.  Bottom line, Theatre of War is a masterpiece in the genre of tactical wargames.   A solid 9.5/10 maybe even 10/10.  Yeah, 10/10!  If you are someone who hates the lame arcadey company of heroes nonsense, then you owe it to yourself to get this incredible and extremely satisfying and PROPER wargame, right NOW!			"

												Warning: Theatre of war is a WWII RTS that places heavy empthsis on realitistic combat operations. Because of this, the game can get really hard really fast. So if you're not into games that are punishing for every mistake, don't buy this game. Theatre of War allows players to command various armies of the second World War from Poland to Russia. Every Nation campaign conists several historically based missions. Every unit you use is highly detailed and useful in some way. You command infantry, tanks, artillery, planes, etc. You're only allowed a certain amount of troops per mission. Because of this, you will have to choose wisely and make every effort to perserve them in combat as best you can.   Your surviving units gain combat expierence that enhances their skills. Making them more useful in the events that follow.  The only downside of the game is that it does feel a bit too hard at times. Even on the lowest difficulty.			"
