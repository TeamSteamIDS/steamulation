												Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.Don't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.Maybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.The cons:1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... 2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?The Pros:Everything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. 7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.Do you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.			"

												I write this review shortly after it becoming my most-played game on Steam.It's difficult to summarize what is- without question- the best space 4X that exists.With all my hours, I've never even really played past the midgame. There's so much replayability just in restarting galaxies with different settings. I constantly got somewhere in the midgame and realized there was a setting I wanted to change.You'd be surprised how much some of those galaxy generation settings make a difference. Things like pirate amount, pirate strength, colonization range, galaxy size, colony influence range, and even the generic difficulty setting.I constantly toyed with all of them. Trying less but stronger pirates. More but weaker pirates. I finally found the balance I like.Colonization range matters. Too large and empires jump over each other's borders. Too small and you run out of in-range planets you can colonize.Galaxy size, in relation to star amount. You can do 15x15 with 1400 stars, or 10x10 with 1400 stars. The difference of course is the density of the entire galaxy.Influence range. Colonies project ""influence"" and these influence circles are considered your territory. This is a setting typically not thought of- just set to the recommended setting- but this matters too. For example I'm experimenting with having it set to the minimum setting- 10%- and this is all kinds of interesting. The influence circles basically don't extend beyond their respective solar systems, leaving the vastness of space permanently unclaimed. Multiple empires can have mines within a single solar system, and not ♥♥♥♥♥ at each other for having mines in the other's territory.The difficulty setting. I played on Normal for the longest time. But I began to notice that towards the midgame, I would have like 16 colonies and every other empire would have like 3 or 4. I was vastly ahead. Bumping the difficulty up to Hard allows the AI to keep up with me, and it's common for a few to stay ahead of me as well. An extremely welcome change, to not just breeze through the entire game.Ship design is amazing. I love unlocking new components and building ships from scratch. Testing them out in battle. When they wreck face, I feel like it's because I designed them well.Lots of people describe the game as a space opera and it really is. The stories it creates, the politics that unfold, are amazing.This game swept me away. I've played it for countless hours on end. There is a feeling of vastness to it that no other 4X has given me, whether in playing them myself or watching others. The fact that the game is real time rather than turn-based is a big part of this.Look up pictures of the galaxy map for this game, largest size. You actually feel like you're a pathetic little nothing, in just one of the 1400!!! solar systems in the galaxy. Many empires, you'll never actually meet, just because they're so far away.The reason this is the best is because of immersion, because of its mechanics that effortlessly cause such immersion. Fine control over resources, ship design, and surprisingly good diplomacy.You can design your mining stations to be weak and have fleets to protect them, at the cost of state funds. Or you can decide to make them extra freaking beefy so that they can hold pirates off on their own, at the cost of the private sector, which usually has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of cash laying around anyway.Need I go on?I really hope you guys found this helpful. Comments are greatly welcomed!			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Distant Worlds: Universe is a game that falls under the RT4X genre (e.g. Sins of a Solar Empire),  which is developed by Code Force and published by Slitherine Ltd., most notably known for their catalog of strategy games ranging from 4X to Real Time Strategy (RTS).PLOT (No Spoilers):Distant Worlds: Universe has a VAST and EXTENSIVE micromanagement system that basically allows the player to form their own dream space-faring civilization.  If you're the type of player who loves war, the game has an extensive tech tree that follows that path.  If you're not really into conflict then you can automate most of the war process and focus more on trade and commerce which is also very extensive.  To make a long story short, the game can accommodate every play style that different 4X and strategy players usually look for such as War, Trade, Diplomacy, Space Piracy, Benevolent / Tyrannical Empire style etc.PROS:+ Extensive and deep empire management system that allows you to focus on certain aspects that interest the player. (War, Trade, Diplomacy, Space Piracy, Benevolent / Tyrannical Empire etc.)+ Helpful in-game encyclopedia that details most of the game's mechanics.+ Customizable civilizations and races, including personalized government types and policies.+ Design and personalize your own ships, space stations and facilities. (Want to build a Death Star? Sure why not?  The game is not going to stop you.)+ Moddable+ Unlimited replayability due to the game's extensive nature.+ Large scale space battles and planet side (ground) combat, something that Sins of a Solar Empire should have had.+ Good sound design and in-game music.CONS:- Graphics is sub-par. I'll be honest: the 2D sprites in this game are not that pretty to look at.- User Interface (UI) is barebone in design and sometimes utilizes Windows sound effects and prompts. Seriously, it could use some work.- Very steep learning curve- Some sprites overlap each other making them a bit hard to click.  Good thing that the game allows you to select the units through a pop-up list of the stacked units.- Performance may degrade when your empire gets way too large but it still ultimately depends on your PC's CPU power.  This means that the System Requirements in the Store page may not truly reflect what you really need if you're planning on playing this on the largest galaxy possible.CONCLUSION:EXCELLENT RT4X GAME but only if: 1. You’re a fan of 4X strategy games2. You love micromanagement3. Have a lot of free time4. Have a lot of patienceThis game makes all other 4X games look simple in comparison due to its vast scale.WORTH IT?One question that faced many people concerning this game was the hefty price tag of $60 (or your regional equivalent), a price normally seen with large Triple-A title games.  In this case however, Distant Worlds: Universe contains the base game plus all past expansions including the final one, so treat this as a 'Complete Edition'.Buy this game at full price if you fulfill the requirements I listed on the CONCLUSION part because otherwise, wait for a sale if you just want to try the game out.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Distant Worlds is the best 4x available today. It's combination of depth and accessibility is unmatched in this genre. How, you might ask, does it accomplish this feat? Variable micromanagement. If you want to nurture your colonies from day one, to design every strut and gravatic beam weapon on your ships, and ensure that the right espionage agent ends up on a mission to steal operations maps from your dreaded enemy, you can. On the other hand, if you want the AI to deal with all the micromanagement and to instead cruise around the galaxy in your prototype hyperdrive rocket, look at the ruins of ancient civilizations and run from giant space lobsters, you can do that instead. You can even combine the two -- more or less -- and tool around in the rocket while occasionally changing tax rates, build orders, and spy/diplomatic targets.Unlike most 4x games, DW is built on the back of a fairly intricate economic simulator. But wait - simulator - does that mean I can't control it??? Not directly. The civilian economy, all those little freightors, gas mining ships, and tourist vessels... that is almost entirely out of your hands. You can set up your military/industrial base to encourage good civilian use, but the civies decide for themselves whether they want to pick up a load of Cason gas and move it to where you need fuel for your next military campaign.DW:U brings better pathing, improved AI, and expanded mod capabilities to an already great game. Cons: The game resolution is set to your desktop resolution because it runs in a borderless window. Consequently, the font can be small and hard to read. If this is a problem for you, one solution is to lower your desktop resolution before launching the game.*This review is based upon many hours of DW:Legends gameplay. Universe brings 2 additional expansions worth of gameplay to the table and I look forward to getting to know it well.			"

Quick Summary:Distant Worlds is the most complex space 4X strategy game I've played in my 15+ years of gaming. Where it lacks in flashy graphics, it makes up for in vibrant, uniquely immersive gameplay. While it's not without flaws, I definitely recommend it to any would-be galactic emperor looking for a thoughtful space 4X experience.Pros:Its galaxies are bustling with life and activity. DW provides pretty much the most engaging simulation of a sentient life-filled universe I've seen to date.A rich and unique economic system: Your civilian taxpayers are actually running their own private economy with ships and bases you can't control.You can automate pretty much anything, letting you focus on controlling the parts you most enjoy.Every little ship has a competent AI allowing your empire to fend for itself even without constant input from you.Cons:Colony management is rather simplistic.Research is done by advancing through a fixed tech tree just like in the Civilization series. I consider this a con because it makes large parts of each game play out rather samey, hurting the otherwise great replayability.Due to the complexity, DW isn't an easy game to get into.There's no multiplayer mode. This isn't a con for me but it might be for some.Detailed Review:I've played many of the space 4X games out there including Master of Orion 2, Imperium Galactica 1-2, Pax Imperia 2, Galciv 1-2, SotS 1, Endless Space, Space Empires 4-5, Star Ruler, Lost Empires, Armada 2526, etc and to me what sets Distant Worlds apart from all of these is that its galaxies feel ""alive"" and real to a degree that I just haven't seen in any other space 4X game to date.They are living, breathing worlds filled with hundreds to thousands of ships, each with their own agenda, going about their daily activities around the clock: civilians hauling cargo, tourists visiting resort bases, military ships patrolling trade lanes, pirates raiding, ancients scheming... all in real time. There's always something going on.At the core of this bustling activity is the economic model that's one of the most richly conceived ones out there. For once the people that you're taxing for income are finally actively present in the galaxy - they're running a private economy, buying freighters from your shipyards, hauling resources to wherever they're in demand, carrying tourists to your resort bases, migrating in passenger ships from colony to colony to avoid high taxes, etc and they do that completely without your input - in fact you can't even control them directly but merely influence them (e.g. by designing better freighters for them to buy) which gives DW a bit of a Majesty-like charm. All of this isn't just a small sideshow either - these civilians actually make up most of the interstellar traffic in the game.The part of your empire that you directly control is also a lot smarter than in other games. It's not a completely helpless child that needs babysitting with even the most basic tasks such as resource flow or self-defense. Resource flow for instance is handled by the aforementioned private economy *if* they have enough money to buy and maintain their own ships and bases after paying your taxes.As for self-defense, even on full manual control, your ships can be given individual AI that automatically assigns them to civilian escort, patrol, defense, etc duties across your territory according to your empire's needs (and yes they're smart enough to refuel/repair without you). You just build them and they'll handle the rest *if* that's what you want but you can also take manual control and have them follow your orders only. In either case, you can leave your ships completely unattended because it's possible to configure their design to e.g. kite enemies with long range weapons, close the distance for short range attacks, board and capture hightech enemies for disassembly, etc so that they fight exactly how you want them to even when you aren't looking. And it's always a glorious moment when your automated defense fleet first defeats a pirate raid without any input from you.In fact part of DW's appeal is that when building your empire you're basically creating and nurturing a complex self-sufficient system with the aim of making it more efficient than the rival empires.An interesting quirk is that you can automate just about anything from research to foreign policy, military operations, espionage, etc. On full automation, the game essentially plays itself. That'd be like watching a pure AI vs AI match in other games. Only here you can influence your AI by taking control of certain decisions. One possible playstyle is to only control one aspect (or just one fleet, or ship) of your empire while leaving the rest to the AI which makes it feel like you're just a minister/general/fleet admiral/ship captain instead of a supreme ruler.The ability to automate things also makes the late-game mop-up period a lot less tedious. In other games, I often just quit once I reach a point where nothing can stop me because the game is practically won and the only challenge left would be to endure the tedium of rinse-repeat steamrolling whatever is left out there. In DW, you can finish up by declaring your wars, putting your military on full auto and watching your good hard work come to fruition as carnage ensues without the hassle of having to manually control all of that.Naturally you also have most of the standard/good bits from other 4X classics such as custom ship design, diplomacy, research, espionage, pirate factions, assignable characters (scientist, governor, etc) with developing abilities, random events, hidden tech, abandoned ships around the galaxy and so on. There are also some extras like the logistics system - in DW your ships generate their energy from fuel which will limit how long they can travel or fight before needing to stop by a gas giant's mining station or a spaceport to refill their tanks. I also really like the pre-warp starting condition where you're confined to your first solar system until you develop some type of warp drive due to the simple fact that your impulse engines are too slow and would take forever to reach even the nearest star.My primary complaint would be that the research aspect which is exactly like the research in the Civilization series (and most other 4X games) is too static. Since technological progress essentially defines how these games play out, if the tech tree is always the same, then each game will also start feeling the samey after a few playthroughs. Fortunately in DW, 1 playthrough can be very long - I'm 137 hours in and only played 2 games so far.Of course, this isn't a negative point in the sense that most other 4X games handle research the same simple way (remarkably, one of the few exceptions was good ole MoO2). But I hope game designers will someday inject some dynamism and randomness into this most overlooked and outdated aspect of the 4X concept.My other complaint would be that colony management is rather simplistic. Setting taxes and race policies is pretty much the only meaningful ""management"" you can do as there are very few buildings to build and most have no economic impact so there's not much you can do to customize colonies.Last but not least, it deserves a mention that the first few hours of DW can feel quite intimidating in various ways: If you don't use automation, it can feel overwhelming while if you use too much automation, it can make you feel unneeded. Don't let that discourage you though because with practice it will all become second nature and you will eventually do much better than the automation so just experiment to see which learning style suits you best.At the end of the day, if you persevered, Distant Worlds will reward you with an epic space 4X experience that you just won't find anywhere else.

												                 First I want to say this is the best 4x game I have played, and I have played, Civs 4, 5, Sins all of them and modded, Pandora, galtic civs 1 and 2, sword of the stars 1 and 2. It has better depth than civs 4, better 4x than Sins,  the most realistic solar systems I have seen in a 4x game.               That said, dont expect to just jump in and be the master of the game. If all you have played is Civs 5 then you will have a huge learning curve. Since in Civs 5 can be won really no matter what you do. I see in alot of these reviews for this, people get overwhelmed with all the stuff. I will say this, dont try to understand everything at once. Most of the people writing bad reviews, seem to be trying to controll 1400 star map, and do everything. While you can control everything manually, it makes it rather time consuming. The computer ai, does a great job of controlling the stuff you dont want to.                  I skipped this game for the longest time due to the price, and 2d graphics, but I def regret that. This game has been one of the few i have bought, that i didnt feel i needed to have a mod running to enjoy the game. I have added some mods since I started, and they just make the game alot better.                  I just want to address one thing though. I am not really sure why people are having such a hard time with the UI. Everything in the UI is customizable to what you want, I mean everything. Also everything is there easy to access, you can make your own ships, see all the aliens, see all colonies, ect. There isnt anything different really from the other 4x games. I found this UI alot easier to use than Civs 4.  "

												When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.Even for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.With time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.			"

												This is, hands down, the most complex 4x I ever played.And I've been playing it since the first release, back when it was only Distant Worlds (this version has four, I think, expansions already integrated)It does things differently from others, and this is a very good thing.Let me explainThe most notable thing is the existence of the civilian sector. Unlike most 4x, you aren't a god, you control the state, but not the people and you really need the peoplet to sustain your empire and, thus, must protect them and nurture them so that your tax base grows.Though it is a bit more complex than that. The first thing you have to understand is that resources? there are lots of those in game, and came in three cathegories, Strategic, Luxury and Super.Strategic are needed to keep your warmachine going, Luxury enhance the value of your civilians helping their planets grow faster and more devoped (and thus more profitable), supers are technically luxury as in that they are used by your civilians but they have profound effects, are very rare, expensive and desireable that I generally put them appart (specially since all empires can restrict the trading of these resources to other empires).Not all planets, asteroids, nevula and what not have all resources, so it si important to have multiple mines thoughout your territory and beyond to feed your industrial might.Not only this allows you to deepen your stockpiles, buti t also lowers the price of the resource in question, which in turn lowers the cost of components that contain that resource .Ship components are manufactured from the Strategic resources, it is not abstracted, and generally needs several resources, in different quantities, to produce a single components. Because of this the logistics of the game are complex, but it is generally of little immediate concern to the player, you aren't going to be manually moving resources, the traders are for that (so you better protect our mines, miners and trade ships) and do so more or less automatically, of course, scarcity of the resource modifies its price, and therefore a component might be made cheaper by having multiple mines.Speaking of which here is where the game shines, see, because you need to protect the civilian sector, the mines and the trade ships you need more than the battleline, you also need cheap, inexpensive and discardable escorts to police your inner lines both from imperial raiders and pirates.Spaking of which, it is important to note that this means war is more complex than throwing your fleets at the enemy. You have to protect the homefront too. Or, if the enemy is more dangerous than you and can't fight it head on, you can try to collapse his economy by raiding his soft underbelly or by hiring pirates to do the raiding for you, you can even do that in peace time, but of course, you might just get found out. Speaking of pirates, dealing with them can be complicated. using them as proxy might be tampting, but they aren't the most loyal of folks, and letting them grow too large might be... unwise.The game has several modes, but have a basic divide you can be a normal empire or a pirate nation, this changes how you play the game significantly as they have completely different playstyles.As a Normal empire, you can start at different levels of development, from pre-warp all the way to being an already stablished star nation.I love Pre-warp start, it is impressive seeing the little ships puttering on your starting system, as you develop and industralize it, turning it into the cornerstone of your empireWhile you can micro everything, the AI is reasonable and generally does a good job, though as of late I prefer to contorl where the mines get built to make it easier on my navy.Thing is, this is not a game for everybody. It is dificult, demanding and expensive. The art and interphase could be better, but it is functional and do their jobs well enough. But it is, hands down, the most ambitious demanding and complete 4x I ever played.Worth every penny to me.			"

												This game is marginally thumbs down for me. I don't hate it and I spent a lot of time studying it and learning how to play. That said, I really wanted to love this game, however, it just misses being a good game. Considering how many people say its the greatest 4x space game, I guess I'm the odd one out, but I really don't think it deserves those accolades. The interface looks clunky, but once you understand how to use it, it's actually not too bad, although it is not quite to the standard of polished interfaces in some games.  The text size is a huge problem, unless you have eagle eyes.  Not being able to increase text size is a substantial ommission.The map and races are all pretty good, although I found there actually wasn't a lot of meaningful differences between them.The automation is quite good, but again, feels like there is a layer of auto control that is missing for me.  I'm happy to automate, but I want to be able to give a little more specific direction from a strategic perspective to feel like I'm still controlling the game, rather than simply watchng it.  For example, controlling which races I will allow as immigrants.  I might be wrong, it felt like I either blocked it or risked having traitors in my midst.I think a significant weakness is the difficulty in defending territory from attacks that often have no warning.  If you have the tech for scanners that can see far into space, you can get some warning, but I feel that there is something missing in the design that requires this.  I'm agnostic on space lanes by the way.  I think what's missing is at least some indicator of a contact incoming, even if its unidentified. It really needs something to give you a heads up.  Finding a planet is dead after the fact is annoying.The greatest weakness this game has is a lack of feedback to the player that gets your attention.  A game with this much automation and size needs to automate important warning and bring them to your attention BEFORE they hit, so you have time to think about remedial action.  You might automate a lot, but without timely feedback, I felt a bit blind. The frustration related to this eventually caused me to dump the game.  Something like the warning system on EU IV would be a huge improvement.I did try the AI and Star Trek mods. They are both good.			"

												If you ever thought Master of Orion 3's paradigm of a 4X game designed around macromanagement instead of micromanagement was a good idea that Quicksilver and Atari horribly bungled, this is the game for you. Even if you didn't, this is probably the best space 4X released in the past several years. The key difference here is that CodeForce, unlike Quicksilver, managed to pair that paradigm with a more streamlined design and an AI that can actually handle whatever tasks the player chooses to delegate to it - from diplomacy, to infrastructure building, to research, to strategic or tactical fleet combat, while largely staying out of the player's way and providing a wealth of information, or helpful suggestions, to help the player make decisions in those areas the player chooses to take on themselves.

												The ugliest 4x in the genre and also by far the best. I love Gal Civ 2(3) and Stellaris might get there with expansions, but this game has an amazing amount of detail and control. It also has a ton of expansion work that you get for free. This is a tremendous game if you like Transport Tycoon or Dwarf Fortress or love games where you can min/max everything and spend hours on a paused screen customizing your own fleet ship templates for both military use but also your freighters, bases, and exploration ships. Or not, and just use the presets as the game will automatically update them for you as you progress through the massive tech tree.			"

												The Distant Worlds franchise has proven to be an unusual exception for me.  When it comes to games these days, I am rarely an ""early adopter.""  Rather, I  wait for other, more adventurous gamers to gamble their time and money before I stick my toe into the water.  But with Distant Worlds it was different for me from the get-go.  I was intrigued from the first moment I saw the low-fi 2010 announcement pitch from a then unknown New Zealand development team by the name of Code Force.  There was just something about it that suggested ambitious innovation from the get-go.  As I was reviewing games at the time, I requested a review code for the original DW game to check it out - really, more out of curiosity than an actual eagerness to play the game.   Long short: I quickly became hooked, as you can read here:http://www.gamesquad.com/review/distant-worldsRight off the bat it got a solid 8.0 from me!Well, Code Force wasn't done yet!  They proceeded to take the community feedback and wishlist items and incorporate a lot of it into subsequent expansions.  As you can see by my subsequent reviews, they did not disappoint:http://www.gamesquad.com/review/reviewed-distant-worlds-return-shakturihttp://www.gamesquad.com/review/reviewed-distant-worlds-legendsWith the release of Legends the game had already earned a ""9.0"" from me.  Impressive!  Of course, since then Code Force has released two more expansions, so the game has only improved (especially in light of the Universe compendium that FINALLY brought the game to Steam!).  If I was to review this title today, it probably would top out around 9.5 or better!Now, why do I say that?  What is it that makes Distant Worlds so special?  Simply, it is this:Unlike most other space-based 4X strategy games, Distant Worlds isn't some sort of chess-like static experience where nothing happens unless a player makes it happen.  Instead, DW is more like Sim City or Europa Universalis, or even Crusader Kings 2, where the player immediately understands that he is but one small cog in a very large, very active galaxy where all sorts of things are happening that are outside of his control.   Part of this is due to DW's real time environment (again, like EU or CK2) where there is constant activity on the map from the various other factions that share the galaxy with the player.  But the biggest contributor to all this activity is the game's ""Private Sector.""  Unlike every(?) other 4X game out there, DW deliberately limits the player's action to the ""State"" sector of his empire, which includes the military, diplomacy, tax rates, and so on.  As with the real world, the private sector - the citizenry, merchants, miners, traders - are outside direct control of the state.  While the player can influence their actions with policies, their day to day activities are completely autonomous.  This is where DW brilliantly succeeds as it is the private sector that brings so much life to the galaxy.  In fact, this is why I often compare DW to Sim City because it can be so much fun to watch ""the little people"" go about their lives in a very dangerous galaxy as you do your best to protect and shepard them.  For example, I recall one game some time ago where a passenger ship was attacked by a space monster (or was it pirates?) while on route to a tourist destination.  The ship was badly damaged and left adrift.  As the supreme ruler, I had to send out a repair ship to save them, which was really cool.  Of course, I had to detail some military vessels to protect them while the repair ship did its work.  THAT is the type of unique, micro focus that DW offers that so many space games just completely overlook.   I also find DW to be like Crusader Kings 2 because, with the arrival of the Legends expansion, DW now has its own cast of characters - diplomats, scientists, spies, and more - who are randomly generated and acquire unique personality stats.  As with CK2, this really adds a sense of personality to your empire (and yes, far in excess of the under-cooked characters in Endless Space).  And while these characters don't engage in the sort of interpersonal skulduggery that is common to CK2, they can be assassinated and killed by events.  Just yesterday I had a talented energy researcher assassinated when his research base was destroyed by a sabotage-induced explosion!  Do you see how I mean DW is less like your typical chess-like 4X strategy game, and more like a science fiction Sim City / CK2/ EU4 hybrid?  There is just nothing like this game on the market at the moment, something that fully justifies its somewhat pricey cost (trust me: it is worth every penny!).  In short, if you like turn-based, by-the-numbers, 4X strategy game where you have total god-like control over everything, this might not be for you.  But if you are the type of gamer who loves real time grand strategy games that works with you to tell your own story in a sandbox environment - again, like a Crusader Kings 2 or a Europa Universalis 4 -  this is DEFINITELY what you have been looking for.   You don't so much play DW as you experience it.  And, as with Crusader Kings, when the game is done, boy will you have some tales to tell! Highly recommended!			"

Distant Worlds: Universe - The definition of a true RT4X, but not a game for everyone.I feel as though this review doesn't do the game justice, as I highly enjoy this game. That said, there are things about it that most gamers would have trouble with, despite Distant Worlds generally being a good game.Gameplay-wise, Distant Worlds is extremely deep. The tech tree is enormous and even makes logical sense. Basic gameplay is very similar to an RTS, while the amount of control you have over every aspect of your empire goes down to the very designs of your ships. This may seem too deep, but you can automate anything you don't want to have to deal with - you can even basically let the AI take over for you while you watch if you want.Graphically, the game is a bit dated, though it will look familiar to people who have played older RTSs and indie 4Xs. There's not much to say here, as it's a 2D game without too many graphical frills. However, I'm kinda glad the graphics are so basic - there's so much going on in this game that 3D graphics of any sort would kill even modern GPUs.The soundtrack is something I could gush over for days, but I'm not going to. It basically varies from cinimatic to orchestral classical, and even a bit of monophonic chamber classical (though it all meshes together very well). One thing, however, is that the entire soundtrack plays at all times, so you may end up with peaceful exploration music during a brutal war, or a high-intensity battle theme while you're peacefully exploring the galaxy.Quality-wise, this game is all over the map. On one hand, the game runs surprisingly smoothly for what can be considdered the biggest RT4X ever made in terms of map size. On the other hand, there are parts of the game that don't feel finished, particularly the system used for ground combat.One thing to note: This game has a steep learning curve dispite all the automation features. Mistakes will hurt, and they will hurt HARD.The Bottom LineGameplay: 9/10 - Deep, almost too deep in fact.Graphics: 5/10 - Nothing special, but there's no slowdown.Soundtrack: 10/10 - IncredibleQuality: X/10 - I can't give a rating in this category, as the game is all over the map here.Overall: 8/10 - A little rough around the edges, but definately a solid entry in the RT4X genre.Recommended for: Fans of RT4Xs, people who liked Civilization but were bored by how simple it wasNot Recommended for: The average gamer.P.S. Pirates suck			"

												I like space games, I like strategy games, I don't really care about graphics so much. No wonder I like this game...Distant worlds is pretty much THE best 4x game I have played so far. I don't know what it is, but something always drags me back when I have not played for a while.The game is complex and it takes a while to get used to it. The tutorial isn't helping much and I recommend watching youtube videos. But once you're familiar with the game the fun starts.The game provides its player with a huge amount of possible automation. That way the player can focus on exactly those things he really likes. You don't want to be bothered with taxes? You don't want to manually upgrade every ship everytime you research something new? Just automize it. (Although I recommend playing fully manual at least once. For me it's the best experience).What I probably like most about this game is that it feels really realistic. The separation of the factions into state and private sectors really feels like you only command your empire, but still having citizens with their own minds and wishes who do what they feel is best for them. So when you tax too hard your population might consider emigration into another empire. Another aspect which make this game feel lifelike is the amount of logistics required to make your fleets work. Each ship needs fuel and fuel runs out pretty fast. You need a dense network of refueling and repair stations to keep your warfare running. Or else your mighty military will be overwhelmed by the smaller, but better organized fleets of your neighbors. All in all Distant world does many things right and only few things wrong. And if you're a fan of 4x games or just space games and you don't care about investing some time to learn a game there is no way around this game.			"

												I'm going to start this off with the obligatory, this game isn't for everyone.  But for me, this game is the ultimate 4x space sim.  Many people complain about the price of the game, that it's just too high.  I sympathize, I would be very upset if that prevented my from owning/playing the game.  The reality is, this game has tons of content and accomodates tons of play styles.  I've put in nearly 500 hours and still feel like there's a bunch of things that I still have to experience.My main draw to the game is its scope.  The size of the universe (at the largest setting) is simply astonishing.  This is the only space sim (next to elite dangerous) that really captures the immense size of the universe.  This has essentially ruined Galactic Civilizations for me.  I played GalCiv2 to death but have found GalCivIII very hard to get into now that I've been spoiled by DWU.  DWU is a simulation first, game second.  Much like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis IV, you can just let the computer AI manage your empire's decisions.  DWU has an incredible amount of options regarding what aspects of the empire you want to control so it's up to you to decide.  I find that starting as a prewarp empire is essential when getting into the game initially.  It reduces the early game scope to what most players are familiar with: exploration, finding critical resources and developing some crucial early technologies that allow you to expand and defend your empire.The visual presentation is very utilitarian.  The menus are probably the weakest visual element, but some other aspects of the game are gorgeous.  I think the late game galaxy view is a sight to behold.  So many moving parts bring an incredible amout of life to the game, something you don't get in GalCivIII or any of game I've played for that matter.The ship graphics can be modded, but it's a relatively basic 2d representation. Managing large battles can be challenging when ships overlap, but I have not had to many problems in that regard.  I still prefer the 2d presentation which allows for the massive scale over the more limited 3d turn based views of GalCivIII.  The game also allows you to play as a pirate faction which can be a very fun experience, it's more intimate.  You also have the ability to custom build/upgrade your own ships.  You can have the AI do this, but that takes a huge strategical element out of the game.  I'm finding that I like to micro manage this process more and more.This game is one of those rare games that will age (and has aged) very well.  The game mechanics are solid and the simulation is just stellar.  By focusing on those core elements and not so much on the visual side, we have a product that is in a category of it's own.  I understand that some people won't get over the price premium and put way more emphasis on the visual side of things, but I think they are missing the point of what this game ultimately achieves.  For them I recommend GalCivIII (which I enjoy playing), but I will be turning to DWU to scratch my Space 4X itches most of the time.  Highly recommended. "

												I am a longtime 4X genre fan, but I'm getting very frustrated with this game. I really wanted to like this game and I bought it based on the large number of positive reviews. It has a lot of the things a liked about games such as MOO and Galactic Civilizations. But the learning curve for using the interface is just ridiculous!The interface is counter-intuitive in so many places. What would you expect to happen if you select 1st Fleet and then click on a target to attack? About 90% of the time, the brave and mighty ships of the 1st Fleet will do nothing. Those rare few times that they actually attack are almost a shock. Sure you can turn off automation of ""Fleet Formations"", but that's not guaranteed to improve things either. Playing with automation disabled (even just 'mostly' disabled) can be a nightmare itself, with ships just sitting around doing nothing at all. After a few hours of play, I still can't figure out how to send my fully loaded troop transport to recapture an undefended mining base that pirates boarded. Really? Wouldn't you expect to just select the troop transport, and select the mining base as a target and *bam*, job done? Want to choose the best target for a remote mining base? Some scout just found a swampy moon with some kind of age-defying pears growing on it. Great, sign me up! Let's see, I'll click the ""Expansion Planning"" button... now show me my pears! Hello? WTF is the pear swamp? GRRRR!!!!Most of my complaints are related to issuing orders to ships/fleets. Some parts of the game do seem to work as expected. You can automate your spies, for example, and then just override individual spies when you want to send someone on an espionage mission. That's an example of something that IS intuitive. Sadly, it is the exception to the rule.Now I'm sure there will be longtime fans of this game who will vote down my review for love of the game. They probably invested many many hours of play to find the workarounds for the problems (features?) that I describe here. But do YOU want to buy a not-so-cheap game and not be able to play it until you put the time in to learn how to fight the user-interface?Others have commented that the graphics are not great. Personally, I think the graphics are fine. If I can love Galciv, well... this game is several steps ahead. It's a little annoying that ships crowd around starbases and make it hard to select the starbase itself. Also, the text is hard to read in places on 1920x1200. But I find the battle sequences quite satisfying.I still want to love this game, but the game makes itself hard to love.			"

												I can’t believe I haven’t played this game earlier. DWU is an enormous 4x strategy game set in space. On first sight, it can look overwhelming… but thanks to the developers, you can set almost everything into “AI controlled”. This is great, because if you just want to see a living universe in front of your eyes, you basically set all to “automated” and just see everything fold in front of your eyes. Other people preffer to micromanage every aspect of their Empire… and the game allows them to do it too! Personally, I am in a middle ground, I like to micromanage, but I do not want to micromanage all the details of this game. One simple example, early in the game I manually send my explorers to the neighboring systems to see what is out there… but once I have a solid base around me, I just don’t care anymore and I set them to “Ai controlled”… the AI can manage very well the task of jumping from system to system all the time. There are dozens of features in the game that I like and I think that are very well implemented, but I think that one to mention is the simple “ship designer”: You can basically design whatever you want in there adding components to your ship (that you research on the tech tree obviously). You do not like the basic Frigate design? No problem, just edit it, add more torpedoes and lasers… and then retrofit it to your entire fleet!! Awesome!I highly recommend this game to all the people that love strategy games in space, you will surely not regret it!			"

It can be different every time you start a new game.  Ship design for me is the most interesting, especially knowing when to upgrade and what possibilities I have within the game itself to customize my fleet.If there is anything I'm not a fan of, it is the late game as it really does bring my computer down to a crawl sometimes.2 thumbs up from me....9 out of 10 "

												tl;dr: functionality does not match the high price (worth $25 US imo); many features are complex, mysterious and frustrating; too much AIMy apologies, this is going to be a long review because DW:U is a complicated game.Pros A ton of features and complexity A ton of automation If you like 4x gaming, you could get a lot of hours out of the game (bang for the buck) Vast galaxy size and many races Many things can be moddedCons The AI will often override your settings and actions. For example:   - in settings, say you set minimum number of troops on a planet to 4   - in settings, you set minimum population for troops to 1 million inhabitants   - let's say you have 20ish planets and many have huge populations (greater than 1.5 billion)   - let's say you are at peace and your economy is growing. Cash on hand is 300k (top number...upper right), cash flow is 5k (middle number...upper right) and bonus income is 30k (bottom number...upper right)You will scroll through your planets and see that many do not have 4 troops. The reason is because the AI believes you do not have the cash flow to support 4 troops per planet. The AI also believes that lower populations do not warrant 4 troops. So....even though you set 4 troops for planets with any population...the AI decides otherwise.You could even manually place recruit orders for 4 troops on all the planets. You will later review those planets and discover that the AI cancelled those recruit orders or got rid of the troops.A typical game would let you live with the consequences of your settings. Not so in this game. If there is an income level involved in deciding to build troops then that income level should be a setting. It is not, you must live with it and the enemy will often capture your planets because you have no troops defending them. TONS OF FRUSTRATION (and not fun) None of the hidden rules are published and there are a ton of them. Every time I have weird or frustrating behavior, I need to go to the forum. Often, people state how they ""think"" it works. To bypass the AI frustrations you would need to go 100% manual. I've found AI quirks in nearly every aspect of the game. Due to the complexity of the game, a fully manual game will take hundreds of hours to complete and is not a realistic option IMO. Even on manual, you will still need to work around some quirks (e.g. removing low fuel ships before issuing a move command for a fleet). The developers do not seem to be active in the community The game starts to feel like cat herding and trying to trick the AI into doing what you want. Often, the solution is the go completely manual. A completely manual game will take forever to play (at least hundreds of hours)For example: A fleet will fly at 1/3 speed if any ship is overly damaged or is low on fuel. They will also consume more fuel at lower speeds over long distances, compouding the problem. So...every time...before sending a 50 ship fleet to a destination you need to review the status of ships in the fleet, remove ships that will slow down the fleet and then automate or scrap the ships you just removed. Some user interface features are cool but other common tasks can require many clicks Very small community (dead game) Overly complex user interface (e.g. some right click options are only available at certain zoom levels) "

												A couple of years ago I found this game by pure chance.  After many years of playing almost every Space 4X I was desperate to find something better and luckily I found it ... Distant Worlds is best in class and it's since become my most played game.  It's a huge relief to see it on Steam because it's ready for Prime Time.A couple of key things to keep in mind before you purchase:1. This is a massive game and it will take some patience to get over the initial learning curve.  You can choose what to automate and what to control, so start with manual control in one or two of your favourite areas only (e.g. for me it was research and fleets) and build from there.2. Once over the learning curve hump, if you like this type of game, you'll probably be hooked.  In time you will find more layers of the onion to peel away.  My game strategies were still evolving 100's of hours later.3. It's a real time game but you can pause to make it feel somewhat like a turn based game and to help keep your massive empires under control.  As a result don't be put off by real time if you prefer turn based games.4. The graphics are average. If this is your primary driver this probably isn't your game.  But if you want plenty of massive battles you'll get them.5. There is a massive array of setup options and as a result the game has significant longevity.6. The Universe release has greatly expanded mod capability.  I don't play with many mods but Distant Worlds has some good ones.7. The Developer has a long track record of providing support and patches.  This game will continue to improve ...If this sounds like your type of game then I recommend it highly.			"

												A lot of the other reviews for this product, whether for or against, are quite spot-on, in both their assessment of the game's strengths, and its weaknesses.  The game's scale is almost unimaginable (700 Star Systems in a Medium game?  How many planets is that?  Thousands?) the rich game play, the ugly graphics, the variety (what, 30 playable races plus custom options?), the obtuse economic model (I have well over a hundred hours in this game, and still haven't really figured it out).I love it, but it is definitely NOT for everyone.The one thing I want to touch on is something that other reviews fail to mention, or only mention briefly: micromanagement and automation. The flexibility you have for setting how many decisions you get to / have to make is just over the top.  I have never seen another game with anywhere near the fine control over such things.You absolutely CAN turn off most (or all, if you are crazy) of the automated decision making processes, and handle everything yourself.  Good luck with that.The opposite extreme is also true.  You can turn everything over to the AI, and turn it into a giant Galactic Civilization Simulator. This would be a lot more fun if the graphics were better.I typically play somewhere in-between. I turn most of the tedious planet management stuff over to the AI, and keep tech, treaties, and colonization all to me.  By mid to late game, I usually have most of my fleets automated, doing defensive missions like swatting pirates and the like, with one or two Aggressor fleets under my direct command.Someone (I forget exactly who) suggested taking that to a new level.  Pick a nice, aggressive race.  Build up your early empire, and then turn everything over to the AI.  Production, Tech, Diplomacy, the whole nine yards.  Take a fleet, and become the Admiral.  Chase pirates.  When your Empire goes to war, punish her enemies.  The ability to speed up game speed during those times when nothing interesting is happening really makes this a viable game play option.I guess, in my final conclusion, what I like the most about this game is its re-playability.  Not just in starting a new game with different settings, but in actually HOW you play the game.  Not many games offer you that choice.			"

												Edit 27/5/14 - I should say that I have invested hundreds of hours in this prior to the steam release.4X fan? Buy it. I dont say that lightly. Whatever your preference in 4X I genuinely believe you can get something out of this game. Its Customisation enables you to play exactly how you choose to with your preferred level of involvement.Love having the feeling of being a genuine ruler but hate being harassed with all the day to day problems? Buy it.Want to be a part of a large empire, but only flying the flagship you named, designed, and picked the captain for? Buy it.Example: In my games, I dont like dealing with the taxes, ship design (I choose the overall design strategy) and aggressive espionage( I prefer my agents to defend the empire from threats unless in war). I do like choosing and finding the colonies to expand to, the research thats carried out and controlling the aggressive fleets (I have many defensive ships and fleets defending and escorting ships in my empire that I dont deal with. I prefer my advisors to suggest the best course of action which I can then approve. I also keep an eye on whats happening in the scrolling message bar to make sure its all runnning as I please.My point is this game gives you the ability to do that and a lot more. This game, instead of trying to cut features and simplify everything as most modern games do takes the approach that it can be quite indepth and complicated to manage everything but we give you the option to what degree you want to involve yourself.The first time you play it will feel overwhelming. Fortunately, they now have tutorials. I would humbly suggest you give them a spin.The options and settings have a drastic effect on how the game is played. You can alter all aspects of empire policy upon starting. I would have a look on first starting the game. Dont worry they are pretty self explanatory. Over time you will find what you like and dont like and the policies are saveable so quick to apply to new games.This game has improved from the base game thro all the expansions to today, Steam launch, with improved graphics and features. Its not cheap, but its also not a modern £40+ trying to make a cash grab from preorders with an unfinished product that dies a death shortly after release. This game knows its value.I hope you find this helpful and I hope you find the amount of enjoyment and immersion I have from this game.Edit 28/5/14 - I should point out that the game does have an issue with the font size in places. I do struggle with this at times, bearing in mind my eyesight is not the best, but I just put up with it as the game is enjoyable enough for me to overlook it.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 29/5/14 - Patch notes from the current beta: (rclick game properties in steam , beta tab, opt in to beta)- Reviewed all in-game font scaling and anti-aliasing and reworked font support to take newer Windows operating system scaling into account. Font size and clarity should now be more consistent across all systems.- Enlarged and clarified fonts: Diplomacy screen, scrolling message list, tutorial screen, cash and income display ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 20/6/14 - Part of the patch notes:Distant Worlds: Universe is now updated to 1.9.5.3.USER INTERFACE- enabled scaling of Empire Navigation Tool at screen left - use new size button next to close button in each panel to cycle 3 sizes: normal, large, extra large----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Big improvements in readability, good to see.Kherny.

												Distant Worlds seems real cool, at first; but then, after a while, you realize that the AI is not playing by the same rules as you.  Not by a long shot.The AI will often field a gigantic space fleet, even if they still only have their homeworld because they're too incompetent to colonize another planet.  You have to pay maintenance, which limits the size of your fleet; apparently, the AI does not.Let's say you start as a pre-warp empire, and all your AI opponents do, too.  After you discover warp drive and explore the galaxy a bit, you'll find that some of your opponents just sit on their homeworlds forever and don't expand, while others expand impossibly fast and will have 10 times or more the colonies you do.  The first couple games, you think that they expand so much faster than you because you are new to the game and don't know what you're doing.  The next couple games, when you understand how the game works better, and they still expand absurdly faster than you, you realize that it's not you, it's the AI cheating.  A lot.After a while of playing this, I began to get the impression that the AI empires are there just to harrass and annoy the player, rather than actually try to win.  For example, you might have this space empire of around 10 colonies; then the AI empire next to you that consists of only it's homeworld decides to embargo your homeworld.  They send their impossibly huge fleet to surround your homeworld.  How could they think they could get away with this?  You're 10 times bigger than they are.  Well, their fleet is almost as big, or maybe even bigger, than yours, because they cheat horribly; but why don't they just declare war on you, then?  This action doesn't help them in any way; you get the impression they have no motivation except to annoy those they don't like.Once war starts, the AI will throw fleets at you.  Over and over and over.  And will invade the same planet again and again and again, which is nigh impossible to stop, even with a huge fleet guarding the planet.  Really, the AI worlds are just spawn points for hordes of ships which they throw at you; even though they will build mining stations, I suspect they don't even have to worry about resources like you do.  It might seem like a crazy comparison, but after a while, I began to feel like I was playing Gauntlet (the old coin op, as in ""green elf needs food, badly"") instead of a 4X strategy game.Look, I've been playing 4X games for years.  I realize that making a decent AI for these types of games is an immense challenge.  However, the AI in this game is so bad, and cheats so blatantly, they're really just not very fun opponents.  Considering that there's no multiplayer, it renders the entire game a pointless waste of time. "

												While there are many games now set in space this is really the only one that makes me actually feel like I am exploring a universe.  It is simply the best 4X I've ever played and its depth puts most other games to shame. Start in a tiny corner of a 1400 star universe, get humiliated by space pirates, slowly map out your little corner of space, secure a few strategic resources and planets, build up your technology slowly, design your ideal fleet in minute detail,make first contact with aliens, send some of your secret agents to steal their secrets and finally you are ready to start building a real space empire. One thing, you should not play the game on fully automated mode until you know what is going on with it. This is the best way to confuse yourself. Automated mode is great when you want to cut down on micromanagement late in the game, it is not a substitute for actually learning how to play. Best way to learn how to play is to start in a pre-warp universe and just take it slow. Put everything on manual at first with the computer making suggestions of what to do. At the beginning you will only have one planet and a few ships to worry about, it is not too overwhelming. Pay off the pirates when they come as your military is probably not strong enough to fight them, you'll get revenge later. Set your tax rate as low as possible to make your planet grow faster, occasionally raising it back when you need money. "

												I  gave 80 hours to Distant Worlds:Universe. A lot, lot of that time was used learning how the game works. What automation to use, which not, How to look for resources. Mechanics, etc. This can be a very good thing in a game. Crusader Kings 2 is a great example of it.Distant Worlds, however, becomes too much. I'm not motivated to play. When I think about giving DW:U another try I'm immediately annoyed. The game could have been great, but there are too many things to keep track of. Automation can cover a lot for you in the game, but there are too many things I found I needed to handle on my own. This game requires you to pause, take a moment to clear your mind, and then focus on what your plan is. You have to really think, or maybe a better way to describe it was to run through a list in your head of things to check. 5 minutes later recheck. Again and again. Also after I returned to a save game a day or what have you later I'd forget a lot of that plan. DW:U began to feel like work instead of play.			"

												VERY Complex, with a steep learning curve but great depth.  Each facet of the game can almost be its own mini-game, taking hours to unravel.  If you like figuring out game systems, and getting your interstellar empire to hum like a fine-tuned machine, this game is a must-buy.  I had more fun playing it than any gave I've played since the original Galactic Civilizations.That said, it's dense.  The AI works very well in some regards, but is pretty dense in other regards.  I found ship design to be maddening, as it's got great features but I never could figure out how to get my ships to upgrade without consistently being converted to some other very generic design (I want Plasma Torpedoes, not Missiles!!).It's a beautiful and amazing puzzle for those who love to solve puzzles.  For those who don't, run screaming in the other direction!			"

												This is the game that I wanted Stellaris to be.The interface is a bit ugly (but also quite nice in places; the battles are really fun to watch), but it gets the job done very well. Almost every aspect of the game is more complex than Stellaris, but for me, that's a good thing. You can ease your way into the game by handing almost everything over to the excellent AI, which can manage your Empire for you pretty well. Speaking of which, the enemy AI doesn't cheat, and it shows. It all feels very realistic. Pirates will extort money from you while they can, but♥♥♥♥♥♥off when you get stronger. (Then, you'll have them attack your enemies for you in covert missions.) I could go on and on. I haven't had this feeling of there being so much more depth than I can possibly cover in a long time. So, overall, after about 20 hours, I think this is a must buy on sale (those are quite frequent) for everyone who loves complexity and 4x games. I wish I had tried this sooner.Edit: I just noticed that the manual -  over 100 pages! - is linked up on the store page. If you want to get an idea of how the game is played and how the UI feels, check pages 37++. Quite the old school, exhaustive manual, I like that!			"

												Its been a bit since I played this game. I did enjoy it for what it is. It has some neat features (characters, civilian ships), but once you get over the intimidating interface, and learn how to play, the game was simple and I grew bored.  I did not find it as complex and deep as many claim. Just like any game like it, you wont just jump right in. You will have to learn how to play first, but once you figure it out I found it not much different then many of the games already available, and with its dated graphics and high price its not something I would rush to buy. I would recommend this game on a good sale. Full price it too much in my opinion. 50% off is not a bad deal if you really like these sort of games, it is worth it at that price.Edit: Had the 4x itch lately and been playing DWU a bit. This game does a good job of making the galaxy feel more alive then most 4x games, but is very weak on diplomacy and ship designing. Biggest reason I do not recommend is the needless high price with nothing too innovative to justify. Pick up on sale.			"

												Distant Worlds: Universe (DWU) is one of those games not everyone will enjoy for the relative complexity and depth of its mechanics and gameplay, made more difficult to comprehend with a strange looking, but highly functional, UI. If you have been looking for a game where you will be:1. MANAGING a massive empire spanning hundreds of stars, and thousands of planets; 2. COMMANDING thousands of fleets, billions of soldiers, and trillions of citizens; 3. FIGHTING against dozens of different interstellar empires, invading hundreds of different pre-FTL empires, and defending yourself against (similar to) Mass Effect's Reapers; 4. CONTROLLING your ship and station constructions down to what components will they be made from, where they will be built from, whilst managing dozens of different materials which will be used to create these components and constructs;5. All the above supported by a relatively deep research tree (much, much more with mods), with dozens of different weapons, shields, armor, FTL drives, and other several types of components this game has;6. All this played using a clunky, but very informative, UI; 7. With a very 2.5D and pixelated ship/station designs (which can simply be upgraded with an HD mod);THEN THIS WILL MOST PROBABLY BE YOUR GAME.Just look at my playtime and you can probably assume that I'm having a lot of fun with this game. That said, mods are highly recommend after your first or second playthrough because they add so much more and they extend your gameplay much, much longer. These mods add things such as:1. Dozens of new components2. Dozens of new races3. Dozens of new ship designs4. Dozens of new technologies to research5. Dozens of new materials to harvest and manage6. Smarter AI, much more difficult than the vanilla AISo yeah. If you liked all the above and you're fine learning using Youtube tutorials, reading, scrolling through dozens of websites just to learn how to play the game enough for you to figure out other things by yourself, then you should buy this game. You shouldn't buy this game if you don't have a lot of time to learn the mechanics, or you have no patience to visit dozens of websites just to figure something out, or you don't like looking at forums to figure out some hidden, un-explained mechanics, or you don't like 2D sprites, or you hate clunky UI and have no wish to penetrate it to feel the gameplay behind it.Decide for yourself :DP.S. If you're interested in buying this game, but you're afraid that you might not find a decent tutorial on the internet, then I highly recommend the very tutorial which taught me to play this game from 100% automation (AKA watching the game play itself) to 0% automation (AKA I'm the Emperor and I rule almost everything I am able to control). This excellent tutorial made me love this game a hundredfold, and I have to thank the one who wrote it.

												Right.... where to start? Well, this is the best 4x since Masters of Orion 2. For a lot of people that's a good enough review, but there's probably someone who wants details, and I can dish those out. I have a (shameful) five hundred or so hours sunk into this game before it came to Steam (and thank god it did, seriously. Or Bhudda. Allah. Whoever. Thank 'em all.)I can't really say enough good things about this game. The major flaws all went away when it came to Steam and now hopefully we can all enjoy something amazing at a sane, reasonable price that doesn't require the equivalent of an ancient magical ritual just to buy. No longer will you need to fight the Matrix website and its dyslexic captcha generator for hours on end. The age of galactic empires has come to the masses.Speaking of mass, the game itself is MASSIVE. Seriously. You can not understand how big this game is. It is TITANIC. HUGE. The galaxy maps rival the original xbox as the most massive work forged by the hand of man. On the largest maps you can expect hours of play before you even find another empire. That's not to say you will be bored, because pirates will be coming in thick and fast. These aren't your garden or average variety pirates either, they are all evil, space based empires themselves, with completely different play styles to the planet bound civilisations. You can play as the pirates as well and yeah, you basically get a totally different game.  Research (The tech tree is also HUGE and I have never reached the end of all the three parts of it), expand onto different worlds (or conquer them), make alliances, salvage ancient wrecks, uncover secrets from the dawn of civilisation and look forward to the first time you fly into a new system and spot an odd looking moon. Not gonna spoil it, but you will shout out one particular line from Star Wars when you look closer. The galaxy teems with stuff to do or see or loot or explode before it lays eggs in your head.There's a massive galaxy editor that is ... well, if it was any easier or simpler to use it would also have a button that would make it feed you cake irl. I haven't dipped into the new enhanced modding functions in Universe though, so I guess you should take this bit with a grain of salt. Maybe someone with more experience will chip in, but I can't imagine them saying it's hard to use to do complex stuff in game.You can design your own ships and bases, and this is where there's a bit of annoyance. Hopefully I can come back later and edit this out, but if you make civilian mining stations with armor and weapons, the game loves to overwrite them with unarmed, unarmoured ones whenever you get a new tech and it tells itself to update all the avilable ship designs. Other than that, you can make your own designs very easily, though I would like it if there was a bit more information about what the different components do. It tells you, but not clearly.There's an overarching story built into each game you play as well, which aside from Alpha Centauri makes this a unique game. It can be turned on or off or individual parts can be toggled, and in the end it isn't a super massive thing, but it is fantastic for shaking up the endgame completely. In most 4x games by endgame you are set in and there's nothing to do since you won a long time ago and are just rolling towards the big flashing 'A WINNER IS YOU' screen. Not so if you have the Return of the Shakturi storyline enabled. Endgame is basically hardmode+.			"

												Ok, so this is my first review i have ever written and I've played alot of games especially in the 4x genre, but this game compelled me to do so...First off when I fired up the game all excited it seemed overwhelming at first with all the menus in the interface.  I soon realized that most everything was automated and it played more of a choose your own adventure approach which kind of turned me off...  Then I digged deeper and found that you could turn off all these automated options and control every aspect of your empire...All I can say is WOW!!  This game has trivialized every 4x game I have ever played.  I am currently in the GCIII early access and that is a great game, but compared to this it is boring.  Ill probably only play GCIII when I'm too inebriated to play distant worlds.  I see some crying about the price saying this isn't a AAA game, well thank god for that, because unlike AAA game titles this is actually a good game with unlimited hours of replayability and mods galore, and if that's not worth sixty bucks well I don't know what to tell you.  Bottom line: flat out best 4x game i have ever played.  If you are a fan of this genre and don't own this game it is the biggest mistake you have made in your life as a strategy gamer.4x Games currently owned: (some not on steam older gamer with hard copies.)CIV 1-5GCiv 1-3Endless Space Endless LegendsFallen EnchatressCiv Beyond EarthDominions 4Age of wonders IIIWorlds of MagicHOMM III-VIHearts of Iron I-IICrusader KIngs IIEropa Uneversialis IV "

You get what you pay for!Let me start by stating that Distant Worlds is, at the time of writing, THE BEST 4X GAME THAT MONEY CAN BUY!Whilst new to Steam with the release of the latest expansion (Universe) Distant Worlds has been available elsewhere for good while and has received several large expansions during its life. (All of which had to be purchased seperatley prior to this full release on Steam).Compared to the cost of buying all the expansions seperatley direct from Matrix, the steam price for the Universe bundle is actually cheap by comparison. (Although pricey compared to most 4x Titles, you get what you pay for!)Do You Like to Watch?Before I talk about the scope of this game, keep in mind that the number of automation options you can set up from the start menu are almost limitless. You can automate almost anything.Don't like designing your own ships? just automate it and the AI will handle that aspect for you. Don't want to fiddle around with the false smiles and bribes that pass for deplomacy, then don't. Automate it and the AI will start paying off the other Empires for you.Hell you could automate the whole game if you wanted and just sit back and watch it unfold like a TV Space Opera.Deep, So DeepAll the standard 4x bits and pieces are there.Research - There's a huge tech tree to unlock, resulting in new planetary facilities to build, better components to install to your ship hulls, larger ship hulls to fit all your new tech inside, various orbital facilities etc.Resources - There are ALOT of different resources in this game. Each planet, moon, asteroid, gas cloud is a potential source of ""stuff"" you're going to need. At first you're civilian sector is going to be buying alot of the resources in to build the components you'll need for your ships and station, but before long, you'll have a fleet of civilian ships (all AI controlled) flying around mining asteroids for minerals and mining Gas Giants for the much needed fuel you're going to need to expand further. Economy - Unlike most other 4x games, Distant Worlds has a fully featured Civilian economy which works independently to you. You can influence it with your actions but you can't control it directly. You can design civilian ships, freighters, passenger shuttles etc. and then the civilian economy will buy them from you and use them move goods around to complete the building contracts or colonly requirements within your empire. This happens automatically, and you can actually see every single civilian ship flying around, check it's cargo, see what it's carrying and where it's carrying to.Place a large military ship build order at a space port and watch all the little civilian ships scuttle around sourcing the resources for the project and ferrying them to the construction site.Of course the civilian ships can be easy prey for pirates, so you might want to protect them with a military escort. This can be automated too!These are just a few things, there is so much I could type about, Ground based combat, troop recruitment, Espionage, Characters (Ship captains, fleet admirals, generals etc) , minor races that can develop into full space fairing empires if left unchecked. Story events, re-name-able ships, characters  etc. (Want to rename all your spies after the characters in resevoir dogs, you can! Mr Black, Mr Pink etc.)Beauty is only skin deepDon't let the graphics put you off, whilst far from good looking, the graphics are functional, different ship hulls are fairly easy to distinguish between and the planets and moons can be quite pretty in their own flat, 2D way.Deep and SteepThe scope and depth of this game is amazing. It always feels like you're playing in a ""real"" universe. Of course this depth comes with a learning curve which can be punishing at first.This is a game you're going to want to watch a lets play or two on before you take the plunge (or just automate everything and watch a while to get the jist of what the AI is doing).Just Buy It!I could spend all night writing about this game but i'm itching to get back to playing it again!I'm so pleased that Distant Worlds has finally made it's way over to Steam and will now get the audience it deserves.If you have any interest in 4x games, you need this. Simple as that.I really hope if you've read this far that you'll buy the game and more importantly that you'll enjoy it as much as I have over the years.Now if the developer could just make a prettier sequel......( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

												Best 4x space game since Masters of Orion II. There are tons and tons of micromanagement options, but by default it is all automated and you can slowly turn it to manual as you learn the mechanics. And the mechanics are deep, very deep.For instance, you mine celestial bodies for minerals and gases. Then you create components which can then be used to assemble ships. Very underrated game.			"

												Pros: Looks and sounds greatVery deep research system keeps things from getting staleThe galaxy feels aliveWatching events unfold naturally can be a lot of funCons:Actually playing the game becomes a tedious messHorrible menu systemHard to access necessary informationPathetic AI makes automation a death sentenceToo difficult to keep track all necessary game elements with out help from the AIDistant Worlds: Universe is a game I want to like so badly, but no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't over come the games horrible user interface, pacing issues, and horrible AI. As far as 4x space strategy games go, Distant Worlds has a surprising amount of depth. All of the components of everything you create require a specific type of recourse witch would create a nice challenge as you try to supply distant bases in an ever expanding empire, except that it is unnecessarily difficult to tell what any given base needs. The game provides no warning if, for example, one of your bases has run out of gas to fuel your ships' reactors until you recieve a warning of an alien attack only to realize the defense fleet you had at the station has no fuel and cant move. While this information can be looked up manually, it requires navigating a confusing, poorly ordered menu system, and browsing static menus for long periods of time just is not fun. The bad menus and lack of warning aren't an issue in the early game when your empire is small, but when your empire takes up a large chunk of the galaxy it can be neigh but impossibl to manage.Distant Worlds also takes place at a surprisingly fast pace, with three technology trees that are all recearched simultainiously. New technologies are researched fairly quickly, so you will often find your once mighty fleet quickly becoming obsolete. Between your Military Ships, Civilian Ships, and Stations, which can quickly add up to over thrity designs, can quickly become an overwhelming management crisis, which requires tedious menu browsing to solve. This would not be so bad if not for the games terrible AI. If left to its own devices, the AI that manages you ship upgrades, research, and fleet assignements will damn you with the first pirate base you discover. The AI will equip your ships with a single week beam weapon, or if you are lucky, a few missle pods, then hurl them en mass at an infinitely better equiped pirate base. All the while, it will be researching how to upgrade your ground troops while a human fleet is bombing you from space.I really wanted to like Distant Worlds, but I just couldn't overcome its design flaws. It is a shame, because underneath it all is a  the obvious potential for a really great game. The game looks good, sounds great, and has a level of depth and customization rarely seen in any game. The galaxy really comes alive once you have mad contact with a few neighboring empires, as civilian ships begin to establish trade routes and interact with your intersteallar neighbors, and it can be fun to just kick back and watch things unflod with out your intervention. Acually playing the game however, is a tedious slog down menu lane. If you are a hardcore 4x strategy fan, there may be something here you can salvage, but for anyone else the tedious menu system an terrible AI are just too much. "

												I cannot recommend this game without significant reservations.  For many people, this game may be ideal, but most people, even most 4X fans, will find it features too much micromanagement with a weak interface.Distant Worlds is a 4X space game in the mold of Master of Orion and similar games.  It simulates building a space empire including setting up trade, mining asteroids, designing and building your own ships, diplomacy, exploration, and such.  That's a lot of tasks and all of them, to some degree, are interesting.  The problem is they all come at once.  Take mining.  You can mine nearly every planet, moon, and asteroid belt in the game.  This is important because mining provides valuable resources.  A large system may have over a dozen mining points in it.  That's fine and all, but that's a lot of mining potential and you receive an alert every time your mining station is attacked.  By what I would consider mid-game, once I've more or less completed my initial expansion and now press up against other empires, I have scores of mining stations.  Mining as a whole is important, but any single mining station isn't particularly valuable.  Thankfully, the AI automation is very good at setting up new mining systems so you don't need to manually send out your mining units.  However, the alert system is not so nuanced.  I receive alerts for every attack on every mining station.  Little information is provided on these reports and they come in fast and furious.  I can't tell from an alert whether this is a single pirate destroyer skirmishing on the frontier or the initial attack of an alien armada aimed at my home system.  If you click on an alert you should be sent to the area in question, but the game doesn't change the zoom level.  Watching an attack on a single mining station isn't particularly useful at the galaxy zoom level.  Consider that I am getting a ton of these alerts every minute of the game and the alert system becomes unworkable.  The same can be said about nearly every other system in the game: good AI for automation (probably the best I've ever seen in a 4X game), but poor human interface.  Of course once you get used to the AI, which will intelligently colonize planets, choose tech goals, and automate other high-level tasks (and can be turned off or overridden if you want to perform those tasks yourself), you will become frustrated by what the AI doesn't do.Why the AI can intelligently choose a planet for a colony but wouldn't build planet infrastructure or critical star ports is beyond me.  Probably some of my complaints could be salved through setting up AI priorities and adjusting other settings in the game, but I'll be damned if I can find the right screens to do that.  The interface is just complex and obtuse.If you are interested in an innovative space 4x with great AI automation then maybe you should give this game a try.  I can't recommend it straight out because it can be really frustrating to work with.  Maybe you will enjoy it, but be warned. "

												A summary in one sentence for this game is; Trade Graphics for the best, deepest, 4X, strategy game that has ever been made. This game has a great amount of depth that you might miss the first few hours of playing the game, I will highlight many below. The price might seem high; just note that this actually a base game with some expansions, and the gameplay makes it worth the face value.The primary features of this game that all the others in the genre don't have is every aspect of 4X actually has a major appearance in this game.Exploit: Every body has some sort of resource that can be exploited in the galatic market, contruction, or consumption by your population. The are many critical resources that are difficult to find that can be controlled for many strategic options. The resources are divided into the groups Strategic(critical materials used in contruction and as fuel sources), Luxury(These are consumables for the populace), and others(various materials that are used for specific technologies). Population speicies have different characteristics that benefit your empire as a whole/You start as one, but you can assimilate other races you come accross. Different goverments change the way your empire will interact with others(and the specific races in your empire) there are many different ways you can use this. If pirates are enabled you can use them to do your dirty work for you. Intelligence System: implemented completely in a text/image form you can get many useful things things done ei: Intelligence can report when an empire is making plans with other empires or pirates and you can choose to use the information to change the course of conflicts. Research is divided in three categories, the time it takes to complete research depends on the amount of resources put to it. There are stations and components for each of them individually(These components are boosted by research sites throughout the galaxy). Get a technological edge to get ahead of the other empires. There's definantly more...Expand:When you start a game with custom setting you can have a galaxy with hundreds upon hundreds of stars. Along with other manipulations making resources and quality planets rare or common. As you get more resources and planets your automated civilian traders/transporters grow and manage trade and material/population movements. Every resource is accounted for in tons and they must be actually moved to a place where they are needed, many newly colonized planets will have a hard time getting started as the nessacary resources are shifted to the planet. Having a supportive population will spread word to nearby colony causing them to rebel and join you. Having planets with non supportive populations can cause them to join another fraction or become an independant. There are likely to be independant planets in the galaxy; taking control will be extremely efficient. And more...Explore:Galaxies depending on the settings can be huge. Expansion depends upon exploring stars searching for anything useful like; Ruins(grants you a random amount of money or information), Damaged ships left in space(helpful in the early game), High Quality Colonizable planets, MIning Sites(For either minerals or gases many of the host bodies are not colonizable and you will need to build and protect mining stations), Research Sites(Provides a percent bonus to research taking place there). There are a lot of resource/planet type combinations to find your going to need the most productive locations. Plus more...Exterminate:Military size is ""basically"" dependant on your state income in order to pay for everything in it. The size of the battles is primarily dependant on the size of the galaxy as the increased amount of resources equals a lot more income. Space combat is made up of ships where you pick the components you have availible to you and build those designs. The weapon systems choosen will be your method of destroying the enemy. This goes from anti-ship weapons and nuclear bombardment of planets. Planets can also have ground troops and defences, if you intend to not exterminate the population you will have to invade with your own forces to take control. Ground forces are much simpler to use since they are all preset units. Certain races do not live well together therefore they are not desirable. When dealing with your own population you can choose to assimilate, ban from coming to this planet, allow them to live freely, or exterminate them. Exterminating has an impact on everything involving that race. There is still more...Entirely Unique features:Private vs State Operations - Many of the annoying tasks relating to your population/resources found in other games are mostly automated. I mentioned earlier that the transporting of people, resources, and trading are done by the population itself. This includes them ordering there own ships(that they pay for), giving all the orders, and making sure the resources are correctly divided across your empire. They are also responsible for getting addition contruction resources to the sight as well. The AI will try maintain all of this based on the resources of your empires private sector. There money is entirely seperate from yours other than what you tax them. Simply trading valuable resources internally or externally will turn a profit for the private sector. I find the AI prioritizes things relating to your operations the best it can based on numerous conditions within your empireUniversal Automation- You get a choice of what aspects of rts gameplay you want to manage. If you don't like maintaining exploration. The AI can do it all for you(including contructing the ships needed). If you don't like locating and contructing mining stations(and other Stations) The AI can also do that for you.  The same goes for research/diplomacy/Planetary Management/Planetary Defence/even all military operations. An in game menu allows you at any to time to pick what you like doing and have the AI do what you don't want to do.(Additional menus allow you to set certain priorities/goals for the automated aspects).Amazing Economy Simulation - All the empires/fractions in the galaxy take part in a galatic wide market and internal markets. There are a lot of resources in the game and every single one of them has a changing value within trade based on supply and demand. This make economical strategies possible. You can take advantage of the availibility of major resources to starve planets or entire empires. Preventing them from functioning normally. Or you can use a resource you have to force other empires to become reliant on you for them. When I say internal markets this is for trade between your own planets. you will not always have or need external trade options so your population will buy and sell resources availible within your empire. You will have to play yourself to see how detailed and realistic this simulation is...Final summary:Finding a strategy game that proclaims itself as being a 4X game with a great involvement with all of the X's is hard to come by. This game is that empty hole. All of the features that i mentioned(and the ones i didn't) have effects accross the board. They are all linked in a various number of ways opening up some many options when deciding your course of action.Gameplay wise this is the best strategy game out there. Now we only need this a sequel with full 3-D environments.(I have somewhere around 100+ hours outside of steam. Probably more.)			"

												TL:DR; THIS GAME IS NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED! DO NOT BUY BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW!!!Possibly the most overpriced space RTS on steam. Hardly a 4X, kinda worse than Endless Space, not anywhere near the MoO2/MoO3 games.After 170h+ of gameplay I believe I am capable of giving an honest accounting of this game.And it is quite a mess. But before I explain why, let us clear basics first.Sound: 4/10- Terrible music. We surely need more dance/rock/techno for a strategic game, where we need to pause, think and plan in advance.- All those woooshes and beeps. Intefrace has limited amount of sounds, reuses the same alert sounds for different events which can be confusing as hell.- Ship sounds are sub-par. Apparently cheap sounds used from over internet.- No vocalizes to speak of. Never.- Sounds lags and distorts many times. - Ambient noise from starports and while constructing ships. Imagine looking at your homeworld and having to listen to pneumatic drill for a 15 minutes. FFS, I am pretty sure they would use plasma cutters/welders for construction in space!Graphics:7/10+ Minimalistic graphics, exactly what you need for a large scale strategy.+ You can mod in your own ships (hello, S.P.A.Z. carriers!)- Very limited planet graphics. Ugly. There seem to be mod that fixes that- Game visibly suffers in default settings from too many ships on the map. This problem (solution described at the end) is caused by fighters, each and every one of them processed the same way as other ships. Meaning a fleet of 10 carriers with 100 fighters each will take as much processing power as 1000 destroyers.- The above mentioned issue is so pronounced, it makes large-scale battles virtually impossible to watch.- Possibly the worst interface of 4X games released in the last decade. - - - Why do I need to have 3 buttons doing the same, but have no list of key shortcuts anywhere inside the game? Why cannot I rebind them in menus? - - - Why not give me resolution setting, so I could actually choose, how about that?- - - Why the few pixel gaps between buttons and status window, so that I could hit that space and loose selection of my choosen ship/planet?- - - Why cram the logs above, why not let me rewind it without entering message history? - - - Why no real message settings, so I could block the annoying popup windows?- - - Why no central control screen for AI settings with all those automation sliders so that I could actually FUKKEN DECIDE ON THE POLICY FUKKEN AUTOMATED AI IS EXECUTING?!?!?- - - Agent succes/failure displays american jet fighter pilot picture, SERIOUSLY?!- - - No mass 'Retire' button for a fleet. Have to search for every ship in ship browser, luckily we can sort by fleet name.- - - Default character/ship sorting is by some ID that is not visible. You can't restore it if you click any other header. Modding:Game was supposed to be supper modable. This is a lie - you can only fine tune several aspects of it, graphics, sound, some research/race setting. You cannot touch the core gameplay, for example galaxy generation method, to create different galaxies. You cannnot mod ship settings, so to create a civilian ship that never runs from combat (very lore-friendly, according to some racial descriptions). There is some huge mod out there that adds dozens of races and techs but seeing the game as cripled as it is today I really wasn't feeling like trying it.Gameplay: 3/10I will break this down in few different categories. It is a must, because the game suffers from certain choices that along with huge stability issues make this title 25€ at the very best, certainly not 50€. Let me write this here only to repeat later with a solution to this, GAME CRASHES OFTEN, WIPING OUT YOUR PROGRESS!1. eXploreRegardless of what positive reviews of this title said, single player kinda sucks.So. Even if you decide to start a pre-warp empire in a brand new galaxy, you cannot research warp technology. Instead you are given an ability to do so, after you are visited few times from a civilisations already having it (!). These are independent (!) planets, not an empires(!) possesing advanced technology(!). You cannot interact with them in any other way than colonizing/invading. Why is such a thing in the game? Because you require resources to build stuff and you cannot get them in the beginning, therefore independent trading vessels will conveniently supply you with them.I shook my head in disbelief for this solution.Now, once you do start building things you will soon realize that:- construction and colony ships can only be build on planets, not shipyards. - the planet building capacities cannot be improved except with a single wonder.- this was deliberate solution to forcibly slow down player progress. So you build a couple of recon vessels. Little do you know that you cannot group them in a fleet (nope!). They have to go alone. They will be attacked by every single pirate/space monster they meet. So perhaps you want to arm your recon vessels so they could defend themselves? Sure, but if you do, every time such a vessel enters a system controlled by other race, your diplomatic relations will deteriorate due to ""military ships violating territory"". Unbelivable.The same goes for civilian ships that you cannot control. Arm your passenger transport agains pirates only to see it blown to pieces by a race more powerfull than yours as a ""lesson"" with few million passengers on board! Oh and by the way if the race has greater military rating than you they will blow up every single of your civilian ship armed with a weapon they see as a ""military ship violating territory"" even if you transport ultra rare spice to their homeworld! FFS whos idea was that??2.eXpandPossibly the worst aspect of the game is how you expand your territory and build up your empire.To begin with, you have no control of your civilian fleet transporting goods from one place to the other. You can and should manually design them, as vanila designs are just too slow/too weak/have too little cargo.But wait, worse things are to come. In order to balance gameplay, the game features very expensive colonisation research (more about ""research"" later) and you can only build your colony ships planet side, which takes like forever. No, you cannot build industrial buildings on the planet to construct things faster, there is only one, singular wonder that allows you to do that.There is more. Some genius decided to add a certain parameter, ""quality"" to the planet. This defines how big population can get on a planet and below certain population levels planet brings no income, only expenses. Doesn't sound bad yet? Let me explain: you cannot terraform planet into higher quality. Terraform facility only serves to repair battle damage to the maximum quality planet had, does not increase it over time. But why would you want low quality planet in the first place? Imagine there is legendary building (one of a kind) or an ultra rare resource (the only source in the galaxy) on a planet with quality 2%. This planet population won't go above 20M and will always generate -3,6k loss.And what if this is the only habitable planet in a 2 sector radius and in a mineral rich system of 15 planets and 30 moons in total? More bad things. Due to some weird bugs construction ships will forget the quequed tasks (I think that happens when they are attacked, pretty sure it does when they are destroyed). Fancy ordering of building mining stations few times in the above sectors of 15 planets and 30 moons? Continued in comment section.			"

												+/+ Each of the 4x components (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) are present, robust, and fun.+/+ Very complex and detailed game mechanics.+/+ AI automation is really well done and helps scale micromanagement to my/your current mood.+/+ Separation of private & public sector creates many unique and interesting gameplay challenges.+/+ Excellent economic system.  Game rests on the back of a powerful economic simulator.+/+ DSU is extremely customizable.  You can modify many things when starting a new game such as: technology rate, pirate prevalence & strength, aggressiveness, story aspects, etc.  This is a very small list; it really is robust.+/+ Great game variety such as multiple timelines, races, & the option to play as pirates.+/+ Story included (can be disabled).+/+ Ingame 'Galactopedia' included.+/+ Many victory options (including race specific goals).+/+ The developers regularly communicate with fans & are very responsive with updates/patches! +/+ Mods (Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar, Babylon 5, and more).+/- Plays in real-time with pausing for ‘turns.’+/- Colonial management is minimal.  Cuts down on micromanagement.+/- Graphics (not very important for 4x strategy IMO).+/- Very steep learning curve - in part due to complexity & in part due to poor UI decisions.-/- The UI, while perfectly playable, is ugly, redundant, and could use various improvements/ be streamlined.  This is clearly the games biggest weakness and will be a deal breaker for some.-/- No multiplayer options.Verdict: 10/10.  Distant Worlds – Universe is currently the best 4x strategy game on the market.  It feels similar to a paradox style grand strategy game, but has its own vibe and mechanics.  The games main fault is the user interface.  If you can get past the learning curve and the user interface, you’ll have hundreds of hours of entertainment ahead of you.  The game really is robust, complex, and absolutely brilliant!			"

												For me far the best 4x strategy game out there. Higly recommend.From endless complexity to semi or full automation, enjoyable for each fan of galaxy exploraion / conquest type of games indeed. Pay special attention to the title even for it´s relatively higher price, cause it can offer hours and hours of great game experience.Pros:- huge complexity, which can be limited right to your fit through task automation and opposite- player decions are reflected to actual gameplay- race families concept through diplomacy (humans can hardly get friends with reptilians :)- well customisable game scenarios to play, proper difficulty levels- extensive game wiki, tutorialCons:*- a lot of info and options, needs bit of patience in the beginning*- natural resource classification could be improved, sometimes confusing- bit old fashion graphics- trully poor soundtrack- english translation only - no surprise once you see all the content "

												Critically underrated. It's a shame that it received any poor reviews.While the game is a bit hefty on the price end, currently $60, $30 if you catch it on a sale, you DO get every DLC for free. It's worth either price, I wouldn't mind spending the full $60 on this, for it has proved its worth.Distant Worlds is an incredibly open-ended space 4x strategy sandbox game. You can manage huge aspects of your empire, down to ship design, attitude toward migrants/foreign alien races, pirates, economy, etc. The generated maps are huge, and one thing about this game that really makes me drool is the seamless transition between galaxy to sector to star system to planet, as well as the lack of direct paths connecting systems that restrict travel; in other words, you can travel literally anywhere on the map, not just concrete points on a straight line between systems. If you want to have a space battle in middle-of-nowhere-deep-space, you can. Anyways, managing a space empire is not easy when you command nearly everything. Such responsibility requires a rather intense learning experience, satisfied by reading a guide or two, maybe watching a youtube series. Once you get the hang of the game (I recommend setting nearly every aspect of your empire to manual control, where the magic is) you can start to open up many other avenues of gameplay. The mod support for Distant Worlds is fantastic, albeit quite contained. The small community, however, seems dedicated. 10/10			"

But once you get past that...  the amount of customization and decision making depth is really fantastic.  If you're not put off by the graphics, there is an enormous amount of info available on the screen and in the menus.Highly recommend to anyone that loves exploration, conquest, and intrigue on a galactic scale.

Posted: April 29, 2015
												A short simple review on why the game is worth the money:My reasons for recommending this game: Automation; Some reviews state the steep learning curve and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI. Nonsense, this game can be fully automatized and you can watch it run itself ! This in itself presents you the opportunity to learn this game. Each game you play (I would, as a starter advise a smaller galaxy) you can put different parts of your empire on automation and learn other parts until you grasp the entire game. On top of that the automation is actually good and competent enough to do diplomacy and war. The only minor annoying thing is the management of invasion and troop transports. Sometimes the AI takes a really long time to put together a proper fleet to attack a planet and take it over with an invasion. From experience I can say this should be improved as the AI tends to put single troop transports in every fleet or strike force. The AI should first and foremost create a proper invasion fleet and then it can assign troop transports wherever. Civilian Economy Excellent design due to you, as a player, not being able to influence it directly. The civilian economy is semi-independent and takes care of all trade and resource transport across your empire. If you mismanage your civilian economy by bad military escort or having to few resources of one type, you are in trouble since you cannot influence it directly. The civilian economy needs time to build up from disasters and from the start of the game. Your job as a player is to provide them with enough planets, asteroids and last but not least security  so that they can do their job of transporting resources. You might think this semi-independent economy is irritating, but its not it add a layer of strategic depth that is most satisfying to play with. Race policy You can be a genocidal maniac or the benevolent empire that is there to save all. The only slightly irritating thing is the fact that you can only select  FAMILY of the race, not specific races. correction: You can only set policies for your own family and all other races, which I find arbitrary and a bad design option. What does this mean you say ? There are a lot and I mean a lot of races (not counting mods) and these races are divided by family. You have insectoids, humanoids, reptiles, etc. These are my main reasons for that this game is far better than any other 4x space game out there.			"

Posted: December 21, 2014
												I really wanted to like this game.  Having played Sword of the Stars just before this, I was very much looking forward to not micro-managing things due to the automation.  The problem is that the automation doesn't work well.The automatically created ships designs include will include a troop compartment on everything that is destroyer class or bigger.  Never mind that there is dedicated troop transport and troops are useless in space battles, I suspect this is because the AI controlled empires wouldn't be able to conquer planet otherwise, as the fleets the automation creates don't make a lot of sense.  In one game I got a strike force (4 ships) with four cruiser in it, and fleet (15 ships) with no crusiers or carriers in it.  Troop transports will get mixed into both strike forces and fleets.  Nevermind that for an invasion to be most successful the troop transports need to massed and attack the planet at the same time, and it is necessary to move the troop transports to a planet enmasse, wait for them to get positioned, and then attack.  Otherwise some of the troops won't participate in the invasion.The automation for the civillian ships can't be turned off and it breaks down hard if you build to many star ports.  The automatic queueing for building mines also can't be turned off, so to avoid having mines built on poor quality resources and/or in locations you don't want to defend, its necessary turn off automation on all of your construction ships.  That means you have to micromanage them, including somtimes telling them to refuel.  Definitely not what I was lookin for.And fricking fuel.  The automated designs don't include nearly enough fuel storage, which is just one of many reasons you'll need to manually design your ships.  Ships can also get completed and be empty on fuel and have to limp slowly somewhere else to get fueled up.  This happens because the civillian ships aren't transporting enough fuel to your star port(s).  The same can happen for other resources and caused the building of your ships and bases to stall for extended periods.When ships are completed their shields typically aren't charged and they only charge up at the regular and slow rate (relatively very slow later in the game).  You can mitigate this by ordering your the components of your ships in specific way so that shields will actually charge while remainder of the ship components are being built.  However, achieving this order requires creating most of the design when better refactor, fuel cell, or shield components come available.  This is because the when a new component is added it always added at the bottom of the list, and those items need to at the top for the shields to charge.  So its not just micro-management but just tedium in the user interface as well.Didn't find the planetary facility automtion useful at all.  It frequently wanted to build wonders on worlds were they would be very slow to build, and also build regular facilities to early in a colonies lifetime given the value of the colony vs. the cost of maintaining the facility.Loading and saving is also quite slow with the top performing SSD currently on the market.  Given the save files aren't all that big, it seems likely its software algorithm issue rather than a throughput issue.			"

												I loved that game from the first click. It is as deep as universe though quite easy to undestand. For me it was kinda Victoria2 in Space but with much more possibilities and customization. Almost everything is polished and user friendly, And its nice that there is no best way or policy to win. The game is quite expensive but its full and you dont pay heap of 100 dlcs another 100 bucks. I hope to see sequel from the devs with a little better graph,  sound, multiplayer and even much compexity without that popular f### wide market orientation. Best buy in the genre for me!			"

												Having played this game for about 200 hours before coming to Steam, I can say, without any doubt, that this is the king of science fiction 4X games. If you like Europa Universalis, Master of Orion, Stars!, Galactic Civilizations, Stardrive, Civilization or any other 4X game and are looking for the ""next one"", look no further. It takes some getting used to. It does have a learning curve. However, once you've figured it out, there's nothing else like it. 10/10 would pay $100+ again for it. It's a steal at $49.79. If you count the amount of time I've played this and divide it by the money spent, I spent less than $1 per hour of enjoyment. That's a better way to spend your money than any other that I can think of.			"

												This is a great game. First one i've found that honestly lets me just do my own thing if i want, thanks to the Ai taking over everything else. I really like how i can decide what the AI controls and what I control. It's like having a partner who already knows how to play the game and is assiting you as you go.But thats not all, the interactions between races isn't always, ""You must die!"" there is a lot of between. Most of the 4x i've played tend to be very hard to ""make friends"". My first game, i had the pirates on my side for most of it. (not done with that game yet, just thought i'd put my review out there).The only hang up i can see about this game, is the cost. it's a pretty penny, but one well spent if you ask me. To be honest,  this costs less then some ""Alpha"" games lately (won't name, names), and this game is finished. Some folks might have a hang up about the graphics, but please don't let that stop you. Honestly, graphics isn't all that big of a deal, as game play is (of course i wouldn't go back to text only for those of you who remember those types of games). This game has depth, replayability, and so much to learn! I'll be enjoying many hours yet to come playing this game :) "

												Wanted to like the game.  Spent a lot of time reading trying to learn how to properly play it.  Long-time 4x player.The game is very detailed oriented and has great depth.....but the AI is too clunky to let it run portions of your game, and the game is too detailed to run it manually.Some game concepts are not well thought out.  The early game endless pirate raids quickly go from a challenge to just entirely annoying.  Not certain why rebuilding a mining base for the 11th time is ""fun"".Where you start is a game-changer - more than other strategy games.   A lot of getting an hour or so into a map only to realize you are significantly disadvantaged.  Spent a lot of time restarting/regenerating map hoping I wasn't missing a critical resource nearby.I like a challenging game and I like spending the time to learn a very detailed game.  This one just turned out to be more annoying a frustrating than challenging and fun.			"

												I bought this game because of the gushing reviews, but I have come to the conclusion that it has a core niche following very familiar with this type of game-play, and for those, this is probably the best game ever.For the rest of us - this game lacks any playable tutorials or easing into mechanism. The tutorials will simply guide you through the menu interfaces. I tried to like it - I watched youtube tutorials and a 2.5 hour playthrough on twitch. I have also spent about 5 hours playing it, and the result is still a game that either I watch the automation system having a good time playing the game. Or I take control of some small aspect (as the guides suggest) but feel that I have not really affected the outcome of the game as 100 big things got automated in the time it took me to do 1 small thing. Boring.  Until this game gets tutorials where bits of the game are introduced while being able to have fun learning, I can't recommend this game. "

												Distant Words is not a new game actually, it initially launched on 2010. But it is still one of the best 4X space game on the market. If you like 4X space game, then you shouldn't miss it. In the past 4 years, DW has been poished by 3 awesome expansion packs, it gets better and better. Now DW: Universe has landed at steam eventually, and this is the 4th state of Super Saiyan ! This is the ULTIMATE edition of DW !			"

												Been playing this game for years but now it is here on Steam! Don't let this lost gem get away!Definately the best  real-time 4X space empire building game I have ever played.It's pretty complexed to get into, but don't let that scare you...  once you invest the time to learn you will be lost for hundreds of hours playing this game.  So many hours I have enjoyed building my fledgeling empires and I keep doing it over and over again after each time I win or lose.... there is also so much modding capabilities. I've even made my first mod with this game because it is a breeze even for a noob like me.  Anyways,  I'm off to play the game again... Have fun!			"

												So as a big fan of these sorts of games, I decided to give this game a try while Slitherine was running their big sale (this is in early march, '17).  The UI looked clunky, but the ideas seemed promising.  After downloading the game, however, I discovered that it was built in a rather antequainted and obsolete technology (XNA), which Microsoft killed off several years ago.  It requires a variety of old libraries and redists, as well as Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer, none of which were on my modern Windows 10 Pro machine (except for Edge).  After spending about 1.5 hoours doing IT trouble shooting and still not having it work (after installing all of its pre-requisites) I was forced to conclude that the game was too outdated to be worth troubling with further.  From the write ups and screen shots, it's clear this is a very old title.  The idea that they are still considering $60 as the list price for the game seems ridiculous.  I bought the game for $20, which seems like it probably would have been a reasonable list price for the title, had the game actually worked.Caveat Emptor.  If you have an older machine setup (3+ years old), this game will probably not give you any trouble.  Be sure to wait for a hefty sale, and maybe it'll be worth the trouble ;).  Otherwise, I'd suggest trying something else.			"

												Distant Worlds is a 4X unlike any other, and is unmatched in its variety, gameplay and complexity. Don't let the complexity scare you though. Thanks to intelligent automation, Distant Worlds can be as simple or as complex as you want. Only want to deal with one ship or a fleet? Fine, automate everything except a ship and explore like it was a spaceship game. Only want to deal with ship building? Fine, you can set that to manual and everything else to automated. Want to have advisers suggest certain courses of action, but leave the details to the AI? You can do that too! The galaxies in Distant Worlds are teeming with life, and there's always something out there to discover. Thanks to an amazing amount of races (even more with modding) and an exceptional amount of game setup options -- including an in-game editor to make changes on the fly -- no two games will ever be alike. If you're looking for a 4X game that makes you feel like an emperor rather than a micromanager, or if you want, a ship builder rather than an emperor or, if you want, and admiral rather than a ship builder, then Distant Worlds is for you. I've played nearly every 4X there is, and this is my all-time favorite.			"

												People who are saying this game is better than MOO 2 are delusional. Really the game is unfinished in my opinion. You have all this AI to do things for you but it's so incompetent that you have to do everything yourself anyways and end up in a nightmare of micro management. If you don't your empire will be brought to it's knees by pirates, your colony ships will colonize planets you have no hope of defending, your construction ships will build bases you can't defend... your military will attack over and over targets that are stronger than them and get smashed. You wil have to micro manage a fleet with a bunch of troops to keep destroying the pirate bases taht pop up on your colonies. You must redesign all your ships as you gain technology and you have to have like 15 different designs (bases, merchant ships, military etc) and you'll have to redesign every ship every 30 mins or so in the early game, or even less. When you design ships, you will have 1 huge list of everything you can put on the ship, and another huge list of everything that's on the ship. No separate sections for weapons, shields, untilities like in MOO. Your ship will have certain things you MUST put on it (you have no option) but you still have to scroll through the list to add it.. pointless. Then you add lifesupport, you have no need to ever put more lifesupport than the minimum for your ship size but guess what? You have to add and remove it yourself.  You can research tractor beams which have the ability to push and pull enemy ships but you can't set your ships engagement range so you will always run towards them if they are weak, and run away if they are strong, until you're dead, ran away or fighting point blank (so you may as well have short range guns every time, the other weapons are pointless).Finally, the game relies on so much chance it's ridiculous. Like you can find certain super weapons and  you will in about 1/3 of your games, and if you do, the game is basically won, easy mode = on. If you don't, you struggle onward. I started out like I do in all 4x games and tried refining my starting strategy until I realized.. the game is just so unpolished, I'm wasting my time trying to learn a game the developers didn't even bother to finish. Ship design is so annoying and would be so simple to make painless (even automatically make reasonable ships) but you're left with frustrations, and your ship pilots are idiots, they make no use different advantages you could design into your ships, so just put on lots of short range guns, and shields and ta-da... do that every 30 min ad nauseum.I see no point in trying to get good at a game that the developers didn't bother to finish before trying to sell it.If they want to improve the game:-make the GUI for ship design less painful-remove the mandatory aspects of ship design (life support? habitation modules... that you need the same # as life suppoort on every ship and it's a separate item so we have more crap to do? ship computer? even reactors... could be done pretty good automatically, plz)-make the AI make reasonable ships so I don't have to do everything myself (I have max tech in lasers and you have 1/2 my weapons the missiles I started out with at the beginning of the game? wtf?-stop the AI from putting up a ton of things you have to defend to spread you so thin you get pirated to death.-have USEFUL information about your mining stations like how much of each resource you are buying each month / year rather than mining, how much are you selling, etc etc. I really want a new 4X space game but this is just not it. I'll hope the new Galactic Civilizations will be playable.-actually look at the weapons your giving me for my research... like there's 2 tractor beams, both cost the same, one is ""long range"" the other isn't... but the short range one is better than the long range one at every single range! Are you kidding me? Are you GD kidding? Finish the game before you sell it!			"

												The most complete 4X space game I've ever played.It's ugly (although it can be modded to look better), it's interface is a mess and it just seems like it was programmed a decade ago. Also, difficult as it gets, especially with those pirates,., but it's quite the game.Tons of customisation, even to start a new game you can pick tens of options and build a galaxy with 1000 stars, each could have planets, that could have moons, not to mention asteroids and space monsters and space pirates. Just imagine the size of the thing.You can pick your ships modules, advance your race's science, build space stations for research or mining or even defence. You can build colony ships and send them off to a recently discovered planet or build warships and just conquer a inhabited one instead. When you meet new races or pirates you have diplomatic options to use with them. Remember to watch your money, finances are also in the game as are resources that you need to build your stuff, you can mine them or buy them from elsewhere. Ships have evolving drive technology and even limited range (fuel!). Heck, this even has space tourism!If you think all of this is too much, well, you can automate it, every aspect. I don't know why you would, but you CAN!Multi-player would have been awesome in this but, alas, just single-player here.Just imagine, your race has just discovered FTL travel. You design a science/exploration ship. They finally leave your system and they discover something... and it could be bad.			"

												Decent game when it works. Seems to slow to a crawl in the later stages. Loads and saves take along time as well.If you manage your own fleets you have to continually order the ships to refuel, which wouldn't be so bad if you could stack commands. I swear sometimes I'd order a fleet to refuel and by the the time I got back to them, they needed refueling again. It seemed every user controlled fleet needed continual attention. Not to mention there would be times when my fleet would get attacked and not attack back, unless they were given explicit orders to.Game interface could be better, I could not find a way to highlight the worlds I was at war with, basically had to click around the map to find them. And it was a big map. I'd rate the game 6/10, but would not recommend it to the average user.			"

												This is a the best Space 4X game you can play. Because unlike the glut of all the other 4X games out there. It is in this game that I truly feel like I am managing a living breathing empire. You can dictate just how much you wish to involve yourself in the management of your empire which is great for new players.Civilian ships will do their own thing and fill in the gaps in your empires demands. They handle the mundane tasks like transporting resources and population throughout the galaxy and mining. Even the population reacts to your tax policy on planets by migrating to the less taxed planets in your control... or they may even migrate to other factions planets because your taxes are too high. You can even control how your empire handles the migration of other races, even to extreme degrees like enslavement and extermination.The AI does its job when assigned to manage any role you set it too. I like to allow it to control my military fleets and let them go to work when I declare war.Those two things are nearly entirely absent in most 4X games or they are over simplified to the point they hardly matter. While the game makes it feel like you are running a living and breathing empire... its not without its faults.Your planets are static things and have no real dynamic meaning other than fulfilling your expansion. Yes you have building but they are mostly focused around defence or building troops. Forget improving them in any meaningful way or have them sate a specific role in your empire. Strangely in Distant Worlds, you have no terraforming feature or even the ability to improve a planets overall quality. There is a terraformer, but it only restores a planet back to its original quality and never higher.The economy in this game is just... ugh. For all the hours I have put into this game I still only have a vague idea of how it works. Get energy collection tech fast so your reactors don't burn energy in system. Make sure your civilian builds use a different fuel source than your military. Prioritize that your mining bases and ships have plenty of space to carry large amounts of cargo back home. Hopefully... your Empire will remain well stocked if you follow those guidelines!Combat is really where this game suffers for me and is why I usually just the AI handle it, because there is Zero depth to how your ships approach a fight. Unless your enemy actually has the tech to stop your ships from warping in right on top of them. It just comes down to who has the bigger boots in a shin kicking competition. So your ships warp in point blank and if the enemy wants to run it has to endure nearly ten seconds of being mobbed. So as long as you are efficient with your ships designs and have a large empire, you will eventually grind your opponents into the ground.TLDR; Good 4X game, combat is weak.			"

												I have played about 3 hours of this game so far. And unlike a lot of others who have already played it a while ago. I just bought it. Here is what i think.For one, it dosent look good, well, thats only half right. The UI is very cluncky. But half the time non of that really matters because, even though the game is in real time, the game dosnet ask you to make split second discisions. Its not like galciv where you need to learn every system to win the game.Granted I have played 3 hours, and restarted 4 times, mostly due to not playing the tutorials, and turning all the AI off, thinking that I want to do it all myself.And i havent actualy won a game, infact im not even close. So it could get very twitch near the end. Who knows.But from what i played, you only have to learn the systems you want to manage, and watch your civilazation grow. Its actualy pretty cool to see a bunch of trade ships start moving because you built a new colony, or a bunch of fighters swarm because a space worm showed up.This is like Galciv, but without the 10 min long turns, the AI frees you up to actualy manage your civilazition, do leader ship stuff instead of the micromanaging stuff that they can do.Or if you want you can turn it all off and do it all your self.

												This game came so close to being the best 4x game ever created, but they lacked possibly the most important feature that most games lack... an intelligent AI.  You have the power to micromanage every detail in a vast galactic empire which very quickly becomes tedious so you turn over certain parts of your reign to your artificial intelligence that proceeds to fly around in circles or protect the worst possible things to protect.  This problem is only compounded with your opponents because they too are working under a faulty artificial intelligence that doesn't know how to defend itself.  I am rating the game so highly because it really did come close, but I find the game unplayable so I cannot recommend it.7/10			"

												This was a very welcome surprise to see on Steam. I played this game a while back and I really really wanted to buy it, but I'm pretty much a Steam or GTFO guy these days because I like my collection in one place. Also their pricing was a bit crazy, and I know the price for this looks high, but wait for a sale or shop around if you must...but know the original with all the xpansions was an even bigger investment. This is a deal compared to that.Now as far as the game? This is the game for control freaks that just can't have enough data and control at their fingertips in a space 4x. It's a giant onion and you start peeling it to find more game. Some will cry tears of joy and others will just cry. I won't lie to you, it's a very heavy game to get into and for some people (like me) that's a very good thing, but if you are not the type to want to learn and fumble around for I dunno.. at least a few dozen hours before everything sinks in then I'd grab up Endless Space if you are looking for CiV in space or even Sins of A Solar Empire if you want something that's a bit more combat/RTS oriented. Or if you are looking for the substantial ""a lot more to it"" upgrade to that kind of game then dive on in, but I can't really use words to describe how much really goes on in this game at one time, yet still feels managble. It's a remarkable accomplishment as a game and has been vastly underknown for the past few years that it's been out.			"

												It's not complex the way Dwarf Fortress is complex. I play it totally un-automated. I think its initial full-automation and apparent complexity, though, masks a lot of its true failings. Its mechanics are needlessly obfuscated (I still can't tell you how a planet's profit is calculated or how size correlates with other factors to determine max population). For example, the game irrationally misleads you by presenting values as percentages when they're really just multipliers. An asteroid with 66% iron, 50% gold, and 40% iridium, huh? Yeah, that's just the relative rate at which you mine those substances (.66 iron per ""click"", .5 gold, .4 iridium, etc). The asteroid isn't literally composed of 156% heavy metals. That doesn't even make sense. There are also a lot of annoying things the developer put in when a more elegant solution would have been better. For example, there is a mining cap of 10 extraction points on all planets so it's pointless to add more than 4 extractors (for 3 extraction points each) onto your mining bases. This was done so that players couldn't get away with just having a few mega-mines in their empire, which are obviously easier to defend and have superior logistics. This as opposed to an elegant solution like a diminishing return on stacked extractors' mining rate. The diplomacy system is still horribly late 90's style bad where, instead of just telling you how much money they want from you, you have to play a guessing game by increasing/decreasing your offer (do any games do this anymore?!). Who doesn't enjoy clicking buttons until they find the right number? Then there's the unenforced peace treaties where you can either bribe or accept a bribe from someone and declare war immediately with laughable consequences (oh, I have a bad reputation now... well, I don't care, I'm annihilating everything anyway). Oh and then there are forms of government you can choose for your empire that have absolutely no merit. There is no situation where National Socialism is more useful than Monarchy. Don't get me started on how the Return of The Shakturi events allow the balance to be broken simply by discovering a precursor ship with level 7 technology in the first year of the game. Way to go, you have an invincible war machine. But if the AI gets it, they inexplicably won't finish the job of destroying you.			"

												So I just got this game and I'm completely hooked. It has a level of depth and complexity that I have not seen in another 4X game. A lot of other reviews that are critical of it say the same thing:- The game is too complex to micromanage- If you automate you don't do anythingWhat they fail to mention is that the game has a huge suite of automation options, including the ability to specify how the AI should behave in its automated tasks. Basically you can automate as much or as little as you want. This is a huge feature to me, as I'm not typically very good at fleet management or ship design, so I can focus instead on managing colonization, the economy, intelligence missions, and my empire's path through the technology tree. There is no need for an all or nothing approach to micromanagement and automation - there is always a happy in-between.On top of that the game has a variety of alien species with their own victory goals. There's a robust system supporting pirate factions, and allowing you to play as pirates with your own asymmetrical goals to profit and spread your criminal network, and do the dirty work of the different civilizations. This game has a lot going on, but is well-design enough and supported by the automation options that you can play at any level from micromanaging everything to playing at emperor and handling only the diplomatic decisions of the country. Most people will want something in between. Learning all the different systems can be difficult, but if you have patience and tackle them as you're ready while automating what you don't get yet, you can find your way.My only complaint is that the UI is ugly as sin and I have to squint a bit to read it, but neither of those have kept me from staying up all night playing the game.

												If you want a space empire sim that probably has one of the best economies and AI automation systems available then you should get this game.  Read ahead for pros and cons.Pros1.  Great AI for managing some of the more tedious aspects of your empire once you get very large, and with 1000+ star systems you will need this, especially with so many planets in each system.2.  A real dynamic economy!  You can actuallly starve other empires of fuel if you claim most of the fuel spots, which is difficult.  More easy is to own most rare luxuries through quick expansion and conquest.  Also, keep taxes low.  Your private economy will flourish, and you will get far more funds from their spending this way.3.  Some people dislike the UI, but I like it.  It is simple, and clean, and gives you all the info you need to properly manage a vast empire.Cons1.  In my opinion, the character system of the game should have been editted out... completely.  I think Galactic Civilization (GalCiv) does Diplomacy and Espionage MUCH better.  In this game, you have characters, which I hate.  They can give significant bonuses, or sometimes penalties.  The character system is by far the weakest point, imo, of this game!1a.  The worst part is espionage is done directly through character spies.  They can die on missions, and they can have a HUGE impact on the game.  It got to the point that I decided to just ingore that part of the game, and just automate it.  It is broken, and if you use it you may find yourself save scumming to get the best results.  Just automate it and make believe it isn't there.  I like GalCiv's method of spending a part of your economy towords a specific empire in espionage.  There is no managing of individual spies, no worries about them dying, and you don't have to worry about actually receiving them randomly.  It is a much much better system.1b.  A short note, you do get diplomats, and they can either significantly help or even hurt your diplomatic stance towards an empire.  Additionally, they can effect espionage between your two empires, either making it easier or more difficult for you to steal tech, and vice verse.  Again, I think this is a terrible system, especially that it also can effect espionage.  Again, GalCiv does this better by tying it into the economy spending.2.  Fleet Management:  The only thing this game needs to complete its fleet managment system, which really isn't too bad, is a system to quickly replace destroyed ships in a fleet.  If you have automated fleets, this isn't exactly a problem for a player, but I don't use that system.  I like to micro my fleets as I focus more on the combat portion of the game.  When a ship is destroyed, I have to either pick a shipyard/station or go into the general purchase screen and purchase more of those ships.  THEN I have to find them in the military management screen and add those ships to the fleet that lost them.  It would be far easier to just click on the fleet and press a button that says ""Replace Destroyed Ships"".  MANY space sims have this feature now, and I REALLY wish the devs would update the game with a system like that.  All the pieces are there, just add that little button... PLEASE!!!!3.  Fleet Movement:  I like the warp system ingame, but it could use more flavor.  Warp Gates and other systems of movement would be great.3a.  Also, when fleets warp then don't warp in formation.  When they warp to a location the warp in a stupid circle around it.  THIS GETS FLEETS KILLED!!!  It is a terrible system that I hope in the next game or an update will be rectified.4.  I will say that the price is steep for some people.  However, I think it is somewhat justified in the past, but now, with so much competition, they should probably lower the price to at least $40 USD.			"

												Ok. I was pretty excited for this game after watching videos about it and researching it before it became available on steam. After I purchased this I was still suprised at the sheer complexity and learning curve this game requires.I tried watching the AI and that didn't work, so I started a new game and tried to micro, learning by pain. It was slow and painful. But I did learn a few things. I had to turn AI back on on almost everything and it slowly became more enjoyable. I blew it on the economy though and lost my colony, losing the game. (my 3rd game)So for this initial review and first impressions I would say that it is a buy IF you want to dedicate yourself to learning this game in and out to be effective.  I am enjoying it, although the very first impression was a WTF moment.  This game could really use a streamline of the research trees (more detailed discriptions and easier to find que). Alot more streamlining of the UI would realy help a ton and make this into the gem that is obviously there after a few playthroughs. Its hard to remember which screen has this hidden thing to fix another hidden thing. ack.If you are buying this game dont be scared to experiment to find the ""fun"" setting that seems to work for you in regards to speed, era, etc. Every game seems unique after the initial starting phase.I recommend this game. I hope to update this after I learn more. Learning this game is a *hefty* investment.EDIT 1: Ok, I have played a few games. This game is huge, and requires alot of micro to get the full enjoyment out of it. Pros : Feels live, there is always something to do, time will pass quickly. You feel like an emperor or diety in this game in a way, depending on your micro. The races are cool, and there are lots of them! Like someone said before, its facinating like a giant ant farm. It is FUN.Cons: UI could use some combining/streamlining, Ships will sometimes bug out, and refuse to upgrade or move. (I had a full fleet that would not upgrade to hyperdrive, and was stuck at the planet for hours until I just ended the game). Resource management is a real pain. (why cant I see which planet I am prioritizing, and where it is easily? Why does AI shoot for a far away system when mining where I have no control unless I micro, and get itself killed anyways?)Ship design is a bit bleh.So there are my impressions. Honestly though this game is hard, and time consuming. But it is fun. for the price I am not sure it is a good buy. I just bought Galactic Civ II and played that alot. That is a much simpler game compared to this, by far. But for the price, Galactic Civ II is worth it( bout 8 hours played offline). I think this game is worth bout 40-45 bucks. But it is a really hard, (cause of resource management), dated, but in depth game. I do like it.Quick Tip: Turn down the pirates, and make them destroyable in settings. It slows the pace of people attacking you left and right and bribes, making it much easier to learn.			"

												As I write this the game is on sale.Don't let me Steam time fool you. I got this game from Matrix several years ago and between the orginal game and expansions must have poured 2000 hours in so far.With the currently  promising but underwhelming Stellaris and the kiddies game that seems to be Master of Orian remake this remains the number one 4X game.For me it's so important to have some element of tactical control over the battles. I micro manage the game and set my fellt order (engagement range, target priorities etc) before hand and do a little fiddling during large battles.Stellaris like GalCiv is just ""Watch the battle movie in friustration as the Ai does things with your fleet only an idiot would do!""This is the 4X game of the last 10 years. Stellaris might overtake it after a few patches and DLC (after all this game was no where near as good on release as it is now) but for now, after dabhling in Stellaris and finding it rather weak and simplistic - essp in combat - Distant Worlds wins hands down			"

												In my opinion this IS the game I have wanted for a very long time.Watch the videos if you are having a difficult time getting started.Try your best to stay away from automating activities. You will will enjoy the game more the more you do yourself.If you have a ship that you have a specific task for learn how to use the Editor to rename that ship appropriately. For instance I use a few Construction Ships to do nothing but build Defense Bases so i rename them ""Defense Builder One,... Two, etc.""This helps me keep track of what I have intended them to do.It will be years before this one will gets old for me.			"

												Possibly one of the most confusing games I've ever played but still fun if you take the time to understand the concepts.  Not an easy space empire builder.  The amount of automation is gigantic and not to be taken lightly.  Graphics are older but still awesome.  The veiw is 2 demensional.  Highly fun... just a little insane at first.			"

												This game came out in March 2010 for 30 bucks, but I couldn't register it on Matrix website, since I bought it on Gamer's Gate. I bought the 1st expansion from Matrix (only place available), got it to work once, got a new pc, they came out with a patch and 2 never worked together again (customer support was useless). Five years later this comes to Steam with all 3 expansions. This game is 5 years old and not worth the 60 dollar price tag, and it's only 32 bit. If you're lucky, you might actually complete a game before it gets really bogged down from all the ships in play. From what I've seen of Matrix, they would rather discontinue a game before dropping the price tag to something reasonable. All their games are over-price. So if you're waiting for a 50% off sale, it'll never happen, the most you might get is 10% off at the end of the year.This game is buggy. Just in my limited time of play, I've found so many bugs. I'll list a few that just irritated me.When setting up your empires policies. I like mine setup so that whenever a new planet is colonized, it immediately starts building a defensive base. However that's not always available from game to game. I've started 7 seven games so far (all with the exact same settings and race). Of those seven, only in 3 I had the option to build defensive bases when a planet is colonized. I think it was games, 1, 4, and 5. How does that make any sense?Games 2, 3, 4, had to be abandoned due to some weird glitch that caused my population growth to jump to 109%, maxing it out in seconds, then my cash and income showed infinity, my 1 and only planet would build every ship, regardless of how they were queued, except colony ships.Game 5, my automated explorers would explore a system, but when you clicked on a specific location, it wouldn't tell you how much of a % of that resource there was. So then you had to do it manually. Game abandoned.Game 6 had to be abandon because all the civilian ships (the ones you can't control) just sat at a starbase and wouldn't move. Since no resources were being delivered, nothing could be built. After messing around with it for 1/2 hour I gave up.Often times you give your ships orders and they just ignore them. For instance, I wanted a fleet to attack a pirate base that was close, gave the order and it just sat there ignoring the order. Or I order a constructor ship to refit/refuel, but they just ignore the order. Some of my constructor ships were like 10 levels behind on tech, but just refused to upgrade. I remember this problem from when I played this game 5 years ago.Sometimes there's the option to refuel a ship, other times there isn't.Sometimes you can build a certain base on a remote or colonized planet (with a constructor), other times you can't. Or it'll accept the order, but won't actually build it.And the list goes on and on.And there are some in game mechanics that I just can't stand or don't make sense to me.For instance, the bigger your empire, the more you have invested in research, the less you research. I read the reason for that was so the smaller empires had a chance of catching up in tech. Yes, lets just pointlessly build money sucking bases that do nothing.You get leaders (heroes or whatever you want to call them), and then the leaders get dismissed randomly due to incompetence. My empire leader in game 1 was dismissed, never got another. WTF! (actually completed game 1). Game 2 had 2 empire leaders from the start, only one of them had stats. Supposedly some of the buildings you build will attracted new leaders. I had a Science academy (they're supposed to increase the chance of getting a researcher) on 40 planets (game 1), but I had no research leaders thought out the game (the only 1 I had was dismissed early on). One of my fleet leaders was killed in battle, even though I lost no ships and none of them took any damage (except shields halfway). I noticed that for every leader that's dismissed, it also says there were killed.Looking at the research tree, for some of the items you have no clue why you would want to research them. Like energy collection, I have no idea what it does for you or why I even need it.For bases you can click on ""mercenary defense mission"". There's no explanation in the help for it. Clicking on it costs some money. But when the base gets attacked, it makes no difference. I've tried this before, during and after a raid from pirates. I have yet to figure out what it actually does.One of the expansions added different types of troops, frankly they could have just left that out and just stuck with one type of troop for all the difference it makes.I read that people who like this game just love the pre-warp option, frankly, that just makes the game even more boring then it already is, waiting for tech to get researched so you can actually get somewhere.The messages you get flash on by and there's no way to adjust message speed. You can look in to the message history, but it's useless since clicking on messages in there doesn't take you to the location and by the time you look in there, it's too late anyway.I do like some of the options they've added for the game, like setting a limit on how many sectors out you can colonize out. Also if you fully automate everything, then the game will play it self and you can go watch tv. Why did I buy this game again?Depending on your automation settings, either the game is fast to micromanagement from hell. With ship designs, it's either the game makes the designs, or you do, but not both. Just what I want to do, spend hours designing ships only to find out that I have to abandon the game due to some weird bug that was never fixed.Due to all the bugs that haven't been fixed, and unless they fixed a lot of the issues, the only thing it deserves so far is a negative.Currently on game 7, wonder if I'll actually be able to finish it.......

												I bought this on a whim and having been having a lot of fun learning the ins and outs.  You can go for uber-micro where you manage every little aspect of the game... from ship designs, to colony tax rates, to research, to ground troop deployment, to ship maneuvering, to fleet operations, to... well, you name it.  Alternatively, you can play the role of a lone ship captain, turn all management over to the AI, and just manage one... single... ship.  This way, you can get a feel for the game and see what kinds of decisions and operations the AI takes out so you don't feel totally overwhelmed.My first shot at controlling a minimal amount of ships went like this:- Set things up in the Age of Shadows, kept pirates weak, went for smaller sectors, played pre-warp Empire- Took command of the first exploration ship that got produced by the AI- Bee-lined it for a planet that contained ruins on it (signified by three dots next to the name in the map)- Uncovered the secrets of warp.  Changed up the research tree to concentrate on warp capabilities- By this time, the AI popped out a two-ship fleet containing a frigate and a destroyer.  I decided to switch the exploration ship to auto and then assumed command of the fleet- With this mini-fleet, I was able to fend off some pirate attacks.  Unfortunately, one of my mining stations fell and was taken control by the blasted pirates.- I destroyed the pirate controlled mining station which kicked out a data core that gave me coordinates to an abandoned ship in a nearby sector.- I visited that sector and uncovered a Capital ship that was adrift.  I could not believe my luck!  It had a huge warp inhibitor field to prevent enemies from running away, a large squadron of on-board fighters, tractor beams, and massive firepower.  I quickly added that to my fleet.- The AI sent out several exploration ships which lead to the discovery of the base of operations for a pirate gang.  I brought the Capital ship enabled fleet to the system and was able to wipe that base out.  - Their base in shambles, the pirates quickly thought better of the situation and handed the remnants of their fleet over to me.  Wow.  Is that cool or what???All of that occurred without much micro-managing.  The AI did the heavy lifting and I was able to engage in the fun of simply being a Fleet Commander.  Very cool stuff.  There is definitely a learning curve, but having a neckbeard is not a hard and fast requirement to enjoy this deep game.Highly recommended!			"

												Best and most refreshing space strategy I´ve played! Well worth it´s price tag! I´ve wanted to play this game for years, and finally it is on steam! Now, first this review will tell about my first game, then I will tell shortly about gameplay:FIRST GAME EXPERIENCE:I just played my first game with 1400 stars galaxy, starting with evil instectoid race. I pretty much grew quietly, while big factions like humans and others (dont remember names yet, first game) lived happily in their peace. First was the other insectoid (I thought them lizards) race, which I conquered except their homeworld, and ever since I have been having them subdued, as a slave race (yummy economic boost) and ignoring their constant pleas for freedom.Next was same species as me, with another hive mind. Having another as aggressive as me cannot be allowed, and I conquered them under week, since they were pretty much surrounded by my space once I had conquered lizard race. Hive mind is joined to mine pathetically fast.Third, blue skinned race with close relations to humans. I start war with them, and humans support them for few weeks, conquering few colonies from me, until humans are passive sheeps they are and just sign peace again with me, leaving their friend race to be conquered in next few years. Now blues skins are also subdued, enslaved race with only their homeworld left. *evil snickers*Fourth, becomes galactic chaos as I start my war with big human empire, which crumbles and divides to now 5 different factions, after their military have failed to defend themselves before my mighty insectoids, as I just raze their worlds instead of conquering them with troops.Now, I´ve almost finished conquering small fractions that are left of the old, once big human empire, while other races and fractured, new independent human empires just cover in fear, my reputation as race diabolical due to dozens of human worlds I razed. Few of the other races went through fracturing too as they watched me destroy their ally. Could be though it is not because of my actions, but yeah, I have pretty much won, as there is only small races, some fractured, humans especially so. Only one who could now stop me or at least prove a challenge are humans if they´d unite, since they have quite powerful weapons, but I dont see that happening, and other races are constantly sending me money probably to keep me away from them. Or if every race that despise me because of my brutality towards humans (they all do) would start all war with me, that could actually be end of me, since together I think they have small, but probably big enough upper hand in numbers. But no, they are too busy with wars between each other and fearing/hating me.GAMEPLAY:This game is very different from other 4x games. It is RTS, which can be stopped. You yourself don´t actually do anything else, except rule, which is pretty much accepting the ideas/suggestions what your empire should do that your army of advisors and generals send you. Wars happen like that your generals plan and do the dirty work, they suggest attacks/invasions/bombardings to locations X with fleet/strike force X. Same kind of system applies to new colonies/bases and new diplomatic moves and refitting your ships and colonies with new technologies, ship building orders too. It is as if you are actually, really some kind of supreme commander sitting at some cozy and mighty throne room, looking at map as your empire grows. You can actually zoom in and see the civilians do their work, live their lives, go from a to b either to mine or transport goods or migrants or whatever.This game is not about micromanagement, this game is about RULING. Things like assigning civilians/miners/transporters/traders anything like that is BENEATH you, so it happens automatically! which I think is so deliciously realistic, it feels like you are actually governing empire full of people! I just love it... Sorry, I think I´m getting repetitive, but I fear that some people don´t understand why so many things are automated, so I try to explain it as best I can.I should mention that some of these things automation/adviced can be turned off, so if you want you can assign your build orders, fleet formation, diplomatic actions, strategic fleet movements and attacks, everything except for civilian actions (mining, transportation etc) yourself. You can say ""shut up"" to your advisors, but I think it´s not humanly possible to micromanage it all, especially towards the endgame.*** 28.5. EDIT: As I play further and learn more, I´ve discovered that the amount of settings how much and specifically you can make your advisors do things independently, recommend you or shut up about certain things is IMMENSIVE. At ""Empire Policies"" you can customize so many things, automation on really specific things, and how your advisors do certain things, after which amount of population you build new installation/base to your colony or it´s orbit, etc etc.So, this deep game is even deeper! ***...TL;DR? HERE:Enslaved two races, forced one to join me, caused galactical era of chaos, war and infighting not to mention countless deaths in process. Divided and conquered a galaxy. No micromanagement, just pure ruling and grand decision making.BUY IT.			"

												Pros:HUGE games with up to 1400 star systems, each with a star, planets, moons, asteriods, all moving about in orbits. You'll easily get hundreds to thousands of military ships, just in your empire alone.Unique private sector builds and manages all their ships and moves resources and people around. It's fun to watch all the traffic around your bustling spaceports.Automation options allow you to manage everything yourself or turn on complete computer control over everything.You can turn automation on and off at any time during a game for anything, from tax policies for your entire empire down to individual ships.Ship and base design is totally freeform. Place as many weapons, reactors, thrusters, manuvering jets, as you want on any of your military ships or bases. This isn't like some other 4x games where ship design means filling in a few blanks on an already designed ship class, here you decide everything about how the ship performs.Cons:The game engine is somewhat bad. The gameplay runs well enough on my old computer even in a big galaxy. Amazingly well considering all the ships and planets moving around both on the screen and in the galaxy at large. But the game itself loads slowly, and loading savegames is also a little slow. There can be a noticable delay when bringing up UI screens and popups. There's also the occasional exception popup that allows you to maybe continue the game. I've also had one crash where I had to load an older autosave to continue.But it's not so bad that it isn't playable, and if past expansion packs for this game are any indication then all the crash bugs should be fixed in updates.This game is singleplayer only.Bottom line:This is absolutely worth the price RIGHT NOW if you're a fan of 4x games.Tips!If you have extra money and your population isn't at the planetary max, cutting taxes to zero or as close as possible can be an excellent investment for the future, since lower taxes increase population growth, which leads to more future taxes.Conversely, if you are at planetary maximum population then move taxes to 50% or as close to it as you possibly can.Intellegence agents can be extremely powerful sources of research if they have the skills and you can find an empire with weak counter intellegence.

												Like others, I have had this game for a couple years now and have to put it as one of the top 4X games I've ever played. There is one key thing that keeps drawing me back: the way this game actually makes you feel like the ruler of a space empire. You can micro-manage all you want at the beginning, but as you expand you will shift towards delegating most tasks to the AI while retaining the ability to tweak things or get hands on as you see fit. There is a ton flexibility here, as you can set the AI to do nothing, to do things automatically (with tons of options regarding what you want them to do), or to ask your permission before doing anything drastic. It's really cool to play out this transition from moving indivdual ships around at the beginning, to only handling your warfleets later on. This applies to other aspects like research, espionage, diplomacy, production and so on.The other unique element is how you can watch your space empire's economy grow in real time. Soon after the game starts you will see a few civilian ships coasting around your planet, before long they will start building mines and transporting goods around. Before long there will be dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of civilian freighters cruising up and down space lanes connecting to your worlds and beyond. What's more, there's aren't just abstract representations of activity, each individual ship has a name, mission, fuel level, cargo, and purpose. If you order a new space station to be built, the resources aren't just magically transported there, they must be transported there by actual ships, which get the resources from specific worlds, which got the resources from the relevant mine/production facility. So if you want to build something in a distant star system and haven't researched FTL travel, don't expect it to get finished anytime soon.This also ties into the great sense of scale. At first, just going around your home star system takes a long time. If you use the Age of Shadows start (highly recommended), you only have conventional engines very little options for ships. I won't spoil anything but eventually you will research faster travel, which makes travel between local planets pretty fast, but travel outside your home system is still quite slow. Range is also a factor for most ships at this point. Eventually your ships get much faster, but the galaxy is still a very, very big place. Ordering an exploration ship to investigate some signal on the other side of the map means you won't be able to use it for anything else for the next 15-30 minutes it takes to go there and back. This of course becomes very important when you launch a war. Logistical planning using staging grounds and secure rendezvous for refueling/resupply can make all the difference.			"

												Easily the best 4x space game available.  Here's a case where graphics don't supersede gameplay.   Gameplay is extremely complex and deep or can be partially or fully automated to reduce complexity.   AI is decent and the number of ways to play the game are many.   So many other games focus on graphics and dumbing down gameplay to appeal to the masses, not this game it's a gem from days past.   The scale is massive, games can last a couple hours to a couple weeks if you wish.   The early game of exploration and empire building is balanced with the mid and late game, there's always somewhere to go, something to see, someone to conquer, and something to worry about. That something to worry about part is usually caslon fuel for me.   Every ship whether private or state owned requires fuel and is fully simulates fuel usage.  I might have a large fleet of destroyers ready to go mid-game but often find they are all stranded because I did not plan my fuel supply correctly, expanded to fast and it's pretty much game over or scrap everything and rebuild.   It's not just fuel, it's also steel, lead, and dozens of other resources.  On smaller spread out star system maps not scouting before building is a death trap, you may not be able to reach other star systems until the proper technology is researched, without careful planning you could find yourself in another dead end.  So many ways to win so many ways to die.   Setting the reserch cost to 800K manually really makes the decisions you make about technology critical, research weapons or research engines, colonization or ship sizes, armor or shields, missles or laser and so on.  As I understand the AI has the same research penalities as you so you won't find the AI leaving you in it's dust trail, but they may have gone a different route than you and when matched up against an different opponents there could be different outcomes bases on the technology each chose to research.This is one of the few games left where every decision you make will have an impact on your empire,  depending upon how you setup your game. The impact may be major or it may be minor and it may not be seen immediately it may be after hours of play you realize you screwed up in the first hour and your whole empire is doomed.  Distance Worlds is what strategy 4x gaming should be, it feels good to have to use the brain again in gaming !I hear they are developing a Distant Worlds 2, if they take any feedback I'd like to submit some ideas for improvement but hope they don't deviate from what makes Distant Worlds the best space 4x game.

												This is a great game. Complex, difficult and not for beginners. This is the Space 4X to play once you've decided Master of Orion II is too simple for you. Civilian trade and one of the most realistic economies I've seen in this genre are two things this game has over the competition.Don't be fooled by my ah extremely low steam playtime on this. Distant Worlds: Universe crashes if I try loading it from steam. That, the ah genericness of the aliens and not being as pretty as stellaris, which given the different year it was released in is 100% understandable are the only downsides.			"

												Do not buy this game if you have a 4K monitor, you can't change the resolution of this game it just uses the desktop resolution. Things are very hard to read, playing this gives me a headache. Even when I try to change the desktop resolution does an anti aliasing bug cause things to be blurry. While changing the font size of windows increases some of the text do many text in game still stay tiny,  I fear I just wasted money.			"

												This game is huge. I bought the box version in 2010. Back then the game needed a lot of work. I stopped playing until now. It has definintely improved.EconomyThere isn't any. No buildings to put down on tiles. No structures to upgrade for minimal gains. Everything revolves around the star ports and theird construction bays which build the ships. The player orders military ships to be built and the AI handles all of the cargo and freight ships.Mining BasesThis can be automated and some automation is nice later in the game as the construction ships will go out and build mining and gas mining stuff for you. Reccomend not a lot of that since it can drive costs up. Exploring for cool resources is really fun and a large part of the early game. There are many resources to get. All resources can be bought (auto) by worlds as they need it, but it is best to have your own sources. Plantes can be taxed higher if they have steady supplies of Luxury resources.AuotmationThis is a huge game. There are many screens and settings all over the palce. It takes a while to get what you want with the settings. The automation really helps in the areas you do not want to handle.ResearchThere are three research areas. Weaponry, Energy+construction, and high tech. They are all useful. Some techs give bonuses for income and they are important later in the game.Ships and BasesYou can design these nicely. You just add components to the design. There are no blocks to place stuff, you just add the items to a list and that is the ship. Weapons and shields all have 360 degree arcs. However, sometimes refitting your ships, adding them to fleets, and managing it all is a little clunky. One thing is certain = the player will have hundreds of ships in their Empire. Again, many can be automated to patrol important areas. This is very useful if you have the pirates active. The game is kind of boring without pirates I found.Research TechsVery cool as there are lots of different techs to get. For example, there are several weapon areas, each useful. Some are long ranged weapons, some are short ranged, fast firing or slow firing, different damage amounts. Unlike some other space 4x games the items do not just scale up a little at a time. New items become available as you go down the tree of techs.WorldsThey have population. This is where income is from, as well as star port trading and the 'civilian' income. It takes a long time to grow people.Set UpThis is very important! There are many options for setting up a game. I prefer really slow technology, so I changed the slowest auto setting to even slower. I like it. Distant Worlds Universe is not a light game. Managing a large Empire can be a daunting task. I would not reccoment this game to a newer player. Controlling fleets, espionage (donw right for once!), diplomacy, resource managment, choosing techs and designing ships can be quite a handful. I find it really fun.Oops, once last thing .... sound. This game has serious sound problems. The music only loops once for me, so I turn the setting way down and play my own songs. Many times the in-game sounds junk out, but they usually come back on.Also, the graphics are not the greatest but they are decent.Good huge game.			"

												This game is for anyone who has ever played a 4x game, from Reach for the Stars, Civ, and MOO, to the latest ones like StarDrive, Endless Space, and Horizon, and just wanted MORE... More contol, more options, and more things to do.  It is easily the most fully functional and fully realized 4x game out there.But ""Hey!"" you might be saying, ""That all sounds great, but it has to be insanely complicated if it gives you that much control, right?""Wrong!Well okay, sorta wrong.  The game CAN be very complicated if you want it to be, but there are also tons of options for automation, to the point that you can pretty much let the game play with itself while you watch (you pervert).Before now there was only really one barrier to playing this game, and that was cost.  The game consisted of the base set and three (now four) addons, each rather costly and for quite awhile Matrix Games was pretty unyeilding on their pricing structure.  But no more...  Now you can get the base and all the addons for the price of a single game.  Why are you still reading this?  Buy the game already.***I am updating this review for the Steam awards.  I still love this game, and it deserves the Just 5 more minutes award because I have lost far too much time into this game.  It is one of those where you look up and realize that it is 4am and you have to work in the morning kind of games.			"

												There is not a whole lot left to say that has not already been said by other reviewers.The only bad thing about Distant Worlds is it makes all other 4x space games look like crap. In fact, thanks to Distant Worlds I cannot even play other 4x space games as they just pale in comparison. DW is by far the best out there right now!			"

												Easily the best 4X I have played in the last few years in terms of both depth and scale. The graphics and UI are pretty terrible for the day and age but for the love of god do not let that put you off buying this game. Does the game look like it may be a little too complex for you? Don't worry about it. The automation is insanely customizable to the point you can either micromange everything in a 100+ system empire or just fly a single ship the entire game and let the computer take care of the rest without any problems. Don't like the art/sound/races etc in the game? No problem, the game is highly moddable and even comes with a manual on how to mod the game.Like 4X stratergy? BUY IT!Like Space themed stuff? BUY IT!Like Your games to be highly modable? BUY IT!Like A game that can offer you hundreds of hours of gameplay? You get the point...			"

												Our member Icemania is the guest reviewer for this game.  He is our groups resident expert with extensive playing time, is active on their forums and is an active duty modder as well.  He actually convinced me to buy it though I lack his playing experience.   This is only his steam record - he played the matrix version for 100's of hours as well.  His review has an 88% approval rating.  Thanks for your permission to reproduce this Ice.Recommended297.8 hrs on recordA couple of years ago I found this game by pure chance. After many years of playing almost every Space 4X I was desperate to find something better and luckily I found it ... Distant Worlds is best in class and it's since become my most played game. It's a huge relief to see it on Steam because it's ready for Prime Time.A couple of key things to keep in mind before you purchase:1. This is a massive game and it will take some patience to get over the initial learning curve. You can choose what to automate and what to control, so start with manual control in one or two of your favourite areas only (e.g. for me it was research and fleets) and build from there.2. Once over the learning curve hump, if you like this type of game, you'll probably be hooked. In time you will find more layers of the onion to peel away. My game strategies were still evolving 100's of hours later.3. It's a real time game but you can pause to make it feel somewhat like a turn based game and to help keep your massive empires under control. As a result don't be put off by real time if you prefer turn based games.4. The graphics are average. If this is your primary driver this probably isn't your game. But if you want plenty of massive battles you'll get them.5. There is a massive array of setup options and as a result the game has significant longevity.6. The Universe release has greatly expanded mod capability. I don't play with many mods but Distant Worlds has some good ones.7. The Developer has a long track record of providing support and patches. This game will continue to improve ...If this sounds like your type of game then I recommend it highly.			"

												This game isn't for everyone: it's massively, opaquely complex and it's perfectly willing to run off without you if you let it.  But if - IF - it's your cup of tea, there's nothing else like it.  In terms of scope, ambition, scale and style, it is one of the finest SF 4X TBS games in existence anywhere.  Hardcore 4X fans, Accept No Substitutes.  (For the record, I say this as someone who considers Dominions 3 - ma-a-a-aybe Dom4, but definitely Dom3 - to be one of the greatest TBS games ever made.)

												UPDATE: The game no longer launches on startup. Just crashes while loading. (""has stopped working""). LAME. There have been no new updates either. Made in China?Encountering too many crashes in later, bigger games. Overall shoddy feel of the interface and functions don't help. Worst, is the random civil war crap. Anytime your empire gets big EVEN IF YOU HAVE ZERO WAR WEARINESS and your people are happy, civil war can break out and half your empire switches over.There is no way to disable this unless you start all over again and supposedly (from what others say) turn off random events---which takes away all the other random events that make the game interesting. But isn't that funny, it's a ""random event"". What a bunch of bull.The only other way to mitigate this is to use the in-game editor to MANUALLY change each revolting planet and ship back to your side. It's funny too how the ""other side"" of the civil war are a totally other race! Were all those other Humans really alien shapeshifters?Anyways, unless you want to spend loads of time watching nothing and fighting with the game to get it to do what you want, don't bother.Distand Worlds: Universe takes the 4X ""conquer the galaxy"" genre and weaves it into a large-scale RTS game.How could this even work? In most RTS games, you might get to a point of managing a large empire with 40 colonies or much more, and can devolve into a sadistic routine of micro-management.To sovle this, the game puts a lot of emphasis on automation. Letting the AI run things for you.This works and fails at the same time.Where is works: -you can tweak what you want to manage yourself vs. what the AI managesHow it fails:-the AI is stupid, it needs too much hand-holding, fights against your decisions, all the time, leading to micromanagement of the AIExample: -the AI will auto-design ships and not make them the best they can be.-the AI will put ships into a fleets and strike groups and send it out to the middle of nowhere for no reason-when you override AI control of fleets, ships, strike groups, the AI will re-override with it's own inferior decision making capability-During a war, you might have 500 ships and the enemy is attacking ONE system. Rather than defend, the AI will send all your ships to patrol your other systems. This leads to constant fighting with the AI where you order your ships to defend the system, they get there, then the AI overrides and sends them away. I'm not joking, even AFTER YOU DISABLE the AI capability, this happens. -To disable AI, you can set it up where it doesn't form fleets when you build ships, rather, you can do it manually. Or if the AI forms groups, you can go in to each group separately and disable AI command. THIS IS WAY TOO CUMBERSOME, because of the poor interface, is poorly organized, and extremely glitchy/blippy, and sloooooow. Extremely rough and skiddish at best.Where as in other games, you can pull up a list of all your ships and fleets and issue orders, settings, global settings, this game let's you pull up the ships, but you have to exit the list to focus on the ship/fleet you select, and then work on issuing commands. Then you have to go back and pull up the list again, scroll through the list looking for it, it's soooo incredibly poorly organized and slow, and then wash, rinse, repeat. Total fail.It's almost best that you form your own 5 kick-butt fleets, that you always will control, and let the AI handle everything else. Even in this scenario, everything will fall apart into disarray when a big war breaks out.Graphically, the game looks okay, but the weapon effects and ship designs mostly looks like something out of an♥♥♥♥♥♥I don't mind lacking graphics. What I DO MIND, is old, simple graphics that run like crap. This game's graphics would have been appropriate for something 20 years ago. The ships are just 2D static pictures. No flashing lights or effects or anything. *Just a .jpg that flies around and shoots other .jpgs at other .jpgs.*So why does this run so bad? I fault the developer, bad programming, that sort of thing.Has nothing to do with your system when you can easily play a Total War game with thousands of soldiers rendered in full 3D bashing each other over the head, but this game struggles with hundreds of flat 2D pictures moving on the screen. It's like they used a cheap game maker engine from the 90s that wasn't designed to handle so many moving pictures.Diplomacy is a fair attempt to do something more than throw money at the other side for peace or something.But the poor game performance shows its ugly face even where when you try to trade something and it struggles to load the list of things you need to trade. In the end, it is pretty much ""throw money at everything"".Pirates are a separate party in the game, but are totally annoying and unrealistic.I LIKE:Using governerors, hero-type characters to assign to missions, that it is RTS, that managing colonies aspect of AI works well, that there are different ways to play the game (just manage building your empire or assigned you leader to a ship and fly around blowing up pirates or raiding civilian ships), I like there is civilian traffic and trade that goes on automatically, you can build space-stations near black-holes for tourism, I like customization of own ships even being able to use other ""picture"" designs not inherit to your race, I like the research system, I actually like the space combat, it's simple and effective, good sound-effects. I love watching space carriers act like REAL carriers where they can launch dozens of fighters, I also like you can invade planets and watch the ground-battles take place (it sucks you have to manually order all your troop transports to be sure to load troops which should be done automatically when built), and the economic system involving more logistics (fuel, mining) is good, I love the size of the galaxy can be ridiculously huge, that you can impose embargo's on other empires, that you can destroy their stuff and there is NO ""automatic war"", and the dynamic that empires can have a revolt and there can be civil war and new empires from that.On that list thing, empire civil war, it happens AT RANDOM though which totally sucks.There is no warning, even if your population is happy, it can suddenly happen without warning. This needs to be fixed.But so do a lot of things. Also, when you conquer a planet, it can easily revolt. In some games, MY OWN TROOPS, garrisoning the planet joined the rebels. What gives???? If you bomb the planet to smithereens, another race might try to colonize it.When I recolonized, the predisposition to revolt was still there and still happening.Maybe it was something in that planet's atmosphere?Main problems of this game:-Extremely clunky, slow UI performance-Game can't handle too many ships on the screen despite the really remidial and simple graphics (seriously, what gives?)-Buggy save game system, some updates killed save games-Has a great game editor but also real buggy-And worst: the AI that is there to take away micromanagement is so incredibly stupid making so many outrageously bad decisions, is a total failure. You'll spend more time fighting your own empire-management AI than anything else in the game, and it sucks it is so essential as it is.My advice, don't use the AI at all and spend all the time you want focusing on manually doing everything.This means slowing down the game time, and having TONS OF PATIENCE.It will be one of the slowest, longest games you will have ever played but you will probably enjoy it more than messing with the AI.I know I mentioned more negative than good, but probably because there are fewer negative than good, but bad enough where they must be mentioned and emphasized, so this can better help people know the main issues they will encounter should they consider purchasing the game.

												The game makes a genuine stab at excellence but misses the mark somewhat.The language that the develop uses to promote this game sets the bar pretty high for success:  ""Experience the full depth and detail of turn-based strategy, but with the simplicity and ease of real-time, and on the scale of a massively-multiplayer online game.""In retrospect, having played the game for about 9 hours, the first two pieces of this claim are obviously contradictory.Truly you can have as much depth and detail as you like and you can certain have any level of control that you like.  Or you can have as little of each as you like as well.  But there just doesn't seem to be a whole lot of middle ground in how you play the game.  You're eiether all in and playing it down to the level of the ensign washing the heads or the supreme commander mastering the strategy.Add to this the interface, which is clunky, awkward, and frustratingly complex, I am left with a game that I truly wish I could play and enjoy but have no idea how to do so.The game is a beautiful game.  There has been a lot of attention and depth brought to this product.  And perhaps I don't realize I don't like space simulation games and don't realize it.But this game, for me, was extremely boring.  Challenges were easily bypassed.  And it was fairly easy to amass an armada of ships and bully my way through the universe.  *Yawn*I bought this game in a moment of weakness.  Every two or three years or so I get stupid and purchase a game at its full price.  Before this game it had been about a year since I fell off the wagon and bought the Witcher II.  And before that before I fell off the wagon and bought Spore.I've been a good boy since I bought this gameand haven't paid anything neear full price for any game since.  $60  is way way way way too much to pay for this game.  $20 is still too much.  I would be satisfied that I hadn't wasted my money if I bought it around the $15 mark.And rememeber, all of my reviews need to be examined through the lens of a casual gamer who counts the moments of his free time preciously, between life, career, family, and soul-crushing student loan debt.

												So Master of Orion 2 was your holy grail. You spend the better half of your 20s failing to find a worthy successor and alienating women at parties talking about its greatness and how nothing ever came close yadda yadda. And even though you felt it was the best space 4x you ever played, you still thought that certain Ideas or features could have made it even greater...Oh well my friend, you are in for a treat. Distant Worlds is not only a worthy successor of MoO2. It also implemented every single one of these ""oh man it would be sooo cool if i'd be allowed to do that now""-things you always missed and then some more. And it didn't stop there. It made everything bigger. It literally just bumped up the scale of everything. More stars. More ships. More explosions. More opponents. More everything. And then just molded it all together in an enjoyable and extremly well thought out, somewhat steamlined but not at all simplified* and balanced gaming experience.And this it all does while having the charming graphics of and excel-editor. Which makes the game an even greater achievement. *Yes this game isn't easy to get into. Yes you can leave most things on automation but then you'd just be playing a non-turn-based, bigger MoO2. The true greatness of this game doesn't get unleashed untill you spend some hours watching youtube tutorials and turn a lot of the automation off (especially research and ship design). It's gonna be a bumpy ride for a few hours but trust me - if you stick with it you will see the light.			"

												According to Steam, the strategy game I have played the most is Crusader Kings II, clocking in at 329 hours. There is no record for DW, because it has only just come to Steam, but there's no question I have put at least double that time into DW in the last year or so (I started playing in April 2013).In my opinion, you will not find a better 4x space game, period. Although it might seem expensive, the game has incredible depth and complexity, while at the same time allowing you to control as much or as little of your empire as you like. Your empire, and the rest of the galaxy, come alive as you are playing it. The other Empires go to war, sometimes with you, sometimes with each other. Some of them will seem very strong at one time, then they will fade to insignificance when they bite off more than they can chew. New empires can rise from almost nothing. The constant ebb and flow tells a different story every time you play the game.The playing space can be enormous, if you want it to be. How many space 4x do you see with a 'huge' galaxy setting and 250 stars (often with just one planet each). In DW, 250 stars is the second smallest setting. You really can go right up to 1400 stars (and you can edit in more if you want - the game will let you, as long as your system can run it). Each of these stars has planets in orbit, and asteroids, and asteroid fields. Moons orbit the planets. There can be dozens of objects in each star system, each moving around their planet or their star as the game time progresses. It is just immense, and thoroughly involving.The game is not quite perfect, but it is close.			"

												Great game! Bought it yesterday, was quiete scared of the steep learning curve thegame is supposed to have - but if you played any strategy game ever you will know what to do, thanks to the automation feature you can also tailor the gameplay to the way you liek to play.. for m first playthrough i was basically being the science ministry only dealng with the progress of research and having the rest of the empire on auto. next time ill do research and fleet design and after that even more.. thats how you an learn the game on the fly without even neding any tutorials.so tl:dr its a geat space 4x with a bit of learnign involved, nothing too demanding though!

Can put people off from playing too long ( kind of like dwarf fortress, hard to learn, but fun once you know)Text is a bit iffy *Got patched, shouldn't be an issue anymore*Kind of time consuming/addicting, if you are a busy person irl you might want something else to do that doesn't require such strategy and thought.

												Just started and sold on it.If your new this is what you need to do:1.Play it on easy first (Don't need anyone kicking your butt before you have a clue whats going on.)2. Lowers pirates power.(This guys seem to come out of no where.)3. Start in shadow era. Before hyper-speed. (This is a slower pace game lets you explore your own solar system at a smaller level and learn everything eaiser.)Once you put an hour or 2 in this way and you should know the basics.Pro:Everything its a smart game.cons:We need the WORKSHOP in the community for this game up and running. I hear there are great star trek, star wars, battlestar, Mass Effect mods. Won't mind checking out a few user made maps too. A lot of the websites mods  for this game are not updated for universe.

												Not a pretty game but definitely an insanely deep game.  And not mind boggling deep.  Its as deep as you want it to be.EDIT: Its also one of the few games I have played of this type with a really good diplomacy algorythm.  Its actually more rewarding to win a game completely peacefully for me.  Dissuading war with numerous alliances, creating wealth with numerous trade agreements, etc.  As long as you have a little cash, and are fairly established, peace is probably the most viable option.  Also, my typical games have last me 10-15 hours.			"

												I like it but it was a hard sell. I read the reviews good and bad and I thought that I'd give it a try. I almost asked for a refund the first hour of play but I gave it more time and found a way to play that I enjoy. In my opinion it is much more for the simulation crowd than the strategy people. If you like sim type game then you'll like this after you learn how to do things because you can automate as much or as little as you like. If someone likes to micromanage then this is their dream game. If you were to play a game without automating at least some things then it'd you'd probably play this game forver. Seriously there is so much depth to it that people who play it enough to learn it will be very impressed by it even if they don't like it. I would suggest trying it and read the tutorials etc. and see if you want to see the whole game or not. pros - Depth & options 2nd to none. You can design ships, galaxies, your gavernment, anything and everything has options.           endless replay value as there are so many options that you could play it very differently 100's or 1000's of times.            It's very well balanced, difficult for all equally lol. There is no race/government combo strategy that has a big edge over others from what I've seen. If you think you're being smart researching different planets to colonize to spread out fast, maybe you are, but maybe the other guy is researching better weapons to come take them from you etc. It's balanced, Having a strategy that works great one game may backfire on you in the next.            smart but fair AI. It does'nt seem like every AI civ is out to get you but at the same time you won't dominate them on normal or harder levels of play.cons - graphics are ok, some are good and some pretty basic            race/character portraits - they are good but lacking options in a game that has options for everything else. If you have 10 human generals/admirals or whatever, they all have the same profile photo. If you meet another civilization that is the same race as you, guess what? their leader is your long lost twin. seriously add some photos.             some things either lack explanation or it's not easy to find or understand it.              it needs more mouse over pop up descriptions and more detailed descriptions about exactly what your choices are. As an example - Your advisor says trade your rare fruit to this faction, it doesn't tell me what I get for it or that the faction will then be upset when I stop trading it one day etc. Some is obvious but more info or details in the popup would be nice.Lastly some advice for those that try it. PAUSE is your friend, don't rush in this game. AUTOMATE is your friend until you know what you can and like to do. If you don't understand something then it's better to let the AI handle it. Like for me designing ships looks like you'd need a engineering degree, I let the AI design all of them and it does great.So I'm happy with the purchase even though I initially thought I wasn't. Give it a try if anything that I said sounds good to you.Oh and Devs, I like cards, add trading cards.			"

												Well, if you are reading this then you are in need of help deciding if you should buy this game.  I like most people looking for a new moo2, have my own ideas on what would be the best game in the genre. So this review will start with my ideals.- complexity -  the ability to manage things on the grand scale (i.e. just globally order things) - or to micro manage every aspect of a planet/ship including placement of the parts on the ship design- difficulty (no cheating AI's and a game that pushes you all the way)- technologies that make you want to replay as a different type of race and culture- I like star systems with a multitude of planets and other heavenly bodies (i.e. wormholes, asteroids, etc.)So from this list of my ideals, which is by no means the complete list, I will now inform you if this game delivers.With respect to complexity I find that this game delivers.  With the state owned ships and the private ships you never have full control of your suply lines but you can either have the AI manage your escort ships or do it yourself.  You can manage nearly all other aspects of the game.The grandscale is sometimes my preferred method in this game for the mid to late game. It works well as the ships that are built pick up your grandscale orders (like nearest constructor- fix this ship, or you can have the AI make up your fleets).You can micromanage most things but this game fails at the ship design.  The player can only choose what parts are on the ship, not where they are on the ship.  I believe that damage that occurs after the shields and armor is done to random parts on the ship.As for all other ideals this game delivers a good difficulty curve, incorporates multi-planet systems, and has a good research tree that is enjoyable and keeps your desire to replay high.So,                 THIS GAME IS EASY TO RECOMMEND, because it delivers on nearly all of my biggest desires for a space simulation game.  The main problems are the lack of ship design aspects and decent space monsters that challenge.  The pirates that I have yet to mention fix the challenging monsters.P.S.     I have deliberately only talked about the game play of a normal nation not as a pirate nation because that is just icing on the cake!!			"

												This game is massive and hard to get into, but you can automate most everything and just push fleets around and that is fun.  After awhile I felt like I was barely scratching the surface of this game but am too intimated to crack it open and really learn how it fits together.To really enjoy this game to its potential you need to be 7 or more smart, but I am only 5 smart.

												The learning curve on this game makes EVE cry.  The amount of micromanaging is mind-boggling.Thankfully, you can automate about 99% of it!  Just sit there and watch the game play for you!I love 4x games.  RTS 4x games are a bit touch and go.  This one is just crazy.  It's not something you're going to learn to play the first time you play.  Hell, I have almost 10 hours in it so far and I still don't understand most of it.  The UI isn't that easy ot use, some of the commands (or lack thereof) don't make sense, and for the life of me I can't figure out how to attack an Empire's home planet, even though I have troops and bombard weapons.Overall I'd give this game a 7/10, because I can see what it can do.  I've watched vids on Youtube of people who know what they're doing, and the game seems deep and fun.  I'm just not there yet.  I'm at the base of Mount Everest looking up.  In a speedo.  And High Heels.			"

												A deep, complex and rewarding space strategy game, where it is your job to manage your very own space empire. Colonize planets, invent new techs, build your ships and wage war or use diplomacy. Basic stuff, really. But one thing makes it stick out to me: the civilian fleets. Every faction has their own civilians scooting through space. The galaxy feels alive because of this. You have no control over them, but you need them to generate revenue for your economy. You can also extensively customize your starting options and generally define what kind of game you want to play. Make a peaceful galaxy for a more trade/diplomacy oriented game or ramp up the pirate activity and aggressiveness of the other factions for a more war oriented game. Other options like how advanced your faction is compared to the others, the scarcity of recources or the the size and composition of the map will make it easier or harder for you.Graphics are outdated, the user interface is quite a mess and sound is basic. But still this is one of the best 4X space games out there.			"

												Greetings! Don't get my 21 hrs wrong, I owned this game before it was available on Steam. Add 200 hrs of long campaigns.This game is a lot of fun if you can get past the heavy learning curve. And, that is a steep, steep curve. It is long, immersive, and functions well. The AI is more than competant and provides a good challenge. Each game will tell a long and interesting story unique to you and your play style. I suggest changing starting conditions each time you play. This game gives you a lot of options (seriously, a lot) and I think that many people will enjoy playing it.My only concern is the learning curve. Check out youtube playthroughs or internet reviews before buying. Lastly, it is on sale (rare!) for 50% off and I think that it is worth every penny of that. Once you have played it a couple times, check out the mods! The mod community is well developed and offers  many popular sci fi universes to use in your game. This game becomes an immersive version of Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica or whatever.Give it a try!I give it a perfect score of 5/7			"

												the best 4x game i'v have ever found hands down. With everything able to be automated the game was very enjoyable first time playing until i got the hand of it. the only thing that could possibly make it better would be multiplayer support, as it stands though single handedly the best 4x single player experience you can buy. Another plus that should be encouraged is the galaticpedia which shows info on everything you would need to know.TL:DR the game as it stands is a great hope to 4x games everywhere. sadly the lack of multiplyer means you will never be able to create a pirate criminal empire with your friends.

												Followed this since the very beginning and now finally on Steam.I believe i spent 200+ hours in all the series and for this price is one of the best bargain you can have now that with the modding options you will start seeing massive customizations.In Vanilla form the game is already one of the most challening and complex 4x out there (maybe second to Aurora?), you can automate what you don't want to control yourself with a decently competent AI and in general have a great time doing it.Can't wait now that this hidden gem is finally revealed to the public what will the modders do.If you are even vaguely interested in space game or strategy game get this! you might be overwhelmed a little bit at first but there are tons of information available in the forums to help you through it!

												All these reviews complain about how hard it is to learn and about how the tutorials dont do much, but I learned the basic grasp of it all within 10 hours of play-time by just actually playing and experimenting. That seems like a long-time to learn, but for a game as in-depth as this, it isn't long at all. It isn't nearly as hard as people claim it to be and some things you can only learn about through playing, which adds to the fun. The UI is very user friendly, gameplay is very fun and you can choose to automate everything or micromanage everything.There is a lot of freedom in this game and many playstyles are availiable due to literally every ship/space station being customizable. There are also many espionage options that can actually mean. You can choose to focus on trading by taking hold of the most valuable resources first and then impose trade sanctions against that pesky insect nation to wage war at you but little did they know is that you have 4 allies to help you alongside with your massed oribital super-defenses. Or you can build a ton of little ships to overwhelm enemies to enslave their colonies. Or hire some pirates to distract the otherside of their territory or perhaps they may even destroy it. Or play as one.Moddability is also outstanding.			"

												Steep learning curve and awkward interface marr what could otherwise be an excellent game.  I have been playing this for the last few hours and still struggle with the visual coding of menus, icons, and stats in addition to the unintuative controls.  For first time players, the game starts with all functions automated which gives you a sense of watching a ""lets play"" video on youtube.  Switching to manual means having to deal with minutia and micro managing.  The intent is fair in that the ability to automate different tasks means you can focus on your favorite aspect of space civ games, unfortunatly the ai automation is slow to respond.  Tutorials are of limited value as some of them don't seem to properly visualize the results of the lesson at hand and merly bring you through menus.Such amazing potential if the game were streamlined and offered better visual clarity, intuative controls, and more comprehensive tutorials on how to play.

Product received for free
												You only have to visit my YouTube channel to see how much I love this game!I originally ""purchased"" this game back in the ""Legends"" Expansion days (2012) but received the ""Shadows"" and ""Universe"" expansions free from the developer for my support on YouTube and through time spent Beta Testing. (Just to be clear!)  My playtime easily exceeds 10,000 hours and to this day I still enjoy sinking time into it. Even with this kind of playtime I STILL come across situations and surprises that make me sit back and say, ""WOW!"" The modding community expands on this even further. I could write a book talking about my love for this game (but who would want to read it! ;) ). To say any more would only Parrot what has already been said in the many other positive (and a few negative) reviews. It's not for everyone, but should be experienced nonetheless. Easily my top game and I have dubbed it the ""Civ Killer"" when it comes to 4x gaming and how I spend my gaming time.			"

												One sentence review: ""Distant Worlds Universe, though very complicated, is the epitome of the idea that good game design trumps graphics.""The only game that rivals Distant Worlds Universe for immersion and number of options available to your empire management is Aurora 4X. Otherwise, if you prefer to have at least some graphics to assist your gaming experience or imagination, this is the last word in space empire simulation.Great base game, great mods, great community support... The only problem is, just like learning how systems (e.g. economics) works in real life, learning the various aspects of this game can be intensive. There are numerous tutorials on Youtube availabe (one by myself even ), and you absolutely must use these in order to understand what the heck you're doing.But I guarantee that if you invest the time to learn this game (assuming you like space 4X games), it will become your favorite, and remain there with Aurora 4X until DW2 is released.

												Major griefs: 2014-06-03Keeps crashing!Feels glitchy.Beta?Interface is bad:Information is hidden - its like searching in spreadsheets with no search options.A construction craft is constructing, but no visible ETA... its hidding on a subcell deep on another page about your ships.Clicking on a window, will sometimes select the object behind the window.Missing links between ""do you accept this deal"" / ""your found something"" to the items / map.Research screen feels like a subprogram, glitching, and resetting when you click something.Text is tiny - but they are working on it.Its like a renderer on a database. But at times doing my own SQL's would be better.Sometimes the ascii interface from Dwarf Fortress is better designed.Clicking on something sometimes takes 3 clicks for game to understand. (unit wasnt automated)Good idea with the AI - needs more sub options.Gives you a chance to learn the game.No options for building your own race based on points. (I knew this before purchase!)But you can edit a file and have all the abilities... that just isnt fair or fun.Perhaps stable in a few months.Still, I do want to support the genre... going back to moo2 and stardrive (which was buggy on release as well).Perhaps it will be worth my time and recommendation with more patches for stability and interface.

												Recommended with caveats.This game is much more akin to Paradox’s “grand strategy” games than it is to conventional 4X space games (MOO, GalCiv and the like).It simulates a lot of the detail of the empire and offers automation for everything - the same automation the AI uses.That leaves the player free to take on the elements that are interesting to them at any given point in the game  (for example - I usually do a bit of early colonisation, set the research path then mostly take control of fleet targets and diplomacy).Playing with a lot of automation can involve a lot of watching your plans being implemented by the AI with a little bit of reacting to random events - yet it is still quite absorbing as you edge towards your long range goals.The caveats:It isn’t very accessible - many critical systems are more than a little opaque, such as colony growth, research caps and the way various ship components work.  Expect to have to do a bunch of reading forum threads and guides to get to grips with things.The UI is annoyingly clunky (for me); while there are multiple ways to select and list the objects in your empire there are actions that can only be performed in specific views and lists.I also have some concerns about the victory system (which may not be that important because at its core the game is more of a “sandbox” than a 4X).  There isn’t any kind of diplomatic or alliance victory, there isn’t really an influence based victory - its all about population and territory, which ultimately means military victory.			"

												Despite some of the criticisms, I'd have to say this is the best 4x out there today by a wide margin.I'm a huge moo2 fan from the DOS days and constantly looking for something that gives that same immersive feeling and character.  I have plenty of things on my wishlist for v2 of this beast and have high hopes they will take some of the input from the members to heart and ignore the negative trollers, but overall I'm glad I paid $60 bucks now that I've played it a while and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone as a great value at that price.  Be warned, it takes some learning, and certainly some digging through the forums to learn some of the basics, but if you don't mind a bit of digging, the payoff is great.			"

												One of the greatest and most versatile 4X games I've ever played. Really well-done 2D visuals on a galactic scale, great sound design for an ever-busy universe, and the ability to delegate essentially any part of your empire to the AI. Do what you want, and nothing more. This game is the culmination of one of the biggest examples of a ""diamond in the rough"", and well worth the price tag. The base game and three expansions, each of which introduces a completely new way to play the game, and steadily develops the horrendous UI into something manageable (And quite pretty, once modded).If you ever wanted to play a 4X as a Leader, Emperor, or Alpha truly would rule, this is the game. Or, you can be a space trucker and set up gas stations for your empire, as it progresses along without you. Or you can be the pirates that give said space-trucker the shaft. Whatever. Only disappointment is that there's no demo to give this a shot, but I'd suggest anyone with an interest in the genre to get their hands on a copy of this, and buy it if you enjoy it. I know I did.

Mods make the game better, and full conversions to other sci-fi universes by mod creators ensure infinite replayability. If you have played Stellaris, or licked the MOO games and see this on sale or you have $60s kicking, pick it up and give it a try, if its too daunting you can always refund it.			"

												This game is a bad♥♥♥♥♥Grand Strategy. The action is nice, but a little seizure inducing at late game stages, just the game a good gamer likes it.I was ""Bro bro bro'd"" by a broke friend into buying this game so he could play it on my steam share. The first day I got it I decided to be a deuchebag and play it for a bit so that he couldn't, I only planned to be there long enough to learn the game... 12 hours later after starting to play, I hadn't even gotten off my homeworld yet but once or twice, restarted the game like 4 times and ignored all messages the entire time... The learning curve melted my brain, it was phenomenal.Despite this the game is pure unfiltered gold distilled in a strange little package. It's like a jacked up mixture of Europa Universalis and Masters of Orion 3 - its Effin' glorious if you're a fan of either one, better if you're a fan of both. It definitely gives you a real ""I'm the leader of a galactic empire and I can't really do everything"" feel. There are quite a few options that you can either control yourself or have the AI control - in fact, if you want to ""Watch"" the game you could put the AI in control of everything, from colonization to troop management to whether you go to war or not but honestly its more fun the more you control, however overwhelming it may get. I've had the game for just under three weeks and already put 90 hours into it, on my laptop no less. My job wishes I put in that kind of time. I'm limited to galaxies with 400 stars but if you've got a graphics card and decent processor a standard 900-1400 stars'll work for you just fine. Don't buy it for the graphics, buy it for the gameplay. Tons of customization options you can build the galaxy as you like and control many victory conditions. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of Grand Strategy games.			"

												Distant Worlds is a 4X Sci-Fi-Game with an interesting story-line and lots of possible automations.That's in short, but you can see from my game time, that this game is seriously addictive ;-)And by the way: I had that game before, which wasn't via SteamSo whats so interesting at Distant Worlds?Above all other components it's the possible automations. You can let the AI handle (or not) MANY things, like ship design, ship building, base building, planetary building, diplomatic gifts, diplomatic treaties, espionage, ... well, I could count on other things, but that's not the point.The AI makes it's job pretty good and as I said: You can toggle on or toggle off that automation-options. Many options can work with ""half-automation"", so that the AI makes suggestions and don't control that aspect directly.The technology tree is not too complicated, but leads to interesting new components. Technology is absolutely important.Distant Worlds uses a wide variety of ressources, many of them needed as building materials for your ships and bases, but also luxury resources, which boosts the development of your colonies, which leads to higher taxes.There are also some really good mods out there for the game. For example Human Revolution or W40k.I saw how this game developed from its early states as it was only called ""Distant Worlds"" to this fine developed state. Maybe it was a long way, but it was totally worth it. "

												Distant Worlds: Universe is one of the best 4X empire builders out there. If you need a comparison to help you imagine how it plays, think Europa Universalis in Space. Like seemingly all games of any significant depth, Distant Worlds is not exactly a looker. Infact, the graphics were a barrier to my enjoyment for quite some time until I decided to get over it and see why this game excited serious strategy gamer quite so much.Gameplay puts you in charge of an empire of two halves. The State, which is the government controlled side of things (which you run) and The Private Sector, which is 90-100% automated. The 10% difference brings me to one of Distant Worlds biggest features. The game allows you to automate any aspect of the game you don't enjoy.If you don't want to fiddle with ship designing, you can leave it to the AI, or taxes, population management, colonisation, genuinely any aspect of the game can be automated. Heck you can automate your entire empire if you really want. This is highly customisable and can be fiddled with on the fly and makes the game a little easier to get into. The game is, however, still very complex and it took me watching 20, 30 minute episodes of a Let's Play series - something I wouldn't usually even consider doing - before I felt comfortable enough to give Full Manual play a shot. But I'm glad I did.Distant Worlds: Universe is a hard game to recommend to those with limited patience or time, and that aren't big on complex strategy titles to begin with, but if you are curious it is a top of it's class game well worth exploring.

												First of all if you want to learn the game, here is a good YOutube Video tutorial from Dastactic


YouTube™ Video: How to Play Distant Worlds ~ 01 Introduction to the tutorial series 

			Views: 45,081		



I usually can never stick to any strategy games too much for one reason or the other, but Distant Worlds has been an exception. This is not just a space strategy game. Its amore of a simulation of an Empire, or writing a story of your race from begining of one planet, building your very first space station to finally spreading out to the stars. Every game i have played, i have had a unique experience, each game  telling a different story. From freighters trasporting goods from one part of your empire to another, to passanger ships transporting migrants to other colonies within your empire, to  tourists visiting that tourist resort you created near a black hole.There is soo many things you can do in this game. It is only normal the UI would be a wee bit complicated. But once you learn the way the UI works, things get a lot easier. If you are willing to overlook the Graphics, and take the time to learn the game. I assure this game will take away your life assuming you are a space scifi fan like i am.GameplayStarting from Galaxy map, every part of the galaxy si accessable, you can mvoe your ships to any part of the galaxy, build a star base anywhere, as opposed to having access to only the systems and not the area between it. This essentially increases the scale of the Universe immensly as compared to Stellaris if your playing in 1000 star system.There are nearly 20 different types of resources, each of these resources needs to be mined by your minign stations, transported by freighters over to your space ports. From where these resources will be used to build ships and other thigns necessary. The transportation is handled by the private sector, so you do not need to worry about that. Each ship component uses certian types of resources, So an entire spaceship with hyper drives, proximity sensors, maxos blasters will use a whole host of resources which your spaceports will need an active stock of in its Cargohold. SO there is no automatic teleporatation of resources, its realistic.Ships and starbases can be custom designed, if you want to leave the designing aspect to the AI, that can be done as well. But it will be a lot more usefull to design your own ships for specefic needs. You could fit exploration ships with long range sensors and place them on the edges of enemy systems, giving active information of ship movements with a sector.  IF you simply want a starbase to give your colonies better access to entertainment  and medicial facilities to improve their happiness and popuilation growth, that can be done as well...CombatIF you decide to build on giant fleet, for your entire empire, you are bound to ragequit. You will be attacked by pirates in different star systems, some times by giant fleets, sometimes by small 1 or 2 ships, some times by space bugs. The only way to adequatly defend your self is too create escorts  and automate them to protect your trade lanes, build small strike fleets to defend vulnarable sectors and few bigger fleets for large engagements. Monitering stations are extremely necessary to find out enemy fleet movements and for better defence co-ordination, otherwise this will become a game of whack-a-mole with pirates constantly harassing you.Ground combat is more or less simple, you have defensive troops which give massive defensive bonus, you have normal troops used for both attack and defence and then you have armoured regiments for purely offensive use,  and then finally you ahve special forces to take out defensive emplacements like shields. There is arduamantry skill system for troops , as more they fight better they will get in combat effectiveness...ExplorationExploration is a rather huge aspect of the game, there are plenty of goodies out there to get from death star space weapons, to abaondned ships, to an ancient starship graveyards where you can end your contructors to repair the ships to special anomalies on planets where you can get tech, credits or activate something sinister which you  will later regret.PIrate bases are surprisingly well hidden, so you will rarely stumble upon them. Its easier to use the charecters to steal their territory map or operations map.PIratesPIrates are probably one of the best(As well as the most annoying) features in the game. There are bascially 3 different types.Smugglers - they basically use indipendent feighters to transport goods into your empire, earning oney from the private sector. you can infact ask smuggling pirates to get the goods that your empire does not have. They are less aggressive, but they will have a few military shipsMercenries - They basically do what you pay them to do, they will attack other pirate bases, planets, starbases if you pay them enough. Other empires will also use this feature against you. SO if youare getting harassed by a pirate merc faction. Most likely your rival is funding them.Raiders - They basically raid, burn♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillage. YOU can pay them off to keep them away from you or you can wipe them out. BUt if you pay them off for too long, by mid game Raiders and merc factions can get extremely powerfull. Even far more powerfull than other Empires.TradeTrade in the game is a lot more realistic. Private sector will often go to nearby empires and purchase goods your empire might not have. They will even purchase goods from pirate bases assuming you pay them off to not be hostile with you.The amount of trade done will positivly effect your relationship with another empire. So you might have in MId to late game freighers from several empires trading and traporting goods withint your empire.MiscAI is pretty good compared to other games, it certianly is not a walk over if you change all the setting to extreme. There is also an very good AI mod from icemania in Matrix forums which makes the AI a lot better. The AI still surprises many Vtearan players.The End game threat is possible one of the hardest in any stratgy game history. Wars against the Shakturi are allways EPIC in scale. The size and scale of battle IMHO is unmatched by any other game until now. If you are not carefull, they will wipe out everyone and everything literally.Final CommentsThis game is dream come true for any space stratgy fan, Galaxy is literally alive from pirate attacks, boarding action , freighters, migrants , tourists , smugglers , space creatures. A pretty decent in game back story, with forgotten ships, starship graveyards , starbases and the massive scale of a 1400 star map with 50,000 odd planets and moons give the game an immense sense of scale and mystery.I easily Rate this a solid 9/10			"

												Clearly and easily the best space-based 4x game released since Master of Orion 2. The ability to play with over one thousand star systems, and thousands of other objects including planets, asteroid belts and other items makes this game one of the biggest in offering in content. Each time you start a new game, it feels like there is a new set of stories in your galaxy to immerse yourself in.For newbies, you can automate parts of the game to allow the AI to control that portion of the game. This makes jumping in a lot easier instead of being thrown head-first into the deep end. However, the Matrix games forum has tons of information to get you up to speed to become a competant and then an advance player relatively easily.The modding community also provides many fixes and improvements with the enhanced AI mod, extended universe mod, Star Trek mods (Picard era and ""Return of Khan"" TOS-era mods) and unleashed extended mod providing some of the best mods the community has come up with thus far (note that I have missed quite a number of mods here; this is just a sample!). The mod forum is available here (http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tt.asp?forumid=795) and also on the workshop.The only weak points are its graphics, however they are extremely functional to the game design and the diplomacy which is mostly bare-bones. Although in DW's defence, most 4x games do not get the diplomacy right either.I would recommend this game to any space-4x strategy game fan. You might also want to look up DasTactic and Larry Monte on youtube for some great ""Let's Plays"" on getting started.			"

												i want to love this game.  you have too much automation, and it plays its self, and you just watch.  or you turn it off, and you have way too much to keep up with.   after 30 hours i would hope to have found a sweet spot, but its always one or the other.  if i do find it ill change the review, but as it stands its not very playable to me. so i cant recommend it.

												10/10 Would create a galaxy spanning empire just to then take a ship and live my life off as a pirate!PS: Have a few hundred hours playing this game from before it came out on Steam. As someone already said, it's the only game smart enough to play against itself if you let it. The amount of automation and customization on how to run your empire is insane!			"

												There is alot of reviews outthere about the game mechanics UI etc so i wont talk about them.. it works okay but could do some little work.. Anyways game is just AWESOME to the point of 15 systems with 20-22 planets. after that point it quickly snowballs to uncontrollable mess unfortuntelly. I play everything manuel and enjoyed alot but as i said after 15 systems or so even if you automote some aspects of game it is not that fun as its used to be..but even for first couple hours of joy the become somewhat powerful empire it is worth the price.. I bought it %50 or so if you find it for that price dont miss it.			"

												Distant Worlds is one of the most enjoyable 4Xs I have ever played.  I have been playing it since the Legends expansion and took part in the Beta for Universe.  When I first started playing it, I had a hard time getting into it and went back and forth from feeling overwhelmed (limited automation) to feeling like the game was boring and basically ran itself (too much automation).  The turning point for me was when I started watching some of the excellent LPs by DAS24680 and Larry Monte.  As I watched more and more of their LPs I gained a better understanding of the game mechanics, many which I didn't even know existed.  I slowly began to switch off parts of the automation and instead of feeling overwhelmed found myself having a great deal of fun.Pros (IMO):+ Automation: The fact that you can automate almost every aspect of the game allows for the flexibility to choose what kind of game you want to play.+ Community:  The community is very friendly and helpful. + Private Sector: Having a private sector that is outside of your immediate control is a really neat game mechanic that adds another dimension to the game.  It also makes for a more immersive experience.+ Resources: The fact that a component that is built for a ship or base requires certain specific resources.  I enjoy that aspect since it adds another dimension to the game and makes you prioritize what planets you set up mines on first or colonize first.+ Game Setup:  I like the fact that you can change almost everything about a game and that the game remembers your settings.  This allows for the ability to customize the game however you want and leads to substantial replayability.+ Modability:  I think that it was a really good decision to make the game fully modable and can't wait to see what the community comes up with.Cons (IMO):- Graphics:  Initially, I didn't like the graphics very much and my initial impressions of the game were not good.  However, over time I have gotten used to them and have improved them via mods.  I also understand that given the size/complexity of the galaxy you can create a map for (up to 1400 stars), having less system taxing graphics is probably a good design decision.  I will take complexity and the ability to create large 1400 star galaxies over graphics any day.Mods that I am using:  Distant Worlds Extended Universe 1.0: Adds 18 races to the game bringing the total to 40.Das Chrome UI: Reskin of the UIMake sure to watch some of the LPs before/after you purchase the game to get a better understanding and appreciation for the game mechanics and enjoy the game.  This is definitely a diamond in the rough.			"

												Plebs love to complain about the game's price. Please, don't be stupid. You're paying for a game and all the expansions in one package. Take Europa Universalis IV, if you want to buy the base game, the expansions, and all the DLC, it will set you back £75. Now you can buy the 'base' EUIV game, but you'll be getting an empty husk of game, it's a horrible way to release a game. With Distant Words, it packages up all the expansions into one game, hence the price.And the game itself? This is THE definitive grand strategy in space. It rivals Paradox offerings and in my opinion improves on them. Its killer feature is the fidelity and detail of the simulation. There aren't many mechanics which are abstracted or 'game-fied', unlike say Europa Universalis, which is a broad representation of complex processes that run in the background, driving the game. Distant Worlds is set on a grand scale, but you're able to quantify everything, down to what is inside the cargo hold of one of the hundreds of private freighters flying around. The systems run like clockwork and yet they're not abstract-civilian traders transport and supply real goods, mined by real stations, designed by the player-made up from specific components-which themselves are constructed from raw materials, either mined or purchased. Once you master how to navigate the interface, there is not much to learn as it's all common sense, as the systems work logically, and not in an abstract game fashion.The detail of the simulation allows for a lot of emergent gameplay. There is a lot of story telling and character here, and you have many options on how to control your empire. Also the level of said control can be adjusted-you're able to automate just about everything aspect of your empire. The game gives you the choice to either automate completely and merely watch your empire interact with the rest of the galaxy, or you can control every aspect, down to deciding what kind of engines a privately owned mining ship may have, and how many. Or what race is allowed to live on a particular colony.This is not a game to win, this is a game to play, like Crusader Kings 2.			"

												If you like Sci Fi 4X games then look no further. This is by far the best of them out there, and believe me I've looked long and hard. The game has been around for years, so my steam play time is not indicative of my experience with it. The price tag includes the base game and 4 yes 4 expansions. Game setup allows you to customise it almost any way you want, making for exceptional replayabilty. Pausable realtime, Huge Galaxies and thousands of ships. But fear not, the scale of it is not as daunting as you may think, because every single aspect of the game can be automated to your choosing, allowing the more than competent AI to manage literally everything for you. Or if you prefer you can micro manage everythng..... or maybe something in between.And Finally.... Mods! There is already a very vibrant modding scene, but with this release comes even more modding capability. Almost every aspect of the game is now modable, I have no doubt that there will be more modders introduced therefore enhancing the library of mods that exist today.To sum up: A fan of the genre? You'd be a fool not to buy!			"

												There is no other game. There is only Distant Worlds.Why do you play games? What is their purpose? What can they achieve?This game answered all those questions for me. I struggled with the learning curve, until I just made the computer do everything, paid attention, and took control of one thing at a time.You can macro manage the entire game, completely zoomed out and looking at the galaxy map as the computer makes ships, assembles them into fleets, and lets you designate where they form up and take control of worlds for you. You can take control of just a single ship and fly across the galaxy with it as a miniscule speck in the sea of destruction that roars around you. You can be the scientist and let the computer utilize all the research and technology you've acquired. You can just work diplomacy and back door deals. You can do whatever the hell you want in this game, and every aspect of it is incredibly deep to the point that makes you want to curl up, suck your thumb, and cry for your mommy.I've played over 20 hours the past two days, losing sleep and my mind, and I've barely even got out of pre-warp stage. Buy this game.			"

												Where has this jewel been hiding all my life. I really like this game. I have played this kind of games since the wonderful Master of Orion and i have had a lot of fun with some of them. I like the approach of this one, i like the automatic AI a lot and the various levels of customization. I can feel like the King or Prime Ministry of the Galaxy being asked about attacks, wars and some diplomacy just enjoying a magnificent universal view but also able to zoom to the lowest level of control and being able to avoid the repetitive tasks when bored or just change in the middle of the game from research manager to attack one. I know i am a quite slacker governor but in these really long games i like to be able to switch and enjoy the different aspects.I also love to start with the ""easy level of difficulty"" and select the option that the game will autofix the difficulty when you are getting close to win the match, wonderful idea to get the maximum of every match.It has a lot of depth, graphical aspect is ok, i like the music.Really nice one.

												This game is absolutely fabulous. It takes some mastering and learning from from various sources such as youtube and  online guides.This is a 4X which even has a story line to it, a complex but yet simple interface structure. The best way to define this game would be to take 'Star Trek Birth of the Federation' and to expand on that principle to an entirely different level all in real time.The whole experience can be customised to your preference along with the scale. I just cant stress how good it is. It does have a few bugs but it doesn't really stop the game play. I would say the graphics could look better but its that for a reason when you are immersed in the gameplay.If you like Civilization, Alpha Centari, Age of Empires, Birth of the Federation and all such games in that league then I am sure you will enjoy this game as a stratagy game that builds on such games to a new level.I have personally found me playing an empire and learning from trial and error to get better and better. Do put in the time and effort and you will love it.This is a MUST BUY!			"

												I can't recommend this game at this time.  I have a very good system, I7 4930k @ 4ghz, 16gb PC12800 ram, GTX770, Win7pro, etc., and I get out of memory errors and crashes once the game reaches the point where the Shakturi begin really being a problem.  I provided all the error messages I have to tech support, but basically my report has either been ignored (no responses on their official bug report forum) or ignored (no further responses after telling me to report the bugs).  No solutions have been presented.  The lack of acknowledgment from support is very discouraging.I'm not playing with any mods whatsoever, just 1.9.5.5 version, the latest non-beta.  The game starts to get unstable when I'm at about 100 military ships, around the same time as the Shakturi appear.  I would say it's mid game or mid-late game.  At any time when everything starts becoming laggy and slowing down and flickering, the game may crash with or without an out of memory error populating in the error logs.  At any time around this point, it also fails to save.I am left with an essentially unplayable game because I can never reach end-game or even get close to it without game crashes happening all the time.  It works fine up until the later game, then it just leaks memory or something, I don't really understand how they can charge $60 for a game that I can't even finish on my modern system.  Therefore, I can't possibly recommend it until/unless they fix those bugs.			"

The story line is ok I have gotten as far as the late game and its been a fun ride. I have not tired modding yet but I have my eyes on a few I might try. P.S. Even though I reccomend this game a full price, try and snag it on sale it makes it feel like its worth it even more.			"

												Best space 4x Grand Strategy there is atm. Pricy, but worth it. I consider myself no fanboy, I just find this game to come closest to my idea of a great game in its genre.Up to 1400 stars, each with its own planetary system (they orbit their star! moons too! ). Plenty of resources to secure, gather and a few to kill for.Sprite graphics but this allows for easy modding (modding is a thing, new races, total overhauls = star trek, star wars, mass effect, etc) and huge fleet battles (easily hundreds+). Steep learning curve but manageable and automation allows you to learn at your own pace or if you just don't like some parts of the game, leave it to the AI (taxes? research? intelligence? ship design?). Plenty of characters that help in various fields, all with skills that improve with use and traits, both positive and negative. No one likes that Scientist that increases enemy Steal research operation chance by 200% right? Or this dumb Fleet admiral that deceases the skill of any other character present in the same place. Not only scientists and fleet admirals but also ship captains, troop generals, colony governors, intelligence agents, leaders or ambassadors. You are also able to pick your government type from Monarchy, Republic, Democracy through Technocracy and Hive Mind up to the legendary Way of the Ancients. 12 in total, each with different bonuses/maluses to research speed, upkeep costs, corruption level and many more stats. Don't like playing an empire? Fine, go and play a pirate instead! With kinda asymmetrical gameplay go and pillage and raid planets, smuggle some goods, built an army for hire, search the galaxy for secrets and sell those to the highest bidder. Or just be a pain in the #$@ and hit everyone and everywhere while playing cat and mouse!AI is competent and might gang up on you if if feels like it and/or you give it a reason. Races have traits, dependable and friendly race will be your long-time ally if you work on it, agressive and intelligent might be your nightmare. AI controlled private sector (it earns money, you tax those money and protect it to earn more so you can tax more.. ) is the most unique feature, nothing like that is present in any similar game. Thanks to this the universe feels very much allive with hundreds of small or large private frighters flying around, doing their business (trade resources, carry materials from mining stations to your Space Ports so you can build that new shiny Carrier for your main fleet), which you can not directly control, but only indirectly influence.For those concerned about DRM, know that other than install/update, the game can be played without Steam client running. This should help those that do not want / can not run it sometimes.Overall, this game might be a refreshing suprise for those starved for a good space 4x / grand strategy, of which we had very few in the last years, and almost none good enough to last.

Posted: October 4, 2016
												I've a confession to make; I pirated Distant Worlds ages ago, well before Distant World: Universe came out. Why? Because at the time, getting Distant Worlds and all its expansions was extremely expensive. You're looking at around 100 euro (back then it was around 140/160 euro as the price point was higher) and there was no way I could justify spending that amount on a game I'd probably not enjoy. But I did enjoy it. But because I was only able to pirate the main game and I believe one of the expansions rather than the whole lot, my experience was sort of disjointed. I enjoyed the game but became frustrated by it at the same time and was unwilling to pump enough time into it.When I found out that Distant Worlds: Universe which contains ALL of the expansions plus other improvements was available to buy, it was an instant buy. Not only is it great value for what you get, I could actually enjoy the whole experience. I have played pretty much all the major 4x space strategy games out there including some obscure ones like Space Empire IV. I've played GalCiv 1, 2 and 3 (3 is a disaster) along with Endless Space, I played Star Ruler, StarDrive... Among many other forgettable ones. None of them can beat Distant Worlds: Universe. Not even the latest 4x game, Stellaris, can beat it, but I will put Stellaris firmly in second place.The game isn't easy to get into, its not perfect but if your looking for a space strategy game with a ton of depth, complex mechanics, a dynamic working economy that you can actually 'see' working before you, fantastic AI and detailed ship design all set in a massive galaxy that feels very much 'alive' and features lots of exploration from lost ruins to mysterious artifacts, then this is the game that has it all.I loved GalCiv 2 for its complex AI that made playing against the computer quite fun. Distant Worlds can accomplish this (more so if you use the Icemanza's AI mod). I loved the complexity of ship design in Star Ruler and StarDrive, and Distant Worlds meets half-way between the two to get something that doesn't feel overly complex (StarDrive) and something that makes it fun. Space Empires IV featured detailed ground combat and an impressive diplomacy/trade system. Distant Worlds features most of those features along with a ground combat interface that while you can't interact with it, you can 'influence' it by having ships in orbit of the planet your invading to bombard the enemy along with different troop types and generals.Endless Space wasn't something I enjoyed, I found it very shallow. But one thing it did good was the Heroes mechanic. Well, Distant Worlds does that and more with 'characters' that spawn within your empire. While I wish it wasn't so random, its still pretty cool to have. You can get ground generals, admirals, ship captains, scientists, spies and spawn leaders for your empire. It's really well done.For size, Stellaris is an impressive game and one that is realtime at that. Distant Worlds is realtime and while Stellaris offers 1000 star maps (I think?) Distant Worlds does one greater with 1,400 stars and has better late game functionality which Stellaris suffers from greatly.I'd wholeheartily recommend this if your into space 4x but I do warn you, you'll need a lot of patience to play this game and it will take sometime to get used to all the mechanics and complexities that it has.

												The first 4x game i played was Galciv2 here on steam, a latecomer i know but i have always loved the idea conquering a galaxy in any way i can through military might, diplomacy, whatever and galciv ticked alot of those boxes and when i say galciv3 beta i was so excited.....then i found this game.i have been blown away by this games ability to be utterly complex and so simplistic at the same time thanks to the automation system allowing you to play the game how you want to. i have only put 22 hours into this game but i am only on my second playthrough! my first was a learning experience and my second is a sandbox game to see how long i last with what i have learnt.PROS: totally immersive- thanks to automation you can be as involved in the game as you want to be, i play fully manual as i like to micromanage eveything, i understand this is not for everyone though.Easily Modded- you can find the modding guide on matrixgames forums that tells you how to mod their game! i personally play with the mod ""Distant worlds extended"" which brings the race total to 40! all with unique ways to play them and they can be fully played by the AI! it also adds amazing grapical art to the games existing races too. highly reccomend this mod.Complete Customisation:- customising the galaxy is such an easy experience in this game from choosing the size, number of stars, is it a spiral galaxy? a ring galaxy? you choose! you control how many pirates are in your game the list goes on! you can even set up where the enemy empires are in the map and their current level of development allowing for scenario play such as, eveyone starts at pre warp (confined to their solar system until hyperdrives are researched) except one race out there who were around first that already have an empire set up in the galactic core. you can even customise on the fly with the ingame editor!Real time: the game is an rts! you can pause and speed up time to play at a pace you like so you dont get overwhelmed (especially if playing without automation). but the best thing about the rts element has got to be the fact your private sector (that manages resources and tourism and trade for you etc etc) is always automated and cant be controlled by you, when you zoom in on a system and see hundreds of freighters going about their buisness it really makes the galaxy feel alive, and when you have 40 races on the map thanks to the extended mod it really is a busy place!Cons:- i personally dont have anything to say here, yes there are little things here and there but nothing that affects me playing the game in the slightest. i think the main thing that will get to people is the learning curve, it is steep...very steep. but i would reccomend watching tutorials on youtibe by ""das24680"" they helped me greatly, and just general lets plays of the game they really help you understand the games mechanics.i personally find the price reasonable AFTER playing the game, i bought the game on faith hoping it was worth the money and by god it was, i would reccomend watching all the videos you can before buying because it is an expensive game but universe is a collection of all the distant worlds games in one package and it will keep you entertained for untold hours if you are a fan of 4x games.

Some people may dislike the RTS concept, however you can pause and slow and quicken time, allowing you to play this game as if it were a turn-based game, yet also allowing for a sort of natural variety or uncontrollability that would come from commanding a real space empire. An enemy might attack one of your bases without warning, popping out of hyperspace, and you may not react in time or have any defense. The atmosphere of this game is extremely unique.If you ever get bored of the game, you can simply look around online and find many mods that allow you to play as many many more races, such as the Picard Era Mod allowing you to command the United Federation of Planets, or the various star wars mods or DWU Extended mods. There are mods that change how the game behaves and the AI's as well. The possibilities of this game are limitless.			"

												Let's get this out of the way: Stellaris! There, I said it. STELLARIS! One day, that game will be good. Great, even. But until that day... Imagine a Stellaris made 5 years ago that is now fully realized, fully developed, fully play-tested, and fully modded. Why wait for Stellaris? Play Distant Worlds: Universe now.I just started and will be happily learning the ropes for quite some time, revisiting this periodically for a decade or so. It's that good.Not convinced? Here's my final thought... I was playing my first game, leaving everything paused for about an hour looking at menus, reading galactopedia entries (If this does not sound fun to you, walk away...). I unpaused and made my first orders, and then started scrolling around the galaxy. When I scrolled back to my home system, I was immediately disoriented. Where is my home colony? The mining base I spent 10 minutes placing? The ships I put on guard duty at my home spaceport? Then I realized ... IT WAS ALL ORBITING THE STAR IN THE SYSTEM!I am going to forget about Stellaris for awhile and enjoy this one. Nice work, devs. Nice.			"

												Skip to bottom for Pro vs ConLet me start out by saying this game is the best strategy game I have ever played. After playing the entire total war series. Civ 5, Crusader Kings this game stands out. Why???- Because it allows you to mold the experiance to your playstyle. If you want to just control the military and let the AI control the rest you can or vice versa. The maps are huge as well and the AI is challenging but also diffrent races have diffrent play-styles some will try to create alliances, or trade empires while others will seek to dominate the galaxy.Something you need to take into account is that this includes all the DLCS. And they are worth itPros-Great ScaleGood AIVery Immersive for a strategy GameAddicting (maybe a Con XD) Allows you to play to fit your Playstyle ex. Pirate or empireGreat mods ex Distant Worlds extendedCons- Graphics are a little datedVery few modsPrice- Includes all DLC's (DLC's Add alot) Score 9.9Gameplay- 10/10Graphics-8/10AI- 9.9/10			"

												By far one of the best 4X titles I've ever played.  For those of you who wanted to love Master of Orion 3 for its depth but felt it ultimately fell short of greatness, Distant Worlds will live up to that promize in spades.Distant Worlds is simply staggeringly good.  From the economy--managing supply and demand of dozens of resources, building and protecting mining stations to keep them working for your empire, supporting your empire's AI-run private sector so they can shuttle your bits and bobs around while you tax them--to the shipbuilding, combat, and even espionage, this game pretty much hits all the high points of the games that came before it, and brings a few more things to the table on top of that.  Automation settings can be put anywhere from watching the game play itself to managing every single aspect of your empire down to the movement of every individual ship, various storylines can be enabled or disabled for a different experience, and each race has its own private win conditions that may or may not overlap with others in your galaxy.And on top of all of that, there's an active community both here and on the official game forums, for modding, tactical and strategic advice, or AARs.  A game's community may not seem like it's worth commenting on in a review, but trust me, you're going to want their help.  If there's any one thing this game has as a downside, it is a steep learning curve.  But a combination of watching how the AI works, listening to the AI advisors, and getting advice from fellow players will see you through in short order.If you are at all a fan of sci fi 4X games and feel there aren't nearly enough of them out there, buy Distant Worlds right now.  You won't regret it for a second.			"

												One of, if not the most, deep and engrossing 4x space strategy titles that I've ever played.  There's a whole shipload of options here from the getgo, from the galaxy size and shape, to if you want start out as a prewarp civ just starting to explore your own solar system, or just how nasty the pirate factions can be from the getgo.Speaking of, did you want to play as a pirate faction? Cause you can! Raid, pillage, loot!  Kick those boring little space civilizations in the teeth and take their resources!If you're daunted by the complexity, don't be too afraid to give it a chance.  There's a lot to learn here, but it pays off in spades by how it keeps you hooked once you learn it's tricks and secrets.There's much more that can be said to promote this game, but I haven't the time or the words to do it justice. Pick it up now or during a sale, and I wager you'll sink more hours into this game than almost any other.			"

												I've played this game long before it was available on Steam, back when it was sold on Matrix/Slitherine, so don't let the hours fool you. This is the DEFINITIVE 4x space game after so many companies promised gamers a good 4x space game. It's detailed, polished, an incredible amount of options and ways to play. Most importantly it comes from developers who really care about their games and are happy to help you on their forums. This version includes a great tutorial to ease you into the game, and to further make things easy to get going, there are loads of sliders to automate what you don't want to handle, that can be switched off whenever you feel comfortable. If you love 4x space games, you owe it to yourself to purchase this gem.			"

												I was tired of some other 4x games guiding me by the hand, and limiting my options. I don't like being given shape of a spaceship, nor the stock layout of weapons. No. I want to design my own ships from the grounds up. I want to be able to min-max my design and tailor it perfectly for the role I need. I want to create a perfect combined arms fleet utilizing multiple specialized ship designs. I want a frigate for chasing smugglers, and a more bulky frigate that can take some beating. I want them to have different shape. I want another one for point defense and a few carrier-corvettes.In Distant Worlds: Universe, I can. I am able to actually engineer my ships. I am able to modify existing mining stations, or civilian freighters' designs, thus forcing civilians to comply with set standards; pirates now have a much harder time looting a civilian mining station loaded with rocket launchers and fighter squadrons, heh heh heh.The possibilities are endless, and this is just station and ship design. Don't like designing? No problem, just set it to automatic, and AI will take care of creating and retrofitting designs as research yields new, more advanced components.I am able to ruin another empire by financing pirates in their sector, stealing research and inciting rebellion through my spies. I am able to assimilate/exterminate indigenous populations on newly colonized planets. I am ble to build a death star.All while trying to keep my empires' population happy, protecting civilian trade routes, befriending ancient sentient machines, exploring new systems, and researching new technologies.Distant Worlds: Universe is a 4x game with manual transmission. It has a steep learning curve, and the UI takes a bit time to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, you will feel the delicious power of total control over your empire. Conquest has never tasted so sweet.9/10 ( I would give it 10, but it might ruin your life. ) "

												Ah, man.This is tied with Swords of the Stars (original one, of course) for my favorite 4X, if not my favorite game. When people say that Distant Worlds is one of the best games made, they aren't exaggerating or lying - it truly is. The features are truly extensive, and the AI is actually intelligent - I've been outfoxed by it twice - even if it does have its failings.I personally think that the greatest feature about DW are the automation settings. It relieves some pressure on you by taking care of the small bits that you might not care for - for example, taxes and improvements - and there's also the potential for alternative game play, such for example playing as a starship captain. There's even apparently the possibility to automate literally everything, though I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you are really bored, haha!Now, for downsides...this game, as I said, is extensive, and even with automation its still a lot to take in. The resulting learning curve is pretty high, especially if you aren't used to 4Xs, and it'll take a playthrough or two to get a hang of all of the features. Its not for everyone, particularly if you don't have a decent amount of time to sink into this game, because believe me it does eat up time like no other game.If you do want to get it, I recommend getting exclusively the DW:U package, which has all of the expansions - its worth it, and there is a significant difference between expansions. I then would recommend getting the Expanded Universe mod, which further dramatically changes the game for the better.			"

OverviewDistant Worlds: Universe is an old school type 4x space sim. Don't expect high-end graphics and fancy user interfaces in this game. Instead you should expect a high level of functionality, strategy and interaction. Distant Worlds: Universe brings you a great deal of control to your fledgeling space empire where your bad decisions can really turn the course of this game around.PROsMany options for your new game. From galaxy ship, number of stars, pirates, starting tech, colonization rules and many many more options to play with.Great ship designer, again with many options. You're able to really spec out different ships for different purposes.Automation... EVERYTHING. You can basically run this game on autopilot and have the AI manage your whole empire. Or you can choose which things you want automated and which things you want direct control over. Don't like diplomacy? Automate it. Don't like colonization? Automate it. Automate your ship design upgrades? Why not! Every aspect CAN be automated. I like to automate things I don't like doing, like diplomacy. It's big. You can have an upper limit of 1,400 stars in game and the distances are closer to real life distances from star to star. This gives this game a nice realisim feel to it.Every ship counts! You'll feel the hurt if you lose that fleet. You have to think about fleet engaugements and if you can afford to move a fleet from it's position, or if you can afford to lose it. This is one of my favorite parts of this game.It's solid. It's been around for awhile and tweaked to the point where eveything works well with everything else.A ton of options for every part of your empire.CONsThe graphics are by far well below what you'll expect from games these days. Drop down menus are like the ones found in windows.Learning curve is moderate. If you don't automate somethings it can become very tedious.You'll probably get tired of building mining stations to supply your empire. This reduces a bit once you realize you should focus on resources that you don't have at that time.RatingAreaScoreGraphics3 It's noticably lacking in graphics. Windows norm with a lot of the menus. Ship animations are nearly non-existant.Gameplay8 Many different strategies will have you coming back to try something different.Immersion7 The level of strategy and the feel of lose, even from a couple of ships really puts eveything into prespective. The amount of options you have over your empire is staggeringValue6 With the lack of current day level of graphics and the $25 price tag are the only reason why this isn't higher.Overall6 Considerably higher if graphics are not a concern for you!ClosingDistant Worlds: Universe is a must have for any 4x space sim fan. If you're able to get past the graphics you'll have great times with this game. Start off with a small galaxy otherwise you may get overwhelmed!You can ether wait until it's on sale or buy it for regular retail. Personally I would buy it for the full retail because I wouldn't want to wait for it to go on sale. "

												This game is bad, the core game mechanics are broken, and the UI is horrible.I could write a long detailed complaint but it just boils down to this. The game provides almost no documentation for the core game mechanics like research, ship components, colony management, or the economy, and when you try to figure out how they work the game's UI is so bad it's often near impossible to tell what effect your actions have.This is by far the worst game I have purchased in years, possibly decades.

												This game is broken on the Windows 10 platform.  After performing the long list of recommended fixes for the issues the game was having, it still didn't work.  There are simply too many variables the developers have not taken into account. There are way too many redists to be installed.  There are too many driver updates, applications to turn on etc. Most of you probably want to play the game you just downloaded... not fiddle with your computer for  hours to see if you can get it to work. If you are running Windows 8 or 10....  skip this title.My thanks to Steam for the refund!			"

												I want to like this, but it's just too messy to get into. The complexity is intriguing, but what good is that if the game manages to lose me in 10 minutes? A somewhat better tutorial system and a thorough UI overhaul might be able to salvage DWU, but as it stands it's only something for people with a crapload of time on their hands, and the patience to learn for a few weeks before they accomplish anything.I'll stick to EU4 in the meantime.

Posted: July 9, 2014
												Quite simply the best sci-fi 4x RTS to date:As a GalCiv 2 and SOTS vet i can quite honestly say that this game overcomes the limitations of the aforementioned titles and then delivers more. For example, the AI of the individual races as your opponents or allies actually behaves in a way that gives you the illusion of distinct personality - rather than simply being the same algorithm with a different portrait and tech tree. Therefore, you feel that there is an RPG element to the game in the diplomacy and you can find genuine immersion in the 'stories' that are generated by your encounters with the other species that share the galaxy with you. There are 21 civs in this version of the game and some great mods available that add even more should want new challenges, which brings me to my second point.The graphical style of this game may be old school top down 2D sprites but the trade off is that the game is designed to be massively customizable and is extremely easy to mod. The only thing you can't mod at the moment are the 'space critters'. Add this to the fact that the game is huge in terms of the number of star systems and races that you can play against in any one game and you can quickly appreciate the decision to stay away from 3D. The emphasis is on highly complex gameplay (Dwarf Fortress comes to mind here? ) and large games involving many races and a huge galaxy WILL make your high end hardware chug like a snail on vallium so be warned :)Now to the gameplay and one of the unique features of this game that IMHO sets it head and shoulders above the competion: The sheer ammount of options available to you for customising the game to the experience that YOU actually want to play. Don't like the UI? Some of the symbols a bit obtuse? Change them. Want a totally hands on, complex micro management sim in which you have to babysit everything from diplomacy, espionage, exploration, tax rates, social policies, construction, economic and military research, resource exploitation and of course, galactic warfare? Or perhaps you see yourself as military stategist or an empire leader? Then you can automate just about every aspect of the game and only control those aspects of the genre that interest you. You can even go so far as to fully automate the game then sit back and watch the darn thing play itself for you! And yes, the AI in this game is advanced enough to do a good job so that you don't have to worry about it, which echoes my point earlier about the old school graphics - The effort has been put into the gameplay and in this regard, the game is about as advanced as you can get with current hardware.Regarding the complexity of the game though: The interface and the ability to find the piece of information that you require does leave a lot to be desired and the initial obfustication for potential and new players is compunded by the fact that the game plays in real time, although you can pause the game at any time and continue to que up orders for construction and unit movement etc. In this regard you should be warned that this game can not be decribed as casual and indeed, it has been described elsewhere as 'hardcore' and 'niche' - descriptions that i would have to agree with: It took me several games and a lot of experimentation to figure out how to issue orders effectively in 'manual' mode and to find the information required to make meaningful game decisions.I would therefore recommend that new players who are perhaps less 'patient' , or are not at least 4x strategy vets - to check out some of the excellent youtube guides out there. Automate most things for your first few games or at least set the AI to seek your approval before taking any action. Also read through the in game tutorials. They could be better but they at least do a reasonable job of taking you on a tour around the interface. They are not interactive though. If you are still struggling, then choose the introductory game as your first - it puts you in a very strong postion so that you have lea-way to make mistakes as you find your way around.Persevere beyond the complexity of the gameplay mechanics and the obtuse interface though and you will find a masterfully crafted 4x strategy experience on a huge scale, from playing the story arcs of the four expansions included in the Universe edition, to playing a sandbox game in which many 'stories' randomly unfold across the galaxy as you 'Roleplay' your way across the stars. Complexity and Customization aside - The one thing that i love most about this game, and the reason that i felt i had to write a review = You do not 'beat' this game, you just play it, and you become immersed in the jouney :DOne last note, but worth mentioning is that my steam profile does not relect the hours that i have put into this game because there is no DRM. You can run the executable without launching steam which is one less program sitting in memory :P			"

												Distant World Universe is a complete edition that includes all of the previous Distant World Games.  Universe also adds a wealth of new material for modders and playes alike.  Game play at first can really seem a bit overwhelming but the tutorials and many player made videos about this great game can be of great help to new players.  The galaxies, when set to maximum, are huge. I mean epic in scale.  Additionally there are nearly two dozen races, each with unique qualities, tech, ships, traits, and styles. Over all this game is one of the best 4x games since Space Empires IV and Gal Civ came along.  Well worth the investment.  The great thing about this new release is that the modding community will be able to do wonderful things .  Something to be very very excited about.			"

Tghinking about making a Futurama one...heheheh...Downsides are:price is pretty high for what it is m graphics are nothing special(it's all about gameplay), and maybe just a bit of a steep initial learning curve.But don't wory it's default setting is automated so you can kind of just puzzle out what to do watching the computer.Also really really wish it had multiplayer.

												Best in class - just about every gameplay feature has been polished over the past releases to end up with this. It might not have snazzy 3D graphics, but they would only get in the way. It has plenty of tiny detail and choices for micromanagers, balanced with fantastic automation - you can ignore the parts of the game you don't enjoy - spying, combat, keeping people happy, finances, whatever - without worry. And if you want to interfere later, or borrow a ship for a space adventure, or order an invasion, the game will take it in stride. Even the story stuff is pretty fun, not to mention all the times you write your own, like zooming in on a tiny moon and watching your colony  fend off an alien rebellion, having reinforcements jump in just in time to change the tide of a battle, having a spy succeed and finally locate a pirate home base, or just watch your trading empire spread out across the stars..

												Probably the best 4X I've ever played.  Most recent attempts at catching the spirit of MOO2 have either fallen too heavy on micromanagement or opted for an extremely limited but easy to use top-down interface. DW:U  approaches it perfectly by giving you a robust and confiugrable AI to handle the various elements of your empire (or all of it). At any time you can dial back how much automation you want and take the reigns on your civlization in whatever way you like while letting the AI take care of what bores you.  Top this off with random galactive events and discoveries and multiple story lines and it is worth every penny.			"

It has a somewhat steep learning curve but the automation helps greatly for easing you into the mechanics of the game.  My recommendation is to either check out one of the youtube tutorials or start playing the game with all automation options on then tick them off one by one to learn their intricacies.

												As a hardcore strategy enthusiast, this game is the best space 4x game ever made.  The size and scope and level of micromanagement possibilities are so refreshing in a genre and industry that tries to water everthing down and simplify things to ensure a larger playerbase (more profit).  If you enjoy the complexity and scope of the Paradox grand strategy games and Civilization games, do yourself a favor and get this game.For those that vehemently defend MOO2, yes it's one of the best games ever, but nostalgia bears no weight on my decision making and this game is objectively better, in that it is not limited by programming restricitons of the 90s.  I love it too, but can we please stop defending ""our childhoods"" (I was in the military when MOO2 came out)?			"

												Interesting real time empire space strategy...Good example would be the expansion of your empire without the need of populating a planet or solar system.Another feature that stands out, is that you can even play as the pirates or as a pre-warp civilization.A massive amount of empire regulating factors are available to the player and a huge star map to explore, one of the biggest I have seen so far in this genre. Each point in space you interact with, like a anomaly/blackhole/solar system, contains its own playfield in which multiple things can happen other then just battle or population.The cons however would be the ugly graphics and ugly/confusing UI...You can even see the pictures within the ui getting loaded like on a webpage (white background) when you initially start the game. If you can tollerate that, you will have a interesting game in your hands.That can give you a lot of hours of gameplay, and lots of different scenarios.			"

												This game is amazing.Beware though, it's very hands off. You CAN micromanage everything if you're OCD but if you also prefer to sit back and only make the big decisions while your private corporations and local administrators keep the smaller stuff running then you can do that too, and that's exactly what I do.Very very deep and complex.

												got this game from official website, started from legends version into shadows then just got steam key (of which i havent played on steam yet due to me still playing mass effect mod on non steam version)first of all THIS IS THE BEST X4 STRATEGY EVER MADE, BY FAR THE MOST INDEPTH!!!WARNING - it maybe to complex for some people with the scope of the game and depth, it is by far the most indepth game known to mankind! which can make it too complex for small minded FPS monkeys! :)you can do anything you can think of in the position of leader of your people.... it literally is a simulated universe that makes its own story. this is a review, so i will have to nit pick and find as much bad points as i possibly can just to make it fair. here we go....BAD POINTS:1) shadows versions pirates, they suck so bad i now play the game with pirates completely disabled, which obviously takes the pirates out of the game and takes from the game. i liked legends pirates, they were fair they were like propper pirates small but annoying if they wanted to be..... shadows pirates are just a puke of the game, they basically ruined the game with them by making the pirates into super strong impossible to beat annoyances that spam all over your empire and always are 9000.00% stronger than any empire and stronger than the shakturi..... so please, keep this in mind if your new to the game, pirates are perma broke!2) AI arnt too reliable to leave to automate your things, some parts are but other parts the AI screws up big time... like tax, they will ram your tax up if you make them automate it and you will never get enough population and your people will probably rebel! ....so dont be too reliant on AI to make smart decisions for you, it s only a AI after all.a few that are not problems that people will ♥♥♥♥♥ over.... ..... but i know alot of people whine about graphics.... this game has 2d graphics, it isnt a problem at all, infact i dont know why people ♥♥♥♥♥ so much as most strategy and simulation games that say they have 3d graphics look like 2d anyway... seriosuly you wont notice any difference!...im not adding complexity on bad points because that comes under depth and depth is a good point!now on to good points.GOOD POINTS:1) best x4 strategy/simulation game you will ever play, seriosuly you will view all other sci space x4 games as inferior copys once you play this!2) easy to mod.... seriously im not tech savy, im dumb, i cant understand code whatsever .... but even i can mod this game any way i want/feel like! it gives you full control if you look into how to do it, once you see how simple it is you can shape this game into anything, make the game how you want it! .... (which kinda gives you the ability to kill any bad points)3) depth.... oh my fecking gawd! you will NEVER find a game as deep as this, so much to do, even if you think you found everything to do then someone shows you that you can do other stuff! the game is a big sandbox of limitless possibilities for you to discover!...although that may also turn people off as some people can say its too complicated (well they would becasue all their used to is press one button to fire a gun on CoD! LOL4) shakturi! ...... nuff said! .... (basically the reapers of the galaxy)5) MASS EFFECT MOD!!! yes its awesome! yes it has shakturi as reapers! :)6) i spent 600 hours on 1 single game..... still had like a few hundred stars left to explore and the other empires were nowhere near defeated (infact i was in a decent 4 race galactic alliance) empires grow huge and so to does the scale of the wars.....i would love to list more.... but seriously im taking up too much space here and no one likes big ugly text walls so ill stop now before this gets too longbut one last thing, the price..... i dont know what most people moan about, it is the full game with all the expansions, if you got it from site before steam release you would have paid £40 GBP (which is like $80) PER EACH EXPANSION AND GAME!!!! ...... yes before steam release this game would have cost you well in the £200 GBP mark .... ($400 for you who dont  think of convert rates!)..... so your getting it for like £30 (and apparently in america paying the same as no one converts on steam!!!) so you get it for  a good £150 GBP discount as it is at the full price!!! so stop whining about the price cheapskates!

												Always been a RTS/4x fan, started way back in the days with a game called Fragile Alliance that probably almost none of you have ever heard of which is a shame, but enough about that :PThis game is so refreshing change from all the crap that ive played, last good sci-fi rts i played i think must have been the X-series (not rebirth, which i cant stand) I dont know if this helps in your decision of getting this game or not but personally i cant stand turn based games anymore, i got my fair share of that with the HOMM series so i did not like Master of Orion that much when it came out, for me its all about real time, of course the pause button is used quite alot in this game as i like to micromanage alot of the game, but the good part is you can auto it all if you want to....you can even set it to totally let it play by it self, with no interactions from the player. The UI could be abit better but as i understand it the game has been out for quite some time and the UI probably wont change much anymore as they already polished and changed it earlier.Dont get intimidated by all the text and options, once you play 1-2 games you know which of them matter and which of them you can just let it stay on automatic untill you want to min/max for you own playstyle, then you will need to change those.I have 90+ hours played on this game and i still have only finnished 1 game as i like to try hard settings, not to ""win"" them but for the challenge to survive as long as i can :)I highly recommend this game if your a 4x rts fanboy like me.

												The best single player space 4x grand strategy game since MOO2.  Maps can be from a few hundred systems to 1400+, the alien races have character, and more settings than you can shake a stick at allow you to play anything from automating everything and watching the computer play with itself, to running a single ship around, to running only the economy or only the military, to micromanaging /everything/.  There are optional events, a 'hero character' system, a ship-building system, a monster tech tree... Graphics are not spectacular but are tolerable - I don't generally play grand strategy for the graphics.This is a game I enjoy a lot.  It's not for everyone - it has a fairly steep learning curve, games (especially large ones) can take a long time to play, and balancing everything can be a lot of work - but it's definitely for me.  If you are a fan of space 4x games, this one is definitely worth trying.  Recommended.Edit 11/23/2016:Still the best space 4X, and probably the best game you've never heard of.Paradox's Stellaris is its closest competitor, and it may someday pass it (probably will eventually, with Paradox's track record of tweaking and improving each game for years), but it's not there yet.  If you like one, you'll probably like the other.'Wuff			"

												Caslon. Man, I need Caslon bad.Caslon is used as fuel for your ships. If you don't have any Caslon, your ships don't go anywhere.I used to have some. I told my advisor to build 6 Exploration ships, and since they are completely automated, as soon as they were built, they went out and found many planets, moons, all with valuable resources to be mined, and a gas giant planet that had some Caslon. So I told my Construction Ship to build a gas mine there. As soon as it was built, the private sector decided to build a bunch of freighters, which they paid me for by the way. The private sector started hauling Caslon back to my home planet. I didn't have to do anything. The private secor handles it.But some pirates came by and blew up my gas mine. Now I need to make some ships with lasers to patrol the Caslon source. The only problem is, I need Nekros Stone to build my lasers. And I don't have any of that either. My Nekros Stone mine got blown up too. So I need to design some new ships with railguns on them. I have the materials for those. In the meantime, I contacted some pirates who are supposed to be bringing me some Caslon.Man, I'm in a bad way here. I need some Caslon.			"

												Easily the most indepth Space 4x game on the market.   After recently playing both MoO and Polaris Sector, I found myself picking this game up.  This game, with mods for extra races granted, had all the depth and events I was looking for.  It had more in depth ship design, more in depth economy, a huge science tree, unique feeling races, huge scale.  Just did everything better.  I go back to MoO or Endless Space and it feels much more tiny in comparison.  Endless Space at least engages me with it's lore and well designed races.  Overall, if you're looking for a 4x itch to scratch, this game scratches it.  Overall 10/10			"

												It feels like I can't fault this game for realism, except that it might be too realistic. Which it isn't. Confused? So was I.To be quite honest, I don't quite grasp the mechanics of the game. Sometimes it feels quite liberating that the denizens of your budding Empire of Seth go about their business, carrying out your instructions as they see fit, and sometimes it feels like you're trying to drive a car, but you have this nagging feeling that the steering wheel should be attached to the steering column, not drifting about your back seat. Alternatively, this game sometimes feels what I guess driverless cars will make you feel like when they finally become a feature. So is it not a good game? Actually, it seems to be a tremendous game space based strategy game. And I've had some moderate success, but ultimately it is the kind of game I play for a day or two or three then put aside for another month or two before I return as Emperor of the Seth. And I'm fine with that. The game has depth. It needs some serious interactive expansive tutorials. It's realistic in that you literally are only a government, your people build and work on their own, your control is limited to governing and fleets. Refuelling sucks. This game is good. If you like 4x Space strats, this one is a must have if you can afford to buy it.			"

It gives you the scaleability to be as involved as you choose to be - a large portion of the game (well, everything essentially) can be automated... so if you just wanted to simulate your own little custom Empire you could.I could lose far too much time in this game, and I have a feeling I will - 11/10			"

												As of writing this I have played ~70 hrs in about 10 days... to say its a time suck would be an understatement.  All in all, do I like this game?  Is there a stronger word for yes other than 70 hours of absolutely?  I am a big fan of 4x real time strategy games.  I like games like Sins of a Solar Empire or the Civilization series (though Beyond Earth is not so great).  I am one of those players that appreciates a really long, epic game, where it is impossible to finish it in one turn.  I am that guy who plays a single game for 40 hours.  So, now that I have established what I like, I will explain why this game does everything I have mentioned.First of all, this is a truly epic game.  In games like Sins, positioning is important.  Relative position to star systems, natural enemy choke points, type of world, etc.  In  DW, this is a brought to a whole new level.  Positioning is so much more important, and yet not at the same time.  You must balance the quality of a planet and its location.  Colony worlds take time, hours usually, to become true powerhouses.  THe positioning of other empires may force you to investigate the positioning of less than desireable worlds to see a way to break out of your region of space to expand into newer, and hopefully more desireable, locations in space.Combat makes sense.  I will use Sins and Civ in this but the way Sins takes over a planet makes no sense.  Lets nuke the surface and then send people down.  YAY!  Radiation!  Civilization on the other hand, does things similarly to DW in that you must conquer an area by first subdoing the defenses and populace.  And yes, conquered worlds, and your worlds, can rebel and raise armies to overthrown you.  One gripe though is, logically, it makes no sense for a troop transport to land troops when there is a defending fleet or a defending station.  Also, the defensive buildings while nice, are not complete.  What about satelite grids?  What about planet based - upgradable structures such as starports.  While I appreciate the need to recruit troops the level of detail here is a bit lacking.As far as troops are concerned they are annoyingly realistic.  Invading a planet is always a risk as numerous factors come into play.  A defending force of 300K can be reinforced by the populace.  The loss of space superiority can see your forces dwindle, etc.  This challenge is refreshing and done, overall, quite adequetly.Automation.  THANK YOU!!!  When you first start, this will seem unneeded as it takes away from what is available at the start.  In the truly epic games however, I had times where the scrolling events feed could not keep up with current events.  Furthermore, with 20+ empires (on the largest map I had like 31 at one point, I kinda conquered three of them...), 10+ characters, 80+ star systems, 1 war, new colonization, 3 branches of research, expanding my mining capabilities, monitoring my allies, doing spy stuff, building bases and planitary facilities, handling internal problems (like a shortage of something), establishing forward bases, building new ships, etc, automation saved me.  The game gives recomendations on targets to attack, will automatically colonize planets, reserach techs, recommend which bases I build and where, upgrades ships, improves designs of ships, recommends diplomatic actions, etc.  The game gives me lots of depth to take over anything I want to at any time (while keep automation on, which I thought was a nice though) and also gives me the tools I need to not have to micromanage every aspect of my empire, unless I want to of course.I like the games take on pirates.  Very few games treat pirates (or bandits like in Civ) as a resource.  While clearly annoying, DW allows pirates to become something you may not want to be completly rid of.  They can smuggle needed resources to worlds, attack targets for you, provide interesting locations (which can then promptly turn into a trap), etc.  They add a level of dynamism to the game that many others lack.  You can even play as a pirate faction, how cool is that?Now, some gripes. First of all, I would like a recommended action when it comes to diplomatic decisions.  LIke when buying a tech, it tells me what the tech is doing but adding an option to view it in the tech tree would be nice.  When asking to trade mining stations, being able to view where they are (which you can do, but it is rather clunky to do so while the window is open, and you can't close it without answering it) and what resources you are trading, and if your empire is currently demaning those resources.  The game has all these advisors, but they only seem to speak up in seperate events, not within events to give you more information or provide a recommended course of action.When zooming to an event and if zooms out to galactic map level, it could do a better job highlighting which item on the map is being focused on.  When you have empires next to empires, systems next to systems, ship symbols, base symbols, etc, that information seems to be lost.Overall though, I truly enjoyed this game.  I will stop blabbing on now so you can buy it and enjoy it!			"

												This is a gratifyingly complex strategy game with satisfying depth and immense replayability. I would highly recommend it for fans of space settings, 4X, and those looking for a deep game that rewards investment.Distant Worlds: Universe engages with each of the four Xs in a variety of ways. Exploring, for example, is about discovering what your corner of the galaxy is offering you, which is potentially plenty: ruins, abandoned tech and equipment, pirates, planets filled with independent races, other empires, interstellar phenomena (black holes, super nova), glactically-significant locales. What's important is that this isn't just empty variety: there's a range of ways to engage with what you find, depending largely on what victory conditions you're aiming for. For a peaceful race, you might want to bribe the pirates not to attack you and pay them to introduce you to other races with whom you can trade, set up mining bases in unclaimed systems to fuel your expansion, and build resorts at those interesting ruins and exotic locales to both earn income and establish yourself as the predominant tourism empire in the galaxy (an actual race-specific victory condition). For an espionage-focused race, you might protect yourself from pirates through sabotage and defensive firepower rather than bribes, and incite riots and revolution to cripple your opponent's economy while destroying their research bases to prevent a technological advantage. There are more courses of action available to you in Distant Worlds: Universe than in any other strategy game I've played.The variety of races and victory conditions bears special mention. There's extra attention paid to crafting a race-specific experience: the difference in game play between various races seems far more significant in DW:U than most other games I've played, strategy or otherwise. The experience is shaped by the skills they offer, the kinds of significant figures they attract, the race-specific technology they have access to (which often synergizes well with general play style), and the race-specific victory conditions, which provide each game you play with direction while still allowing for flexibility. You can also tweak the weighting of various victory conditions in the game creation menu (one of many, many customization options) to allow you to shift focus as desired.With all these options available, the game is clearly complex. But I don't feel as though it's too complex. This is to a degree a matter of preference, but I think it's also helped by the game's useful tutorials and extensive automation options: you can micromanage as much or as little as you want, including providing rules of thumb for the AI to follow as it runs the nitty-gritty. It's a very effective and well-conceived, well-executed facet of the game that enables you to ease into it and calibrate your experience to your own personal level of OCD-ness.So in short, this is a great game if you don't mind complexity. If you've played the iconic Dwarf Fortress, I'd say this is 3/4s of its intensity, which is to say, deep, but more focused and well-developed in a particular vision of gameplay, rather than the utter sandbox that DF is. I would highly recommend this game to those looking for a game they can log dozens if not hundreds of hours into; I'm sure I'll hit the 100 mark sooner rather than later.			"

With this, you can manage large empires without too much management = more time doing watherver you like. The main problem with this game is the small diversity of startegies possible. There is only one: procreate and expand faster than your neigbours.			"

												This game scared me when I hit the “purchase” button. It was on sale, and it was one of those buys that I wanted to do because I was afraid to let the sale go by.Once I bought it, began playing, I realized how complex and big the game was. Took many hours to get a grip on how to operate the game, and do something that I felt was “the right thing to do”. I've played more than 43 hours as of this review, and the game has become a blast to play! The complexity of the game, makes it almost impossible to play without having most of the automation turned on. With that said, you can play and command parts of the game that you enjoy the most. Pilot ships, act the politician, be a pirate, its endless. In short, if you are not afraid to learn how to play an epic complex 4x game, I guarantee you'll have a lot of fun with this one. After playing for many hours, well worth $60 in my opinion, and a steal at any sale price.			"

												I wasn't sure if I had it in me to learn how to play this game. I am so glad I did. This game feels epic in scale while still very detailed, complex and deep. I started learning this game with a guide by Timotheus, explaining how to play it with turned off automation. This helped a lot to actually understand what aspects this game offers. While I am far away from knowing everything and I happen to come across quite a few questions while playing, its still a blast to experience all those aspects of the game.My background: Haven't really played any 4x games so far. Tried Galactic Civilization 3, played a little Master of Orion 2 and some time ago spent quite some time in EVE, which is different though obviously. Highly recommended game!			"

												A truly excellent game and a unique achievement in the 4x genre. Not only do you have the complete power to micromanage every aspect of your empire, from the tiniest ship to major policy decisions, you have the option to let the computer handle any aspect you don't want to control. This creates a lot of flexibility for the player in experiencing the parts of the game that are the most fun for them and reinforces the idea that the empire is a living system that you direct through influence rather than a series of chess moves.It controls in real time, and the resource, economy, military, and political systems are all very complex and there is always something to do. Each expansion has added tons of content, and with all of them available now, it stands out among other 4x for trying to innovate a stagnant genre. My only real criticism of the game is that it's very hard to understand the consequences of certain things, and diplomacy is pretty derivitave. If you are a fanatic of 4x space strategy games, I can actually reccommend this at full price. For anyone casually interested in the genre, I'd reccomend it on sale.			"

												great game. Designed for hardcore stategy fans but the automation system allows for a less steep learning curve.  The control and micromanagement can get a bit out of hand but it is a great game.  buy if you like 4x stratagy.  The universe expansion does not add to much but lets you buy a great game on steam so do so and be happy.			"

												This is one of the deepest and greatest 4x Space Games i know. I play it since the Original Distant Worlds a few Years ago, then with all expansions and now in this Version, it got everytime better and better. DWU added better Mod Compatibility, which you should use, there are some great Mods out there, which enhance the Gameplay.But back to this Game:You start with a small Empire, typically with only one World. There are many other Starsystems out there, most of them with one or more Planets and each of them can have a Moon or more. And some of them are colonizeable. So you will colonize them, but the big Problem is: You are not alone! There are other races which want to do the same thing. Well, you could let them and create a peacefully coexistence with them, or go to war. Or you dont declare War and send Pirates and your Spies. Or maybe, you could send your other Friend to go to war with them. Many possibilities, only the outcomes counts!Every game is different, you could play small Maps with only 200 Starsystems up to big Maps with over 1000 Starsystems. Well, it sounds maybe not to big, but it is! You could automate everything in your Empire, but managing a few hundret Systems can be a big Deal. Whatever, it is a very good Game, get it if you like 4x Games, especially Space Games. The only two big drawback is the somewhat old Graphics, and the step learning curve. The first isnt as bad as it sounds, the second will go away, when you play and learn how everything works! Get it, i promise you, you wont regret ;-)			"

												As of writing this I have played ~70 hrs in about 10 days... to say its a time suck would be an understatement.  All in all, do I like this game?  Is there a stronger word for yes other than 70 hours of absolutely?  I am a big fan of 4x real time strategy games.  I like games like Sins of a Solar Empire or the Civilization series (though Beyond Earth is not so great).  I am one of those players that appreciates a really long, epic game, where it is impossible to finish it in one turn.  I am that guy who plays a single game for 40 hours.  So, now that I have established what I like, I will explain why this game does everything I have mentioned.First of all, this is a truly epic game.  In games like Sins, positioning is important.  Relative position to star systems, natural enemy choke points, type of world, etc.  In  DW, this is a brought to a whole new level.  Positioning is so much more important, and yet not at the same time.  You must balance the quality of a planet and its location.  Colony worlds take time, hours usually, to become true powerhouses.  THe positioning of other empires may force you to investigate the positioning of less than desireable worlds to see a way to break out of your region of space to expand into newer, and hopefully more desireable, locations in space.Combat makes sense.  I will use Sins and Civ in this but the way Sins takes over a planet makes no sense.  Lets nuke the surface and then send people down.  YAY!  Radiation!  Civilization on the other hand, does things similarly to DW in that you must conquer an area by first subdoing the defenses and populace.  And yes, conquered worlds, and your worlds, can rebel and raise armies to overthrown you.  One gripe though is, logically, it makes no sense for a troop transport to land troops when there is a defending fleet or a defending station.  Also, the defensive buildings while nice, are not complete.  What about satelite grids?  What about planet based - upgradable structures such as starports.  While I appreciate the need to recruit troops the level of detail here is a bit lacking.As far as troops are concerned they are annoyingly realistic.  Invading a planet is always a risk as numerous factors come into play.  A defending force of 300K can be reinforced by the populace.  The loss of space superiority can see your forces dwindle, etc.  This challenge is refreshing and done, overall, quite adequetly.Automation.  THANK YOU!!!  When you first start, this will seem unneeded as it takes away from what is available at the start.  In the truly epic games however, I had times where the scrolling events feed could not keep up with current events.  Furthermore, with 20+ empires (on the largest map I had like 31 at one point, I kinda conquered three of them...), 10+ characters, 80+ star systems, 1 war, new colonization, 3 branches of research, expanding my mining capabilities, monitoring my allies, doing spy stuff, building bases and planitary facilities, handling internal problems (like a shortage of something), establishing forward bases, building new ships, etc, automation saved me.  The game gives recomendations on targets to attack, will automatically colonize planets, reserach techs, recommend which bases I build and where, upgrades ships, improves designs of ships, recommends diplomatic actions, etc.  The game gives me lots of depth to take over anything I want to at any time (while keep automation on, which I thought was a nice though) and also gives me the tools I need to not have to micromanage every aspect of my empire, unless I want to of course.I like the games take on pirates.  Very few games treat pirates (or bandits like in Civ) as a resource.  While clearly annoying, DW allows pirates to become something you may not want to be completly rid of.  They can smuggle needed resources to worlds, attack targets for you, provide interesting locations (which can then promptly turn into a trap), etc.  They add a level of dynamism to the game that many others lack.  You can even play as a pirate faction, how cool is that?Now, some gripes. First of all, I would like a recommended action when it comes to diplomatic decisions.  LIke when buying a tech, it tells me what the tech is doing but adding an option to view it in the tech tree would be nice.  When asking to trade mining stations, being able to view where they are (which you can do, but it is rather clunky to do so while the window is open, and you can't close it without answering it) and what resources you are trading, and if your empire is currently demaning those resources.  The game has all these advisors, but they only seem to speak up in seperate events, not within events to give you more information or provide a recommended course of action.When zooming to an event and if zooms out to galactic map level, it could do a better job highlighting which item on the map is being focused on.  When you have empires next to empires, systems next to systems, ship symbols, base symbols, etc, that information seems to be lost.Overall though, I truly enjoyed this game.  I will stop blabbing on now so you can buy it and enjoy it!			"

												This is a gratifyingly complex strategy game with satisfying depth and immense replayability. I would highly recommend it for fans of space settings, 4X, and those looking for a deep game that rewards investment.Distant Worlds: Universe engages with each of the four Xs in a variety of ways. Exploring, for example, is about discovering what your corner of the galaxy is offering you, which is potentially plenty: ruins, abandoned tech and equipment, pirates, planets filled with independent races, other empires, interstellar phenomena (black holes, super nova), glactically-significant locales. What's important is that this isn't just empty variety: there's a range of ways to engage with what you find, depending largely on what victory conditions you're aiming for. For a peaceful race, you might want to bribe the pirates not to attack you and pay them to introduce you to other races with whom you can trade, set up mining bases in unclaimed systems to fuel your expansion, and build resorts at those interesting ruins and exotic locales to both earn income and establish yourself as the predominant tourism empire in the galaxy (an actual race-specific victory condition). For an espionage-focused race, you might protect yourself from pirates through sabotage and defensive firepower rather than bribes, and incite riots and revolution to cripple your opponent's economy while destroying their research bases to prevent a technological advantage. There are more courses of action available to you in Distant Worlds: Universe than in any other strategy game I've played.The variety of races and victory conditions bears special mention. There's extra attention paid to crafting a race-specific experience: the difference in game play between various races seems far more significant in DW:U than most other games I've played, strategy or otherwise. The experience is shaped by the skills they offer, the kinds of significant figures they attract, the race-specific technology they have access to (which often synergizes well with general play style), and the race-specific victory conditions, which provide each game you play with direction while still allowing for flexibility. You can also tweak the weighting of various victory conditions in the game creation menu (one of many, many customization options) to allow you to shift focus as desired.With all these options available, the game is clearly complex. But I don't feel as though it's too complex. This is to a degree a matter of preference, but I think it's also helped by the game's useful tutorials and extensive automation options: you can micromanage as much or as little as you want, including providing rules of thumb for the AI to follow as it runs the nitty-gritty. It's a very effective and well-conceived, well-executed facet of the game that enables you to ease into it and calibrate your experience to your own personal level of OCD-ness.So in short, this is a great game if you don't mind complexity. If you've played the iconic Dwarf Fortress, I'd say this is 3/4s of its intensity, which is to say, deep, but more focused and well-developed in a particular vision of gameplay, rather than the utter sandbox that DF is. I would highly recommend this game to those looking for a game they can log dozens if not hundreds of hours into; I'm sure I'll hit the 100 mark sooner rather than later.			"

There is only one: procreate and expand faster than your neigbours.			"

You don't control every detail. In fact it would be almost impossible too, because there are so may things going on. There are also some great mods to this game, like the Star Trek mod that makes it feel like you are playing in the Star Trek universe. Each empire has it's own unque abilities, ships, etc.Definately worth getting. Check out videos on youtube to see how it plays.			"

												Incredible game, I d say best strategy ever. Dont let the poor graphics or complexity lvl of the game keep You for away from giving it a try. Game is very deep&complex, but one can choose lvl of complexity on his own preferences due to the automate option for lots of areas. I must say that for the first time in my 30yrs gaming history (which is from the days of early 80s and Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum games), I really feel like emperor or whoever is in charge of one space empire. U can be lazy emperor and automate all or some(in which case AI might do good&bad things), on the other hand if You really want succesfull empire You need to work...Big plus are community mods so the Start Trek and Star Wars lovers would really have a great time playing. Speechless that this sort of game is made and cant wait for DWU2			"

												I've played this game and all of it's expansions to date (Not on steam but on the stand-alone version for a few hundred hours, please ignore the steam play time), but now it is finally available as a single package on steam.This is by far THE BEST 4x strategy game. It has an impressively steep learning curve but the payout is unrivaled. You start as a custom civilization beginning its trek into the solar system and follow your own path to an intergalactic empire. Ships are fully customizable, technology trees are vast and unique, galactic events and alien ruins can change the course of the game, and diplomacy and contact with new races breathes depth into the fictional universe.Don't be dissuaded by the 2D graphics, the combat and action scales immensely as you expand and soon you will be ordering multiple fleets around the galaxy, conquering star clusters and invading planets across the stellar terrain. All the while you will be managing your government style, taxes, espionage agents, diplomats, scientists and fleet commanders to flex the strengths of your civilization.If you like the depth of civilization V, galactic civilization 2, or any game along those lines, seriously consider purchasing this game. You might have to watch some ""Let's Play's"" and do some manual reading with a test game or two to get your feet under you, but after you learn how to play this game will bring hundreds of hours of replayability and strategy. The Distant Worlds Universe expansion also brings about impressive modding capabilities so it is likely that the community will expand this game far beyond what the developers could have imagined.Do yourself a favor and plunge into your own Universe.

												I have little to say that isnt said already. I am a huge fan of 4x grand strategy games. From MOO to Space Empires to GalCiv  or basically any Sid Meir or Paradox title. This game is the most engaging title I have played in the genre since Space Empires. It is everything we were hoping MOO3 would be. You can micromanage to your hearts desire but to me, I love the fact I can macromanage on the scale originally promised by MOO3. A multiple page options screen allows you to set your imperial policies wherein the AI will lovingly (and intelligently, by the way) follow through to your commands. You can have the AI automanage everything based on these policies if you choose but it will always loosen its grip when you click a ship you want to control or research you want to do in order to let you guide it. It truly is breathtaking with the level of detail you can get down to. I specifically started as a human colony pre hyperdrive technology and have been having a lot of fun in an ancient galaxy. Watching my empire build from fledgling to become a colonial power has been quite fun. The game is not new, but before you go on about the price i would note that this version of the game includes the base game plus over a hundred dollars worth of expansion content AND a new batch of content for the Universe version. The possibilities are endless with regards to what you can do. Want to be a pirate king? A human diplomat? A Spy Master? Fleet Admiral? Corporate Profiteer? You can do all of that and more, and have the AI cover the parts of the game you dont like... or be a hands on emperor and manage it all yourself! One more thing. For fans who have ever played Star wars Supremacy (Rebellion, in the US) there is finally a game we can go to! The mission system and personal stories of the characters harken back to that game (As well as MOO) a LOT. Youll be quite pleased!			"

												So you've seen/heard about/are looking into this game, yes?First off, note that it does go on sale for 60% off very regularly but only for a few seconds at a time. You might want to wait.Next up, you might hear people talk about things like ""play without auto"" or ""I don't wanna play without auto"".These people are to be disregarded. Play without auto at each game's start so you can adapt to things and get settled in, but it's kinda daft to not automate an exploration ship when exploring 50-60 asteroids. I think it has something for everyone, but you should follow two guidelines while playing this AT ALL TIMES:1. Never be afraid to experiment with everything. Don't wonder what would happen if you built a science academy in every colony, JUST DO IT! You can demolish them later. Don't wonder what would happen if you built an escort with only EMP and Ion weapons, make ten fleets of fifty (this is acutally an appaulingly OP strategy if your enemies don't have EMP sheilds yet/ haven't redesigned their fleet to beat yours)! Don't hesitate to go beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your closest ally for building on that asteroid you liked! IT WAS BLUE, IT WAS SPECIAL!2. Start with all the automation OFF and do it in Shadows with trash-tier starting tech. You will need all your irons in the fire to understand which aspects you like best. All of them. If you need help, http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=3508583 is there for you. "

												I honestly think anyone who's a fan of space 4x and paradox style strategy could find something to love in this game. I got it recently and literally lost my entire weekend to being absorbed it in. That hasn't happened since I was a kid.The systems are quite complex, it's got a bit of a learning cliff. Sure you can automate everything but if you don't understand what the settings do then everything falls apart a little. My biggest criticism would be how obtuse some things are. I'd highly recommend spending a couple of hours watching guide videos or reading about systems (Das Tactics on youtube has a great series, and the subbreddit is quite helpful). If that sounds like the kind of effort you're willing to put in to stop being hopelessly confused then this is the game for you. It's scale is amazing, the stories that come out of it are brilliant. You can go from being a civilisation just stretching its wings in a large and hostile universe to deploying planet cracking weapons against intergallactic supervillians. You start as a galaxy spanning empire and police/nuture your favourite empires to greatness. There's really not a lot of ""point"" to the game, victory is achieved by simply being the most awesome at everything with a little bit of flavour for race. The joy is in the simulation depth and the emergent stories as you set about doing whatever it is you want to do. Hell you can turn victory conditions off and just mess around if you like.Once you understand how to get things flowing smoothly to create the kind of game you want to play with the automation there's a little bit for every tactics/strategy gamer in this. Diplomacy your way to galactic peace, engineer hyper efficient ships, steal lie and plant chaos, raid, commit genocide, micro to your hearts content and win battles through abusing range mechanics, bored ships, screw with trade lanes, optimise logistics, kill a leader.. the list goes on.And when you've exhausted all the different starts and play styles that might be fun, play as a pirate nation or install one of the amazing mods and do it all again!

												I must say, this is one of the best real time 4X strategy out there. Having the ability to automate the hell out of this game is what makes it so good. You can allow AI to do the stuff automatically while you just make important decisions and watch your empire grow. Anytime you can interfere and micromanage something yourself. Or you can manually control all of your empire in a huge galaxy. Learning curve is steep, but as long as something is automated, AI will make sure to do it right (most of the time) and you will have time to learn.This game is moddable and there are already mods like Star Wars theme that adds races, planets and ships from that universe.If you are into 4X RTS, hurry up and buy this game while it is on sale!

												Edit: I fixed my issues somewhat by changing some settings in Windows (I changed my display scale from 100% to 125%). Even so, I hope there is a real fix one day. ---This game is THE perfect space 4x game. Just be aware that it has a built-in bug that causes the ingame text to look blurry and illegible on 1080P or above screens that are 17"" or below in size. The ingame text looks god-awful on my laptop, and while the game is everything I wanted it to be content wise, I still am deciding to give it a thumbs down in order to get this message across to the devs and any potential buyers.  So if you have a gaming laptop, just keep in mind that this game does have a bit of a font/text bug that may or may not be fixed in the future. You might be able to live with it, but it's difficult for me, and this is coming from someone who has put hours upon hours into other 4X games and MMORPGs. Normally my eyes are just fine staring at a screen, but they were just super strained by this game. Based on what little I played, I definitely think this game is THE definitive space 4X experience. Just make sure you either have a large screen, or a laptop with a lower resolution. Otherwise, you might end up with tired eyes after about an hour of gameplay.			"

												I will keep this short, I love 4x space strategy.  This game has a ton of options to automate everything, but I found the AI to be especially lacking in combat so you will have to avoid such automation.  Generating funds is not done well by the automation either.    So in the end you have to turn a lot of that automation off too which in the end become burdensome.Pirates plague the spaceways and while you can protect yourself from them, but it is exorbinantly expensive.  You cannot keep a big defensive fleet(s) because you will go broke.  You cannot protect your planets from pirates well as the defensive systems will also cause you to go broke.  If you don't check the pirates they will severely effect your economy.  And we have not even mentioned conflicts with other races.  One of the other posts mentioned you can go from large cash flows to negative ones quickly and that is an understatement.   This game can be frustrating to play mainly because your income can vary extremely fast.  I don't play games to be constantly frustrated.  If they ever get around to tuning up the AI this could become a fun game, but at present, you really have to micromanage everything.			"

												Horrible resoultion, horrible fonts, boring graphics. People will claim that because the game renders hundreds even thousands of worlds that the graphics need to be crappy to ensure the game runs one computers.  The game is 4 years old and sells for more then  a large majoriity of new games here on steamIt comes from a company that is known to be expensive and is unknown or niche. They have games like Eastern Front II made in 1999'ish and slap on a new title  ""Tiller something or other"" and  patch it and sell it for upwards of 30-40 dollars depending on physical or digital copy.People will claim it is the best money they have ever spent on a game and perhaps it is true but the experience of paying 60 dollars for a 4 year old game and its expansion ( 1 which is a recent expansion) should be warnjing enough.Only hardcore x4  strategy fans of this specific genre who dont care about graphics will truly have a chance to enjoy the game to its fullest.

												Pros: Good gameplayDepth/complexityHours upon hours of funCons:The priceGame's technology feels basic and out of date: event windows judder on to the screen rather than smoothly scroll; when you open screens to view stats you can see the screens being built, interface element by interface element; screens use standard Windows scroll bars, comboboxes etc. which feels really cheap and nasty.

												Waste of money...you either fully automate and WATCH your empire or unautomate portions or all of the facets and get lost in the confusing and unresponsive game mechanics.  The tutorial does not let you do anything...it just tells you what things do but when in an actual game the controls do not function or do not do what you would expect them to do.  You either get bogged down in minutia or bored to tears because you can't control anything.  If you like SIMS Solar System this is your game...if not find something better to spend your money on.

												Ok, almost 20 hours in on Steam so I can try to review this game. Let me start by saying I'm not new to strategy games and 4x games. I prefer mostly turn based games and some pausable real time strategy games (HOI, EU and Total War).I do prefer to play hostorical and fantasy games in the genre mostly but lately looking into space genre as well.Distant Worlds is on my disk for over a year now and I never really got into the game for any reason.This changed when I bought Stellaris. For one reason the interface in Stellaris, the manual and the ingame tutorial does a wonderful job of explaining the game mechanism. It was always very clear what to do and how to do it. Maybe a little bit too much in Stellaris at the moment of writing. The game looks a bit streamlined to me and even when starting a comlpletely new map with different factions it feels like I've seen it before.There is too much I can sum up in Stellaris what is perfect and I expect some DLC from Paradox to give the game more depth in the future. I wait for them before reviewing that game anyway.My review for Distant Worlds isn't a vanilla version anyway. Since you can only choose to buy this version of Distant Worlds there are many DLC and patches already in it. This is a kind of Gold version for the game and I didn't the played the vanilla. So fair enough to not compare them. Stellaris can overgrow the sublimity of this game in the future, but they should work very hard to achieve that.Distant Worlds when I first started it is was like watching some electronic manual with hundreds of numbers and symbols on the screen and I felt overwhelmed quickly. The old fashioned text based tutorial didn't do it's job for me as well and to start just playing from scratch without any knowledge of the mechanics seems almost impossible.It was because of some depth I missed in Stellaris that I got back to this game and because I learned the genre in Stellaris I finally knew how to start playing DW.It's all about keep your city happy, mine or trade imortant resources, design and buy ships and explore the universe.What I learned very quick is that there is so much micro management involved in this game that even in the games standard settings most of them are already set to automatic. You eventually get a warning when some building is finished or ships are engaged in battles, but the trading, mining and developtment of most of your ships and bases is done automatic. You still can set everything to manual but you will be happy you are able to automate some of them after a while.The universe is very diverse. You can choose from a decent amount of races (all those stats you can read at the store page yourself) and what is nice that every race you can set or choose a random form of goverment as well. Those traits influences happiness and research rates for three different research paths to follow.You can assign leaders to specific tasks (general in spaceship, supersmart professor etc) and you can manually build, design ships in the ship designer. While I have to say that designing is mostly about stats. I didn't feel to change that single sprite that represent your spaceship (and every other spaceship in the universe) one time in my 20 hours into the game. Maybe just because there was enough other things to do.But the design of the content of the ship is very deep and all of those components are made of many different resources you have to find.When you look at your star or the moons where you are started you see a standard cosmos with plantes we see in many other games. You can zoom out to see sectors (names A1, A2 etc) and you can zoom out more to see the universe build out of 400 to 1500 of those star systems randomly generated of with custom made maps.The universe is gigantic, but not unlimited. I think No Mans Sky was the first who delivered this, I love to see this in a space game next time as well.Also the grpahics aren't that good. As I said the ships and bases are just plain 2D sprites. Not even animated. Explosions are nice, but no 3D presentation of space fights.The interface is helpful when you know how to use it, but far less fluent then the UI in Stellaris. It's a lot of clicking and choosing from multiple buttons to achive just one simple thing. I was searching forever for example how to upgrade my small starbase to a medium one and still did not find it after 20 hours in the game.But the amount of planets, all the different races, many different stories and random events you encounter, over 40 kind of resources instead of 3 or 4 in most games and the depth of design is very good.For a 4x space enthousiast I think most reviews are right that this is still the emperor of the genre. I did not played any game in this genre which was so rewarding after you know how to play it.			"

												Fantastic game, however it does not run on Windows 10 which keeps me from recommending this terrific game to others.EDIT: Thinking about buying DWU? Dont. Buy Stellaris instead, it is deeper, better UI, better events, better exploration, and the best of all - Paradox is going to keep the game updated and supported for years to come. DWU's developers basically left this game for dead with no patches for the many bugs and crappy UI. I suggest buying Stellaris, it is CHEAPER runs BETTER and has CONSTANT SUPPORT!			"

												The most complex, so far, pausable space 4X I have ever played.  While the graphics will bring to mind Master of Orion 2, the play is deep.  Recommend watching Let's plays.  The entire game can be automated, aloowing the player to control as little or as much as they'd like.  There is also a good story.			"

												Distant Worlds is a phenomenon in itself; it is already a cult classic. The learning curve is steep and game UI and functions may seem rough at times. Don't let details like that fool you, because underneath, we find the best 4X games ever created and one of the best strategy games in history overall. I've been playing the game since late 2012 and been spending more hours with this than any other strategy title in recent years. I learned the basics of the game through watching YouTube videos and then I did my own epxerimentations to find my preferred gaming style. There is no one single winning gaming style in this game; you can play it however you feel comfortable and there are a thousand different ways.The game satisfies many of my strategy needs. I can be a ruler of a grand space empire, dealing in politics and diplomacy, and/or I can take direct command of my fleets and see them fight out the battles against opposing space empires in real time. I can pause the action at any time, to take a look at all the details of what is happening; analyze and perfect my ship designs according to how well or not they perform in battle. It is even possible to not deal with battle at all; with a good eye for diplomacy, I could succeed in winning the game by avoiding warfare altogether and playing a peaceful empire. Indeed, if I wanted it, I could let the automation run the whole empire around me, while I controlled only one single ship!Automation and AI is in focus. I'm not a true micro-manager, so I just leave the AI to handle certain parts of my empire that do not interest me. If the AI screws up, I can easily go in and manually order the building of that mining station on the polymer-rich planet that I need. The galaxies generated by the game are huge: Up to 1400 stars, most with several orbiting planets that may or may not contain valuable, extractable resources or other secrets. Soon, you'll have an empire with thousands of ships buzzing from planet to planet with the private sector taking care of transport of passengers and goods; mining stations, defensive bases, enormous star bases on your most important planets, and military ships and exploration ships going around protecting against pirates, border incursions or just out exploring distant star systems to find new resources. The immersion is immense.Don't expect the outer polish of an AAA title, but do expect the complex, intricate inner mechanics of a truly great 4X title. The gaming community has been wanting a detailed, sophisticated strategy game for years and has been loudly proclaiming that it's tired of streamlined super-commercial games with focus on graphics and expensive DLC. Well, here it is. If you're not up for a real man's game like DW, then go play some AAA graphics focused COD in space instead, there are lots of them already. Otherwise, come join the cult phenomenon that is Distant Worlds.			"

												A fascinating 4x game.   The steep learning curve is definitely worth the time investment.  This game is its own take on the genre and defies comparison to other space 4x games.  The huge galaxy feels alive with pirates, raiders, monsters, abandoned ships, ruins, etc.  The 2D graphics are quite charming as well.  Solar system are actual solar systems, and you can have up to 1400 of them. However, this unique game has some unique frustrations.  Several systems are needlessly complex.  For instance, I can't stand building a new fleet only to have the newly built ships automatically decide to go on a mission far outside of my main territory and run themselves out of fuel.  Also when building a fleet, I don't see why I have to order new ships in the building manager, then go into the ship manager to find those ships and assign them to a new fleet, then go into the fleet manager and rename the fleet and set its orders!  That can get awfully tedious when I want to build and maintain a large number of fleets - why can't I just order a fleet from the fleet manager?  Another good example of needless complexity is the resource system.  There are dozens of resources - maybe even hundreds.  It's tough to tell what's important and why certain colonies have the resources they need and other's don't.  So many resources adds nothing but complexity.  There are other low points as well.  When I have a large fleet that needs refuel and repair, it can take a really long time as they all queue up in the same busy station when other stations are available even within the same system.  The ship designer is inferior to both GalCiv2 and Master of Orion - and you have to fight with the automated system if you want to make your own designs.  In fact, tech upgrades come so fast that you'll want the automated system on for the most part, but it would be nice to insert my own designs without turning off the automation, making the ship, then needing to turn it back on.   Also combat balance is not that interesting - as in many 4x games the biggest ship with the biggest guns is the only class you really need to build.  It would be nice if any 4x game had roles for all ship sizes from the smallest escorts to the largest battleships even in the late game.  The music is good, but I wish it were context-sensitive.  It is odd to have pulse-pounding music when I'm just waiting for my spaceport to be built.    However, overall this delightful game is such a great take on the 4x concept that in spite of the frustrations, it is well worth the time.   Recommended for fans of the genre, but not for the faint of heart.			"

												I find this game to be less of a traditional 4x game, and more of a ""Space Empire Simulator"". You only control the government / military aspects, while the civilians go and do whatever it is they want. It definitely gives the game a Living breathing feel to it. (Something I find is lacking in most 4x games.) Much of the complexity is easily over come by the automated features, or your advisors recommendations. If you are into the 4x genre, it's worth the price tag. If you bought the game in the past, you can get it discounted by $10 for each game/expansion you own at Matrix's website.			"

												Immersive, with a lot of layers of complexity.  Expect your first few games to be a bit frustrating as some of the controls aren't intuitive, so you will have huge holes in your empire that the AI will exploit to begin with.  But immense fun, once of the best games I've seen in this genre.  Just won my first game finally now I've got my head around the controls, and victory came without feeling like a grind at the end.

												I rarely review products I buy on steam but I have to weight in on this one as it was such a pleasant suprise. To my shame I had never heard of this game despite being a huge fan of Civ 4 and Sins. The customisation and depth of this game are truly unparallelled. It allows you to free your imagination and play whatever story arc you wish, from simple captain to God/Emperor of a pan galactic civilisation. Those that complain about the UI just need a bit of time to get used to it. I have had no problems understanding what fleets want to do and what bases need. The only limitation has been the multi-threading ability of my brain. As another reviewer stated, only when you play this game, do you realise what other 4X games have missed.			"

												THE Definite 4X experience.Why, let me point out a few reasons.1.  There is no 4x game in existence that gives the sense of life like DW:U does, all the civilian ships running around, your escort ships, your fleets standing at the ready, gives a definite sense that this is a living universe.2.  It is almost always challenging in some way.  Earlier games I have played (and I've played down to the oringal Master of Orion) usually have a point where it's no longer a challenge.  This game rarely has that (at least not till very close to the end).  There are always pirates, another empire, or the great destroyers to worry about.3.  Deep ship design, there are many different types of weapons and other components to place on your ships, that only thing missing here is firing arcs.4.  Good AI, AI is usually very good, most games I am more middle in the pack for most areas (yet still competitive).5.  Pirates, there be PIRATES.  LOTS OF PIRATES.  And probably a lot more, but IMHO, this game is amoung the top 3 best space 4x games ever made.  Save your money, it is worth the price!			"

It would be nice if any 4x game had roles for all ship sizes from the smallest escorts to the largest battleships even in the late game.  The music is good, but I wish it were context-sensitive.  It is odd to have pulse-pounding music when I'm just waiting for my spaceport to be built.    However, overall this delightful game is such a great take on the 4x concept that in spite of the frustrations, it is well worth the time.   Recommended for fans of the genre, but not for the faint of heart.			"

												Easily the best 4X game I've played. It's real-time pausable, and has it all: grand strategy, ship designs, huge research tree, deep modding, everything from fighters up to planet destroyers, random events, diplomacy, economy, troops/invasion, borders/territory, fleets. And you can easily let the AI handle the parts you dislike, and handle the parts you like on your own. I love this game so much.			"

												While I'm still learning everything, this game takes the cake for me. I have always enjoyed the idea of 4x but felt constricted when it came to most of them. This game is more simulation than it is game, and that's why i love it. Sometimes the galaxy you start in is completely unfair. Sometimes the there will be space monsters nearby your base, sometimes you'll have a hard time because you aren't near the right resources. The few games I've played so far pose new challenges each time. It's a fun game. It's expensive so you'll definitely want to do some research to decide if this is right for you but I am loving it's level of depth. Everything can be customized and made to play the way you want. The parts you don't want to deal with can be automated.Edit: Looking back at this review, I have now accrued over 240 hours. This is the best 4x I've ever owned and it is one of the best games I've ever played.It's a big price tag but you should give it a shot.			"

												So I've just finished my first game - It's fantastic.Well, it wasn't my first first game. I spent my first hour or so getting mauled by pirates and figuring out how to deal them as well as getting out to colonize some worlds.It takes a few hours to get used to the interface and the mechanics (Fairly certain I've not even touched 10% of the mechanics) but eventually it clicks and it becomes completely enthralling. Encountering different alliances and races, bullying out poorer empires for resources and kicking back and exploring the galaxies. It's absolutely massive.The automation is pretty cool as well, there were points were I didn't want to deal with the economic side and just go messing around other peoples territory, there were other times where I got smashed and figured I better know how the economic side works. You have the freedom to automate or determine a lot of your gameplan.Alas, In my first game I managed to incur the wrath of the Ancient Guardians (I think we had some contested bases) and I was well and truly put in my place (I didn't find/trigger the Shakturi).Pros -It's massive. Incredibly indepth, I've not even scratched the surface.Being aggressive is incredibly fun, but the slow, methodical economic route is also pretty fun too.You can even be a pirate, rather than a budding empire.Music was pretty immersive too.It's currently -17% off and supposedly this game ran for $100+ without the expansions.Supposedly there's a story, so you get to enjoy that too.Automation, so you can leave the stuff you don't want to do to the AI and you can get on with what you want.Cons -You will get smashed before you figure the basic things out. (Pirates are pretty brutal, do the tutorial!)The game has a relatively steep learning curve, but it's nothing a few games won't sort out.The UI can be a little.. messy.Overall, I'll probably end up spending a ton of time on this. It's pretty fun and especially worth the money now that you get the expansion content at this price.			"

												This is a great game. I've played the rise of the Shakturi Expansion a lot before and decided that the extra expansions would be nice to have, so I got this version from Matrix 50% off when a friend told me it was on sale. This is an RTS empire building simulator, in space, where you can control a lot of aspects of your empire in ways that most games dont' mix successfully. You have a certain amount of ship design ability, complete military control, research control, ecnomy control, taxation, colonizing, resource management and acquisition, spys, diplomacy... and so on. You can also AUTOMATE  all of those things (and just watch the computer play, it's more amusing than you might think) or none of those things, IDIVIDUALLY.			"

												""It's about time, it's about space""  This is a great game. As has been said, you make it as difficult as you want or not---and concentrate on what you want to do. I'm not half as smart as the people who usually write these things but I have to say.....what a great game. Wave that beginners (noob) flag and dive into easy modes, completely micro-adjusted to your mood. Pirates are a big P.I.T.A. so adjust their power and control to how you feel like dealing with them. Buy this game--- absolutely. Buy it on sale --- better yet. Still, this is one of those games that will literally rob you of sleep, LOL. There is so much intricacy, so much detail, it can be over-whelming. I watched Youtube videos which I found helpful. One from a guy who didn't seem he knew what he was doing but what the hell, neither did I. Another Youtube vid by a guy who made mods and he (Das.....), I enjoyed listening to. On the edge with getting this? Get It! It's very user friendly.			"

												Very Nice strategy game.This game is in the style of Master of Orion, but with quite a bit of difference. You start with one planet pre or post warp as you choose. You try to expand in the universe by colonizing and conquering other planets. The difference is that there are a crapload of planets in the universe. At least 50% or more are not colonizable, but it still leaves an immense possibility of an empire! You can have around 16 opponents against you(just to show you how biiiiig the universe is) and your'e not even crowded! Plus the damn pirates who makes your life interesting until you stamp them out. And they are tough!You can design all the ships and bases in the game. You can research new technologies which improve or add new components to the ships. Some special teks are race specific to give some flavor to each race. You can change your government, which actually matters a big deal and there are a lot to choose from. You also got a boatload of ressources (i think there are more than 15 of them) that you need to get to build your bases and ships. For that you must build mining bases.Now the big peculiarity in this game is that EVERYTHING can be automated. Actually, you can put the game on full automatic and just watch it play itself! All ships can be automated to play their role, to be included in fleets as they are built and to attack or defend automatically without your intervention! Even the colonisation can be fully automated. They actually colonise better than you would manually. The idea here is that when you start playing the game, you're better off with most things automated and as you become more acquainted with it, you can decide what to keep automated and what to put on manual. You even have an in-between step that suggest to you if you want to do something(i use it for colonization and spying). You have to understand that you can eventually have more than 1000 ships in hundred of fleets so just managing them all manually would drive most peeps insane, so the automatisation is there for you! The other big thing in this game is that you don't go fetch the ressources you need! You got private sector ships to do the job for you but they build their ships at your starport (and pay you for building those ships with your designs!). You only build and control the state ships which include warships, constructor, colony, explorer and troops ships. Bases too can be built by the constructors and colonies. So you pay maintenance only on those ships. The private sector will pay its maintenance on their ships. What you do when you reaaaaally want a ressource is to build a mining base on the planet of that resource. The private sector will send cargo hauler to it to fetch that resource.So the game is played mostly at a grand strategy level and not at a ship level. The battles are quite simple affairs that basically come down to who got the bigger guns, shields and armor = win. The graphics are 2-D for all the ships and bases. The view is top down. You don't play this game for graphics. The music is actually pretty good. The game is tough to learn and can last a very long time if you want to conquer everything (but you don't have to there are victory conditions that make you win the game much earlier than total conquest). the diplomacy is pretty good with lots of choice and the ai is not completely insane either compared to other games diplomacy.Also, with universe, you get something close to 4 games in one! You can even play as a pirate faction which function quite differently from the other empires! You can also play a fleet admiral or captain of a single ship. You can also play the game mode for spying only!!! That one is quite intriguing i must say.The game is well supported with many patches already since i bought the game so this is very nice.			"

Want to build up a massive mercenary/pirate  organization? You can do that too. While I enjoy it,  I dont believe its worth the price its currently at on here.

												It is a 2D stradegy game with alot or little as granularity as you want. There are as many ways to play it as races and factions, each with there own objectives. I recommend being very particular with your race/faction as that will be how you need to play.. in order to win. The great thing about this game is the policy that enables you to either be as involved as you want or just sit back and watch only interferring when tottally needed.If you just play the game to win, it works fine. If you play sandbox with victory conditions turned off, or continue to play after you win it eventually crashes. The code looks like a memory leak.. or perhaps it is restricting itself and crashing that way because it seems to be only 32 bit. Each time I crashed I hap about 40% of the galaxy under my control.The built in cheats are great. They allow you to munipulate the basic variables without having god like powers.Given the limitations of the memory leak, you will never see the entire story line. It will still give you hours of fun, and perhaps they will fix it one day.. So I do recommend it with those limitations in mind.			"

												The most expansive 4X space game out there, although flawed in many aspect it boils down to this, there is currently nothing better to scratch your grand strategy/4X itch.The civilian economy is what truely sets it apart from other games, the galaxy feels alive with activity, and military ships move about on automation to patrol your domain and protect your intrests. Automation is both the best, and sometimes worst, aspect of the game. On this scale it is NEEDED, or it would be micromanagment hell, but at the same time you sometimes have to fight your own AI to get it to do what YOU want.Grapically it is thouroughly unappealing, but if one can see part that aspect the graphics are... functional. They give you the information you need about planet types, ship types etc., withouth wasting any resources on looking cool. Diplomacy is very basic, but functional. Again, it's the economy aspect that sells this game.I do reccomend the game, even with all these faults and problems, again, because while not perfect, it is still the best there is out there.			"

												I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE- playing games that take some time... strategy games....  hard games....  games you can let play itself...  space . ....  theres many more.  its a really cool game.  Sometimes I leave it running when i sleep, wake up every once in a while and change some stuff.  Conquering the galaxy alone is hard,  so most systems run automatically for me like building bases and colonizing.I like it, but its really hard without help.			"

												Even though plenty of other 4X-Games in Space have come along DW:U still remains unbeaten when it comes to achieving a good balance between playability and accessability. It allows the player to automate tasks he regards as tedious or do every little thing yourself, your choice. It is an immensely satisfying experience, and plenty of mods are available to make sure you get immense mileage out of this game.If you liike 4X IN SPACE! this is the game for you.			"

												I picked this up this weekend. $50 is alot, but it comes with ALL the expansions. This is one of the best 4X space games I have played. It is real-time, but can be paused or sped up. So far,  I like it better than Gal CIv 2. It may give GalCIv 3 a run for its money even though it is an old game (graphics aren't that bad). The original game came out in 2010, but has had several XPACs and patches along the way. Universe includes everything.The learning curve is a little high, but not bad. You can set everything to automatic, and the AI does a great job with it. You can then just do manual control on whatever aspect you want, on as many ships as you want, and let the AI do the rest.I didn't know it at first, but it does have an ""eManual"" in the installation folder, which has helped me quite a bit.

												4x Galaxy Civ/Space Civilization Sim. Highly customizable ships, Micromanage your ship design, fleet compisition and missions or let the AI handle it with policies directed by you. Best played with a Sandbox playstyle in mind. Graphics are lacking, if you can't stand 2D 16-Bit graphics move on. Otherwise, if you like games lik Galactic Civilization or Endless space but want to cut out the turn base crap and not have to directly tell your colonies that mining resouces in their systems is a good idea, this might be the game for you.Game is not without flaws, but it functions very well on its own, though 'Epic' games (12+ Civilizations, 1400 star systems, 4+ hour games) could become very taxing on your system, early games are usually fairly boring but mid-late game you will find yourself buried in attack alerts and resource shortage notifications as pirates raid your mining bases and neighbouring civilizations impose trade sanctions on you for being to big and directly competing with their expansion.The game is huge, STRONGLY recommend playing with the computer set to fully automate most things, observe and slowly pick up the slack as things go on till you can tell the AI to sit back and just manage low key operations while you direct your fleets, design your ships and attempt to diplomatically disuade a rival from launching more raids into your systems.

A great space opera adventure!DWU = Distant World UniverseMusic/Sound 67.5% the middle between good and very goodSounds from the ships are nearly very good 75%, but music is only good I give it 60%, of course some tracks are excellent but there a few of them, and they do not perfectly visualize space opera for me. Music could be improved. People from Matrix Games should have listened to soundtracks from Hegemonia Legions of Iron and putted something similar instead. They should have also listened to the sound effects in Hegemonia. Interface 90% the middle between very good and excellent In every game it is necessary to learn the interface, DWU is not different in fact it takes more time than usual, but I do not consider this to be a problem, this game is bigger than the average RTS. All the information that the player needs is nicely and intuitively presented on the screen. I would like to see some improvements on ship design interface. Parts that are necessary to build a specific ship should not only be described as it is now, but they should also be highlighted in the module window. There is also a problem with fleets, when a ship is clearly slower than the rest of the fleet, the entire fleet would travel with that lower speed. Interface should point out which of the ships is slowing down the entire fleet. It is a big problem when you have up to 40 ships in a fleet. Graphics 75% nearly very goodI think it is perfectly justified, that the game is presented in 2d. The scope of this game is better captured in 2d, 3d would not run even on high-end machines. What I would like to see is improved devastations on ships in form of particles this could be a great eye candy. I would like to see ships being smashed into pieces, which later are orbiting around a planet this could be achieved with particle physics. These pieces can later be removed when they collide with an asteroid or a planet. I will leave the problem of repairing such a destroyed ship to the developers. One thing is for sure even if the game is in 2d; there is still room to improve the graphics. Gameplay 100% ExcellentWhen then player starts its own custom game in pre-warp era it is necessary to build a space station, then the player must build an exploration ship to search for resources on planets and asteroids. After that the player must build a construction ship to build mining stations on planets and asteroids. The economy is divided between a state sector and private sector, the player controls only the state sector. In order to maintain the state and its expenses, the player has to choose how high the taxes should be on each colony. This is basically the main game mechanics.There are 21 races in the game. And they all have different goals in the game if you decide to turn on race specific victory conditions. But basically victory conditions can be divided into, trade, exploration, research war, intelligence and diplomacy. When the player has to choose a race from these 21 races, it must firstly choose between quantity and quality of the military ships. A race that can reproduce itself very fast can produce lots of money that can be spent on military ships, but such a race is usually stupid and therefore the military ships would not be very advanced. In opposition to this, there are races that do not reproduce very fast and therefore does not produce lots of money, but they are very intelligent and therefore they can research new technologies faster. It is a well-known mechanics from other RTS games.The game is huge and I thing that setting things to be operated by the AI was a must in this game, especially units. AI 100%Excellent I think the AI acts very rationally. The AI knows when there is a good time to declare war, pay the tribute or propose peace for the player.  I was very impressed when I saw that the AI has sent its own military ship to keep an eye on my military ships when they were located in AI’s home system, even if I had good relationships with that opponent. I was also impressed by the rationality the AI had when I proposed many different deals. Pros+ Lots of technologies+ A possibility to design your own ship + Convincing reactions from the AI+ Space opera climate. + Lots of races.+ Lots of options to customize the gameCons- Music/SoundConclusion: 86.5%The greatest space opera game I ever played, but there is still room for small improvements.

												After one round let me recount my experiences.*Game immediately opens to the ingame encyclopedia on the main menu, bad sign.*45min-1 hour worth of tutorial, explains too much about easy things like camera movement and not enough about the true depths of the AI options*Some AI options are in the interface, others are in the in game menu by the way*I do like the automation in the game, mostly because it would be unplayable with out it. Trying to get your units to attack anything like you would in a RTS is an arduous chore. Cheifly because you can only give attack commands at certain zoom levels, enemies detect when you attack them this way however and usually warp away or turtle, and of course it's fairly hard to select the units you actually want to use.*Resupply ships do what exactly? Click their refuel command and nothing happens, tell the ships near them to refuel and they warp jump to the nearest planet.*Did I mention the AI? Well yoYOU SHOULD BUILD A DEFENSE TURRET AT THAT COLONY THAT HASN'T EVEN ESTABLISHED IT SELF YET, OH AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEND SABOTEURS TO AI YOU'RE ON OKAY TERMS WITH EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS SET TO WAR ONLY? -- For some reason there are nearly a hundred option but build fleets and build turrest aren't their own options.*Usually the AI will go stupid on you and do something like pull all the troops back when you are crushing the enemy, then what should have been a 2 minute battle becomes a 30 minute one.*Don't let the thing auto build colony ships, you'll have every base choked full of them and be unable to actually do anything since the game has no cancel button for things under construction.*Giant galaxy? Oh you bet. All the better to put 25 AIs on so you can LAAAAAAAAAA			"

												I don't understand the praise this game gets.  It is incredibly slow-paced, the UI is horrible, and nothing works in an intuitive way.  I understood going in that the game had a very steep learning curve because of all the features it includes.  What I wasn't given to expect is how boring it is.

												Difficult to pick up, but impossible to put down.  Distant Worlds: Universe is a Real Time Space Strategy game which I believe every game like it should strive to be like.  It's complexity comes from the ability to design your own ships, manage your economy, and build an empire.  Don't just look at your own empire, though, for you are but one of many.  While doing the above, you must manage relations with potentially jealous neighbors, forge alliances and, at times, manage a military campaign.  The AI is very well ballenced and is forced to play by the same rules as you are, meaning you'll not find an overpowered, difficult to match AI in this game.  You can also use the AI to run parts or the entireity of your empire, or just have it give you suggestions along the way, so if you don't understand something, you can let the AI handle it while you deal with other pressing issues.  The game runs well and rarely lags or slows.  You'll get slowing when you have thousands of ships in your galaxy--so, late game--but it's not terrible.  To sum up the above, Distant Worlds: Universe is a very good game.  It runs well, has very good game play, and is complex enough to satisfy someone bored by the simplicity of Sins.  I recommend it.

												Hey everyone,For those who read this: I want to start by saying that i love the concept of this game. Its features are really amazing, and it is a lot of fun. The possibility to build a large empire with a huge fleet and 1000+ ship battles is a lot of fun. The ai that helps you run the empire is really solid and reliable (and i love to use it). Sure its 2D but the grapics really arent bad. The combat animations really look quite cool.  No complains here. This game is awsome. So then... why the negative advice? Well, unfortunetely the greatness of this game is overshadowed by a massive game breaking problem: once you got a larger number of planets in your empire and a larger number of ships (lets say about 100 planets and 700 ships, this is after about 3 hours of gameplay if you are lucky) the game begins to lag/freeze at the higher running speeds (2-4 times game speed) and the problem becomes worse once you get more ships.I understand that the devs of this game are currently looking into bugs and are still releasing patches for this game and i really hope that they will be able to fix this issue. However in the mean time i must conclude:I cannot, in good faith, recommend the current version of this game to anyone. The performance issues simply make the late game unplayble and unstable. Once this issue is fixed i will gladely adjust this review however in the mean time i feel obliged to warn possible buyers of this issue.  55 euros is after all, a lot of money for anyone to pay for a game that really doesnt work properly.

												One of the deepest 4X space strategies ever finally came to steam with really appealing price (well, their previous publisher prices was real outrage). Despite lacking some visual appeal the game is unusually deep and replayable. Somewhat hard to learn (read in-game encyclopedia) but surprisingly fun when you master it. At the start you can think it is really slow paced (research is slow and hyperjumping takes forever, especially when ship is running out of fuel) but in a half an hour you'll find yourself splitting your last couple of combat-ready warships between defence and offence simultaneously recruiting troops and leading planetary invasion plus planning your mining operations for a couple of wars ahead.So, sparing details here's my list of pros/cons for this game:Pros:- No jumplanes/wormholes or binding ships to solar systems - your fleets are free to go anywhere.- Economy model: division to player controlled 'state' ships based and 'private' AI civilians is unique for the whole genre.- Storyline: no more usual 'exterminate/dominate' endgames.- Random encounters of epic scale: imagine ancient battlefield with half a hundred damaged ships to claim either for immediate firepower or for tech inside.- Unforgiving AI: yeah, set your difficulty to max and be gone in first 15 minutes.- Diplomacy: no more fiddling with 'if I add 1 credit to this deal will it work?'. You get immediate assesment of your demands and possibilities are really diverse.- Space combat: no micromanagement, no direct controlled ships. Construct your ships, form fleets and watch them burn.- Ground combat: no micromanagement too, just make sure enough of your troops safely land- Automation: every single aspect can be automated, starting from planetary taxes, through automatic colonization and even automatic fleet formation and attack/defence missions.Cons:- Visuals: they are from 2000.- Sound: pew-pew-pew, clang-clang (getting worse when you zoom into busy spaceport).- In-game help, especially in ship designer: 'what does damage control +40% mean?'- A bit slow UI (well, it is responsible at least, and doesn't slow down in epic 100-on-100 space battles).

												I have only jut started beyond the tutorials with this game I have enjoyed it so very much.Distant Worlds: Universe is massive. Utterly huge. It is a delicious experience, but the sheer amount of information and choice is enough to go through and drive some new players to the brink of exhaustion. Working through the learning curve though and what do you have? A beautiful masterpiece of managing your galactic civilizations, from space exploration and research, to politicking, to combat; every single aspect of growing your space faring race is covered.Sheer volume is a part of why the replay value is so high, but more importantly it is because the game is just so darn satisfying, whether you win or lose. There were a handful of games where I had hours into a session and I made a wrong move and it was all for naught, lost the map, or made a massive political or military blunder, whatever, but it never once felt like wasted timeAmazing1 This is a game for me that gets everything right from start to finish.

												This game is the Alpha Romeo of the 4X genre.  The cute puppy that peed on your Special Occasion tailored suit.  The crazy woman who is late for everything yet your world would implode without her.  You will love the attention to detail the developers gave it.  You will hate the lack of polish in the systems.  If you still love it, you can mod into your own obsessive compulsive control freak paradise.You could fall in love with this game.  The attention to detail is staggering.  The game will let you micromanage an empire spanning hundreds of stars over the course of several months.  When you finally tweak the automation into submission you could play a game in a few hours.  As you try to figure out the many systems and get them all to work for you your obsessive need to control all things will be satisfied.  At least in fantasy.The many systems each have many details which all must be paid attention to at the same time.  This could be a plus or minus depending on the person.  The problem is the lack of information given about these details.  An internet connection to answer the many questions you will have is recommended.  Keeping the automated systems on to start with is also recommended.  Try to figure out why the recommendations are being made.  The amount of decision making giong on under the hood of this game is immense.  If you don't keep up you will not catch the mistakes it makes.  Those mistakes are why you can eventually beat the AI and also why you need to learn how to watch your empire.  I've lost count of the number of times I've dismantled a ship for doing something stupid and refusing to do what I told it.  Ships which are not automated will run out of fuel and be easily destroyed when their empty reactor cannot recharge the shields.This is a challenging 4X game.  It runs smoothly at all times on a modern machine (quad core processor with gforce 650 ti).  Even if you are a fan of these games you may want to wait for a sale.  The graphics are a bit dated and the interface feels like a college C+ project.  This a good game deserving of the love and hate of fans of this genre.  Note to the developers: This game needs a demo.  $60 is a bit steep.			"

												Distant worlds is a Realtime 4X which essentially serves as a combination between Stardrive and The Last Federation. Everything you can do you can automate - which means that once your massive galactic empire starts hitting the 2 or 3 digits you can confidently delegate your minor decisions to the AI and policies you set for the empire. At the same time you always need to pay attention as the governor system will often make a decision you wouldn't have made or underutilise available  resources.The enemy AI has exactly the capabilities of your own, which means that the only thing holding them back from crushing your empire is the input you place on it's path. Aesthetically, the graphics are primarily functional - the fact that it's 2D is the only thing saving your computer from turning into a pile of melted scrap because once you start hitting several hundred occupied systems even the hardiest rig starts to struggle. It looks reasonable and with one or two exceptions you can generally see what's going on, although sometimes planets with heavy trading can get a bit too clustered to select anything.The interface is quite plain, like the rest of Distant World's design. I recommend you use the built in tutorials and even practice on the tutorial galaxies as the general layout isn't very intuitive. The game is complex so this is expected, but some icon groups could be a bit easier to spot. I'm also somewhat disappointed in the diplomacy screens and the choice to use 3D models for the races instead of artwork. The game's sound isn't particularly inspired by any stretch but it does the job, the music is suitably epic but does get grating after a while - you may want to consider muting music and putting on your own. The FX can get quite loud so keep the ingame volume a little lower.The main storyline is wide in scope and primarily revolves around a hostile alien race called the Shakturi. Several expansions have widened the game lore significantly and there's now a wide variety of starting scenarios as well as custom scenarios containing however much of the main plotline you'd like. The game allows a lot of flexibility with regards to starting conditions and empires, and even takes things a step further by allowing you to edit your galaxy while it's running with a built in game editor (SM mode?). The size of creatable galaxies is impressive, with the advertised 1400 star systems and assorted bodies. There are games that can do larger systems but not as deep.Gameplay is, in the end, where Distant World really shines - planetary In the end, Distant World's appeal is in it's gameplay more than anything else. With a bountiful amount of resources, wide tech tree and reasonably deep colonisation system your empire keeps you reasonably occupied from the get go. Once things start building up and you develop a multicolony empire, you start needing to automate the more common decisions - facilities to be built, fleet management, warsand diplomacy. The policies system an AI are powerful enough to do this meaning that instead of feeling like some sort of accountant you can drop the minor chores and simply make the big decisions. At any time, however, you can step in and take over for as long as needed - feel the AI isn't building enough Cruisers? Queue for them to be built and the AI will revert to policy afterwards.As a last note, I tend to leave ship design on automatic - the system isn't nearly as enjoyable or intuitive as Stardrive's, but perhaps I've just been spoilt for anything worse.Overall I'd say Distant Worlds is a very good game for anyone who enjoys games like Stardrive or Master of Orion. The automation aspect implies that anyone can play no matter how casual, but the slower early pace - particularly on prewarp games - and unintuitive interface means that some may be scared off.  "

												First, I want to start this review by mentioning that this game does not seem to properly communicate with Steam. It doesn't tell Steam about your achievements properly, and when I quit out of the game, Steam doesn't get the message. I have to kill the process in order to use Steam in other places.There are so many ways to enjoy this game. Where to begin?If you like Dwarf Fortress, but wish it were even bigger and more complicated for some reason? This is your game. Go nuts. You can do everything from micromanage every aspect of your empire to let it run itself, only occasionally offering up your input. Automate the stuff you don't like doing, and manually control everything you do like. The AI is competent, if not great, and it will often do a much better job than you by sheer virtue of the fact that it knows the rules, and you likely do not.If you like 4X games, it really doesn't get much more in-depth than this and the game, while still expensive, is vastly cheaper now than it was before the Universe package was released.The user interface is atrociously bad, but I honestly can't think of any other way to get across the vast amount of information needed to play this game to the player. That said, finding buttons requires a freaking map and compass. Keep Google handy if you want to do something the UI doesn't think you'll need to do.EDIT: After going further into a game, I've noticed a major flaw in the UI that cannot be overstated. The UI starts to look like a Jackson Pollack painting that moves, which is neat and all, but almost completely impossible to understand. You need to pause pretty frequently to understand what's happening, or automate more and more of your empire as you go on in order to keep pace with what's going on.			"

												This game is the first game since SE5 that comes very close to satisfying my love for Space 4X games! There are small issues with inadequate AI when it comes to fleet control, tax, etc ,treaties and dealing with other races...Those things should always be on manual control! But the vast numbers of races, star systems and importance of economy and military in a survival, makes this game interesting enough to spend hours and still keep coming back for more!

												I'm going to have to put some caveats in first.Currently I'm getting a crash when I try to explore a section of space occupied by some space monsters.. from what I've read it will be fixed in the next update - but I've no idea when that's going to be.The font is awful. Appears to be linked to screen monitor size, larger monitors worse. Seriously have to squint to make out the writing sometimes.I'd kind of expect better for a full price game.. however the rest is full price.++That out of the way, I'm really enjoying playing this so far. It's got heaps of automation, which I recommend you disable, which I did after getting my **** handed to me on a plate a couple of times on the first run throughs. Nothing like 3 hours play, then getting hold of a territory map and realising just how badly you've underperformed..Pirates are super annoying, in a good way. Normal course of events is to pay them off, while concentrating on building up strength, and then wipe them out. It's a pain as when that happens they are all over you, until you can contain them, and they infest your systems with hidden bases. It's a good feature.Nice selection of hidden kit lying around to provide storys and bonuses (ships, bases, tech) and interesting space terrain (nebulas that damage, or prevent hyperspace)Graphics.. well hopefully the Devs can afford to get HD monitors sometime soon.. but game play makes up for it, as well as some nice galactic map features, so you can see your layout.Economics..  bit confused by that in this game, run out of money, you can't build, but the totting up of income and expenses I have not figured out yet, it's probably there somewhere. Personally I would love for a 4x game to add some more realistic finance systems in place - inflation, defaults, loans etc. you could end up with empires that need to expand to keep strong etc.In summary I bought this on a whim, and it seemed expensive, and I'd not seen any reviews produced. I'm happy with it. Could do with some polish, but there is a sense of excitiment I've not had since MOO.			"

												Distant Worlds: Universe is THE strategy game. I have a LOT of Steam games, most of which haven't been played for more than 50 hours. Skyrim was my record game at 100 hours. I haven't really been paying much attention to played time but imagine my suprise today when I noticed that I've played it for 226 hours..... and guess what..... this game still has much more to give.It is vast and complex, a true sandbox game. You start the game on full automation, listening to your advisors for the next recommended course of action. As you begin to grasp the mechanics of the game you slowly turn the automation off and pick it up yourself. Here's an idea of what you can expect:My last game lasted around 30 hours, it was a huge universe with thousands of colonies. I started in the pre-warp era, I led the Human race to the discovery of warp/hyper speed travel. I started to expand quickly, forming new colonies on nearby continental planets. I soon discovered my neighbours in my small cluster of stars, one of which was the Boskari. A vile insect race, they instincively disliked the human race and I took it upon myself to rid them from the face of the universe. Queue a couple of hours of intense micro and macro management of my 13 fleets (I was playing the game on a difficult setting, so it's not all pew pew) trying to attack their 7 colonies and countless mining stations while keeping the integrity of my fleet intact. As this was relatively early in the game, my ships were incredibly inefficient with their fuel - and that is what I love about this game, EVERYTHING is thought of and you can be as involved as you want to be. To help keep my ships fueled I deployed several resupply ships on nearby gas giant planets for my fleets to use to refuel, not a necessity but made a difficult war a bit easier. If you want a detailed game and you're an analytical thinker that is up for a challenge then this is the only game that you should buy this year.Here's to the next 200 hours.... This time I'll unlock the Shakturi acheivement :)			"

												Surprise of a lifetime for me. In this era of semi-casual Grand Strategy games we have a game with actual depth. Too many  recent ""4x"" games are all about victory conditions and all about forcing players to go for one condition and punishing straying from it. This game is an open sandbox. You can do whatever you like and multiple races have different victory conditions and playstyles. Though expensive at $59 it is more a ""complete"" pack that contains multiple expansions. This game is VERY MUCH worth your money if you enjoyed games of the past like Master of Orion 2. More complicated games. The learning curve for this game is steeper than others, so be warned.			"

												I have played many 4x strategy games in my lifetime, including the civ series, however Distant Worlds blows them all out of the water. Never before has a single videogame made me feel so many emotions in one sitting, and it is simply breathtaking to say the least. This is the kind of game that will build you up and make you feel strong, and then five mins later kick you in the crotch and leave you in the dust wondering WTF just happened. Powers rise and fall around you, civs evolve and ascend into galactic civilization, with you being able to take them under your wing or forcibly ""assimilate"" them into your regime. A civilization that was once your friend can eventually become your sworn enemy, waging epic war against you for the sake of their new twisted allies (or yours, in my most recent save's case). You can do nearly anything in this game, from enslaving any race you choose as a twisted and cruel dictatorship to becoming a democratic union spanning the entire galacy, absorbing any rising race under your wing and gifting them with an honorable and just society to live in. The only thing you need ask yourself is: ""What impact do I want to make on my (completely customizable and living) galaxy?""			"

												Of all the 4X games I've played, this one has had the most reasonable AI governor control. AI control really helps keep the game from getting too micro-managed, but unfortunately it also never really engages in a coherent strategy either and babysitting is always required. The scope of the game is significant though and you really cannot play this game in full hands on mode and maintain your sanity.The game has some incredibly huge late game balance issues that need resolution badly. Planetary shields are horribly overpowered; instead of mitigating bombardment effects, they completely nullify them altogether, which is just stupid. For 20k (drop in the bucket) you get complete immunity to orbital bombardment of any kind! Whee! Which might not be so bad except that ground assaults are also broken, with tons of stacking bonuses that can make an assault on a heavily guarded planet effectively impossible. Meanwhile, actually loading troops into ships is often incredibly tedious and your AI governors will frequently fight you for control of the ships while you're trying to issue orders to load troops onboard. Meanwhile your ships will just respond to a load troops order by visiting the nearest colony... not the nearest colony with... you know... troops.I really enjoyed this game and if they could just make invasions not a horribly frustrating experience I think I could recommend it without much reservation. Well, other than the obvious caveat of ""Woah, that is a steep learning curve!"" But as it currently is, the game is only fun in the early/mid game. It just completely falls over late game once bombardment stops being a viable workaround to homeworlds being immune to invasion.			"

												The game is a bit daunting at first, but after you sit down with the game for an hour, or you watch a let's play/tutorial online for a bit, you'll have a ""eureka"" moment. The game isn't as overly complicated as it might appear. It is an extremely rich immersive experience and a tonne of fun. The $59.99 dollar pricepoint is paying for a bunch of expansions and an extremely fleshed out game. The one complaint I had was the base UI, it is horrendous. Seriously, it's terribly ugly. A way to remedy this is to use the ""Extended Universe"" Mod (which makes the UI pretty damn sexy and adds more races into the game). Another quick point, modding is extremely easy in this game, literally dragging and dropping the mod into the ""Customization"" folder. Overall, I highly suggest getting this game to anyone interested in something a bit different from the average strategy game experience.Addendum: The game itself has a pretty good tutorial, and also I'd advise checking out ""Blackstork""'s ""Race-specific UI/Soundtrack Mod"". It is currently a work in progress, but the finished result should make the game a lot more immersive.			"

												This game is strategic Empire Simulation Game. But the automation aspect and detailed system makes it RPG like game. You can literally play off different role in each game. No race has fixed way of playing game. Automation may sound like turning the small plays off. But no, this game provides more contents and more strategies just by being more familiar with automation. First of all, the bi-income system is new turn on. The balancing between controllable and dependable yet hard to manage income and uncontrollable, undependable and conditional income was just amazing. You can really manage 'what kind of economy' you want to maintain for your empire. Also you can balance this through automation and really form the 'government' you would like to build. I first thought government systems were useless, just get by contents that all the empire management game have. But no, you can actually play out those governments through your own policy making. The extra perks from policy makes those role-playing realistic and manageable too. Resource system and delivery mechanism was great too. This makes this game very realistic as it requires significant army to maintain significant supply chain. Also this resource supply chain is just sub-system for uncontrollable economic system. You can fully automate this and forget about it. But if you get use to it and how to twist it, it gives you whole different experience of economy building. Also technology isn't just planetary facilities and ships to win the war or colonize more. They actually affect economy itself. Not just retrofitting, but with sufficient tech and supply chain, you can dominate certain trade literally. Hence making trade sanction very effective. (this domination gets harder as map size increases. But still until AI build tier4 propulsion tech, you will have regional dominance)Also you can manage your sub culture (side-races). It isn't just simple decoration for your empire profile. You can use their population to colonized planets that you don't have technology of. Gaining bonus is mainstream, but enslavement bonus and extermination option was new. If your planet is about to be overthrown by side-race you can manage that. (of course depends on your role-play)Bad sides are AI and Diplomacy, Tech tree balance, and charactersAfter a while you will find whatever you do you will always win unless you put yourself in very disadvantaged situation. Also diplomacy needs more work. It's too simple to even criticize. Trade Sanction or Treaty is great but this is because of Policy and Automation, not Diplomacy. AIs are very passive regarding Economy to begin with. Also use of High tech is very minimal. You can live off without colonization also its rewards are minimal except being  able to have some wonders. I mean it lacks creativeness and character that Energy or Weapon tree has. In weapon tree, each weapon is very unique and you can come up with different combination to make your ship effective. Energy too has great effect on our policy automation and economy. Not to mention the influence management. The high-tech isn't really high tech as its name shows. It's almost good to have but ok without it. It provides some vision and tracking. Also some exploration options. but that's it. rest of them are quantitative improvement of planet's stats or facilities with use of money. colonization becomes very useless until the late game if you manage to find one or two independent factionand successfully occupy/colonize them. It's like this High-Tech tree is on the air. Very not -distant world -like. It has almost nothing to do with Automation or policy nor empire building. It slightly makes things fancier and easier. the character idea is good. But better implement properly. It has minimal effect except for colonial governor. Better give more incentive for having good characters intact with fleet or ship. But it has only been a year. I believe this game would be great simulation game as updates are frequent.			"

												Without a doubt one of the best 4X games out there. While the graphics are fairly limited, this is more than made up for by the depth of the gameplay: there is a lot to discover here. I have sunk a number of hours into this game and what strikes me is how it consistently surprises me with each successive playthrough; seemingly minor differences early game can play out to generate really distinct end-games.There is certainly a steep learning curve at the beginning, but you can automate a lot of the activities; as you get better with the game you can turn more and more of this automation off. This also means that you can control how much micromanaging you want to do, and in what spheres you want to do it. For instance, the espionage dynamic, while interesting and powerful, is not my most favorite, so I usually let the game AI focus on that while I spend a lot of time on the military aspects of the game.The map customization options are also really deep, and different map types play out very differently. Personally, I like to set the map settings to be fairly large, but with a very limited number of stars. This forces you to be very strategic, as each planet you come across has huge value (this also makes the game much more manageable!).The enemy AI is also quite robust, and will surprise you with what it gets up to, and the diplomacy is fairly deep, allowing you setup complicated alliances (although sometimes this can be quite dangerous: one minor agression on the other side of the galaxy and all of a sudden the entire galaxy is plunged into a huge intersellar war!).As a final note, the modding community for this game is really strong!

												Deep 4X Space Strategy with steep learning curve. I really like the private sector in this game. It is controlled by AI and you can influence it only by building mining bases, securing trading agreements, protecting trade routes, etc. All ships need fuel and fuel rich planets are prime targets for pirates which will annoy you in the beginning. But! you can hire them for yourself and use them for smuggling resources and destroying enemy (or anyone really) bases or for defense contracts.There is rich tech tree with many branches you can take. You can create custom designed ships or you can leave it to AI. Actually if you want you can leave everything to AI. or control 1 ship, role play and explore the galaxy as ship captain.  or you can micromanage every little detail in your empire. or anything in between. choice is yours. 1 Thing that is not that awesome is UI which can be confusing for new players. This game is like nothing I've ever played before, I love it.  "

												Probably one of the most indepth X4 games I have ever played. I especially love the number of ways it can be played. You can play it straight up like any ole strategy game, or you can do wacky things like automating your entire empire. Maybe you wana play out your fantasy of being a prestigeous ship engineer....well you can do that! Automate all of the empires functions except ship design! Bam! Ship Engineer! The depth of the game is quite similar to AI war and they even use the high definition sprites for units and stations. What I'm trying to say is that you should get this game if you like X4 games. It's worth it.			"

												This game pretty much sucks. If you play everything manual, I'm guessing it works much better; but the automation features just don't work very well. Fully automated (in absentia) seems to work as expected, but when you pick and choose what to automate, it just doesn't work. Sometimes, it won't work either way. For example, even on manual, your fleet may ignore its posture settings and be used for AI purposes. Then, on automatic, your fleets may refuse to repair. The game is just a smorgasbord of bugs ... should be avoided.			"

												So.. I was upset when I spent $60 on a game that crashes on startup. I asked and received a refund.A few months later, and I thought I would try again, when I saw Distant Worlds was on sale. Less than $20 this time, so if it does crash, I'll be a bit more patient with it.Yep, it crashed. But a quick google search brought me to a Steam forum, where I could edit Startup.ini in the game folder within steamapps. I had to set this line: playmovie 0. By default it is 1.I started the game again, fingers crossed, and WOO. This fixed the startup crash.So, my question is why the devs haven't fixed this problem. Seems like it would be relatively quick and easy, and must be a known issue. But they are an indey group, so I'll just get over it.I haven't spent too much time on the game yet, so I can't give a thumbs up without spending quite a few more hours. I've been watching the beginners guide vids and gone through some of the initial in-game tutorials. By the way, a really great series for beginners:

												The 4X space sim is my favorite genre, as one can tell when the look at my game Library, so Distant Worlds was a game of huge interest for me.  I dedicated a significant amount of hours into the game, tweaking different ways to play, and while the AI is a great help in functioning as able assistant, it tends to get in the way at times.  Nothing like getting an enemy attack alert on a system you had set a fleet to patrol, only to find out the AI had canceled that mission, and sent the entire fleet for refueling across the sector.  For me, it is a borderline buy/no-buy call, so if you can get it discounted, give it a try, but don’t but at full price.  I look forwarding to seeing what Distant Worlds 2 looks like, or maybe even a deep expansion, giving greater granularity on choices and options.			"

												Gonna play more after writing this!Pros:1)  it doesn't feel cheezy like all the other 4x out there, which only does 1 or 2 aspect well (In DW, there was no ""does this makes sense"" moments for me... it keeps one immersed if one can get past its graphics. the story/things/mechanics that happens are believable)2) AI will surpises you, it knows when to not waste ships. and unlike StarDrive, AI personalities STAYS consistent. your history with them feels important/that it matters ***this is from playing a 20+ hour game*** 3) Ingame editor to make things... interesting if you ever feel need a change of pace ***such as setting the entire galaxy at war with each other and watch the fireworks***4) Options for new civilizations arises from indepedent colonies. <- this keeps things fresh if you don't end the game by destorying all other civilization, the game becomes an ANT FARM (which can be awsome since game can last as long as you want it to).  Con:1) A very big con is: This game is complex and there are ALOT under the hood. it will drive people who max/min CRAZY if they go in with the max/min mentality. It doesn't feel like your A + B = C formula that are like SC and other 4X, but more like Dy/Dx = Sigma[((A+B)/C)^N] where value of N is from 1 to infintity.Which is why it goes into the next con:2) no multiplayer: But I believe this is inherient due to the processing power required AND having a range roll for things would make multiplayer not enjoyable... ***and where am I going to find people who can play an 20 hour long game with me***3) UI, TINY text, but I hear devs are fixing that. ***Serious dev? are they all super-eye-sighted-humans or something?***4) You WILL forget about work, Birthdays, and aniverseries.Major Pro:If your machine is beefy enough, and can handle it. *16gig of ramgo 15x15 sectors and 1400 stars, and watch an galaxy evolve....

												Don't look at my Steam play time - I had this game long before it ever was on Steam. It was $90. Ouch. Yet I took the jump and I found it to be worth every penny.It's simply the best 4X space game out there, far better than Gal Civ, Endless Space or most any other title you can think of. It's that good with that much ""flavor"". This is the only space 4x game where you could control everything or maybe just even direct one little scouting ship while leaving the empire to the computer AI. Or you can control the dipomacy and your fleets leaving the economy to the AI. Distant Worlds does a wonderful job catering to your play style. You play the 4x game you want. Micro or macro. Exploration or extermination. Research or ship construction. Or do it all. That flexibility is the strength of the game.What you'll find is that all of the areas are fairly robust. Exploration continues throughout the game. There's a deep diplomacy system, an economy to manage, ships to create and build and always the scarcity of resources that require you to prioritize.The biggest issues with Distant Worlds are two fold:1. The learning curve is STEEP. You will need to watch some Let's Plays. There's just too much to learn to make a decent tutorial system. So there'sa  time investment up front that you have to be willing to spend to get to enjoy this game.2. The interface is...not good. It's too cluttered with far too many ugly icons. Frankly the game isn't all that attractive anyway, but it's the UI and icons that are by far the worst culprits.So what do you get if you can get by those hurdles? Fairly awesome gameplay. It's epic for even a space 4x game. You're going to be exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating for a long time in any given game. Alliances will♥♥♥♥♥♥ Opportunities will arise (ever build a death star?). Things will happen and you'll very likely have a good time playing it. There's hundreds and thousands of hours of enjoyment to be had. Look, I know the price makes it seem expensive. But it's the base game and like 4 expansions. Buy it, learn it and you may not be playing anything else for the next 6 months. That's if, and only if, you're willing to give it the time to learn it. For me, it ended up being a great buy and therefore gets a thumbs up from me.			"

												Eh kinda boring, little one sided, no matter what the fanboys/girls, might say. You don't get any where near enough staff. The Auto Management system which is needed is idiotic at best, half the automated designs really are pathetic. Really not worth the price. When you do make a better design, if you do not turn of auto designs, then your design will get repleaced with a much worse design, even if, you set your design to manual. Highly annoying needing to re retrofit ships mulitple times because the computer desides to change to a much worse design.Since others keep arguing... (heh fan boys.) Yes if you want to set it so the game does not auto upgrade all designs of say frigates, you can set it, but you can not set it to not upgrade a paticular design off frigate.This is my review, I will change it if I so decide that I shouldm no amount of arguing will change my mind, I will only delete those comments.

You can just play, but you will miss out on so much that you will have an impossiable time succeeding.   Just like one of the post i read a second ago.  I have to agree that when I think about playing this game I get annoyed.  I really wanted to play it.  I put hours of learning into it.   Tried automatic gameplay, which then makes the game like you arent really even playing.    Just way to complicated for me anyway.   I dont have endless hours per day to play a game, so saving and coming back next time I do have time, is almost impossiable to know what I really wanted to do the first time.  Ya not for me.  Really wish I could get a refund.   especially since I paid full price and it went on sale a week later.			"

												I don't need to give a long review to show this game is awesome. The fact that most reviewers have 100+ hours in the game should be a good enough sign this game is amazing.EDIT: I was probably a bit angry for some reason when I wrote this review, cause it seems kinda dickish to people reading it. In all honesty, this game has some great depth, especially with this one mod that adds an extra dozen species (I forget the name of it.) However, I don't think it's worth the $59.99 being asked for. It's not a AAA, it shouldn't be priced as such. However, if it's on sale for at least $40, and you are a fan of Civilization esque games, you'll have a good time. Granted, it'll be a confusing time at first, but a good time nontheless. I wish I could descibe the game in more detail, but I genuinely suck at reviews. The less I say here, the better.			"

												First of all, everything advertised about this game is incorrect. Leaving your affairs to the AI is a great way to get bombarded by bad decisions (I think they got Wheatley from portal to do that job). The Private sector freighters are easily confused, and it is a common sentiment that players wish they could control that aspect of the game directly to avoid such bad decison making. And the worst sins of all are that the game's graphics look like they're rendered on an Atari, and that would not be so bad if the game itself did not stutter and lag like a mechanicus adept with a stroke. I am not the only one with this issue. These developers should be ashamed of themselves. Do not buy this for $60. Do not buy it for $10! Seriously, you are just wasting your time. There are MANY better games on steam to try.			"

												This game is horrible. It is either way too complicated with (real-time) years of micro-management, or it's way too simple, and the game ends up in a steady state that is impossible to break out of. This game should really be called ""Stagnation"" as that's all you do - sit and watch dots fly around the screen. Would love my money back, just for really disliking the game.Big time pain in the butt, this game.			"

												micromanagement hell or watch the ai play the game (badly) for you.   any serious player is going to be compelled to shut off all the automation because the automated systems are so far from optimal that it will drive you crazy.    unfortunately, this means the game will have to be paused ever few ticks while you spend several minutes going through a very long checklist of the things you need to micro manage.    which wouldn't be so terrible, if the ui wasn't so terrible.   doing pretty much anything usually requires switching between several menus multiple times.    the absolute worst documentation i have ever seen in a game this complex.   finding relevant information on the various systems in the game requires hours upon hours of searching online just to find some post somewhere that talks about some test some other player did some years ago that may or may not be up to date.   i still don't know if energy collectors function worse further from a star, by how much their efficiency decreases if they do, how different stars/energy types may or may not effect efficiency, or if the really don't work when moving.  (i've seen conflicting reports from online posts)  there is just nothing in the game that shows the info on how much energy they are collecting at any given time.    i want to like this game.   all the pieces are there.   but this ""steep learning curve"" that the fanboys talk about is just a cover for the fact that the game designers don't explain very important aspects of the game and seems to go to great lengths to hide information from players.    the game really isn't all that complex, once you fight your way past the fact that nothing is properly explained.    it's really pretty standard for a game of this sort.    (okay, that still makes it pretty complex)  but the ""learning curve"" is really just a result of bad documentation and deliberately(?) hidden information.i want to like it.  i really do.   i just can't.    i hope they clean up the ui if they make a sequel.   and i DO hope they make a sequel.

												best 4x spacegame you can buy for money! to put it in the words of the reviewer from rock paper shotgun: ""Distant Worlds: Universe is my favourite space strategy game. Not my favourite space strategy game released this week and not my favourite space strategy game released this year. It’s the definitive version of the best space strategy game I’ve ever played...""..now to the biggest selling points:- the scope is gigantic....1.400 star systems and up to 50.000 planets make this galaxy feel like TRUE universe! not a small map with 12 star systems or even better just 12 planets in it...no no no no....this IS a galaxy!- living galaxy: the galaxy is not just huge but it is alive....how many of you played games like galciv2, endless space, sins of a solar empire (technically no 4x spacegame though) and lets say star ruler? those are pretty good 4x space strategy games but besides some skirmish with some randomly spawned pirate ships and the much later battles with the enemy empires there isn't much stuff happening in the galaxy. in distant worlds universe (DW:U) you can witness life everywhere! from the many different space monsters around different planets or asteroid fields, to private sector ships like cargo ships, traders and tourism shuttles, to pirate FACTIONS and some hidden ancient thread...there is much to be seen and every corner of the galaxy has something happening....even without your intervention.- pirate factions: now i mentioned this before briefly, but i can't say how glad i am that pirates aren't just some randomly spawned ships which are only there to give you some explosions to test out your new weapons and ships in general. don't  get me wrong, you can and will see your new weapons & ships in action, but these pirate factions have their own bases, playstyles and their own agenda and goals to achieve....their have their own sub-faction AI which actually tries to win within their goals....AND you can also play as a pirate! the pirate roles differ from smuggler to raider over mercenary and over very distinct playstyles (both for human player and the AI as an opponent).- huge tech tree & full ship design: the tech tree is huge with many different weapons, shields, engines, and other utility modules (like long range scanners or cloaking devices). there are many toys you can tinker with and you can design your ships in a freeform manner! ships actually have an energy consumption and mass, which affects their movement speed, acceleration and their thrusters (turning speed).- indepth economy & resource system: now the economy isn't just a simple +1 gold / citizen....you have a private economy and a state economy...which is  both fairly complex but on the other hand mostly automated. but because it is quite complex there are so many ways you can influence it if you want...the options are gigantic. ..now RESOURCES are finally both plentiful and meaningful in a 4x spacegame. there are around 40 resources in the game, 50% strategic and 50% luxury resources. now the ships & bases you build are made out of components which are constructed in your shipyards out of the  various resources. this resources you have to mine before you can build stuff. so finally not ships coming magically out of thin air, constructed purely out of money / gold. there is much to do young space captain!...now for all who think ""this sounds too complex and if there isn't a huge tutorial and some handholding i will never understand all of these!"".....well you don't have to understand all of these things! you can literally automate the whole game and just watch the AI play it for you (literally)! or you can chose the parts you want to control manually and create your own playstyle.distant worlds is much more like europa universalis or crusader kings than it is a civilization 5. it is more of a dwarf fortress in space, it is a simulation / space opera game where you can create a huge living galaxy, where you can create YOUR story!

												I've played a LOT of 4x games, and for the first time I feel like I've found a worthy successor to the Master of Orion series.Be forewarned, though...this game has a MASSIVE learning curve.  It took me no less than 20 starts spread over 60 hours to gain a modicum of proficiency with the interface and gameplay mechanics.  The number of AI and automation settings is simply staggering, and the in-game documentation can be a little sparse and vague.   I yelled.  A lot.And then there is the gameplay.Pirates raided my early colonies.  Hostile space monsters ate my mining ships.  Independent colonies resisted my troops and absorbed my early colony ships.  My empire was blockaded by a race of cute rodents with big dewy eyes, who proceeded to bombard several of my early colonies from orbit.  Pirates raided me again, this time leaving behind troops and building fortifications on my colonies, siphoning off my trade revenue.My first fleets met horrific defeat after defeat.  My first ship designs were underpowered pieces of crap.  The tech tree presented a huge array of paths to follow, and invariably I was beaten to the punch by my AI neighbors.Every restart presented a new challenge, a new lesson to learn.And then it happened.I learned how to defend my colonies, turning the pirate factions into resources to be exploited.  I learned how to explore and expand effetively, seizing ancient relics and technologies and forging early alliances with sympathetic races.  I learned how to design specialized ships, and was able to bring highly effective combined arms fleets to bear against my enemies.  Once I got rolling, I still had more to learn.  Ancient races, rivalries, and forms of government were discovered in the forgotten corners of the galaxy.  Natural alliances shaped by history and biology came into play.  All the while, carefully expanding, defending, and trading tech and info with my allies.After 120 hours I finally won a game.  At the end, my empire controlled 70 colonies across 50 star systems.  24 automated fleets of fast warships patrolled my borders as I directed 6 strike fleets in crushing pirates and bringing my neighbors to heel.  Thousands of civilian ships plyed the starlanes protected by hundreds of automated escort ships and frigates.  My economy was supreme through an absolute monopoly on several rare luxury items, and an embargo by my empire could bring an opposing empire to civil war and ruin. The sheer scale and detail was incredible, and I wasn't even playing on the largest settings.So, if you're into 4x games and don't mind jumping into a challenging UI, I highly recommend this game.

												This game is big, really big. Big enough that the game comes to a point of being unmanagable unless you set almost everything to automatic, and waging war is even worse, fleet battles get so big that the game almost crashes. But thats all late game, early game is amazing. in the begining you start out with nothing so you need spread throughout your solar system to get the resources you need to expand farther, and as soon as you discover an alien race, all hell breaks lose. The galaxy burns with war, desease, and poverty. You can either work together with other factions, or take advantage of their weakness and rule the galaxy. of course ruling the galaxy sounded fun, but this is when i learned that wars are near impossible to manage manualy, so the fun was taken out of that. so then i (attempted) to work together with other races but they thought i was ugly so i killed them, which once again led to game crashing battles.     To sum this up, the game looks like there are so many options to seat yourself at the head of an empire, either through economical, power, or just being peaceful. But i ended up killing everyone anyway.      I did enjoy the time i played and i havent dug very deep into the game (just enough to write a review tho) so i think i might return to this game with a different set of goals, like becoming a ship captain or being a pirate     I would also like to mention that the game has a MASSIVE learning curve so start studying, doesnt run on windows 8 and up, the UI is a mess, and the reason it costs $60 is because it includes all the expansions.

												Love this game! Automation in a game like this is fantastic. You can fully customize variables of what the automation does, or turn it off completely for many different aspects of the game. You can even set it so the game pratically plays itself (every once in a while a popup comes up that requires your attention). At the beginning, you'll want to turn most of the automation off or at least make it so it only offers suggestions instead of doing it for you. As your empire grows, you'll want to start turning on some automation for some of the more micro-manage aspects of the game, such as colonizing and building ground units on the surface of planets.Designing ships is easy (a little too easy). There's no shuffling parts around in a grid to make everything fit, all you do is shove componets in a list and dependent on how large each part is and how many of the parts you have it changes the size of the ship. The only reason to have a smaller ship is because there's a max build size that you can construct, or to have a smaller or cheaper ship to mass produce for swarm fighting and scouting.There's many resources in the game to manage, but it's not too complicated to manage. All you need to do is construct a mine on a resource site and it'll harvest the resource. The rest handles itself. Ships controlled by your citizens (you can't control or even manually build them) will go to the mine, collect the resources, and distribute them across your empire. Construction is but a button away. In most games, you have to manually select a builder, tell him to go to a site and construct the item you want, not in this game. Just go to the place you want something built and a contextual menu will be available with all the things you can build there. Click one of the items and it'll automatically find a builder, tell him to go there, and build the item. If no builder's available, it'll stick it in a queue to be built later.Modding is easy and fun. Adding factions, ships, ship parts, and technologies just requires editing a few text files with different extensions. There's a good, detailed reference material for modding contained within the product itself.The worst part of this game is first starting off. The UI is small and there's a lot of freaking buttons. You can muddle through the dozen tutorials, but they're long a boring and noone does them, they're like the manuals of the gaming world.Overall, this game is fun and once you get used to the semi-comlex GUI, it's great.

												Distant Worlds is a series that has come very close to maximising its potential as a 4X RTS game. Which is outstanding! Unfortunately the game suffers a lot of negative feedback due to its high learning curve and complexity. If you are used to games of a complex nature then you should do just fine. Realistically there are ways to make custom games in your favor so that you have a better opprotunity to learn. If you buy this game and dislike it because of the complexity and you are unable or unwilling to learn the games mechanics then i will ask you to please not leave behind a negative review aimed at hurting the games reputation. Its a very good game and one of my personal favorites. If you are up for a more challenging than usual 4X RTS then dive right in.			"

												Distant Worlds borrows many concepts from other space based 4X games, but does none of them particularly well. However, the epic scale makes up for it. Distant Worlds truely makes you feel like you are steering a massive interstellar empire towards it's destiny, whether it's conquering the galaxy, or simply staying relevant while the story of the galaxy unfolds.Pros -Epic scale, can play a game with thousands of star systems-Good ship design that is uncomplicated yet makes it easy to see the results of your design choices-TONS of game customization, you can play in pretty much any manner you choose. For example, you can start as a backwards pre-warp civilization that is barely beginning to explore their own nearby planets, or an already established galactic superpower, or somewhere in between. -Victory conditions that are unique to each civilization. -Decent AI to manage aspects of your empire so you can focus your attention on the things you enjoy the most. Or you can control it all.Cons-Economy is somewhat obfuscated and hands-off. Not recommended if you enjoy closely managing the financial details of your empire. (Arguably not a con, but for me it is).-Somewhat clunky interface-Diplomacy lacks some of the transparency needed to make informed decisions, AI can be somewhat arbritary at times.Overall if you are a fan of 4x games this is definitely worth playing.

												I was concerned that the massive scale of this RTS would force me to either pause the game a lot or be overwhelmed in a clickfest.  I was wrong.  Because many of the functions can be automated, according to my specifications, I can absorb the game at a better pace and focus on my own style of play.			"

												The game I highly suggest you get instead of Stardrive. This does not need Multiplayer to make it great. This is what 4x is all about and has a reasonable AI to boot (Unlike Zero's Stardrive). Plus the devs knew what they were doing so your not left wanting. However the learning curve can smack one in the face really hard.			"

												Distant Worlds is a series that has come very close to maximising its potential as a 4X RTS game. Which is outstanding! Unfortunately the game suffers a lot of negative feedback due to its high learning curve and complexity. If you are used to games of a complex nature then you should do just fine. Realistically there are ways to make custom games in your favor so that you have a better opprotunity to learn. If you buy this game and dislike it because of the complexity and you are unable or unwilling to learn the games mechanics then i will ask you to please not leave behind a negative review aimed at hurting the games reputation. Its a very good game and one of my personal favorites. If you are up for a more challenging than usual 4X RTS then dive right in.			"

												Complex star-empire building sim with most complex economy side of a space strategy game that I've played.Although most of the economy is handled behind the scenes, you have basically all of the tools of a ruling body / Emperor / government control ~ taxes, troops, warships, infrastructure development (mines, starbases, shipyards, research centers, tourist attractions, tech research)... while relying on your people to actually do the inter-colony shipping & transport of goods themselves (build a resort, they will come & generate more taxes!). Somewhere around 40-50 different resources to find & get supplied, good variety of tech trees to develop, and relatively competent opponents if set on harder / aggressive game settings.A bit complex to get started, but once you turn OFF all the automation to learn how things work and then choose what you want to control / not control, is very fun. While the game can basically play itself, what fun is that?			"

												Still my favorite space game.Play a small simple galaxy first with everything on manual, get your butt kicked, then try again and eventually you'll learn all the parts of the game. Automate the things you find boring, keep the stuff that interests you on manual. I never automate research and ship design, for example, because to me that's the strategic challenge. I automate most ship missions. Other people probably do the opposite. You can do what you want!I think the default pirates are unrealisticaly strong. I have no guilt about making pirates weak and sparse. Just a nuisance, like they are in our own world.			"

												Pretty fantastic if you're a fan of 4X games.  In terms of gameplay, it's closest to Star Ruler without 3 dimensions. DW:U does everything as well as Star Ruler (and all the other greats), but then adds one killer feature to seperate it from all other space 4X games: a private economy appears and interlocks with your state economy once you have a spaceport built. Each Ship, Structure and Component in the game has a specific set of resources required to produce it.  There are something like 80 resources throughout the galaxy, some quite rare.  Once you have a space port, a private economy comes to life and does almost all of the work to mine and transport these resources.  It's fun to watch the little mining vessels and transport ships zip around your first star system, mining resources and transporting them back to spaceport or to a needy new colony.  It is hard to overstate how much having a private economy operating independent of the player-run economy makes this game standout in the genre.  Play a few minutes and you'll love it: the game has modeled the boring and repetitive tasks (transporting goods, gathering resources), taken them out of your hands, and explained it in such a way that makes the game more feel more realistic.  Encouraging this private economy to grow (by building mining stations and colonizing planets for them to service) not only gives your Empire more ships to move things about, and each new private ship provides you with money since the private sector buys them from the state.  This gives DW:U that little feeling that has usually been the domain of City Builder games A-Train and SimCity.  You nurture the citizens, they go about their business, and if they thrive then you will benefit greatly.In just about every way this game equals the best of the genre: the Research Trees are great, the combat is great, the diplomacy and trade are great, new games are absurdly configurable, automated/manual options exist for just about every game concept, species are quite different and fairly balanced, ship design is very detailed, leaders are varied and interesting, espionage system is well done, etc.  Take all that and then completely improve a major aspect of the 4X genre by making the productive economy more meaningful and more fun and you have the best game ever in the genre.  If you loved things like Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations, and Star Ruler, DW:U is the game for you.Pros:Absurdly good in pretty much every way relative to previous games in the genre.Good music that's appropriately epic.Cons:Learning curve is steep.  This will be difficult if you haven't played previous games in this genre before.  I'd recommned looking for the guide written by Timotheus for manual gameplay -- he's done a pretty good job of walking you through controlling everything.  In-game tutorials are just so-so.No multiplayer.Graphics are a bore.  Not a problem for me, I still play Master of Orion 2 sometimes.			"

												I've played many sci-fi 4X games, but this has to be one of the best. It's not new and it looks a little dogeared compared to other titles (although I love the native Windows UI; you can even print out pages of the in-game manual, just like that!) and it's not as complex as Aurora (though, if you know what that is, you'll know why it doesn't count), but it's richly detailed AND features the optional and pretty comprehensive automation to not get overwhelmed by that if you're not into constant micromanagement and clerical work!Distant Worlds misses a lot that I've seen in other games of the genre (the ability to create your own species, a more expansive research tree, better unit selection options...), but it has so many great features that I HAVE seen in other games and thought, ""Why doesn't THIS game have that too?!"" and many more that I haven't, from huge scale, attention to fuel mechanics, weapon firing arcs and projectiles that can miss, ship handling, to detailed and moving bodies around stars, that I dare call it a modern crowning achievement in sci-fi 4X. How it's this good and I've NEVER heard about it until it hit Steam, I have no idea, but it hurt.If, like me, you love these kinds of games and have been disappointed with new and sexy yet relatively shallow titles like Endless Space or neat but rather limited ones like Star Ruler (not that it's apples to apples with either of those), this is a surprisingly refreshing discovery [and you should get it (now)]			"

I have more time playing the non-steam version and I try to limit myself to playing this only when I have a lot of time and the brain-power to keep up with it; this isn't a no-thought-required game like some 4x games can be - or maybe I just haven't played for enough hours to play it on autopilot.

It's a beautiful thing. The systems in this game are well thought, and you can tell that the developers are fans themselves, because every aspect of the game is refined. There is unlimited dynamic replayability, and it's so SOLID.			"

												8 out of 10 This is an excellent massive pausable space strategy game.  Based on shear size and complexity this is an enormous achievement.  You can run the game with almost everything automated and intervene where you want. The game is dated though and all the commands and information is not what you expect from a modern game. This is a game for people with a lot of time and patience.			"

												This 4x game is an amazing acheivement (especially after three or four updates and mods).  There are two sides to a faction, the State and the Commercial side.  A player may have direct control over over the State (Military and some Resource management),  but can only ever have an indirect influence on the Commercial side, taxes and a ship design option.   The Commercial side is mostly run by the AI, leaving the interesting decisions to you.The game can be tailored  for people of varying levels of experience with 4x games because you can hand over as much of your faction to AI control as you like.  You can start by handing your entire side to the AI and controlling a single ship, watching the Universe unfold around you. Once you've played a little bit, you will probably want to at least some of the reigns,  the diplomacy and war AI in particular make decisions I disagree wtih.  It takes a bit of learning to mold the game to your desires.One may find the graphics lacking.  The space creatures are a bit silly, but I grew to like them. The interface can be overwhelming at first, but you can do so much. I have some issues with the game and some caveats.It isn't immediately clear how you affect the Commercial side, I'm fairly sure I still don't know the whole story.The game experience you have is very dependent on the set up, and it takes a couple of shots to understand what the setup knobs do and how that affects the game you play.The vanilla game provides a variety of ""races"",  but suffers a bit from 10% more this, 15% less that for differentiation.For good and ill, there is a lot to learn in this game.  Fortunately Let's Plays are a thing.			"

												I have played this game for quite a while before purchasing it on steam. A very fun space strategy game with alot of depth and complexity. However, you need to be the kind of person who either likes to micro manage everything or doesnt like to do much at all. There is alot to this game; taxing planets, managing fleets, starbases, mining, colonizing. And it requires alot of management from the player. You can also let the AI run certain things for you, but this personally annoys me as it does not always make the most intelligent descisions. If you are the first type of person who loves to manage abosulutley everything, you will get alot out of this game. It really feels like you are running a giant space empire.			"

												This is one of the most complex games of all time. No game save Star Ruler gets you as close to a total galactic war as this one. Its a war that can play out using all sorts of different kinds of hostility. Aggressive territory expansion, manipulative economic domination, and exploitation of less fortunate species are all viable tactics here. I can't talk enough about the scale of the game. The galaxy is immense, and the number of planets is staggering. The most obvious problem is the interface according to most reviews, but I would challenge them to make one that's better. The interface design COULD be better, but a significant amount of development time would have gone into it. In general, though the player will often have to create their own ways of navigating the UI efficiently, it works well enough. The ability to pause the game makes issuing complex orders easy. Fleet organization isn't great (not helped by the average interface design). Ship retrofitting, especially once hundreds of ships are available to select from, is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Despite the fact that the civilian sector is handled for you, I feel like there's a hidden trove of gameplay potential hidden there that isn't explored. There are no major corporations, civilian coalitions, or any real society elements here. Just keep the taxes reasonable and everyone's fine. Combat tends to be a bit iffy. This is the only real failing of the game, since steam rolling with giant balanced fleets tends to win the day. Micromanagement of combat is very difficult, and the Ship Response system you can program into different classes doesn't REALLY give the kind of tactical complexity that one might hope for. What it boils down to is fleet positioning. Where do you put your largest fleets? Your smallest? What planets function as military shield worlds, and which ones as economic centers? Macro strategy succeeds where micro strategy fails.The learning curve is very deep. You'll play a few failed games and go through a long tutorial before you really comprehend the totality of whats going on in-game.			"

												The greatest 4x ever. The other 4x games are so unrealistics with the kinda restricted  turn base system and the square/exagon tiles.You manage an empire/whatelse choosing to dominate the galaxy via war or trade.- CONSSometimes the diplomacy is limited; the AI dont understand when you are a mega threat and it wont try to ally with you. You can really abuse the AI, but sometimes is smart enough to understand when the war is lost.The AI for automation of the small fleet is kinda weird and pirates can really be annoying if you are an expanded ""nation"", but probably is realistic to have annoying bugs in your domination.Sometimes you cannot command efficiently part of a fleet (the light ships) to avoid to suicide on a planet base without changing all the stance of an entire class of ship.Conquest of planets is ""Meh"", you just throw units until you have the more firepower. You have to use some tactics, but not so much.The governament type make your ""nation"" unique, but only on statistics. Only the ""Hive command"" has enjoyable unique aspects, the others is only a ""game style"" choice.The economy system could be better.+ PROSCustom fleet and ship with a tons of module. You can choose the size of the model and the design.Automate aspect of the game to enjoy what really you want and let the AI take care (efficently) of the annoying stuff, so you can learn first some part and then you can manage all your ""nation"".The combat system is sweet, you really feel your customization in action and the glory of your ""Main fleet"".Replayable game.It's a complex game that can give you challenges. If it's too much complex, let the AI automate some stuff. In the list of CONS and PROS could be appear that I dont like the game, but the CONS are just details that dont ruin the PROS.			"

Stellaris leaves this out. It's the little things like this that will make or break a game.			"

												So i read this game reminds of old legend Master of Orion 2. They are right, but the game still fails to deliver. I am playing Skyrim and Rise of the Tomb raider on high or ultra quality, but this old game is laggy.+/- Ship graphics are drawn well, but after ship design screen most references you see to those ships are pixelated icons and far zoomed out blurs or dots.+/- Automated military is a nice idea, but AI makes extremely bad decisions for the player. It  If you start war with someone, your ships won't be going out to capture enemy planets for you. Only random attacks to their systems but that's it. You can't really force them to bomb a planet either it seems. You like destroying the galaxy? Nope, not this game. It seems the AI doesn't like putting bombs on the ships automatically, but even if you put them in manually they're not being used. And AI makes fun of you by making new designs of its own and building them instead of yours. The rate at you get new technologies makes you want to automate the designs and retrofits.+/- Automated colonization works, and is propably much more efficient anyone could handle manually. But then when you do try to play manually, the game doesn't offer a clear interface to manage building queues. You don't see clear lists of available structures like in Moo2 or Endless Space. It's like the developers tried to hide them on purpose in the small printed mess that is the interface.+/- I like the variety and ideas in the research, but the tree is fairly short and completely misses the endgame miniaturization technologies.- Whole popup system needs a complete redesign. It's sliding them from the right in weird steps of 10 pixels or something in 2 second long animation during which you can't click any button in the interface. (I mean, how hard is it to slide an image smoothly from right to left? Apparently hard...) It can show you popup after popup where you can't even see what the last one was. New tech? Oh well, you just missed it. Hope you can find what it was in the techtree.- And all that is after you've gotten used to the small fonts and explosion of information on screen, which would surely make most people quit the game before it even starts.- Leaders? Oh yeah there were some of those in this game too, not that it seemed like they were even there. No personality or anything like leader systems in other 4X games.I would not recommend this game even with a discount. It's left at a horrible state, and needs a ton of fixes to be considered a finished game.			"

												To really enjoy this game you have to approach it the right way. If you're looking for an insanely complicated game of space chess then you should look elsewhere, because the pawns don't always do as they're told. But if you want to play the role of an evil galactic emperor (or a pathetically benevolent administrator, however you want to look at it) whose minions will occasionally be bumbling and headstrong (or, sometimes choose to exercise their right to free will), then it's just par for the course... simply execute them (or pat them on the head and give them a medal) and move on.Yes, it can be extremely frustrating to find the cuddly space monkeys carelessly cavorting among my insectoid stormtroopers when I have given *explicit* instructions that they are to be enslaved to work in the iridium mines, but if crushing the galaxy beneath an iron boot was easy then everyone would be doing it.The galaxy is relatively interesting, and as it evolves it begins to feel like a real, living place, which makes it so much more satisfying to crush it like an insect.The automation is functional and somewhat customizable, but not perfect. Sometimes an evil overlord must handle things personally rather than leaving it up to bumbling minions. That's just one of the realities of life that we must deal with if we are to to spread sweet, sweet evil throughout the universe.I have found that on the largest maps in the mid to late game, the game lags to the point of being unplayable (on a mid-range laptop). There is just too much going on. I am attempting to alleviate this problem by researching the technology needed to create and control Silvermists and use them to annhilate all life that is not within my empire, but have so far been unsuccessful. If you look out your window and see your neighbor's house being consumed by gray goo, you will know that my efforts have borne fruit.Now if you will excuse me, there is a band of space pirates that have outlived their usefulness.

												This is a really good game. In fact, it's very likely one of those games I'll play for over a 100 hours, which is very rare. I tend to get bored quick, so generally don't play games for long, but great strategy games I can play for hundreds of hours (Europa Universalis IV, CiV) and this is one of them. It takes a bit to get into since it's quite complex but once you get the hang of it you have a great game to spend your time on. Besides, to help a beginner get started, you can choose what parts of the game to automate or take control over. For example, you can automate research, tax rates, colony policies, ship design, troop recruitment etc. You can also set for example Colonization to automate/suggestions/full control. There's even more, but you get the idea. There's lots of options to set up your own game and the galaxy can get upto 1400 stars, which is really huge. So far, I have only played with 11 other empires, but I'm pretty sure you can set it to atleast 19. Then there's the pirate factions and independant colonies (Which can also start it's own empires) so the games can get pretty busy. I'll update this review with more information when I got the time (Got to go now).Anyway, game is DEFINITELY recommended!			"

Posted: June 22, 2015
												This is my first review for a Steam product. I thought I'd join the litany of positive remarks for the game.It's exceptionally complicated, but even the learning process is enjoyable. If you take the time to learn how the game works, you can navigate its manyfold layers to create a deep and compelling narrative for your game that plays out like a story and whose gameplay becomes very rewarding.A little anecdote from my first game:I had started in preward era as humans. We could barely travel beyond our home planet, and when we could, only using convential thrust engines - limiting how far and fast we could go.A few technologies in, I build a space port. It was a great achievement for the entire Human Race. We were entering the space age. I build the revolutionary Surveyor Mrk I - a formidable little ship that would travel the solar system in search of life and answers. And what it found was pirates. Lots of pirates!As it is exploring, I'm thoroughly extorted by 3 pirate factions, squeezing me for all my Earf (my planet's name) dollars. As a pacifist by inclination (read: lack of fighting ships), I oblige with a smile.In the mean time, I continue to expand. Earf being a moon of a gas giant, I build a construction ship to build a mining facility on the behemoth.Simultaneously, I discover an abandoned, broken down ship orbiting another planet in my solar system. Far enough make me think if it's worth trying to recover and risk whatever ship I'd need to send to recover it.Human curiosity won, and, after a quick Google Search on how to claim an abandoned ship, sent my construction ship to rebuild it in hopes of... I didn't even know what! Perhaps I'd get a new technology, perhaps a new ship, perhaps a some cool new scrap metals, or (probably) a new alien infection that will turn off even the most accepting of spouses back home.I send my slow construction ship to repair the abandoned hunk of junk from Earf.Earf's endeavours were not profitable yet, and the pirates were gouging me, quickly going into deficit. It wouldn't be long before my funds would not be able to sustain placating these barbarous space thugs.Sure enough, in time deficit turns into debt, and I am forced to cancel treatise with the pirates, raising the ire of the Space Maurauder clan especially.They attack my fledgling space race, now boasting a spaceport, some science facilities, and a few freighters going back and forth to the mining stations. They open fire on all of my facilities and space ships, like pirate do. I was about to quit the game and start again.Earf's space days were almost over when, suddenly in the distance, lo and behold! The ship had been recovered and manned by my crew and turned out to be a destroyer of epic size and power; a veritable warship beyond human understanding.Slowly, the lumbering titan made its way back to Earf, and to my great surprise, devistated the entire pirate fleet of several ships with such a show of might and firepower that none could escape its wrath.The ship became a staple of homeworld defence from then on, and after several hours of gameplay still had not gone obsolete. No pirate squeezed a cent out of Earflings anymore, though they tried several times to overpower my fleet of one... to their demise time and again!By the end of that session, I had three planets and was a middling power in the universe and wasn't bothered by a pirate (on my home planet) again. 10/10 would turn wreckage into pirate killer.

												If you haven't bought other space RTS games yet (like Star Ruler, and Sins of a Solar Empire), this game is the best in the genre that I'm aware of from as much as I've played it and the others.It may even justify the high price, as it takes many plays to grasp the game, and after a long amount of play another part of the strategy becomes more obvious and the temptation is there to start over.  [Although I think everyone is aware that ALL games are overpriced until they go on sale.]Part of the learning experience is dealing with maps as they are rolled - some planets are much easier to start with than others.This is a difficult game - not quite an RTFM, but watch some tutorial videos to get a start.Pros:+ Highest replay value I've seen so far.+ You can start with colonization not researched yet, and it takes a very long time before even colonizing another planet, during which, pirates extort for money.  It makes the game openning very lengthy, which is a nice option to what other games offer.Cons:- Some minor bugs seem to still be there.  When I press the ""zzz"" button to see sleeping ships in expert, it returns none.  I have to manually click on the idle ships myself.  I would expect more polish for this price tag.			"

There is no end turn, its all real time but in a great way and unlike Sword in the Stars or Sins of a Solar Empire, this is an actual real life galactic experience not yet present on any other game I can think of except for the X-trading series.Great game, hours of game time already spent on it. In fact I have bought this twice already and I don't normally do that. So YES, I would most definately recommend this to any space nerd/enthusiast out there.			"

The different mods for it, turn this great game into a GEM. So in conclusion dont be turn off by the price tag. IF ur a fan of 4x, huge game full of depth, then u will love every dollars invested into it.Final note. DONT listen to all the pro automation players. The real way to play this game is all by yourself.			"

												This game is truly excellent, and immense beyond the dreams of anyone who plays 4x games I think.  I love the tech tree, the spacecraft, and the alien civs.  I thoroughly enjoy the exploration and the diversity of events in space.I'd like to see more involvement in planetary management, it's not like there are so many colonies that managing/building the ones you like and leaving the others on automatic would be a big deal.  I don't feel connected enough to the colonies I'm supposed to be protecting, I guess. The space side of the game is 10/10, however.  I love fleet battles, I love the pirates and space monsters.  Nebula, supernovae, black holes, etc. all make it feel like you're exploring a living galaxy.			"

												One of the best space empire building games I've ever played.  It's great how it's in real time and you're able to have certain aspects automated if you like.  My favourite part is how your empire has actual private industry and private ships going about their business so you feel l you your empire has a life of it's own.I've played many games of these space grand strategy games starting from Master of Orion back in the day and this game did the trick.  Ship design is good and having to manage resources.Game time is deceiving since I've played countless hours outside of steam and just bought it on steam to show my support.  It's very rare that I would do that for a game.You won't regret buying this game if you like this genre.			"

												DWU (Distant Worlds Universe) is simply outstanding in my opinion and I have probably played several hundred hours with it.The game is a 4X sandbox of unlimited duration or at least until your empire becomes the sole ruler the galaxy. You can sit on high like I do and make the big decisions and let the AI handle the mundane work (economy, research, exploration, war) or micro-manage to your hearts content. AI works reasonably well enough that I am comfortable letting the military do their job with minimal interference and I think it does a better job on the economy than I do. What I do not trust is the diplomats and I micro-manage the relations between the various empires. After all that is what Emperors are for.Nothing is better than sitting back after you have initiated ""trade sanctions"" on another empire (it is the key to the AI that you are contemplating war) and watching the fleets move across the universe to attack positions and then declaring war. Which is why you need to micro-manage the diplomatic relations. Diplomats just love trade sanctions and if you are in a disputed system with another empire the military (think Patton or MacArthur)  just might get you involved in a war you don't want to be in.Pros: Good AI, graphics reasonably good, excellent music in the background, tutorials are good.Cons: An occasional crash when my empire becomes too big. Restarting the game from the last time I saved it fixes the problem. Slow learning curve in the beginning so it does pay to go through the tutorials and then play the introductory game ""at slowest speed"" until you can get a handle on the interface, AI options, etc. Interface needs improvement. It is too cluttered.I do not like Pirates but I can get around those by playing custom games and just removing them from the  game. Pirates are for policemen not Emperors!			"

												At the beginning I liked this game, the game idea it very good.Then it turned out to be boring, because, despite of it's complexity, the gameplay is repetitive.The behaviour of diffetrent races is nearly the same.There is not much variety in the types of events.I didn't see how to apply different strategies, you have to do the same things in every game.The graphics quality is very bad. Ships for example have no animation, some text is pixelized and look bad, on large scale it is too jerky, planets of one type look all the same.The music I like, but it is just repeating and not somehow event driven, so it sounds like havingno relaion to the game play.For this price I have seen much better games.

												I've  had the game for a couple days. i've played enough to kinda get a feel for it an seen how the AI works.and i'm quite disappointed based on the reviews others have written.The AI tends to interfer in every thing from the start.an theres so much automation that they game could pretty much play itself...which -.- kinda makes me ask why does it need me if it plays on its own ?You can to a degree disable most of the automation...but things are so clunky that its hard to know which ship is part of each fleet, which fleet is actually doing.the civilian traffic...isn't very...detailed. they mostly buy civilian ships. which they use basically as resource collectors and and resource ferries. but they don't really do it effectively or in a way that shows intelligence.ships constantly run out of fuel because apparently they aren't capable of developing a system of warning them when they're entering the point of no return with fuel.when you send ships to a distance system to patrol an defend your mining stations instead of using the mining stations to refuel they more often move back to another system to refuel...an run out of fuel in the process of going back which basically means they travel at a crawl.Your military ships lack strategy.  3 Pirates jump in slightly stronger than they are so instead of holding the pirates off from destryoing/capturing your mining station while reinforcements travel there...they suddenly get the need to refuel ...i assume its because they peed themselves at the concept of actually having to use their weapons for the first time in 5 game years. the game works i haven't encountered a bug (to my knowledge) yet...but its quite boring. given that mosto f the game plays itself with little input from you. Its not a bad game but if you like planning an your input mattering ..it doesn't in this so far as i've seen. You also don't  have much customization. you get premade races. there are a lot of variety in appearance an they all have their own traits . Its no where near 60$. i got it on sale for 25$  which i think might be fair.11/27/16After playing more an learning more about it , the game imo still relies to much on automation. but its not to bad. and I keep having issues mostly that i don't understand to my newbieness.For example........Colonization is expensive! >.> Who knew figuring out you need a ship to carry supplies to a planet like your own cost so much.the ship classes aren't so much bigger ships as they are ships all capable of being the exact same size, with the difference being which role the ship(s) in question will perform automatically.like Escorts an Frigates on auto will seek out civilians to escort, bases to defend, and some patrol duties on their own.or Destroyers will defend your colonies in a dedicated role.--its probably is for all the things i've found to do none of them are really done deeply for example  the Civilians are resource collectors, and ferries. they also eventually have tourism and people using passenger ships to move from one place to the next which when i finally get to the tourist point i think might bring the universe a live more.but you can't really influence them in anyway you can't make laws, or dictate ship requirements. Your citizens don't seem to go an buy ships from other nations. they seem to do so purely in their locality. but i think it would bring more life to it to see your citizens buying ships from other empires that you've discovered. on the military side.Theres no overly complex method of order ships around you basically just give general orders an your ships carry them out.For example telling your ships to patrol. you can't set up a custom patrol youte. you can only tell them to patrol a system, or planet, or station , or escort a specific ship but telling them to patrol a system , usually has the fleet break up with some ships going to defend station an others travelling around.I personally would prefer a bit more depth in telling them 'how' to patrol the system an their primary goal should the encounter hostiles. but i can't do that. hopefully in the next DW they'll expand on the command and control structure . and expand on the civilians so the universe feels more dynamic.If i could i would rate this game 3/5 stars, an set my review more on the  middle line of recommending it.It has very few bugs that i've encountered. but it will no doubt annoy you when your ships are to busy doing their thing to defend your station when pirates jump in. or when your planets starving for fuel because the civilians aren't effectively bringing enough fuel to keep operational.but I figured i'd update this since the first part of it was more of a annoyed rant, than informative.Its still imo not worth the 60$ that it usually goes for. but 20-25$ is definitely worth it. unfortunately i assume after the sale it'll go back up.Don't let the graphics hold you back from trying it. sure there simple but its the depth of the game play that matters more than its looks.

												It is okay, but I can't recommend it.  That is too bad, because I really wanted to like it.I love space 4x games, and this one is interesting.  But ultimately it is bogged down by an opaque logistical system.  There are good elements, but they are overwhelmed by the irritating ones.Regarding logistics specifically, there are dozens of different resources in the game, which are arbitrarily demanded for construction.  This is unnecessarily complex, and not interesting.  Worse, they are only transported by ""civilian"" ships which you do not own or control.  Seriously?  So the designers created an unpleasently complex system, then added a weak background system to handle it.  Which you can't manage or improve.  That is a major fail, and far overbalances the right mix of management and impact.  So then they tacked on another system, which is to offer a bounty to smugglers (pirates) to boost missing elements.Speaking of pirates, they are numerous and nonsensically powerful.  They have fleets and infrastructure on the order of the conventional opponents.  Why?  I guess it was an interesting twist, but they were illogically OP, and I did not find them fun.  Elusiveness makes sense, but giant hi-tech fleets really don't.  Especially given my objections to the logistical systems (above), I suspect the devs cheated by giving the pirates fleets they could not have generated using the game's own systems.This suspicion was confirmed during a game where ""super pirates"" suddenly spawned out of nowhere.  Spawning absolutely does not belong in a game which emphasizes a really big logistical tail on your hard-earned technology and infrastructure.The AI is not impressive, which is true of most games, sadly.  And the friendly AI is irritating, sending exploration ships to useless locations when there are many nearby options.  (Why?  That is not complex behavior....)Sorry I can't recommend it.  I will keep looking....			"

												Great concept, poor execution.   I have played a lot of 4X space games in the last 20 years.  I have invested several hours into this one, and there is still too much going on where it is entirely unclear how (or if) I am able to influence the outcome of what is going on.   yes, I went through all of the tutorials.   There are plenty of screens/menus that tell you what is happening, how many, what kind, etc. to a brain numbing level of detail.   But in terms of screens/menus that allow you to make decisions and take actions in a logical and intuitive fashion, they simply don't exist.   Simple things like wanting a multi-ship fleet to fuel up and go to a star system become a complex mult-step nightmare, especially if the ships in your fleet are not exactly in the same location to start with.    Once you finally figure out how to take an action, the action often becomes 'stalled out' waiting on any number of other (non-obvious) events to occur.   Discovering you are stalled (in a timely manner) is the first challenge, then drilling down to find out why you are stalled is the next challenge, and usually a painful process.  Even if you figure out the various reasons why you are stalled, you are then faced with the obvious conclusion there is NOTHING you can directly do about it.   (i.e. you need to have blind faith that a 'Private' freighter will eventually go get the resources you need)  All of the above quickly overshadows any entertaining aspects the game might (eventually) offer.This is the most money I've spent on a 'Steam' game, and I had high hopes.   With this experience, I will be a lot more careful before spending any significant money on games in the 'Steam' world going forward.    The testimonials offered for this game now seem like pure marketing hype intended to be misleading, so how can I trust any purchase decision on this website?			"

												Too much of a good thing.During my time with the game, what came across is less of a 4x/strategy game and far more of a micro/macro management game. There's simply too much going on too quickly, forcing you to have to rely on the automation (which is pretty well done, by the by). Unfortunately, that largely means that the game plays itself more than I do.Be prepared to spend a lot of time pausing the game and alt-tabbing to the forums to  look up how to do X task.  The tutorials are dry as an old bone and not a whole lot of help outside of the basics. For instance, it took me an hour plus of fiddling about just to figure out how to load troops onto my transport ships (and even now, I'm not sure how I did it), then another hour trying to figure out how to land my troops on a planet I wished to conquer.While I liked the differentiation between private sector and public sector, the crowding around the star bases was infuriating. Selecting a ship or two that you wanted- or the base itself- becomes a chore. This became exacerbated by what seems to be an rather inaccurate pointer.The UI can charitably be called abhorrent: small buttons with indistinct and unintuitive icons; tiny, difficult to read text; spreadsheet-like interface for performing tasks or looking up info; little explaination about what each number means. in fact, if I had to sum up the game in a single word, ""unintuitive"" would be it. The ship design interface is particularly bad. B. A. D.Once you can figure them out, the game's mechanics appear to work well- but you won't be using them much. As stated earlier, there's simply too much going on for a single person to be able to handle, meaning that one MUST delegate many aspects of your empire to the AI to keep from getting overwhelmed, and in my opinion, this is not a good thing.Depth is appreciated in a 4X game, but there are several important rules of game design which seem to have been thrown out the window in bringing this one to life. If you want a space RTS 4x, there are other, cheaper options which have done it better and with vastly superior experiences for the gamer- Stardrive comes to mind, particularly.Sometimes, less really is more.

												Using a 28inch 4k monitor and I'm unfortunately unable to read the font or the UI, usually switching resolution would help this but I couldn't see any options for any of this either. It's sad because this game seems very ambitious, however I obviously  can't recommend this game due to its  options and interactions being illegible, maybe a scalable UI could have eased the problem?    			"

												The two main reasons I'm not recommending this game are: Cumbersome interface, and excessive automation.Whatever great features this game might boast are buried under a needlessly complex user interface, one that appears to plague most modern space 4x games. The game tries to display all the information you need simultaneously on the screen. While many menus are collapsable (much appreciated, btw), unfortunately others are not and prove to be too distracting while I'm trying to figure what systems I own and what my ships are doing on a dizzying map filled with icons of all geometric types.Every window is crammed to the rim with text that is tiny, uses unpleasant fonts and colors, and provides poor color contrast with backgrounds. I owe my rapidly deteriorating eyesight to the prevalence of this ""text syndrome"" in this genre. I was forced to reduce my screen resolution to the minimum, and it still didn't help much. The UI in this game makes me long for MOO3 -- you know, the game no one liked due to its excessive menus.What makes this UI worse is the constant bombardment of text news and pop-up windows dutifully alerting you to largely inconsequential information, such as Civ X and Civ Y thanking each other for a very minor trade deal, one that had nothing to do with you civ whatsoever. Some more important messages are often duplicated several times, once as scrolling text, another as a pop-up window, and finally a separately loaded screen -- just in case you failed to read it the first two times. The last time I screamed ""I don't care about this crap!"" so loudly and frequently was in Gal Civ 2.To all 4x developers: When designing a UI, please take lessons from Civ 5 or MOO2. You can make a deeply complex game without using a complex interface. Modularize the info into layers and display only the most pertinent info at a time, but allow players to delve deeper, but only when they want to.The second issue is automation. While I appreciate the great efforts to relieve the 4x player the terrible burdens of micromanagement, there IS such a thing as too much automation, which unduly robs the player the power of decision-making.  I spent a good hour trying to figure out how to produce a colony ship, or move a prebuilt one, only to realize that all colonization was automated, with zero input from me. Automation + Real Time = Sit back and twiddle that thumb.There ARE options to turn off a lot of the automation, but much of it remains. After turning it off completely, I was still getting tons of mission reports from my scouts discovering new ruins, even though I never sent them on any mission. I was getting reports that my fleet won a major victory against pirates, even though I never ordered it to attack anyone. Reports that one of my spies got caught in an allied civ, even though I never ordered the spy mission (or even knew the spy existed). Reports that my troops have begun invading -- well, you get the idea. I suppose this is what a figurehead feels like. While it can be occasionally relaxing and even enjoyable to sit back and watch a whole game play itself out, I would sure love to be able to make SOME decisions -- I am playing a 4x game, after all, and not watching a movie. Perhaps if I had more than 2 hours to play this game, I'd have a deeper appreciation, but alas that is the time window Steam gives us for returns,			"

												I like this game, but I can't really recommend it. This game has some serious balence issues with pirates and ai fleets. The pirate can completely overhelm you if set to a slightly  challenging. Ai fleets seem not to pay unkeep like the player does. Many of the mechanic are hard to discern such as removing pirate bases from your planets. Weapon and tech tree are somewhat boring but that has been true of a lot of simliar games.			"

												I do not recommend this game.I love games like Civ5, Endless legend, Age of Wonders, Endless space, Pox Nora. I play all these games on top difficulty. I have no problem learning strategic games. But his game....The tutorials in this game are a joke.Graphics are really bad - But I dont mind that part.When you start a new game you start with a alot of ships and systems so you dont get the feel of your empire by building it from scratch.Also everything in the game is automated - so your ships are just flying crazy around in the galaxy. When your set your army to patrol around a planet the ships warp insane around inside the system trying to fight critters and space pirates.The automation also includes your science research and ship design. You can choose to unautomate most of these things, but the tutorial is sooo bad that you no idea what your doing.All in all this game is probably a nice game if you have played all the previous games in the series - but coming as a newcomer to this game it just isnt worth it.I payed 50 pounds for this game... My god - Worst purchase ever.			"

												turd, i want my money back , as far as i can tell the the game is completely automated because it's too complex to explain---this is my understanding of the tutorial -- we recommend playing as prewarp civilization , okay , build some construction ships , explore your system , research , when your not prewarp anymore go out and win the game , enjoy!except when i try playing prewarp , i get to press a button for building the only ships it will allow me to select ( construction) , reseach is automated already, the ships go ahead and build and when i try to figure out how to assign them to do something by looking at the maybe 100 buttons , they take off to build a mine on another planet that had already been explored i guess, it's like watching someone else play a video game,  i get frustrated that i can't seem to do anything in the game and turn it off. i decide i'm not giving up yet , i start the game and they play the entire intro with full orchestration , like civ 5 before they fixed that in an update, but since this is a mature game i'm guessing the developers are just fine with me having to watch the intro every time. not.

I'm sorry call me lazy but I'm not spending $60 for a game where I need to spend another hour+ trying to set up. I'm a simple person I guess, download game then play game. What's so hard about that? So I got my refund, and I'll continue to follow and wait for it to get optimized I guess. If that's ever going to happen.			"

												Reviews heralded a new era of AI automation. Unfortunately, for me, none of the game systems we appealing. I wound up slowly automating more and more game systems, to try to find a way of playing that I liked. But, for me, DW:U turned into a matter of just watch the years tick by. I tried to win even when avoiding my racial victory conditions, which was an interesting diversion.Ultimately, the experience was like watching an automated set of spreadsheet data click by as the turns continued. I felt no real connection to the events, my empire, my colonies, my characters. Nothing. I love a good tech tree. But none of the tech felt like it mattered.But the biggest disappointment: It's priced as much as a major publisher's MSRP. So I read a review. It was glowing, so I foolishly assumed that ""oh wow, if they're selling it for that price, it's bound to be something special. I guess since 4X is niche, I haven't heard more about it."" Though I don't write reviews, I decided to write this just to warn others.In short, all crunch. No flavor. And EXTREMELY overpriced.			"

I loaded up the introductory mission after some basic tutorials and just the amount of stuff going on immediately was overwhelming.

												I struggle to understand why some people seem to like this game.  As 4x games go I find it far inferior to any of the other games readily available.  The game itself is automated to the point where a 'player' can just sit back and watch while occaisionally clicking on a confirmation button.  Performance is suprisingly poor with message windows having an odd way of painting in one piece at a time over several seconds.  It is very frustrating just trying to tell what is going on and even more so trying to direct the activities of your empire.  Ships come and go on their own, giving them orders is painfully difficult and even then it seems like there is a good chance the orders will be ignored or superseded by some other automated command.I find the UI difficult to use and rather unhelpful (and I enjoy Dwarf Fortress!).  In the face of resource shortages simply directing your units to colonize an appropriate planet and build much needed refineries is an exercise in studying the fine print across several spreadsheet like windows.  Budgets for building and research balloon into the 10's or hundreds of thousands one  minute only to disappear again by the time you've decided what to spend it on.  Similarly ships are destroyed and replaced with barely even a blip to bring it to the player's attention.In short the game feels like it prefers to run itself and almost seems to make it intentionally difficult for players to get involved.  Imagine a game of Galactic Civilizations or Master of Orion where all actions were automated, the player existed only in a sort of spectator /  advisory mode while turns flipped by at the rate of several per minute and you have a glimpse of the chaos and frustration that is Distant Worlds.

												Poorly Designed, Tedious, and BoringI generally love exploration games like Civilization or Master of Orion, so I was looking forward to playing this. Unfortunately it was a boring crawl through cluttered screens and a confusing/frustrating user interface.My first warning that this game was going to be a tedious chore were the tutorials. Pages and pages of tiny text explaining how to play the game. A well-designed game integrates learning into the gameplay rather than making you slog through hundreds of lines of text explaining the controls of the game.On top of that the game is incredibly cluttered and busy. No elegant graphics or user-interface here, just screen after screen of clutter that you have to sort through to figure out what is going on. It's like the developers were clueless on how to create a pleasant user experience, so they dumped everything they could on the screen. There are so many buttons and lists and junk that it feels like work learning how to sort through all that mess.If your'e looking for a Master of Orion style space exploration game (or even a fun game) skip this one. If you enjoy working with spreadsheets, lists, and cluttered poorly designed user-interfaces this game is for you.			"

												This game is typical ""the less would be more"".  Regarding the price, it is completely a robbery. The amount of star systems might add value if they have.....value. But they are not. Automate things.....reminds me on the nightmare of MOO III. The ship building means, you have no idea why but you are flooded with ships with unambigious design. Automate ship design means you are flooded with ships containing a small amount of evrything you have researched. If you switch off the automate design, does not matter. You have a chaos in your ships.This is just one of the trial in the big series of gathering money from 4x fans saying ""pre-order"" or ""you can be part of the developer team"".If anybody want to buy it from me, please let me know.

												Seriously, save your money and frustration for a game worthy of your time. The frustration with learning a massive UI is horrendous enough as it is. The die hards say yes good value but they tend to be a little one eyed and biased. Don't believe me? Browse through the numerous complaints in regards to this game. "

												I was excited by the game, and even more excited by the comments from players, saying that it's somewhat too complex and not very pretty: I thought that it would be a great challenge for an experienced player like myself.Well, it was a mistake. This game is probably very deep and complex, but I also think that it requires 50 hours just to understand the basics, and I'm not sure it's worth it. I've done every tutorials, and started the first easy game mode, and spent the first 2 hours watching the game being automated, and not understanding how to perform even a few very basic tasks like attacking a target or sending a spy. i've asked a refund.To conclude : it's probably a well crafted game, but too complex, even for veterans.

												I cant really speak for gameplay. What I can say though, is this game does not work with windows 10 without editing the game code manually. This game also has no option for adjusting the video beyond framerate and detail, without going in and also manually editing the game code. So if you want to play in windowed or adjust the resolution you can look forward to that, and if you have a custom size screen you may be unable to play this game at all. Both these features could be added and/or fixed by a competent company within a day, screen resolution adjusting has been pretty standard in games since 2002.I generally have a rule if a game is priced like a triple A game, and I have to start jerry rigging it to work, I refund. So I did.			"

												NOTE: I already own the non-steam version without the Universe expansion and have thus invested way more time into the game than steam claims.This is a seriesI have really tried to like. I have invested money into all of the expansions, hoping each time that the game might become fun. But it just doesn't.The single biggest problem with the game is the concept. While the idea of controlling a huge empire indirectly through AI automation may sound clever (and I admit that it does), it also means that the player isn't left with much to do (you can try controlling everything by yourself but you won't have any fun because of the insane micro that you will have to suffer) and that the AI's automation will either make or break the game. I will admit that the AI automation isn't half-bad, but it's really not ideal either. It's really painful when you get attacked and then defeated merely because the AI did not have the good sense to build a strong fleet and an army even though your AI empire setting gives fleet building a high priority. If you so wish you can only make the AI control certain aspects of the game while taking care of others, but no single aspect is really deep enough to be fun all on it's own. This makes for a dull game. I will admit that the game has some strong points, like very good game start-up options, and this latest expansion is suppose to make modding even easier than before. But for me this doesn't fix the game's core flaws. Overall I regret having to say that this series just isn't doing it for me. I am sure others might have fun with it, but it just isn't my cup of tea.			"

												Decided to re-review this game after trying out games again with small play time. I think I posted the wrong review originally! Anyway, it's still down as a ""Not Recommended"" but not because the game is bad but just to highlight some issues. This game is not for those who are new to 4X.Starting out, it's overwhelming. There's just so much that can be done, as a result, the GUI's are overloaded and inititally unfriendly. Thankfully they've included AI automation. Your empire can pretty much run itself. I would highly recommend starting out letting the AI manage everything, while you get used to the layout. Unfortunately, due to the font being used, and font size, some bits are difficult to read.The game offers a global currency, and also resources at your various planets and other space features. Lots of different resources, perhaps even too many (Like Gold, Lead, Steel, Helium, Argon, Nitrogen, etc, etc) Everything you build needs both, some are for ships, some are for colonies. You'll always get resource shortages at the start.I do love that every star is it's own system of planets+moon, that do orbit the star, and that you can zoom in directly (and fairly smoothly) from galaxy view to planet view. Plus, you can have other species in your empire as a result of battles and independant colonies. They provide additional benefits, and allow you the oppertunity to own other planet types you wouldn't normally be able to colonize.There are some aspects I think were not needed, or need improving:""Hero's"" - your empire produces various hero's/leaders who develop additional skills. When controlling a galaxy wide empire, you don't really need to care about individual people, or as an example, if one of your ""hero's"" gains the useful skill of being ""Drunk"".Troops - all your troop squads (used for defense and attacking planets) are individual entities, that gain experience. Seems overkill again for a game focusing on galaxy wide empires.Ship Design - I took one look at the GUI and thought, nope. Left that to the AI. It's not a pretty screen.Real Time - So much happens that you have to frequently keep pausing to keep track of things. Kinda defeats the point of a Real Time experience.Fleet Selection - I'm finding this clunky at the moment. Have to zoom to galaxy view to be able to select fleet icon, then zoom back in to control the action within a system.Finally, the price is very excessive. Sure, it's got a lot of fairly good AI within the game, a fairly useful contex sensitive ingame wiki, lots of game modes, etc. But it's a very steep price.			"

												This game is really not worth the money, wait till it is $5 or less.  There is just to many pop-ups happening and the automatic management is pretty foolish by sending mining ships etc to areas of conflict.  It would not be so bad if a lot more work was done on the UI, fonts are actually legible when hovering mouse over buttons, and generally a bit more of an easy overview of what requires what.Promises so much but yet again another game on steam that falls miles and miles short.

Posted: May 27, 2014
												I did research on this game before I purchased it.  I'm a huge fan of the 4x genre, as well as RTS, and it seemed like a great fit.  The reviews were good, and the in-game video I saw looked great.  So I took the plunge and bought it.I have to say that I was almost immediately turned off.  The tutorial didn't do a very good job of walking me through the interface.  It focused mainly on high-level 4x game information, most of which I already knew.  When I tried to interact with the interface, I became flustered immediately.  I told my planet to build a construction facility, as the tutorial suggested, and had to decide which one myself having no real basis for making such a decision.  I then couldn't even verify that it was building until I dug around enough to realize the game was paused.  Once I unpaused it, though, I still couldn't really verify that it was building until I zoomed in really close and saw some construction dust like effects.  There was no progress bar listing the build queue, or active projects, or anything that would show me progress.  I started to explore around to different planets, and was very uninspired by the whole thing.So I can't really speak to thegame depth, or the features, although they all sounded good to me.  For me, I cannot get past that interface, which really seems to be as bad as I've ever seen.  I found myself getting frustrated really quickly, and I gave up.  I've probably spent more time writing this review than I actually have playing the game.  I'm sorry I couldn't be more complete.			"

												Whoever built the combat interface should be shot. It is impossible to quickly navigate thorugh a group of ships and select them and move them around in a realtime combat 4x this is a must and there are way too many non combat ships filling the screen to spend the time picking and sorting through. You do not see the 60 plus non combat ships in the screenshots and videos i wonder why? As my planet hubs are packed with them coming and going. The interface is poorly done for a realtime game and once you get a few dozen systems under your belt it really becomes a chore to keep up with chasing and sorting combat from noncombat ships you spend half your time fustrated at the interface.

												Unfortunately this game is basically unplayable.  The fonts do not scale so at my native 3840x2160 resolution, the text boxes and action menus are basically illegible.  There is no option for either increasing the font size or switching out of full screen mode to select a tailored resolution (apparently running at 1024 x 768 was the original UX target).  So I can launch the game, squint super hard to get through the tutorial, but actual game play is impossible.Very disappointed given the rave reviews on the mechanics.  Unfortunate proof that every developer needs to provide a basic out of the box option to set games to non-full screen and choose an appropriate resolution for the gamer setup.			"

												So this is going to sound strange at first but hear me out. I am not recommending this game. It simply was completely and totally not fun or interesting. I like the idea, it was just poorly executed.So first, there is massive, massive data overload. You can get in and micromanage to the absolute lowest level you can pretty much imagine. The micromanagement is beyond tedious and you can't really see any benefit in game from tweaks because it is such a micro level of management. Second, to alieviate this data overload and micromanagement, you can automate everything. Sounds great right? It did to me too until I realized I wasn't really playing the game, I was watching the game play itself without any direction from me. I thought, ""well, I could turn off this part or that part"" but then, I felt why should I? Because the software will manage it better than I ever will. I have no desire to hop in and micromanage anything. That doesn't feel like a game, it feels like work. Third, the $60 price tag is exhorbantly high for what you get. If this game was a bagain bin $12 game on sale, sure, might be ok for sadists or Obessessive/Complusives who neeed a fix, but for the average person, even the more advanced and serious 4x player such as myself? No thanks! So, to close, the game was simply not fun in any way. Very disappointed.Suggestions for better 4x games:StellarisStardriveStardrive 2MOO2Any of those are infinitely better than this disaster of statistics. My college level algebra is easier than this.

However, if you automate things...you don't get to play. You just sit there clicking an approve button every so often when your advisors suggest an action.			"

I would advise against spending $60 on a four year old game that was written using twenty-year old technology.  And no matter how much it crashes, the support forum developers will claim the problem is on your end and the people in the forums will tell you ""oh, I run the game the same way on an old crappy machine and NEVER have a problem.""

Space Council Approval SimulatorGraphics are far below average and make indentification near impossible. In gernal the graphics pale in comparrison to other similar games such as StarSector or StarDrive.GUI is clunky, convoluted, ugly, gives little information while showing the same information multiple times and relies heavily on opperating system windows and objects.Mechanically the game runs poorly with menus opening with torn graphics and stuttering when shifting zoom levels.The game is also over complicated without depth and never explained, leaving you to rely on the AI which does a poor job and leaves you with nothing to do except sign off on suggestions.The tutorial only tells you what to do much like the AI suggestions and you are never once explained any of the mechanics the game uses or how to navigate the mess that is the interface.Sound quality is pathetic with obnoxious looping tracks such as stars constantly exploding even after zoomed away from them.Combat is dull and lifeless.Distant Worlds is a pathetic game and no where near worth the asking price. Dont even bother picking this up on sale.If you want a decient 4x space game and dont already own these following games check out StarDrive, StarRuler or Armada 2526.			"

												This game is a perfect example of why more games need a demo or a free trial option. At first glance, this game looks great. The reviews are generally good and the screenshots are deceptively positive. Under the surface however, things are very different. This game is needlessly complex, that is the short truth of it. Everything is pointlessly brought out and made complex.It has so many extra functions that everything can be automated if needed. That means the best way to play this game is by not playing it. The text for everything is so small and hard to read and there are so many extra functions for pointless things. If you're into that... you might like this game, you might also be the same type of person who thinks your microwave needs another 30 buttons instead of one marked ""popcorn"" when you want to enjoy a movie.

												I bought this game thinking it was indeed going to be the end all be all 4 x game. It was not remotely close to being that type of game. Distant Worlds is to 4 x games about as much as pinball arcade. Nearly everything is automated and you can literally walk away from the game and come back an hour later to discover you have won the game. Auto-colonize, auto-build, auto-fight, etc. etc. What's the point? There is no strategy here in fact I would say that there is not a game here to begin with, but rather an automated simulation with very poor graphics and no enjoyment-value at all... Not sure where the good reviews are coming from, but I can asure you that this ain't no Master of Orion 1 or 2 and it for sure ain't no gal civ 1, 2, or 3. I would recommend space empires or gal civ 3 over this dated misrepresented trash.			"

												 I haven't actually played the game yet, but here are my first impressions:1. On Windows 10 64-bit the game does not install correctly.  It just silently fails to run.  The fix for this isn't even part of the developer's troubleshooting tips.  A user submitted the fix for Windows 8.1 in 2014.  I find it inconceivable that the developers didn't bother fixing this problem two years ago.  To save some searching, run this for the fix:C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Distant Worlds Universe\_CommonRedist\DirectX\Jun2010\DXSETUP.exe""2. There is no support for large monitors.  I have a 29"" monitor, and I think (but am not sure) DW:U runs in 1024 x 768.  There's no option to change the resolution in the video settings.  In my humble opinion, whatever resolution the developers are using looks ugly on a large monitor.I'm actually so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the developers, that I'm not even going to try the game.  I'm going to get my money back.  I may be missing the ultimate best strategy game ever written, but there are always other games to play.			"

												This is one of if not the best 4x ever made. Few other 4x have manged to get the feeling of running a galactic civilization nailed down this well. The customisation is ever present in all aspect of play from making you're race to designing military ships,bases, defence platforms, and civilian ships in all their forms. One of the best parts of the game is that your empire has both a state and private economy, you have very little control over the private sector but its awesome feature that makes game feel more real and complex. Seeing all those private ships be it mining, transport, passenger or freighters fly about makes both your empire and the galaxy feel alive, that feeling of seeing an empire and galaxy alive is what makes you keep comming back. Most new and old 4x fail to get this sense of life in their games, which is why distant world is so much fun, you get a sense of making and developing a thriving civilization. Also this is very important the game lets you specifically target xenos on you planets and either relocate, enslave or exterminate, for the glory of mankind and the emperor.Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10Music 7/10Graphics 8/10Replayability 9/10Overall 9/10PS: You can get a death star and blow up dirty xeno homeworlds MUHAHAHA!

												Excellent in most any category and in the aweing of customization abilities it gives to your game...Takes a few spins or trys each of several hours to see how the game you've chosen or customized will work out for you.Learned other night not to select the sparesly populated option for the other species, as even in a full sector map, your not likely to find them or worse any colonies outside of your own home empire for building.One advantage though was got to become very familiar with the controls and all the galaxy maps since wasn't preoccupied with other species attacking me, etc.Part of the learning process and doesn't diminish a thing as when you start new games you can reset such for better results.Have played several rounds but not to ends and in each you learn a bit more on how you want to set it up, so a good learning experience in that.Great Game!

												The problem with most 4x games is also what is cool about them.  Everything is discrete.  You build buildings that give you +2 production.  You have ""10 units"" of population.  There are 5 different types of planets.  Etc.   This requires you to suspend your disbelief, and understand that these are just ways to represent larger quantities of people, economic development, etc. in an easier to understand metaphor.The developers of DW:U don't believe in metaphors.On the one hand, this choice makes the game impenetrable at first.  I can totally understand why someone would try the game, and decide it wasn't for them.  But if you stick with it long enough to understand the glorious complexity beneath the fog, the rewards are a 4x game that is so much more realistic and thus engrossing than any other 4x game.  There are flaws, but this game deserves a look for any fan of the genre.			"

												Let me start by saying that this game is MASSIVE! The sheer scope of this game is impressive and something that has rarely been done before. Before the game even begins you have dozens of different options when it comes to creating your galaxy. You can choose the size, number of planets, rival faction spawns, mob spawns, pirate spawns, your government, rival faction governments, etc. You can begin the game as a large and overexpanding empire, a single planet spieces finally looking towards the stars, or a young space fairing civilization that has a few established colonies, the choice is yours. Actually, you can do far more than that if you get creative. This game has some impressive automation. So much that you can choose to automate EVERYTHING and watch the game create it's own story. Better yet, you can set everything to automate with the exception of a small fleet or say a single ship. Then assume command of that fleet/ship and play the game as if you were Captain Kirk of The Enterprise! It's basically a sandbox. Do what you want, how you want, when you want. All that being said I can't recommend this game enough! Once you get past the steep learning curve this game becomes extremely rewarding and will give you THOUSANDS of hours of gameplay. And whenever you get bored you can mod the game up with the dozens of AMAZING overhauls that exist thanks to the modding community. If you don't want to overhaul the game then go with something smaller such as graphics/icon customization packs. Seriously, if you love grand strategy games, space, sandbox games, and losing yourself in a massive and unique universe then this game is for you!			"

												My favorite 4x space game and better than MoO in my opinion.It can be quite intimidating at first and has a somewhat steep learning curve. To help with this you can delegate pretty much everything to the AI and then take over the tasks whenever you are comfortable with the mechanics. This helps you get into the game quickly and enjoy it immediately. However when you become comfortable with most tasks and start to control most things yourself, the depth to the game is amazing, and makes you feel as if you really are in control of a galactic empire.Owned it before it was on Steam so the 15 hours on record isn't quite accurate. More like 115 hours.			"

Unparalleled in the 4x genre outside of marginal spreadsheet games, this is a game where you can micro all the things, or let the AI play for you.Beware the AI, though. Once you start paying attention to how it plays, you will scream with rage.Must buy for space fans and developers who want to take notes on how to do scope and how not to do AI.			"

												Stardate 164, the 18th day of the 8th month.The war with the Tamarians to our Northeast has not progressed to the expectations of the council. What was intended to be a short colonial war to annex the outer-colonies of the Tamarians has turned into a dragging war of attrition. After the unfortunate Invasion of Orto and the loss of the Alliance's Elite Guard, the empire lacks the reserves to assault the colonial militias of our enemy. However, the war progresses in our favor. Our superior naval forces continue to capture and scuttle the mining stations of our enemy, bleeding their navy dry as we hit it hard in our border sorties.Stardate 165, the 2nd day of the 2nd month.Hell is upon us. What started as a simple petty war of imperialism between two of the lesser empires has sent shockwaves throughout the galaxy. The delicate system of overlapping and contradicting guarentees and alliances has burst and thrown the galaxy into a haelstrom of practically free-for-all war.  Most empires are at war with at least four others, and many at war with eight or greater. The Ferengi Alliance sits in a tenuous position. With the supreme navy of the galaxy, direct attacks on our systems seem unlikely, however, a deeper threat looms. The empire relies on mining stations in the nebulous border-zones of the empire, which draw the ire and greed of neighbors who wish to see those resources their own. The people are already worn out from the long colonial war with the Tamarians to the north-east, and though that front has been settled, this promises to be a war on a far grander, and more destructive scale. Only the alliance with our strong trading partner to the Southeast, the Federation has held strong. This is to be, I believe, our greatest crutch in this war. As long as the trade routes between us are protected against the vast swaths of enemies, our two nations can continue to hold fast. However, at this very moment, over half a dozen of our outlying mining stations are under attack, and the pirates grow worrisomely powerful, half the galaxy feeding into them for supplies and mercenary services. Trade cut as it has been, and war on several fronts, I look to the hands of fate to decide the future of the Alliance. Hell is upon us.			"

												I've bought so many 4X games that went straight into the bin. Not so, in this case, happy to report. I've really been enjoying it.It's got great depth and massive scope. I found it easy to pick up.HOI 4 got released recently, so this interrupted me :-) Hasta la Vista though :-)			"

												Amazing game. I must have put a hundred hours in it at least before it was released on steam. 100% recommended for anyone that likes 4x space games.			"

												I really enjoy this game, and keep coming back to play it time and time again. It has such a space opera feel to it, and no games are the same, especially if you allow for the various events. The game is decidedly unbalanced, which normally is a bad thing, but  in this case, it works. It also has a vibrant community of modders and players who are willing to help on the forums.I played Distant Worlds way before it became available on Steam, and still have a few non-Steam installations with various combinations of mods.I recently started to record a few series of game play, which you can find here. Hopefully they can help you make your decision on the game.			"

												Great game! Learning curve is a bit steep. Finally getting around to playing this game which has been sitting in my Steam Library for about a year now. I would recommend you scope out some of the  Let's Plays below on You tube on Distant Worlds: Universe to get a feel on how to play this game which is very complex and also print out a keyboard shortcut list. Now that I got the game setup and the playing procedures some what figure out it plays great.You build -ships - stations - research facilities - and much - much more - You negotiate diplomacy - You colonize - You trade and You can play as a pirate. Distant Worlds is a long play game. My only complaint is after a Steam install on Windows 10 you ""might"" have to configure the Direct X and few other programs. My other complaint are the graphics which are bit dated but that is of no consequence. Be nice if the devs created a Linux release? But .. It's still a great playing game!Distant Worlds: Universe (Help on Setup)(Steam) Distant Worlds Troubleshooting Guidehttp://steamcommunity.com/app/261470/discussions/0/540742399466842060/Some Youtube Let's Play....Distant Worlds Universe - Extreme Survival LP - Ep001 (This guy is good!

												Probably the best 4X strategy I've played in my life. Cons: requires some youtubing / browsing to figure out how to play.Totally worth it. Sincerely.			"

												This is one of the best 4x space games ever. It still has issues that need to be addressed such as with space flight involving fuels under autopilot and the length of wars. Other than that one of my favorite all time space 4x games.			"

												I have changed my rating to thumbs-up-with-a-dire-warning (previous comments below just in case anyone wants to read this crazy journey).  Based on the long learning curve, poor UI and inconsistent automation, I do not recommend this game for any 4x gamer who likes things organized, manageable, smooth, or controllable.My initial rating reflected this, and I still believe some gamers will get more frustration than fun from the game; however, going back to play other 4x games I hold in high regard showed me how refined DW is in many key aspects.  It has superior maps, design capabilities, battle mechanics, and end game options than its predecessors.  And to be fair, the UI and automation issues stem from the epic scope of the game, the sheer magnitude of possibilities, than from any programmer error (with a few minor quibbles as the exceptions).Though don't mistake this for glowing praise, because the UI can still give you headaches (literally) from the fine print and unwieldy processes, and the automation will still annoy you even as you learn to work around it (the largest learning curve is understanding what the game's helper does well and terribly, and knowing when to use each).  For example, if you use most of the automation in the beginning, it could very well cost you the game in tougher situations; yet, if you manually handle most of your empire by the time your race is sprawling across 5+ sectors, the micromanagement tedium can quickly wear you down.  The game is nearly as vast as actual space, with both the massive challenges and pains that brings with it.So, I only recommend this game to those who love mental pain, or who thought GalCiv2 or the Endless or Civilization series were too simple.  And even then, they will have to learn an awful lot about the game to be able to play it successfully--I recommend a tailored easy setup with few pirates and no story events for your initial dose.  If that's too easy, then maybe--just maybe--you can survive the madness that is full settings with all the options turned on.---------------After redoubling my efforts and spending about 100 hours more in the game, I feel compelled to edit my original review (below).  The game's steep learning curve makes it feel like you're trying to herd cats, with not-a-damn-thing doing what it should.Most notably, guard ships often won't stay where you put them (and pirates destroy your stuff the moment the guarding force has left to do something else, like refuel or chase a scout ship they cannot possibly catch), and the AI behavior is quite different between fleets and single ships--it took some painful examples to learn that I couldn't make a single ship do what a fleet could do, and vice versa.Trusting the automation to do the work for you means being terribly inefficient (and often ineffective) which some races simply cannot afford to do.  So this requires a tremendous amount of learning/research to figure out the workarounds--much of the challenge of the game is learning how to accomplish your far-reaching goals despite the ""helpful"" AI.Once I got past that stage, I could enjoy a fantastically complex/vast game and still be challenged on a level that Endless Space (and all the others) just can't manage.So bottom line: if you want a smooth, fun 4x game, then Endless Space is an exceptional offering.  If you want something far more epic to push your limits of management, then this game will probably scratch that itch.. . . . . . . . . . . . .(Original review:)Do NOT buy this game unless you have time for a large micromanagement job.  Your mileage may vary, but I spent about 3 hours watching Let's Play vids (the best way to get up to speed on the complicated UI and other not-so-obvious things), downloaded the must-have mods for UI, graphics, and expansion, and then spent about 30 hours learning the limits of the ""Intelligent Automation"" (a relative phrase, to be sure).Various tasks like character placement, build order, ship action are often terribly handled--you know, the important stuff that must go smoothly for you to dominate a competitive galaxy.  If you care for that kind of stuff, you will end up grinding your teeth or removing the automation that's so flawed, like a fleet admiral taking over some backwater fleet (and refusing to stay in a more appropriate fleet), or a scientist with a negative to a certain research picking that type of lab to inhabit; how about scouts that skip many unexplored systems to go for some far away star with no current relevance to your budding empire, or resources that go to civilian ships while the mining facilities that could actually provide the needed resources remain unfinished?And then there are timing issues, certain things happening out of order that highlight the flaws of a real-time game on this scale.  The particular example that made me write this review: I was at war with an empire and just so happened to have a colony ship filled with that race.  Figuring they would give me trouble, I had marines in orbit to garrison right away.  Proactive of me, yes?  So, I colonize and at the same moment tell the troop carrier to unload onto the planet.  The planet revolts, wins some bogus ground war (where they instantly got 8k troop strength is a mystery--they should still be bleary-eyed from the stasis pods or whatever).  And then the a-holes give the planet to one of my allies--all before the troops who were in orbit could get on the ground?  What kind of idiot operation is this?All fun aside, there is no way to enjoy this game with the AI screwing you over (whether or not you automate).  This could be an epic, satisfying game if more kinks get ironed out.[See comments for additional clarification.]			"
