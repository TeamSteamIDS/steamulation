												Warlords isn't as huge an expansion pack as some of the previous Civilization titles have had, but it's the best balanced, most refined expansion pack a Civilization title has ever had, and it carries more than enough new content to justify the purchase price.			"

												I've enjoyed this episode the most, usually playing the Terra map in order to be able to expand first into an unclaimed territory.  The ability to modify the game text by editing XML has been fun -- part of the enjoyment in both Civ II and Civ IV for me has been editing the resources.On my platform (Win 7/2.8GHz HP home PC/8 MB RAM), the UI alternates between snappy and very slow.  After a while (presumably a memory garbage collection) it gets fast again.  Using some of the shortcuts like right-click to move makes the slow-down bearable.			"

												No point in getting this as all the functionality of Warlords apart from the scenarios is included in Beyond the Sword. So get that instead. I've only got this because it was included in Civ 4 complete.Compare what you get with both in the links below.http://www.civfanatics.com/civ4/warlords/http://www.civfanatics.com/civ4/bts/ "

												I love this game and this expantion, its fun to play and reletively simple. Dont really have to go in debth of game mechanics to understand whats going on, further more you can just get ahead in technology and kick everyone around in theyr buts. Just in general pretty well done game. There is some thing that i would love to be in it but for me its way way bether then civ v. :)			"

												Warlords might be my least favorite Civ 4 expansion, that being said it is in no way a bad game. It feels to be smaller than the other expansions, even so, if you are just looking for a little bit of extra content for Civ 4 this may be where you want to look.			"

												This is my second favourite addon for Civilization 4, my favourite being Beyond the Sword. It is wonderful in its scenerios. To name a few, there's Rise of Rome, which I have yet to play, Chinese Unification, my favourite, Vikings, a close second, and Barbarians, a close third. What it adds in scenerios, it lacks in content. There is almost no content. I would only get this for the scenerios, but it's still worth it. It would also be FAR better with achievmentsPlease ignore the ""15.6 Hours,"" I've played A LOT more but not on Steam.			"

												its too bad that once you try on prince difficulty that the stupid cuntiness of the programmers makes your odd 1/20 of winning. some party will almost always have tech and number superiority over you and waste your time. its very frustrating. there is no middle ground. you will have 20 resources or you will lose. use ctrl-w to cheat back. there is no other way. make no mistake, at this difficulty level or harder, the programmers are just cheating - somehow, civs with 2 cities keep up in tech with your 20 even through you have chosen the ""no tech"" trading option. somehow, a civ you have been on par with for the whole game now has 100 units at your gates...oh, and another civ joins them so there are now 100 units on either side of you (even through one of them is your trading partner and isnt mad at you). you can never recover from the cheating of the cpu, so after wasting hours to get close to the end of the game, the cpu players magically have vast superiority even through they didnt have it before. dont waste your time on any strategy game from this company, the new civ is even more pointless and poorly designed than civ 4			"
