												Aaah this mess and what a mess it is.Back when The Banner Saga: Factions launched there was so much talk. Talk about ripping off the kickstarter backers (which they weren't ripped off they just never bothered to read), talk about the lawsuit for use of the word 'saga', talk about how the game was so perfectly balanced that it risked becoming stale.Now no one talks about The Banner Saga: Factions anymore.Looks like that last one came true.First of all this is a mini-game, a subgame if you will. The point of this game is solely to PvP so do not confuse it with the main product and likewise this review is for this game not the main game itself.TBS:F is like a game of chess...With only 4 pieces. But wait, each of those pieces come in 3(4) flavours so their is variety!Except not really. Confused? We gotta go deeper Leo!You have your typical 3 classes, you know Tank, damage dealer, how does it go again? shield smasher? Yeah thats it. Whats a healer?Now without sounding like an instruction manual every unit has 2 bars, a health bar and an armor bar. armor reduces damage but the lowest amount you can do is 1hp. Be warned however that losing your armor is a big deal and a low armor or armorless unit will be cut down in short order! This makes games very methodical. Do you snipe hits for 1 damage each trying to score an early kill, or do you whittle down armor and then deal devastating damage to quickly mop up and win? Afterall their are no healers so every match is a war of attrition!It works out really well and I can't do it justice with words alone, it is a simple idea that could have gone really badly but here it is balanced perfectly.Of course not all things are created equally in any video game and this one is no different so what sounds like an awesome and rivetting gameplay experience ends as a battle of patience as a losing player with 1 archer can still run away and then pick your remaining units off and trust me, they will. So every team has archers because being dumb doesn't pay off on the battlefield and most matches become mirror matches. Remember when I compared this game to chess? Imagine introducing a new piece into a game of chess. Imagine the sheer balance upset and new tactics that would bring to the table?! This game suffers that exact same issue because the balance is so fine, it is too fine and very easy to upset that balance.So what happened?It stagnated, what did you expect? A competitive game needs a lot to keep the crowds coming back. Look at DOTA, new champions every month is it? Streetfighter, new iterations just about every 2 years. This game? Not a damn thing since release.The music is fine as are the sound effects and honestly who even gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ The music has to be great for people to sit up and take notice and here it is just above average. But the art, this game is graphically a piece of art. Playing this game is like visiting an art gallery it just looks so good!But you play a game to be entertained (usually) and this game is fleeting fun. Their is fun to be had don't get me wrong but when you decide to shake it up a bit and really get into the game you will realize their isn't much more to it to explore, what you see is what you get. So I can't recommend this game.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												So you put together a team of viking and giant warriors and fight short tactical turnbased fights and tournaments to get renown, wich is used to buy more space for warriors or upgrade your warriors. You get matched against players with the same combined level of fighters, resulting in very even matches.The combat system is identical to the banner saga, with  the only exception of some small changes to the abilities of some units.Though I strongly recommend the game, there are some issues that you should know before playing.First of all it is a player vs player only game. There is no training mode or single player, if you want that you have to buy The banner Saga (strongly recommended as well).The second major issue is that the game seems kind of forgotten by the developers, there are memory leak issues that cause lag, and updates are close to nonexistent. The third issue is that most player quit due to the first two, or the fact that the gameplay changes very little over time, resulting in very few players online at any moment. This of course can cause painfully long periods of waiting for a match. This is also to some extent caused by the matching system, in wich you may be unable to battle anyone at all if you don't have enough warriors to put together teams of different levels (ironically happens predominantly to new players).With those things out of the way, this is really fun and challenging game for you tactics fans. The turn system is different from many other games and is of extreme tactical importance, and to me the number of classes and restrictions are enough for a large umber of tactics and combos. Adressing the issues: The first becomes a non-issue after like four fights. The community is great and everyone are excited for new players and will help you get started. The second issue is bad, but in theory if more people play it the devs should work more to upgrade it. It will also likely get a boost after the release of newly announced TBS2. The third issue is the hard one. I personally don't think its boring, just as I dont think chess is boring, even if chess hasnt got any upgrades or new skins for decades =). And remember that many quit because there are too few players already. what kind of logic is that? But I won't judge anyone who played the game for a year and a half, waiting for someone to fix  the lag and crash issues, and stopped playing when nothing happened.Try it out though. it's Free! and fun!

												No one plays this game....It seems like it could be fun but PvP matches are the only option and there are just not enough people playing to even find a match.  They really should have though about having PvE for leveling and training.  apparently the tournament is a thing but I can't get to level 12 to participate because no one plays quickmatch in my level range haha.

There haven't been any huge balance tweaks in a while, but the core game is amazing. Can't wait for the single player to release!			"

												If you have played The Banner Saga, you know what to expect.If you have not, well, it is a game for those MMO enthusiasts who like a slower pace, more calculating approach and generally leaning towards chess rather than Wipeout in their games. Only complaints I would have are the same as for the ""original"" TBS: we could use more animation and more (i.e. any) voiceover. Other than that, the graphics are delightful, the atmosphere is great and the audio is fantastic.Definitely for the calmer, more realxed gamer. If you want a game for long winter evenings you will not be disappointed.			"

												An excellent game with plenty of strategy if you persevere and learn the mechanics.   In contrast to some other reviews out there, there is no real random element to this game if you learn how to play it, and learning the game is made all the easier by the friendly community which are always happy to help.  I can't reccommend this game enough and as it's free there's no reason not to try it!			"

												This game has sucked up more of my life then any other game of Steam to date and with good reason.  Essentially a complex version of chess, this game became my obsession for a good six months.  While the servers are not nearly as busy as they were during its hayday, the game is still a superb demonstration of how to develop a rich deep combat turn-based combat system with high replay value.  Add to that some of the most beautiful hand drawn artwork I have seen since Monkey Island 3 and you have a winner.  For those looking for a better single player, offline experience, I recommend the single player game that was the catalyst for this, The Banner Saga (and hopefully soon) its sequel, The Banner Saga 2.

												I am not a big fan of Strategy games but this one swayed me. The art is insanely good. I am wating for the single player game to release. The scrore is also great and goes weill with the overall feel of the game. The setting si very interesting as well. The mechanics are simple enough to learn with ample tutorials and help provided at the click of a button. I would say it needs to be expanded with more variation between the character models, at least in multiplayer. Pallette swaps are nice but I would like to see more. This setting begs for it!Pick it up free then pay a bit of money as I did to support it. Great title.			"

												Not only that it possesses such depth (both story and gameplay wise), but it also represents a rare blend of mind-bending strategy and beautiful visuals.- The art style of the game is a story of its own. - Unlike the original Banner Saga, Factions is a purely pvp experience.- The combat is turn-based and it is very well done.- Strategically, every battle is like a tree - each branch represents a unique path and there are    quite many to choose form!- The game is very complex and the more you play, the more new layers you start to discover.- It feels like chess, but is much more fun.- It is very well balanced and for each team lineup there is a counter lineup - you only need to find the right one!- The music and the sound effects blend in very nicely and provide a calming ambient between and during battles.- The community is small, but very warm and polite - you trully have a feeling like you are in a mead hall.If you are a fan of good turn-based strategy, complex mechanics, beautiful visuals and good music to accompany it all I highly recommend this game to you and if you aren't, give it a try, it will be worth your time :)			"

												You can see the more technical reviews of this game at IGN, etc., but I want to highlight the one thing that makes this game so great: simplicity that belies its depth.  The number of combinations of moves and overarching strategies that can win a given match are so numerous that having played this game for months, I haven't exhausted trying new things and even succeeding at them.  Accusations that the game is 'boring' for reasons such as lack of unit diversity, etc., actually fail to see the best part of the game.			"

												Matches take forever because you are required to do more actions/confirmations each turn, animations are slow and opponents intentionally wait for turn to end.So, just play the single player game because multiplayer isn't fun when you have so long matches and you get so little rewards. Upgrades cost too much so you can Pay To Advance if you feel like it (you probably don't).			"

												EDIT: The developers have abandoned post-game support for Factions until they finish the singleplayer trilogy. It's still a fun game, but the population has bottomed out. I played 400+ hours of Factions, and only wish it was supported more, as the potential was so high. I don't regret a single minute of playing, and thank the developers for at least making the game. My hope is that one day they return to Strand, re-release as a Advanced Edition with all the new characters from the singleplayer into Factions, add campaign maps and AI battles, and possibly the other cool features they've talked about in the past (2v2, town building and management). It can be where all their fans from the trilogy continue their viking journey, maybe even importing their own heroes from the singleplayer to the multiplayer. I doubt that Stoic will deliver on that, and if not the game will still remain one of my past favorites.--Great visuals. Very unique gameplay mechanics, may not be to everyone's playstyle or liking. I like the in-game sounds and art style. It isn't pay-to-win at all. It does have a learning curve, and requires some grinding to get past the initial ""newbie zone"". Power level 6 is the motherland, aim to reach that for more frequent matches. I'm looking forward to the singleplayer counterpart to this. Would recommend this game to turn-based strategy enthusiasts, or viking fans. Not for the faint of heart, you will probably be sent to Valhalla for your first few matches. If you're unsure if its right for you, just try it out for a few games, its free after all.			"

												Great game. Artwork is unique and amazing. The strategy has a lot of depth and you'll get punished if you just blindly do something in a battleThere's a few things that this game definitely needs however. The major one would be more base unit typesRight now it only has Warrior, Shieldbanger, Archer and Raider. Each of these units can be upgraded to 3 types. But I believe the game needs AT LEAST 2 more base units to give it more depth. I think the single player has some more units so I hope they add that to the multi as well and add more base units in futureAlso a little more customization would be nice. Only customization you currently have is different colors for units which looks a bit repetitive after a whileAll in all a solid strategy game but has potential for to do even better			"

												Being a fan of both games i can say that this is the game graphics and feeling with an endless training mode( quick match or ranked). The bigest problem here is that the combat was good because the troops were different but here you fight humans with the same combat level wich means it's incredibly mind blowing boring because everything depends on who is dum enough to attack first or who makes a small mistake.Also, there are no items, to level up heroes takes a lot of time and you really have nothing to do that to grind the same endless training match endless.Also, you can buy renown with $$$.Pay to win, endless grind.....why? just why make such a bare bone game and call it multiplayer. Don't even bother, it's like a game of chess and you both play with kings, it's slow but if someone makes a mistake the game is decided			"

												If you like the combat and art style of The Banner Saga, then you will find joy in Factions. Matches consist of ranked or unranked ""friendlies"" where you compete against 1 other person using a set-up of the classes found in the original game - Varl and Human. Each match earns you Renown (should you win) and the ability to level up your team, much like was done in the game. I've seen some reviews commenting on the lack of people on the server, or matches hard to come by, and I write this review mostly to say that I haven't had any difficulty finding a match. In fact, I often see a lot of the higher level (by +2 levels) matches popping up looking for an opponent.The beauty of the team system is you can level some favourites but also have a team of lower level so you can try out different play styles without waiting longer than a couple minutes for an opponent. I imagine a lot of this relies on the time of day you are looking, but the community is quite active and with TBS2 shortly being released, I see even more people coming into Factions.  "

												I haven't played too much of this game yet. Just a couple hours. But from what I have already been involved in, this game is a keeper.First off, this game is fantastic for what it has to offer as a Free To Play. Not only will it captivate you as a user, and encourage you to play more and more, but you are never once cornered to pay towards micro transactions as an individual.I have always loved being involved with turn-based strategy games, and a well known similarity too this kind of game is Chess. One player takes a turn, then the other. This provides a relaxing atmosphere for the user as whole, but at the same time making the gameplay quite a nail-biter.When I first joined the community of TBS, I didn't quite know what to expect. But after a quick, and easy to understand tutorial I was able to get along quite nicely. As several users will say at one point, you can get quite distracted by the beautifully crafted retro graphics, and as I did- miss your turn.As earlier stated, gameplay is relaxing. You have a fair amount of time to perform each action with every individual unit, and the turn-based aspect of the game gives you time to plan out your ways to attack, pillage, and dominate the opposing player.I'd like to talk about the community, not as a game, but within the discussion of players. Right as I came into the game, and said my first words into global chat, I was warmly welcomed. Every player is nice, respectful, and easy going. You can easily make friends with your opponent, even if you are trying to bash in their head with a shield twice the size of their unit. Some may like to trashtalk you here and there, but it doesnt spell unsportsmanship. Hopefully this review has encouraged you to play this game, as much as every other review. I'm looking forward to facing you in The Banner Saga: Factions game.Infynus			"

												Gotta get on late at night when our neighbors across the pond are up, otherwise games are fairly sparse.Claims of pay-to-win are false.  The matchmaker is very balanced, it'll always match you up with someone at the same level as your own faction.  You can buy pre-leveled soldiers, but this only influences who you get matched up with.  Once you're in a match it's your own fault if you do poorly.  Money won't save you.If you liked Heroes of Might and Magic, or Banner Saga, or tabletop wargames, give it a shot.  It's an excellent free game that rewards patience, planning, and strategy.			"

The animation is just absolutely beautiful and captivating And the gameplay interface is just perfect something you dont see much in todays games that have too much going on in the interface can be very distracting and annoying. If you like strategy/chess this game gets down to that point. I would definitlely recommend this game to those stratigic enthusiast.			"

												I wasn't interested in trying this at first. I got on the kickstarter for the singleplayer game still in development, but this is a very interesting tactical game. Two clever features - health and attack strength being the same and the alternating round-robin turn progression - make this more vicious and tenacious than most other turn based tacticals. The outcome is always decided late and the combatants usually pile high.			"

												An extremely deep, yet surprisingly simple tactical RPG experience.  Taking a step away from the traditional mechanics of the genre and being beautifully hand animated in a style reminiscent of Disney classics, it'd be an understatement to simply call The Banner Saga a breath of fresh air.  The best part about Factions (the standalone multiplayer client), beneath the fun of playing against your peers, is that it is entirely free to play and devoid of game altering advantages via microtransactions.  I couldn't recommend it more.			"

												A superb tactical turn based straegy game. If you have played Final Fantasy tatics, Chess or any other turn based stragey game and enjoyed it you will love this!The graphics are stunningly stylised and mood settingly effective without removing from the gameplay with unecessary distractions. The tatcical gameplay however is second to none, this is final fantasy tactics on awhole new level. This Arcadia but far,far more tactical then you might be there. With a chess styled ELO ranking system, tournaments and ranked unit progression this game has it all! This is also just the multiplayer pvp portion, the sp game is to come with a story line too! Stop reading this and just go download it, you'll love it!			"

												So I clicked on this because it seemed cool. Then I downloaded it because it's a F2P multiplayer tactical rpg that's ♥♥♥♥ING TURN-BASED. WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE THE NERDGASM.Anyways, this game nails its mechanics and its atmosphere perfectly, though there are some connectivity and freezing issues at present. Luckily, I've only had one game freeze. This is also not Pay to Win, but Play to Win. I highly reccomend this game to everyone who's even interested in strategy or vikings. Especially that last part.			"

												Normally I don't like Free-2-Play-Games and the likes because they often feel like the most commercial games of all. However, I guess as long as it's not ""pay to win"" or ""pay or else you'll have to grind for a thousand years"" it's ok.I'm glad I checked this game out. I was intrigued by the art design and still am.I have only had 7 matches or so, so this is not a ""complete"" review, but thought I'd let you guys know this seems to be worth checking out (being free2play).In the beginning I had the feeling the mechanics were rather slim and every match would be pretty much the same, but I quickly realized that I knew only half of the strategic possibilities (and maybe tomorrow I'll say I knew only a quarter ;) ). It doesn't take you more than an hour to get through the little tutorial, watch the two further tutorial videos (click on the banner in the upper right of the town screen to get there) and look at the special abilities of your warriors in the proving halls. Then you pretty much know all you need; the rest you'll learn on the battle field and when upgrading to other warrior types with different abilities.The game has an atmospheric presentation and sound, is rather ""quiet"" but the tension in the matches can get your blood boiling.For now, the game is in a rather early state (so a full review wouldn't even be fair). Everything seems to work (except for battling friends for now) but sometimes you cannot get into the game because of server load or maintenance. Also the game feels a little sluggish and laggy at times, but that's not much of a problem because of the turn-based nature of the game.The in-game purchases don't seem to be necessary to enjoy the game (otherwise I would immediately stop playing it). Other than other colors for your warriors' clothes you can buy ""renown"" which is kinda like the currency in this game. You need it to upgrade your warriors and expanding your barracks. But you also earn renown for playing matches (even more when winning them) and it doesn't take forever for you to earn enough to upgrade your team from time to time. And since matches are put together via match-making, you won't have to fight an utterly overpowered team.So if you're really impatient, you can spend money (and I'm sure there will be plenty people who will), but you'll have just as much a good gaming experience without; so that's a fair system in my book.If you like chess-like games and/or nordic flair, try this game - it's not like it costs ya ;)See y'all on the battlefield (when friend matches are back on) :]			"

												I was not even able to play this online. Why? Because it disconnects all the time. As I have searched on the Internet, it turned out it is a problem from the beginning, and a lot of people have complained about it. But still the developers have done nothing about it... I would not recommend this for anybody as a free game, not to mention paying for it. Disconnects in a multiplayer games is just a mockery. And here it is not an unfortunate case, but rather a norm.

												Now that I've had some time with this I can see it's a great game. It's fault lies in the early stages of finding low Power Level players and earning Renown (the currency) for leveling and other things. The strategy feels fair. It's not like XCOM where you curse the heavens that you missed a 90% shot. It can happen to archers but only if you choose to take that risk. There is a lot of time when no one is on but this game is far from dead. Great thing is it's free to play and you can see for yourself :)			"

However it's differs depending on times of the day, easier in the evenings.I hope it get’s updated with new classes from The Banner Saga 2.//Cheers "

												A unique turn based strategy offering, and the multiplayer component of the banner saga. the combat system is excellent and well worth trying if you are a fan of deep yet simple to learn complexity. A refreshing change from the usual DnD style hitpoints and damage systems so often employed, your strength is both your offense and your health in the banner saga. A healthy amount of planning and positioning is required if you wish to be the victor in battles. Overall a well thought out title that costs you no more than your time to check out. If you are interested in the single player game, do yourself a favor and check out factions .			"

												What drew me into this game was its unique art style which is simply mindblowingly beautiful and reminds me of the handdrawn qualities of Disney's Sleeping Beauty. But what kept me playing this game is its interesting turn based combat that feels like custimizable chess. The interaction between armor and health keeps me wondering if I should be pecking down an opponents health in order to diminish how much damage they can deal or take a chunk of their armor for a more effective follow up. The mixture of upgrades for each unit and variety of units are far from endless but it gives each match a different spin of a proven formula.			"

												An extremely fun and interesting game, with a bit of a learning curve at first. Deep strategy allows for even an underdog to pull off a crushing victory. My only complaints are the many bugs I have encountered which are not gamebreaking, but are a constant annoyance and also the extreme limitation of customization for both your army and individual units. This is a huge disappointment to me, as I love me some major customization and personalizing my units. Those things aside, the game is free, so you lose nothing by trying it out, and I recommend you do just that if you are a fan of grid-based, tactical or thinking in general games.No longer any bugs that I can see, but sadly, only a remnant of a community left and as pvp is the only option I know of, the game is largely unplayable most of the time unless you have friends who are willing to play.

												It's a decent take on chess if you can get past the technical issues (it runs horribly and for a 2d turn based combat game it's unacceptable, slow and everything lags, even typing is in slow motion, it crashes frequently about 1 in every 3 matches, and I've experienced the exact problems on 2 separate machines).  If/when they clean this up it is definitely worth the download.  I would not put any actual money into it though, such as the pay to customize your pieces.  This is online dueling only, I do recommend buying the separate single player game when it's on sale.  There'd be a much bigger community if this game ran smoothly, but right now it's one of the worst performing games I've ever played, and the community is nice but very small.  You'll probably be held back unable to use your upgraded pieces because you won't find a match at the higher tiers.  Rated matches use the ELO scoring method and an average match is 15 minutes long, but the game isn't stable enough to move up in ranked matches so I mostly played quick matches (same thing but without the score).

												The Banner Saga: Factions is easy to pickup, but offers incredibly deep gameplay. The real strategy comes in deciding on the composition of your team, and whether you are going to play defensively or offensively, focus on ranged or melee, have one or two powerful units or spread the ranks of your team evenly.I've played games that are outright brawls, and games that have been about cautious manuevering trying to outflank the other team. I would recommend giving it a fair try over a number of days as durng my first few hours I almost quit because the combat seemed too chaotic and I didn't appreciate the nuances.I really like the variety of classes, and love that some of the classes I initially regarded as weak have become my favourites. In fact I would say there are no weak classes and any unit can be good if you use it appropriately.This game is not in any way pay to win; each side builds a team of equal level based on character rank, so battles are evenly matched. So for instance a rank 6 team could be 1+1+1+1+1+1 or 0+0+1+1+2+2 etc. The payment options just allow you to build that team faster (or even instantly with enough purchased renown), so that does not give any advantage within a skirmish. I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who likes turn based tactical battles where skill is the overriding factor.			"

												Note:  As of this review, I've not played the single player version, The Banner Saga.This game is a very simple turn-based brawler.  In terms of pure mechanics, I'd say it plays like a stripped down X-COM: EU/EW, minus perma-death.  Or like viking flavored chess.  Of course, both of these examples are simplifications.I really enjoy the balance of the gameplay.  Even though it's pure PVP, I've never felt cheated, which IMO is unusual for a competitive multiplayer game.  There's only a limited stock of different units, part of why the game is so balanced.On the other hand, limited unit type means limited unit variation, which is unfortunate.  I've come to understand that besides not including enemy faction units (the dredge) from the single player, there is at least one more viking unit missing.Additionally, you earn Renown (your currency and XP) at a slow rate, clearly to induce you to go to the shop and spend real money.  However, paying doesn't grant access to anything that anyone else can except for skins and extra renown.  While I've spent a shameful amount of time on this game, I have a proportionately substantial team to show for it and I haven't paid a dime.  Unlike other F2Ps where I wondered ""Well what was the point?"" when I finally logged off. It's free.  It's balanced and fun.  It's rewarding and beautiful to look at.  I fully recommend giving it a try.			"

												This game has a ton of potential. However, the fact that it is literally taken right out of the original banner saga story, and the fact that no one is able to play the game, as there is no one to play against in a multiplayer only game, makes this game a little less than promising. I would not waste time on this until the developers work on the game, if at all.			"

												I never thought I'd play a ""Free 2 Play"" multiplayer game in my life, heck, I even made a personal rule against it. Needless to say, The Banner Saga: Factions has become an exception to that rule. An excellent turn-based tactical battle game, with some wonderful 2D animation, Factions finds a comfortable place between being a Tactics Ogre/FFTactics/Fire Emblem style and something much closer to Chess. The primary reason the game skews closer to the timeless tactical classic is in it's turn order/initiative system, which keeps the game remarkably fair even when one player is ahead of another. However, some of the core elements you'd draw from other tactical RPGs (or just RPGs with turn based combat) such as special attacks are present, so it really is a hybrid. As someone mentioned in chat recently, this is sort of like the holotable game R2D2 plays with Chewbacca, except with Vikings. Now, you're not going to find much depth here beyond playing matches of this ""Viking Holotable Chess"" against other players. That's literally all there is. On top of that, the competition is mighty fierce, and the players who have stuck around are going to destroy you ably until you learn to form a solid strategy and build a team around it. But all that said, if you like testing your tactical mind for briefer snatches of time rather than dropping several hours into a single player outing, then this should certainly have you playing. Plus, it's ""free"" (all of the buyable items are either cosmetic or boosts to unlock things faster, but unlocks do not give an edge, so it's fine balance wise), so there's little reason not to try it.

												I do love this game. But.. meh.It started with the intent of looming updates, and don't get me wrong - they were awesome, in the beginning. There were golden gates shining on the horizon. Or more appropriately, burning gates looming, the ashes falling upon as we marched. But no, sadly  we all died on the trek.. the next update... years away!Like what-the-fuq? I love the single player, and it's awesome we could be your pawns for it's betterment, no regrets. But we were mislead. What about all these new players. The base would be so much larger if you implemented *ONE* new unit. Thought we were supposed to get more, with the first chapter? Nah, scratch that. And yeah, ""blah blah blah"".  A one-unit integration would be entirely manageable for imbalances. Even if it were to be over a couple of months. I've met way too many people who want to play this game who say ""well f*ck it"" 'cause it's so hard to play consistently or evenly.So, as a huge fan, I say shame on you Stoic.			"

												This is a pretty cool game. Great mechanics decent story behind it pretty easy to pick up. There are definitaly enough cons to warn against playing it though. It has a very grindy feel for how you level up and earn stuff unless you buy renown, but its major problem is it usually takes 10 min or so in a wait time to get a match and then its rarely at your level. That is the biggest problem with this game is that it is only multiplayer, and it is difficult to get a match which is pretty much a cardinal sin for a multiplayer only game.			"

Product received for free
												Total disaster, dead, pay to win garbage. While confused by the battle mechanics I have only 3 choices in choosing a game path: Quick Match, Ranked or Tournament. Since Ranked required a certain power (which is difficult to obtain) you cannot play it. All the same for tournament. Therefore you are left with a single option and that is to repeatedly play QUICK MATCH. I did so, was matched 2 times with the same opponent and waited 15 minutes the third time just to not be matched with anyone because there are NO PLAYERS.Please discourage these kind of games and let them die. Free to play did not save this pile of junk so waste your breath.tl;dr: Should you download this? NO! Invest your time in something else.			"

												This is a fun tactical game.  The game breaking issue is if you are losing you cannot surrender.  Make a bad move or 2 early, you lose some units.  Admit deafeat, but if you actaully surrender, you do not gain the renown (renown = xp) from the match.  So you have to stay in game and use each unit until they are all dead.  If I know I have lost, let me surrender and more on to the next battle.  Why make me stay and take the  beating.  Not fun at all.			"

												Ok so i had this game for 3 days, i spend day 1 and 1 learning how to play and getting to know the game while being unable to play, on day 3 i finally get a game and guess what? im level 1 they are incredibly op, and its my fault i did not bought the game to play a single player campaing. So because it said i was free i waited for 3 days for a game to ALLOW me to play and let me realise the incredibly big paywall that this game has. Either buy the game and win or dont and be a punching bag, its sad to see something that looks amazing turn into a money grabbing pay to win game.			"

Product received for free
												I wish I could give this a better review but I can't.The first 5-10 minutes of the game were good; good story, tutorial, there seemed a nice amount of info and depth to it. And then once the basic start of the story is done, I've been left with a group of fighters in a village with nothing to do. We can't travel anywhere, there is no mission to follow, no way to improve characters without leveling up. Trying to find an opponent has been non existent. There just doesn't seem to be anybody playing on the server to challenge. I'm not sure if I just haven't had any good luck with this. I know this was a free game, but it's a game that could have encouraged me to buy the other games if this proved to my liking.I can only give this game a 3/10, and that's only for the potential I see was in this game			"

												Although I was unable to 'Be Good' at the game, this game shows a lack of originality... In all honesty, this game is nothing new compared to any other turn based games. Although, I will give it this... It has great imagery. It was beautiful and the Intro completely captured my attention. The entire idea of Vikings and Giants is original and if you're into that, then don't let the lack of Originality in the Turn-Based game genre push you away. I think this game is worth playing, but I sadly don't think I will be playing again.			"

												This game took a very long time to download, and there is absolutely no ramp up into matchmaking. They give you a tutorial, and then set you loose. If you decide to use your ""renown"" (the in-game currency) to promote your characters or buy new characters, beware! You can only play against those that are at EXACTLY the same power as you, and if you run out of renown and no have no one to play against, tough luck, you'll have to use REAL MONEY to get enough renown to fix your mistake. Nickle and dimes you to get money. I would highly prefer that this just had an upfront cost and gave you access to the whole game, and enough characters so that you can choose your power level to correspond to those that you can play against.

												At the moment, I do not suggest this game, BECAUSE:Apparantly in order to do anything at all in this game, you literally have to pay for it. Excitin' isn't it? Tried for close to an hour to get a match going as a newb. Didn't get a single bite. I LOVED the tutorials, but... it really should be more like March of War, allowing for NPC play, and say... allowing multiplayer combat as the 'buy the multiplayer, fight other players, or stay in free-mode and only fight NPCs'. Would allow for a much better newbie experience.Yes, I know, March of War is a COMPLETELY different turn-based combat system and era, and way of doing things, but it has the 'fight for free' deal down for fighting NPCs. Fighting players is more of a 'pay to win' as well, but it gets stuff done and I've been playing it for over a year almost.Again: Allow for single-player combat and switch the 'pay to play' to the multiplayer aspect. I will now be deleting what I thought was going to be a fun and interesting game, with cinematics that drew my eye, as DUST: An Elysian Tail did. Call me when you change how you do things, Devs!			"

It's only multiplayer though so it can be a little annoying when there's no one on around your power level to play with. Beyond that though the art work and design is beautiful. I just love the art style of the entire thing. The game itself feel pretty well balanced and has some pretty cool mechanics.			"

												Very good and deep TBS game. You can gain and choose from 12 different classes (4 base units), and there are more to come.  There are endless possibilities how you can choose your 6 units, so every fight can be different. So far there are NO P2W elements, you can gain every gameplay-relevant thing within resonable time (NO endless grinding!). There are only 5 maps so far, still there are some interesting features placed on them. Why do i call it ""deep"" anyway? The system itself is straight forward, every ability has its use. There is only 1 specific thing where there is a %-factor, every other gameplay element is straightforward. You see the numbers, you get the numbers. From this rather simple base you can forge  so many strategies its unbelievable. Also every opponent has his own ""army-set"", so your tactic and overall strategie has to change if you wanna win. Thats what makes this game so great. Latest news are that we can expect updates soon, so this game will give you even more fun!10/10, awesome F2P game.			"

Usually winning or losing was mostly due to luck. The tutorial wasn't very helpful. It just shows you the basics.It doesn't explain what any of the special moves do. It's just trial and error.And it does NOT let you get Experience in games against your friends.So what's the point of playing this turd if it's a multiplayer game that does not reward you for playing with your friends?

												I wish there were more options than just recommend or not. I halfheartedly do and halfheartely don't. If you're a fan of tactics games, by all means try it out ... if you can get it to start. It usually crash on startup for me, but if I manage to get through the critical startup stage it works without problems. Apparently the crash problems have been around since beta, which frankly should be a bit embarrasing for Stoic. They really should have fixed things by now. I expect the single player game to be quite good, but I'm not sure I dare to buy it, because of the crash problems. What if it won't work at all?Regarding the actual game, I like the combat mechanics, but the interface feels a little bit unwieldy, and the pace is slower than I would've liked. There is a kind of progression in the game, which is a good thing. You have four basic classed and each can be upgraded to three specialized classes, but leveling up is a very slow process, and the whole thing quickly gets rather repetitive. You have little to gain by winning and a loss means nothing but a missed opportunity to gain a little extra renown (which is the currency in the game). The battles have no context and starts to feel meaningless after a while. This is of course true in most multiplayer games, but I think this game needs that context to shine.			"

												The game needs some tweeking of pace.Somebody (@stoicmom) said it is a chesslike game, more rewarding than chess.There are too many stats to calculate and a turn is limited to around 20 secons, it is hard to calculate a strategy in such a short amount of time. One game gives you between 1-7 pointsOne of you ""chess piece"" can be ""promoted"" for 20 pointsYou get a character promotion every 3 games. If you constantly win you barely keep up.And I dont know about late game, but you can get to have more than 10 pieces it seems.In the market you can purchase points, and you can purchase bonus%points.It is not pay to win. It seems to purchase these kind of items would greatly improve the pace.For me it seems they made a good game, they added an handicap, and you have to pay to remove the handicap.			"

												Another game for the strategists at heart, you will have to use your brain proficiently if you are to win any battles here. There are three types of early game units; archer, warrior, and tank, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Attaining enough kills with a specific unit will earn them a rank up option, it costs Renown [the in-game currency] to rank up a unit though.+ clean interface and lettering+ tactical strategy gets you far+ simple to learn, difficult to master+ game searches for another player of your level-/+ no story-/+ entertaining in short bursts- implicit ""Buy Me"" feeling you get8/10			"

This game Alsoalows you to make up your own team of Varl and Humans which can't exide a 6 character limit. I recomend this game to anyone who was played the Actual game or wants to and to anyone who wants to play against your friends or other people in a well done viking turnbased strategy game.			"

												A great turn-based game, but even though you'll be sorely tempted, try to avoid actually spending money on it.  Learn the game first, and if you really like it, splurge and get a big set of Renown points.  There's a LOT to learn here, and you could go broke trying to speed things up without achieving much.The game also suffers from occasionally few players, although on some days you can't turn around without bumping into a battle.  The community is also pretty cool, with lots of people willing to help you even as you fight against them.  I highly encourage free use of the chat.Here's looking forward to a sequel, or at least a significant update with more classes and a better matchmaking system!			"

												This game impresses on so many levels.Music, art style and animation are simple and beautiful. Extremely fitting, wonderful atmosphere.Game mechanics are the way they should be: original, easy to learn, hard to master. Wonderful for both the people who ponder over chess boards for hours as well as those who are able to make fast decisions.Community is friendly, always helpful. Unfortunately a bit on the small side, but as you always only need one partner to play with, that is a small problemAlso, definitely not pay to win. You can't buy anything you couldn't also achieve through a reasonable amout of playing.It's free, give it a try! This is perfect to test whether you'll like the mechanics well enough to buy the single-player game!			"

												Hey listen, I recommend this game #1 it’s free, #2 your supporting indie developers who have a great vision and execution.  #3 this game is not ""pay to win"" all the pay stuff is cosmetic.Yes you could pay to get the XP boost, or you could put in a little more time to get that same XP.Bottom line: this game is free and its on a Match by Match basis.Perfect for casual play.The system is ""MAD DOPE"" its like chess and the match making is pretty fair. The damage low level units do compared to high level units is not a huge difference, so no matter what the XP disparity players still have a chance to win.This is an excellent mini game with excellent art and direction, and at the very least worth a try. Be warned - it can be brutal when you first start. Allot of players are not used to ""Old school"" turned based strategy. So you’ll have to get used to it at first. You got to get to know every unit- what their strengths and weaknesses are as well as knowing how your opponent might play.  Every move counts and turn order especially important.  You’ve got to think like three steps ahead.My only criticism is that i wish they would update Factions to include the units that they have in the actual (PAID) campaign to make the game more interesting, or even carry over some the XP from factions to the main game.Long story short: this game is AWESOME, try it out- ITS FREE!

												Factions is the multiplayer-only portion of ""The Banner Saga."" It has the same fantastic art style, music, and turn-based combat system as the singleplayer, yet boasts an incredibly simple, yet deceptively deep multiplayer. Figuring out which classes I want to put into my party, what order I want them to go in, and how they will work together can consume hours of thought. In a match, positioning and initiative become huge, as well as knowing when to kill an enemy, and when to leave them barely alive as a useless road block.A fantastically deep game that is a must try for anyone that enjoys the turn-based strategy genre.

												I wish there were more options than just recommend or not. I halfheartedly do and halfheartely don't. If you're a fan of tactics games, by all means try it out ... if you can get it to start. It usually crash on startup for me, but if I manage to get through the critical startup stage it works without problems. Apparently the crash problems have been around since beta, which frankly should be a bit embarrasing for Stoic. They really should have fixed things by now. I expect the single player game to be quite good, but I'm not sure I dare to buy it, because of the crash problems. What if it won't work at all?Regarding the actual game, I like the combat mechanics, but the interface feels a little bit unwieldy, and the pace is slower than I would've liked. There is a kind of progression in the game, which is a good thing. You have four basic classed and each can be upgraded to three specialized classes, but leveling up is a very slow process, and the whole thing quickly gets rather repetitive. You have little to gain by winning and a loss means nothing but a missed opportunity to gain a little extra renown (which is the currency in the game). The battles have no context and starts to feel meaningless after a while. This is of course true in most multiplayer games, but I think this game needs that context to shine.			"

												Superb artwork and lore, simple and interesting mechanics. At first it felt extremely slow-paced and I lost very consistently because I failed to grasp a couple core mechanics. Once I re-reviewed the tutorial and talked with some other players a little bit, I ""GOT"" it, and went on a winning streak and started levelling up. The gameplay IS a little bit slow-paced. It's a game where you can take a moment to think about what to do during your turn (I believe the time limit is 30 seconds, but with such little action happening on-screen, 30 seconds is forever to wait for the other player to do something). As you get up past power level 1, players are better about keeping their turns reasonably short, and you end up spending all of it thinking about your tactical options, so no longer boring.The UI leaves much to be desired. not very self-instructional or intuitive, but it's nice that it's not super noisy or in-your-way given that the nice looking artwork is worth looking at. I would really like to see full keyboard-only and gamepad support in the future, but mouse-only is not problematic.I think they are developing more content and a single-player story mode, which I'll be looking forward to and am happy to spend a few bucks in purchases to help support that.

When the single player campaign is released, they will be expanding factions' content.   Play now if you want to get a head start on the very interesting mechanics and earn some renown.			"

												This is a great free to play turn based online strategy game in the vain of chess.Norse mythology is the background for the game and your band of trusty fighters can be upgraded when they reach a certain amount of kills and you have enough renown points to pay for it.The free to play model is good since it does not allow you to pay to win. Any money spent on the game is more for vanity items and for expanding your barracks if you want to.All in all just download it and try it out as it will not cost you a cent if you don't like it and, if you end up liking it, you'll thank me.

												What could have been a fun and interesting twist to the ""tactics"" genre turns out to be a laggy , confusing , jumbled mess .The Pro's-Amazing artwork and graphics.Intersting storyline.The Cons-Inconsistant game mechanics.Suffers from severe Lag.confusing controls and game layout.Feels like an unfinished title.Not very fun.In conclusion this game should be avoided.Never at any point did I feel like I had any control over the battle. Usually winning or losing was mostly due to luck. The tutorial wasn't very helpful. It just shows you the basics.It doesn't explain what any of the special moves do. It's just trial and error.And it does NOT let you get Experience in games against your friends.So what's the point of playing this turd if it's a multiplayer game that does not reward you for playing with your friends?

												I love turn based strategies and I'm usually quite good at them. I just heard about this game because of Banner Saga. Note that this is a multiplayer only game unlike its counterpart Banner Sage that is single player only. The first three matches I was matched with noobs like me and nothing that I didn't know happened. We just attacked eachother etc. and I thought hey, this is just my game. Then I upgraded my units that earned it and reached ""power level 5"" whatever it means.... Well, I shouldn't. The moment I did that I was matched with super experienced people that used units and abilities I had yet to see, let alone master... Enemy isn't taking damage, one shotting my guys, buffing eachother etc... doing stuff that I wasn't even aware of their existence. Note that these guys were playing at noobs' levels.The problem is I can't depower my team now and even if I could, would I want to always play with level 1 units?Of course this doesn't make this game bad. It just means this game is a train past far away for new beginners. If you aren't too patient or have a lot of money (don't know if this is relevant) just skip it.Tutorials? They only let you know the basics.Asking stuff from chat? Noone answers.Can you somehow learn from an in game source that what you can come against? No, you can't see abilities you don't have. The ones you have are hard to understand.			"

												First, this is a great and inventive game and in my opinion the multiplayer increases the replay value.  The game is different each time because people are behind the decisions.  That being said, there are not enough people to find games quickly all the time.  I like this game and I recommend it, but it's the first one produced and it's apparent that the dev's attention is elsewhere at the moment.  The story games are much more advanced and include more characters.Frustrating.  With it being so hard to find a match, it's really important to win.  That being said, the renown required between rank 1 and 2 is so high, it's going to take a while to level your team so that you can play more people.  Every change takes renown, which you can grind out or buy.  One problem with this is that even with the steam overlay enabled, the mac steam version can't connect, so you can't buy renown even if you want to.My most recent frustration is with upgrades and dismissal.  If you get rid of a character, you lose all the renown you sunk into them.  So, for example, if you carelessy hit a button and upgrade to the wrong class, you're stuck.  No undo, no class change.  Every decision is final.  This makes sense in the story game, but is unnecessarily petty in factions.  Changes:  You should be able to adjust character stats so that you can play a larger range of levels.  You should be able to change classes just like you can adjust points, even if it's just one time due to a mistake.  Repair the steam connection.  Add some of the characters from the story games.  Reduce the renown cost to upgrade to match the story game.  There's a tutorial in Factions that shows a team with all Level 11 characters.  That would take 100 years.  Ridiculous.I still like this game.  It's like battle chess.  Needs some attention, which is probably going towards Banner Saga 3 right now.  I saw on their website that they're hiring.  Probably short-staffed.			"

												The game needs some tweeking of pace.Somebody (@stoicmom) said it is a chesslike game, more rewarding than chess.There are too many stats to calculate and a turn is limited to around 20 secons, it is hard to calculate a strategy in such a short amount of time. One game gives you between 1-7 pointsOne of you ""chess piece"" can be ""promoted"" for 20 pointsYou get a character promotion every 3 games. If you constantly win you barely keep up.And I dont know about late game, but you can get to have more than 10 pieces it seems.In the market you can purchase points, and you can purchase bonus%points.It is not pay to win. It seems to purchase these kind of items would greatly improve the pace.For me it seems they made a good game, they added an handicap, and you have to pay to remove the handicap.			"

Easy to learn the mechanics of it, at the heart of which is a system where health=strength(damage done), which no only makes a lot of sense, but is what makes the combat so interesting. Art is exceptional, and sound design is pretty effective at maintaining a somber tone despite the illustrated looks.

												Sucks that it's only multiplayer.  Don't get me wrong, I like playing other players, but sometimes you just want to chill out and practice on a dummy (A.I.)  Good game, but not for me.  Banner Saga was omgwtfawesome but this spin off isn't as good as I'd hoped it would be.			"

												It's the multiplayer for The Banner Saga. There are no extra bells and whistles, there are in fact a good few less bells and whistles. It could have been much more and it probably would have been better as part of the main game, rather than a standalone free-to-play, that said, it's fun, it works. It does basically what it should even if it feels very hollow when compared with the single player game.			"

												I played Banner Saga: Factions after I had played The Banner Saga; while the latter is more optimized and better implemented it lacks multiplayer. However the core mechanics of both games is still the same and both are a delight.Factions has frame rate issues, i witnessed one memory error after I had closed the game (I played only one game, and certianly intend to play much more). Though, I have read that there were no devs working on updates and patches to Factions, I guess its safe to assume that Factions was the Beta release for the series. However, Factions is still very much enjoyable competetive multiplayer experience. As well the game hosts a weekly tournement, which I am looking forwards to joining. Certainly a thumbs up for the work done, and the potential it holds into becoming a platform for something much much bigger.With Banner Saga 2 annouced next winter; if they combine the campaign finishing of Banner Saga and Multiplayer element of Factions I think we will have a gem on our hands.

												Banner Saga: Factions is one of the most successful games in Steam Free to Play. Developed by Stoic, a group of former Bioware artists. Initially funded by Kickstarter program. This game is highly drivened by the art development and simple game mechanics. The game music is composed by Austin Wintory, also the composer of ""Journey"" on PS3. If you have played the Heroes Might and Magic IV, then this turn-based RPS will be familiar to you. Each units has its Armour and Strength, it is to your tactical commands to win the game. Earning in-game currency, Renown, is fairly easy after you win a round. For matchmaking, it matches players according to your level. Though searching for a player might take some time. This is a highly sought game, if you love tactical thinking games.http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stoic/the-banner-sagahttp://stoicstudio.com/forum/the-banner-saga-factions.php "

												First, this is a great and inventive game and in my opinion the multiplayer increases the replay value.  The game is different each time because people are behind the decisions.  That being said, there are not enough people to find games quickly all the time.  I like this game and I recommend it, but it's the first one produced and it's apparent that the dev's attention is elsewhere at the moment.  The story games are much more advanced and include more characters.Frustrating.  With it being so hard to find a match, it's really important to win.  That being said, the renown required between rank 1 and 2 is so high, it's going to take a while to level your team so that you can play more people.  Every change takes renown, which you can grind out or buy.  One problem with this is that even with the steam overlay enabled, the mac steam version can't connect, so you can't buy renown even if you want to.My most recent frustration is with upgrades and dismissal.  If you get rid of a character, you lose all the renown you sunk into them.  So, for example, if you carelessy hit a button and upgrade to the wrong class, you're stuck.  No undo, no class change.  Every decision is final.  This makes sense in the story game, but is unnecessarily petty in factions.  Changes:  You should be able to adjust character stats so that you can play a larger range of levels.  You should be able to change classes just like you can adjust points, even if it's just one time due to a mistake.  Repair the steam connection.  Add some of the characters from the story games.  Reduce the renown cost to upgrade to match the story game.  There's a tutorial in Factions that shows a team with all Level 11 characters.  That would take 100 years.  Ridiculous.I still like this game.  It's like battle chess.  Needs some attention, which is probably going towards Banner Saga 3 right now.  I saw on their website that they're hiring.  Probably short-staffed.			"
