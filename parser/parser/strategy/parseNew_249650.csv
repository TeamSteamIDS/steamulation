												Daedalic's Blackguards........Where to begin......I like so many others was rather excited by this title from the content shown here on steam. As a result i purchased this in the sale at 1/3 of its retail price for £10.99.  So a turn based dungeon crawler with rpg character development.  Right now the nitty gritty there are some details of gameplay but i shall not spoiler you on plot etcShortfalls in my opinion 1) The Overall story of the game is linear there are very few opertunities to drastically alter the outcome of the game, there are a bunch of side quests which are optional? (but not completing these for the extra loot, gold and items will make your playthrough a nightmare in its own right! as enemies will be VASTLTY superior to your party of characters. I completed all the side quests and optional dungeon choices.  2) Character Creation is shallow at best  you have a choice of TWO classes! the game does suggest three but its a joke you have the choice between spellcasters and non spell casters! There are no merchants, no stealth options, just pick a close combat weapon or a ranged weapon, or spells if your the former mage class. oh and all chracters can basically become cookie cut clones if you want them to be exactly the same. 3) At Certain points your party composition will be radically altered i.e random members of your party will be unavailble to you for fights following the storyline (so all that time and effort spent developing a character for a specific niche,  those skills to help your party become less brittle will be for nothing making certain fights hellish to complete. 4) The world map has a mere dozen locations for you to explore consisitng of the exact same format towns with the same vendors selling almost identical gear! Black guards is not like diablo where you can expect hoards of loot and mindlesss array of weapons, there are so few it makes you wonder if your ever going to have a badass looking character. 5) Most of my game time was spent on loading screens........ugh i cannot stress how mind numbing this was!The Aquisition of items and gear is extremely tedious especially at the start of the game those life saving potions are almost unobtainable and forces you to either sacrifce weapon and armour or go to battle injured. Later those same items become useless which makes you wonder why you invested so much in the first place. The interface is clunky and at times often difficult to direct your actions.6) The variety of enemies was also sparse to say the least the same foes  cropping up again and again made killing them a real chore, I should also mention that there is NO level grinding in this game to improve your characters stats  for that fight you are having trouble with. 7) THIS IS THE BIGGY The chance to hit modifier is The MOST ANNOYING PART OF THIS GAME!!! YOU WILLL NEVER BE MORE FRUSTRATED, NEVER MISS AS MANY ATTACKS OR FAILED CASTING ATTEMPTS  AS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN THIS GAME,  It has rusulted in me personally restarting hundreds of encounters because this game is COMPLETLY GOVERNED BY RANDOM CHANCE! it will try to break you!!!!!!8) There are multiple battles linked together resluting in sometimes impossible to win situations as you have been thumped so bad due to unlucky attacks you've misseed ten times in a row or the enemy lads a whole slew of critical hits forcing you to use all your recovery items. (but....i hear you say what about your inventory?? yeah invent items can only be equiped outside of combat, also quicksaving is the same! only outside the dungeon! Basically the ENTIRE game is fight, FAST TRAVEL to location,  distribute stats, rinse, repeat, load, load, load, load,  get lucky, Save. PositivesThe Dungeon maps are varied and are pretty to look at,  there are interactive objects to help you, most maps have a stratagy behind them to make things a wee bit easier but a couple of crucial misses will send that plan right out the window. There are moments of satisfaction when you drop that enemy who has forced you to load a dozen times and you complete the fight in no time flat. The Dialogue can be entertainig at times and you do find your characters personalities are pretty unique. Im Struggling to come up with more positive points! in all honesty i personally thought this was going to be a bit like a fantasy version of  x-com enemy unknown  (which is a fantastic game i do highly reocmmend) needless to say i was sorely dissapointed!  only die hard fans will see any replay out of this title. even at £10.99 i felt robbed and yes i did pour 60 hours into it but most of this was due to the snails pace of the combat system.Brutally Honest review Hope someone finds this useful? Ryan :)			"

			Cosmic takes a look at Blackguards, a turn based tactical role playing game set in the popular universe of the Dark Eye, Developed by Daedalic Entertainment. Get it on Steam here!		

As an avid RPG player, and one who is all about story, I hold any RPG story I play to a high standard. Daedalic have been great storytellers in the past and blackguards is no different. The game is dark and mature, just what I like. Often in RPG's the more morally grey characters are the most enjoyable, relate-able and overall liked characters of a given game. In Blackguards this the type of characters you play, instead of a group of moral paragons, you play a band of rogues, trying to get by in the world and dealing with events that have been thrust upon them.You start the game as your chosen character hovering above the corpse of princess Elenor who is being eaten by a wolf, after killing said wolf you are blamed for her death, but the strange thing is, you can't quite remember what exactly happened before you saw the wolf. After being tortured and being questioned for a name you know nothing about. Enter the fire loving, fight craving, elf hating dwarf Naurim and you’re soon on a prison break with the intention of finding out just what the hell is going on here.The Battles in blackguards are very addictive, they tend to be relatively short but by no means easier. The great thing about blackguards combat is its difficulty, some battles require real thought and careful planning. The game is very challenging but by no means overly difficult and while it can be unforgiving at times, the game auto-saves after every battle and even if you die you have the option to start the battle over at any point from the pause menu. Fans of tactical turn based Rpgs will really get a kick out of the challenge blackguards provides. One of the star features of combat is the interactive environments. In certain levels you will have objects placed around that you can use. You can cut a rope causing the hanging chandelier to crush the enemies below it, ignite flammable swamp gas to burn opponents and more. There are over 190 beautifully crafted battlefields in blackguards, these are no mere random maps, these are hand drawn, carefully thought out maps that not only feel unique but really leave a lasting impression. If your an RPG fan, a turn based strategy fan or you just love a bloody good story, I cannot recommend blackguards enough. It is one of those rare games that I literally lost track of time playing. The story telling is good and engaging. Battles while not lengthy have great solid mechanics and good depth to them. The world is fantastically immersive, Daedalic have envisioned southern Aventuria beautifully. Check out the full video review for a more in depth look.

												Alright....Blackguards is definitely a game with no lack for content. In fact, there was enough for me to put in a solid 60 hours. Some of that time was redoing battles and such, but there were plenty of quests and plenty to do in general.The game itself is a curious blend of your prototypical Daedalic adventure/point and click game (when you are in towns, albeit with the hidden object stuff removed of course) mixed with turn based hex battles that use random number generators ala XCOM and other luminous titles. The RNG aspect can make things interesting as occasionally, you will inexplicably miss when you show a 95% chance to hit (actually, it isn't inexplicable..you fell victim to that other 5% lol), but at other times, when your percentage is really low and you go for a desperation power move, and it connects, you totally feel excited and stoked for having taken that risk.Graphically, it wont blow you away. It is reminiscent of other Daedalic games when in cities/towns/etc..., but when in battle, it's more of an isometric approach with movable cameras that can be adjusted to the cardinal directions as well as going from top down to more straight ahead angles. This definitely comes into play during battles as you get different vantage points to make decisions and set actions. Definitely pulls off that middle ages with mysticism look well. The cutscenes are more of the same. Nothing too spectacular, but still effective and definitely in line with the overall game presentation.The story itself is interesting enough. You are framed for the murder of the princess, whom you and a few of your friends grew up with while under the care and apprenticeship of a powerful wizard. You are arrested, and escape with the help of two other prisoners, who become your stalwart companions. From there, you are at first trying to solve the murder and clear your name, but as things progress, you uncover a plot that can destroy the world. At that point, your goals become far more lofty. The story was engaging enough to keep me interested throughout. Which was necessary, as the pace of the game was not very fast. In fact, it took a while for me to get to the point where my characters were able to resolve the more difficult battles without copious retries.The battle system itself was pretty stellar in my opinion. If you have played XCOM or other turn based hex battle system games, you will have a good grasp for this game fairly quickly as far as the combat is concerned. What they don't do is churn out the same basic layout over and over. Each battle gets it's own unique battle map, which was stellar in my opinion. You never get bored from seeing the same map over and over, which even XCOM as guilty of (I keep going back o XCOM as a reference due to its accessibility as a point of reference for this games combat systems). The geography of the battle is often as important as your positioning relative to your enemies. Often, there will be traps, mires/bogs, and other obstacles that will hinder or help you and your enemies. Cover is provided on many maps. Interactive objects also make there way into the battlefield. For example, there might be a stack of barrels that you can knock over to crush enemies underneath or simply block their path (and they might use those same stacks), a stand filled with rocks that can be knocked over, bookcases, oil filled barrels that explode, pools of oil, vats of poison, simple chairs and tables, etc....The battle maps were supremely well thought out in my opinion and kept things pretty fresh. In addition to all that, there might be goals other than simply destroying your enemy, such as trying to fight your way to a specific part of the map, free prisoners to help you fight, defend citizens as they try to flee the battle zone, escort missions, and so on. There was even two instances where complete stealth was necessary and one where you are fighting your way through a cavern while also trying to stay ahead of a poison cloud that creeps slowly forward behind you. So much variety. It was really quite impressive.The quests were pretty standard fare for the most part. Go find this missing person, please retrieve this item and possibly take it to somebody else, find out what this person or that person is hiding, intercept shipments, and so on. They were fun, and if you play RPG's, they are par for the course. However, they were much easier to finish and never dragged out. Short and to the point as it were. I had a lot of fun with them, and finished every quest the game had to offer.The main quest itself was pretty interesting, as I mentioned before, and kept you moving forward.The pacing itself was pretty slow. In fact, the first few hours of gameplay might dissuade some people from continuing on. It takes a while for the game to start really sending you places, and it also takes a while for you to be able to upgrade your equipment and abilities. However, once you get past that initial stage, the game never stops moving forward, even if it is at a slower tan normal RPG pace. I wouldn't get discouraged by this. Once it really got going, I never looked back, although I did break up the gameplay by taking a day off in between sessions to play other types of games. I think that approach benefited the gameplay here, as it helped me to stay interested. The reason I mention this is because, on top of all that, this game is absolutely combat focused and is quite grind-ey. In fact, you will pretty much need to grind out every battle to level up enough to have a reasonable experience later in the game. Fortunately, even if you wrap up all te quests, there is the option to do gladiator fights whenever you want (after you become the champions of the gladiator ring), which will fill out any necessary experience and give you extra cash to spend on potions and such, which you will definitely need to do.Healing and mana potions (they don't call it mana, but same thing) are an absolute necessity, and especially towards the end of the game, you will want to have as many as possible. You cant have too many, and they don't carry any inventory weight with them, so there is no reason not to keep yourself well stocked. The only other things I ever really spent my coins on were arrows and the occasional armor upgrade. You will find plenty of weapons, poisons, etc...throughout the game and shouldn't need to buy any after maybe your first couple upgrades. At a certain point, those all become more than plentiful via combat spoils. You do have party encumbrance, but I never really found it to be an issue, and went over several times, lol. As far as the inventory system goes, it's pretty simple...you have your various clothing slots (which equate to pants, shoes, gloves, shirt, and hat). You have three weapon loadout slots (during battle, you can switch between the three, but each switch counts as a turn). Each loadout has two hands available, so one loadout might be sword and shield, another might be bow and arrows, another might be a greatsword, etc...You also wear a belt which can have as many as 4 slots available (depending on the belt itself). Each slot will hold one disposable item (potion, poison, grenade (equivalent), or throwing weapon).The RPG system is fairly deep in my opinion. There are several categories that all pull from the same pool of experience points you earn, so you need to be judicious in how you spend those points. There are plenty of guides on the topic although I just used what I thought would work well with a touch of common sense and an idea of how to build a party mixed in, lol. The breakdown is abilities (strength, courage, dexterity, charisma, etc...), talents (such as survival, warfare, traps, healing, willpower, and so on), weapon skills (specific weapon categories....bows, axes and maces, two handed swords, two handed axes and maces, staffs, ec...) *continued in comment section*			"

												Blackguards is a flawed game. But one that I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with so far.Let's go over the problems first.1. Difficulty. Particularly early on, the difficulty of each encounter can be horribly inconsistent. There's a reason why there is a ""try again"" button during fights - you're going to use it. Quite a lot. A lot of the more difficult fights have some kind of trick to them that might a try or two to figure out, and a lot of the time said fights require an element of luck too. One or two bad rolls or a few fizzled spells and it's time to try again. Anyone familiar with D&D probably knows that it's hard to create a balanced party with only three characters, which is all you start off with in this game: A mage, a fighter, and your main character who you can build as you wish. After a few hours you pick up a ranger too, who happens to be pretty good with traps, but until I acquired her, any map with hidden traps was a real pain to deal with. There was one fight where I had to memorise the location of the traps through multiple attempts before I could succeed. Additionally, sometimes quests force you through multiple fights with no escapes, and no warning beforehand, which can catch you off-guard if unprepared. In summary: Save often, and be prepared to try again.2. The interface. The combat system is excellent, but the controls are a little clunky. There's some oddity to the character models which can make it hard to target enemies at times, and the camera is rather awkward at times too. It can get quite frustrating, but it's not so bad that I find myself making accidental moves or anything like that.3. Information. The game can be very unclear about things. If you're not familiar with the RPG system the game is based on, trying to figure out how it all works is awkward, and the game basically only tells you things once. Being able to mouse over raw stats to see how they affect things would be nice. I have a parry rating of 7 on a character, what sort of parry chance does that actually equate to? How are these stats modifying dice rolls? You can get a rough idea of how things work over time, but I'd like to be able to see exactly what's going on. Contrast with, say, the original neverwinter nights, where if you wanted you could see every single roll being made.So those are the negatives.And the positives? Well, the combat system is fantastic, the RPG system, while incredibly deep and unclear, is also very flexible, you have a lot of freedom to let your characters grow in any way you want them to. The quests are enjoyable, the story is simple but engaging, the characters have some actual personality to them.If you're willing to get over the initial hurdles of an incredibly complex system and some very frustrating battles, there is a deep and enjoyable game with a wealth of content available for you. The world itself is pretty unique, it does a good job of avoiding a lot of fantasy tropes and creating something a little more engaging, and there's something rather refreshing about having a party that aren't a bunch of do-gooders.You're blackguards. My party consists of a wrongfully imprisoned warrior, a dwarf arsonist obsessed with dragons, a pompous upper-class noble from the south, and an elf who got high on drugs and owes everyone money. You're not evil, but you're certainly not good either. You're labelled scum by the people around you and hunted across a kingdom, adding to your list of crimes on the way.I've completed chapter 1 and am partway through chapter 2. I'm eager to see how the game develops from here. If you can handle some difficulty and frustration at the start, this game is well worth it.			"

												I mentioned that I would edit my review once I had played more of the game, and I've finished most of Chapter 3 at this point, and wanted to weigh in again, now that there is more content available. Once again, I really enjoy the gameplay. X-Com fans will appreciate the turn based strategy. My earlier concerns regarding the limitations of the trainer system which inhibited true freedom in character development have been lessened however. I still would prefer true freedom to spend my experience points, but the additional content gives you plenty of fights and quests with which to expand your characters, as well as more trainers with the important abilities available to train for. If you are looking for cool loots though, prepare to be disappointed. The emphasis is really more on the characters themselves. As you progress through the story, upgrades of weapons that are marginally better are available, but using merchants to upgrade your characters gear doesn't really feel as fun as beating some monsters or bad guys and finding a cool weapon or magic item.Overall, I feel the additional content pushes this game from 'not recommended' to 'recommended'. I am particularly excited for when they add more depth to character creation, as this will allow me to pick some starting skills that will more coincide with how I want to build my character. For example, warriors start with the skill that improves your attack when using a shield. If you want to build a 2-Hand sword wielding warrior, this skill is just a waste. But with the new system, hopefully you can skip that in favor of another cool skill.			"

												For Blackguards, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.I wanted to wait until I beat the game to review it. I felt obligated to do this. If you’re like me you bought in to all the good reviews this game had on Steam. A mature, turn-based rpg, starring anti-heroes? How could it be bad?Well, for starters, the “Key Features” that Blackguards lauds itself on are deeply flawed. Character choice and combat tactics are undermined by balancing issues - certain abilities and spells are clearly better than others to the point where your characters will be at a severe disadvantage if specced the wrong way and beating some of the harder fights will be near impossible if you don’t have one or two specific spells. Additionally, the game suffers from sudden spikes in difficulty that leave the game almost unplayable. Battles go from challenging and needing strategy to just plain unfair and needing luck to win out.Outside of combat, Blackguards doesn’t fair much better. The story is piecemeal and uneven - with the whole second chapter being nothing but a combat-only reenactment of “Gladiator” that only seems to be put in place to fill time. The rest of the main quest is further hampered by a multitude of random side quests that hold no weight in the game world and only serve to distract you from your objective. Narrative elements and choices are frequently brought up only to never be talked about again. And finally, when the story actually manages to come together, it’s a rushed case of too little too late - leaving you with an ending that is worse than Mass Effect 3. Because despite what the game says, you don’t decide the course of the story at key points - nothing you do matters.Characters are also largely underdeveloped and remain that way. Although, the voice acting, for the most part, is passable aside from one annoying companion. However, the male protagonist is the clear winner between the two gender choices (think the opposite of Mass Effect).When the game asks, “What happens when the only hope of a threatened world lies not with heroes in shining armor, but in the hands of a band of misfits and criminals?”. It turns out the exact same thing that would happen if it were heroes in shining armor - because for a game starring “criminals”, you spend most of your time helping people and doing the right thing.Blackguards has so much potential. It’s just like that really cool looking kid that has tattoos and fashionable clothes but when they open their mouth you realize that looking cool doesn’t mean you have substance. And as much as I wanted to like Blackguards, I can only recommend it to someone if it were deeply on sale.			"

												I was intrigued when I saw the game. So much so that I plunked down my cash for early access. But I realized very quickly that youre basically expected to run the game once completely blindfolded before you will ever know how to build the party or what theyre capable of. Mistakes will dog your every step during your first run. Its very tedious and frustrating. But the killer for me, the straw that breaks the camels back, is the ridiculous spike in difficulty from one fight to another. It would be one thing if there was some sort of difficulty precursor before a fight. But there isnt . You step from one fairly mild fight to, suddenly, be faced with a large force led by a high level mage and youre expected to kill everything on the map. IN SEVEN TURNS. Did I mention all the mobs have healing potions? And the leader is on the other side of the hex map? And there are spike traps and tripwires everywhere. So you need to kill 6 mobs, in 7 turns, while they use heal pots, while missing on roughly 30-40% of your attacks. This game is dead to me. I would say it isnt worth the 22 bucks i plunked down for early access. Its a ridiculous waste of cash at the durrent $35 price tag.			"

												Updated impressions to Full Version below:Blackguards is the first Early Access game i really want to recommend!First it´s quite well developed already (but surely not without some roughness, especially regarding balancing, texting and bugs), secondbecause they did two things very well:Second it actually is a good game in the Realms of Arkania/Das Schwarze Auge universe, since the last ones (Demonicon, Schicksalsklinge HD) were poorest crap.Secondary it brings a new genre to this rpg system - the strategy (yeah i know, they also did two adventures already, but imo adventure and rpg are not that different).Also they try to bring a bit of a more grey atmosphere to the normally strictly black and white world of Arkania, you play as a convicted murderer, your party also consists of the strangest fellows like addicts, fanatics and so on.Though this all Daedalic manages to stay true to the typical rpg feeling as well as presents it with quite some bit of humour as well.You are somewhat limited in creating your character (three classes only, race and sex are fix) but the skill system (which represents the RoA rules surprisingly well) offers quite some flexibility to process all the characters the further the game progresses.This mixture of freedom and linear story telling, continues throughout the game, while you visit the locations to progress the main storyline, you have always some options for side quests, which offer a variety of goals.The battles themself remind me for one of Expeditions:Conquistador, where cover and strategically well placement of your characters is as important as choosing the right means of attack.They also try to keep the battles different with traps, different obstacles as well as victory conditions.As the game is still in development i can´t ultimately write about the story, but so far the characters are well done and the development is quite interesting.So if you either like the realms of arkania universe or are a strategy fan, you can give this one a try.Update:In the full version Daedalic has implemented kind of free character generation, since many players wanted this and not only the pre made classes.Well.. the plus is, Daedalic tried to give the fans what they wanted..the minus is that they implemented it very half heartedly, it´s an ugly, short creation process, with nearly no explanation about classes or whatever (the only choosing here is a single mage yes/no button?!)Also you kinda notice that the game was made with a hunter class in mind, if you create some very different hero, you may not find the best stuff/make the most out of it.Also i still get some stuttering issues/cut off ends of cut scenes, so they didn´t improve this much.All in all, this may be small points, but they damper a good first impression..

												Well.. you know  when you watch TV and see the that really Juicy Burger in the commercial? Well. They actually use plastic burger with special lighting and a lot photo editing to create such an effect. When you actually go to that fast food and order the same burger it's quite different and the taste is no where near as good as you imaginged when you see it on TV.This game is like that burger in the TV commercial.. Graphic is great, Sound is great and packaging and concept is awesome.But when you actually play it it's like a Plastic burger that you will have a lot problem to chew on and it taste bad.First.. The Story is Linear with supposed plot twist but it's quite badly rewriten with a lot things unexplained.Second.. The Game combat mecanism is following a old DND3 type dice/board game. Which they did a good job translate into a PC game but it just doesn't work out.. Repetitive and uninteresting.Third.. each battle map suppose give you options on how to finish the each map solution seems very linear and easy to guess. Each battle may have different enemy but they don't feell unique when i see a different one.Fourth.. The Game difficulty is super hard. I am a DND vetern and studied quite abit of that dice game before i started and I have a tons of difficulty finish the game.Fifth.. the game interface is not well designed and hard to operate.Six:.. there are about 7 Achievements broken at the moment and from what i heard in the forum the developer is not gonna fix them.Unless you are a die hard Dice game fan i wouldn't recommend anyone trying this.4.5/10.

												I think it's a steep price for such a simple RPG. The story so far is not the best, but not the worst I have seen. On the bright side the tactical combat is pretty ok. However, the lack of exploration and skill progression/customization is just horrible. You travel from one location to the next with a click of the mouse, and every single location brings a fight, and I mean EVERY SINGLE ONE. There is no wondering if the big axe of the bandit you just slew is something for you. No no, you just get some {random) auto loot that has nothing to do with the fight. Frankly - the game just feels wrong.			"

												Blackguards is a textbook example of a TRPG.  Sadly, this genre seems to be dying out, though the Blackguards series gives me some hope for the future of gaming.  I love how the Blackguards system is based off of a German roleplaying engine.  Old AD&D games like Pool of Radiance, even Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter NIghts (though I hate the real-time aspect of these) are my favorites, and Blackguards is definitely along that same line.Some of the positives.  *The customization available is one of this game's many strengths.  They allow the player to keep each character unique throughout this game without having too many options as to overwhelm.  *The story isn't that happy-go-lucky anime stuff.  It's dark and intriguing.  The complaints regarding the main character's amnesia seem gripey to me.  Amnesia happens, but it's not overdone.  What I mean is that your main character may forget a few things, but won't go through the game complaining about missing memories.  The amnesia just adds to the mystery and allows the player to catch up on what has transpired.  Make no mistake, though, the focus is on the combat.*Most battles allow for different ways of completing your mission using objects in the field or terrain.  The complaint some make along the lines of ""I use the same tactics every time and this game becomes boring"" is the result of the choice the individual player has made, not the limitations of the game. *I love the variety of the enemies you'll face and their crazy portraits.*The soundtrack is mostly dark but there were several battle tracks I enjoyed.*Don't expect to get the ""+5 Sword of Fiery Judgment"" toward the end.  The weapons in this game do not provide the means to become amazing in combat, which is very unusual for RPGs.  I appreciated the change.What I didn't like.*Around 75% through the game, my melee fighters were essentially maxed out.  Without assistance from magic, fighters need a lot of luck to be helpful.*Speaking of luck, that D20 (the to-hit random number generator) is the most evil creature in creation.  90% treated me more like 70%.  1s were very rare and usually happened when I was finishing off a foe with few HP.  20s were frequent, as was foul language coming from me.  On top of that, there appeared to be a glitch.  I tossed, say, a 14 when 19 or below struck, yet the result was miss.  This occurred about one in every 15 attacks  (Despite this, the game is very beatable, I've finished it).*I wish there was more story.  Not better story, just more story.  I still don't understand the motive for one of the player-controlled characters to follow around the main character.  I wish one of the foes was more-developed.Those that haven't succumbed to mainstream gaming and still appreciate TRPGs can not go wrong in buying this game on sale.			"

												7/10.A solid turn-based combat Roleplay game, with interesting fights, varying win scenarios, and no game-changing +50% damage trinkets. The way the game played out for me.   First, customise your character with a wide variety of spells, talents, and stats. There are quite a few options, here. Next, crawl through a vast variety of well-designed maps and interesting combat scenarios, in the turn-based strategy style. Marvel at the lack of decent gear... even in the final chapters. :P Get frustrated by missing 3x 90% (incorrectly labelled ~ more accurately 50% chance) hits in a row >  adapt by using weaker abilities with 95% hit chance. Win. Use reasoning skills to work out the win condition, when the game doesn't spoonfeed you how to succeed > Win. Delve deeper into the well written storyline. Contemplate right vs wrong, and the way human societies functions. Watch a few thrown-together and anticlimactic final cutscenes.. (due credit to there being a few alternative endings). Decide not to make another char and start again, because you're intimate knowledge of the skills/talents/stats would make you a God on 'normal'... and increasing the difficulty level would just cause the more annoying aspects of the game to become too much to be enjoyable.--------------* See last paragraph for a list of helpful hints **--------------------The pro's and con's:Pro's: Interesting maps, and scenario's. Great range of character stats to customise. These stats actually made a significant difference to how your character could be played. Sometimes required me to stop - think about why I just lost - adapt. Rather than just steamrolling through every scenario.        Especially, when 2-star enemies start appearing. Sometimes required me to work out the puzzle of how to win the map. (Despite some other reviewers' comments, this rarely required chain-learning trap locations *but even when it did I could have put points into Traps (talent) to over come this* - see above point about actually strategising instead of gratuitous wins). Well written story, and voice acting. Particularly, the wide range of accents. The overarching theme of the dialogue was thought provoking, with concepts of anarchism, liberalism, and competing social values.  No ""+50% damage trinkets.""  Con's:   No ""+50% damage trinkets;"" in fact, upgrades were very hard to come by, with the best gear in the game being only marginally better than the starting level gear.  The lack of gear-based character improvement makes Adventure Points essential for creating an effectively optimised end-game character. It's important to get it right on the Character Creation screen. There's almost nothing worth buying, especially because main quests give you free full armor sets in Chapters 2 and 3. By the end of the game, I had over 1000gold and nothing to spend it on (the top level chest armor cost 50g) <-  This was only exacurbated by the need to regularly clear your inventory of unnecessary weight Around the second half of Chapter 3, 2-star enemies suddenly begun appearing - much stronger than 1-star enemies - receiving a huge buff to their stats and global buffs. (E.g. +8 attack, +2 dodge +20% Magic Resist buff for all enemies!!).   their strength increased too much, too suddenly.  Melee Hit chances are too low. Even with maxed out Attack from stats, Weapon Skills, and weapons/shields. By the end of the game, poorly scaled hit chance forced me to abandon my expensive big-hitting melee attacks (ie Hammer Blow - which I had spent over 3000 Adventure points in meeting these abilities' requirements). Was forced to use weak high hit chance abilities to even hit anything. By the end of the game, the game forced me to abandon my dreams of a badass melee build; opting for 1Hander axe and sheild, instead. Boss enemies in the 4th and 5th Chapters regularly potioned to full health when falling below ~30% health.  Combined with the fact that I rarely hit melee attacks, it became frustratingly difficult to get through the last 10 or so damage in a single turn before they 100% healed. The game kept messing with my team synergies by  taking away one of spell casters for long periods of time , and killing off my ranger. There are a few spells pretty much beat any enemy (example: Karnifilo Frenzy - the insane rage spell that makes groups of enemies kill each other) Maps with many enemies became very slow due to the inability to skip enemy movement and attack animations. Even enemies that couldn't reach you due to blocked paths would run in this painfully time-consuming circle, in order to use up their movement points. Back-to-the-past missions took away your well synergised gang of fighters; instead, leaving you with a lone character that wasn't optimised for solo play. (I felt sorry for any spell-casters, here). In-game decisions make minimal differences to the actual gameplay - mostly just affect the cutscenes.Helpful Hints:- Probably wouldn't put points into Treat Wounds (talent). Instead, get 13 points on one of your party member's Healing (spell), because it heals all wounds as well as being much more convenient.- Don't allow you characters to remain wounded. 3 wounds will severely weaken any character.- Team buffing & enemy debuffing spells are game changers!- Rangers are actully pretty decent in this game, so long as you have a tank or two to keep enemies 5 hexagons away.- If melee, don't bother going for Hammer Blow (tier 3 Abilty), nor Death Blow (tier 3) as their hit chances are way too low to provide reliable damage in the second half of the game. Tier 1 melee abilities remain viable the whole game due to their high chance to hit.- Minimum 8 points in Body control (talent) for every character is ESSENTIAL; 8+ points in Willpower (talent) are helpful for every character. - 8 Points in Warfare (talents) and 8 points in Animal Lore (talents) are very useful for melee  and ranged characters.- Defensive characters & spell casters should have relevant Weapon Skills of at least 8 points, and set to full defensive mode (for example, Zurbaran with 8 points in staves, with the sliding bar all the way to the left).- Gear is so hard to come by in this game, so you need Adventure Points in order to improve you characters. Didn't bother putting any points into Charisma as it seems counter-intuitive to effectively reduce your Adventure Points just for easy conversation options.- Finally, using poisons on you weapons is a great way to get through some impressive damage.

												I reserve words for certain games. Words which define the game itself and help encapsulate what I'm trying to get across. This game merits one such word, and that word is :""Chewy""Here's the deal. Blackguards is a strategy game which has been dipped, liberally, in the world of The Dark Eye, think Dungeons and Dragons germanic cousin and you'll be in the right area. It's got a wonderful, thick, rich backstory, with a lot of history, gods, cults, personalities, politics and intrigue. This is a world that over the course of several games (Check out Drakensang when you get the chance if you find yourself a fan of Blackguards, it's worth the time invested) has become every bit as nuanced and subtle as the more accessible DnD counterpart. The operative word though is accessible.The Dark Eye is to Pen and Paper roleplay what Dark Souls is to videogames. A stern, rock faced, cold hearted, unyielding dominatrix who seems impenetrable and who demands your complete and total servitude, and at the slightest folly will beat you bloody and raw and tell you to start over again. You will, multiple times, due to a flaw in your build that down the line results in your character ending up stunted and a fight proving a little beyond your reach or poor choices when you level your character. But each time, you will learn, through the beatings and the whippings, much like Dark Souls, you will learn, and you will improve. Eventually once you get past the gatekeeper and once you've survived the rite of passage that is the near vertical learning curve of the games mechanics, you'll find a world that richly rewards, and deserves every minute you spend within it.The graphics finally have shaken off a lot of the shoddiness and rough edges that have pervaded a lot of the TDE games, Blackguards is slick, smooth, and carries a glossy sheen with it, it's not QUITE melt your eyes gorgeous, but it's certainly pleasing to look at, and the spell effects certainly carry with them a definite sense of satisfaction as they connect and fly about the battlefield. So too has the voice acting and musical score improved, as presentation goes, Blackguards has matured TDE into a strong, and at last truly sellable product.But it's not for novices. Noooooooo sir. This is not a new player friendly game. So far to date no actual ""Roleplaying game"" set in the TDE universe has managed to be even -remotely- new player friendly, this is not about to buck that trend, not when your character sheet runs to five seperate tabbed pages with more numbers to make sense of than the US Federal Budget. Not when the wheel that surrounds your character can offer dozens of possible options as to what action you might wish to take during a turn. Not when a conversation option can turn a story down a route that results in a fight you may not have been prepared for. This game does not go lenient on people who are not careful, not methodical, or not thoughtful.The main story arc I'm going to leave spoiler free and focus on the mechanical side, the game follows a two-beat system, the world map, being a parchment map overworld that you zip around and visit static settlements to partake in various pleasantly rendered towns and villages, which offer side quests, conversation dialogs, healing and merchants. Then there's the meat of the game, a mix of single encounter and multi-encounter dungeons.These take place on hex based maps which are closer to things like Kings Bounty : The Legend, however in this case, we're dealing with -single units-, and in this case the strategic rendering is done with TDE levels of detail. Characters are solid, so you can't shoot or cast spells through them, ditto for static objects and moveable objects. This means positioning becomes a factor, you can't just layer your melee in front of your casters, you need to play smart and ensure people are in the right place. Equipment too has significant impacts overall on the fight, with bows having minimum and maximum ranges before major penalties are applied. Spells have granular levels of ""to hit"" based on the casters skill... you get the idea. We're talking pen and paper levels of detail, rendered lovingly in the game.Once you set up hotbars for your most frequently used abilities, fights run pretty smooth and fast, and the strategy element is as the word I used to begin with implies - ""Chewy"" - you'll be constantly thinking and rethinking your moves, and the AI puts up a respectable fight even at default difficulty. Environmental hazards too present a real and significant problem, and throw in an extra layer, thankfully there's no time constraint, so feel free to get a coffee as you ponder each move.Do I recommend it? Yes. With the caveat. This is not a game that will appeal to everyone. It's a niche game. I celebrate it's existence. It's a strategy game for strategy gamers. If hexes, math, and stats excite you, get stuck in.			"

												Wow, what do you get when you combine an entertaining story, colorful characters, and turn based combat with absolutely BROKEN game mechanics?  You get Blackguards!Blackguards is another in a string of games recently that have such wonderful aspects about them and yet have some fatal flaw that sabotages every good experience you have with it.  That flaw is that the game straight-up cheats.  Now I'd normally be the first person to say ""suck it up you sissy, it's meant to be challenging.""  But there's a big difference between something that is genuinely challenging, and something that cheats.-I can't tell you how many times I laughed my butt off watching the number of ways the game abused my characters.  Character killed before anyone can act in a battle.  No problem, reload.  Character recovers from knock down only to be knocked down once more with no apparent cause?  No problem, reload.  The game is full of this kind of stuff.  Prepare to be ""loved"" in the most brutal way by this game.  There's little else that you can do other than laugh about it...it's baked in.-Ignore any percentages to succeed on anything you do.  They're meaningless.  You'll realize it's all BS after your 10th time of failing when it says you have a 100% chance of success.  This will be driven home even harder when you see your character who has maxxed out stats in his chosen weapon, the champion of the arena, outfitted in the best gear, and still being unable to hit some highwayman in leather armor.  And if you do, it will be a small percentage of the damage that guy can do to you.  It's depressing, really. -Forget tactics.  They really have no place here.  You'll find some style that works with your approach to games and work it over and over again (as best as the broken mechanics will let you of course).  The game doesn't give you much reason to try anything else, and you won't want to because you're just trying desperately to win some battle.  It's like the designers were unable to find a way to make the game challenging besides giving the enemies a wholly unfair advantage.  And that's what it feels like...cheap and dirty hits.  That might be ok if it was built into the story and somehow made sense.  But when it's the developers that are doing it, you really don't feel like supporting them again.  Which is a shame, because if they tweaked just that one thing...that one small thing...to play by the rules...it would be pretty enjoyable.  There's a lot of content, some really funny breaking-the-4th-wall comedy, amazing production values in some areas (the world map), and combat with some moderate depth. But alas, it was not meant to be.Frankly, as much as I want to I can't recommend this game.  I got it super cheap as part of a Humble Bundle, and I still can't recommend it.  I don't know if I'll ever return to the game again, but if the developers fix these problems, I'll certainly update my review.			"

												If only Steam would allowed that, I'd post it under the neutral banner. The game is neither all good or all bad, it's somewhat of any of those extremes.I really liked the story part, especially the main villain figure, and all that dark cult agenda, it was really fitting. With that said, I'm quite not happy with the pace and rhythm the game plot proceed, the characters making their moves and all such things. It's all... static and boring. Yeah, again, the story is good, the way it was written and told is really subpar.I liked the subquests, some of them are really creative and interesting... But buggy and not really rewarding.I... liked the battles, at least, good bunch of them. The maps are challenging, the variety of abilities and ways to get going is really good. With that... Have you noticed the time counter Steam thinks I was playing? Something around 100 hours? Well, in truth it's maybe around 20. I've played the Blackguards on holidays, I never really needed to shut the game. So I was just playing over the moment I get bored and frustrated, and then just leaving the game without closing it. Mostly, it was around some combats, where you abide, and abide... And tarry the tide, if you know that verse.You see, some of the combats are really long, with big maps, lots of enemies, unobvious goals or some freaky bugs not letting you to finish the fight. Like, for example, a crystal you have to break to proceed. You're standing next to it, with a hammer and 100% hit chance. And then you miss. 5 times in the row. The hit percentage is maybe the one of the worst abominations that Blackguards shows to the world of turn-based RP games. They are so unfair, as loaded dices.Finally, with all that pro and contra stuff going hand in hand, there are broken achievements and over-the-top strange pattern to make a good ending. In the end, all the game is unrewarding. Unworthy. My mark is 5.8/10. Think twice over this buy, even on the lowest price possible.			"

												Blackguards would be an overall very good game if it wasn't for a few but very impactfull flaws.I wont indulge in the pros, you can read on for that, I'll just briefly explain why I abandoned a game that I mostly enjoyed at the beginning of the final chapter.First it lacks an element that should be at the very core of a game of this genre: character/team customization.You get a very limited number of characters which is 4, one of them will be swapped with another at a point in the story leaving you with an underpowered character as well. You don't really have a real choice on how to develop them, there is a few things you can decide but since mages are defined by their magic and one of the fighters comes in already half trained the tactical phisionomy of your team is pretty much decided before you start the game. You can customize your main character a bit more but you'll realize that the only role lacking in your team will be an archer which is also the stronger dps in the game... Second and most important: everytime a loading screens appears cross your fingers because there's a good chance the game is gonna crash. This is most definetly something that can be fixed and it's also something that didn't affect every player,  but given how frequent and long the loading screens generally are it really ruined my experience with this game.Third: devs brag a lot a about the depth of the story, they also use it as an alibi to justify things like killing fresh characters for no reason and the impossibility to farm. But the truth is there is not much of a story at all, the most of the game is a barely engagefull hunt for clues to unveil the mistery of what happened at the beginning, very linear, not interactive at all, if you really dig powerfull story-driven stuff this will also strike you as trivial and stupid at some points.Also given the price nowadays there's plenty more games of the same genre you might wanna give a shot to on steam that look much more promising.

												Difficulty spikes when trying to rescue the Baroness. Balancing needs alot of work. Really feels Alpha. The potential is there but at this stage, the balancing issue with the characters just being a couple levels weaker than the NPCs and with maps designed with strategic challenge in mind, just makes a frustrating experience. Feels harder than XCOM on the hardest difficulty. Really doubt I will try another game in development stage. It's in ""Beta"" for a reason. At the current ""Beta"" stage I would not recommend this game.			"

												First off, AMAZING design and detail on every battle map, no 2 battles ever look or feel the same, and there are plenty. Thats a huge factor for these type of games and its evident they invested alot of time and effort into that area of the game. Also, Difficulty is so so critical for lasting entertainment in turn based rpgs and this one NAILS it. Without giving too much away, its not too difficult, not too easy, but theres a splash of both extremes at times which makes for genuine gaming fun. Dont know too many other TBRPG where each and every character in your party becomes and remains so vital to your strategy and success. Well thought out and well executed. Voice acting, storyline and humor all get a solid A. All subjective but bottomline is that its detailed enough so you care, written well enough so you laugh, and it progresses well enough so you're always looking forward to more. I see bad reviews based on bugs and price. In all fairness, there was an early freezing bug, 5 second fix, 30 gameplay hours later. forgot all about it.I got this for less than what I spend on a night at the movie theater.2 entertainment hours vs 30+ and counting entertainment hours.Guess it just depends on how you see it, right?Not selling. just sharing.Fully enjoying and recommending Blackguards and looking forward to hearing more about Blackguards 2!

												I like Daedalic games, especially adventures, but I cannot recommend this one. The game is not so bad per se, but there are much better games in the similar genre. Battle is too dependent on RNG, and the story is just fantasy cliche and is very linear. If you want to play interesting RPG/TBS combo, you better try Expeditions: Conquistador - it's cheaper and more interesting.			"

												How would you feel when you are unable to proceed because you do not have the required abilities to deal with the enemy?You could say, tough luck, it is your own fault, because you made the wrong choices. And I grant you that. But how can I make the right choices when I do not know the strengths and weaknesses of these abilities? And how can I foresee that the story seriously impacts the functioning of my party?  At two moments in the game you will be inflicted with a setback that unhinges your party's fighting power. Once, one of the party members gets killed because the story is written that way. And at another time her replacement, a magic user, gets robbed of her ability to do magic and so thousands of points sunk in developing her magic powers becomes nullified with one stroke. So you might expect that the game takes this into account, but not at all: you cannot undo your choices nor does the game allow you to make up for the loss of a valuable party member.This then, in a nutshell, is the problem with Blackguards.. This game is very much like searching for keys to doors, while you do not know which key opens which door, you do not know if a door leads to anything useful, you do not know when or if you will find the key or the door to which it belongs and you might find  that the keys and doors disappeared before you actually could make use of them. So what is left is to go back to an earlier point in the game and find the right keys to the right doors: make the right choices. And unfortunately you might have to go a long way back: perhaps all the way to the beginning.And then another issue pops up.Blackguards is  basically a tactical battle simulator in which the battles are linked together by a thin storyline that gives the battles context. You will find that many of the common characteristics of a roleplay game are underdeveloped. For one, your party members are a given and so are their classes. Do not expect that you can build your own party. Furthermore there are few choices in equipment so your party will be running around with the same armor and weapons for long stretches.  And while many places have shops, you will only visit them to restock your supplies. But the crucial issue is that the story is simply too linear. While at some point you can select what to do first, you will be unable to change the storyline in any significant way. And because the story isn't really special at all, redoing this game just so you can change your characters is not enough of an incentive to go through the game again..Even as a tactical battle simulator the game leaves much to be desired. For instance you are unable to determine the setup of your party members. More often than not the game gleefully shoves your more vulnerable members, your magic users, in the front line.  Hilarious is the ability to set traps. You have almost no time to set traps, let alone set the traps that actually make  difference. The traps are expensive, the relevant skill requires a massive amount of points and you have only a very limited amount of traps.  In addition some battles confront you with a special setup that is pivotal to the battle, often without explaining to you the specifics. In one battle, for instance, you will be able to make use of automated flamethrowers. But the game doesn't explain this to you, nor do you know what the impact is until you have seen their effect and you figured out how to operate them. It therefore requires you to redo the battle at least once.Some battles are practically unwinnable until you achieve a certain level, or develop a certain ability to a certain level.Is it all bad then?Actually no.When I went through the game the first time I actually was entertained. The game uses what I call the fall out principle. The fall out principle is that you start out as a nobody and then gradually start to make a difference when the story unfolds. This is the reverse of what you might call the dragon age effect in which  it is clear from the start that you are a special person destined to make a difference.Personally I prefer the first angle to the last. Also the characters are amusing, even though, or perhaps because, they are so cliche. The remarks of the Naurim, the grumpy dwarf, are pretty funny and in line of what you might expect from a dwarf: a fighter who distrusts magic users and elves. The story, although linear, has a few twists and also there is some emotional connection as it involves a friend and later on a family member. It isn't also clearcut that the enemy is actually bad and it leaves things fuzzy  for a long time.So it seems to me that if you go once through the game(using a game guide to form your party) then you might probably be entertained.Verdict:Blackguard is a nice filler when you are in between better games. Pick it up when it is in the bargain bin and around five dollars or euros or less.(Note: steam doesn't allow for a meh score at the time of writing this review. This game most certainly belongs to this category. I gave it a thumbs up just because, when choosing between the negative and the positive, i prefer the latter).			"

												Now that I finished this game, is time to review it.When I heard about a tactic turn-based strategy game, about some blackguards (that promised some bad guys doing bad things!) with RPG elements, and I saw the game was in my steam library, I said: ""Yes!""But... that was a big mistake.The story of the game has a good start: A mystery. A murder. Are you guilty? Are you innocent? If you are innocent, who is the true murderer? Why can't you remember nothing?And with that, you get out of prison to live some adventures.The characters are charismatic and with personalities of their own. The world is full of life, but most of the secondary missions are only valuable for the Adventure Points (the XP of the game), and they are irrelevant to the story.The game has a few plot twists and they are not bad at all, but before reaching them you will probably exhausted. The problem is that the ending is... well... is HORRIBLE. It is the ending that you can expect, but is displayed in a really awful and strange way that makes you think: ""I really finished this game to see this?""The gameplay is good in the beginning, but when you are more or less mid-game you will probably be sick of being poisoned. And that's only the start: The machine abuses the use of poisons. You will probably hear every turn ""Poison!"" or ""I am poisoned!"" or ""I hate poison"". Also, some special combats in Act 5 are never explained why are this special or why the special rules.As many other tactic turn-based games, probabilities are really important. That means you can have a lucky day and impact an almost impossible shoot, or a really unlucky and fail all your 98% chance spells. But, as always, it seems ""50%"" means ""1/2"" to me and ""1/10"" to machine, as I never impacted an attack under 20% and usually failed things of 70-80%, 95% or even 98%. In a game where every movement, every action counts, this can make you sick really fast. Also, the enemies are as if they were taken out of Matrix, because they can dodge easily and usually all your attacks.So, well, unless you really want to be poisoned EVERY combat, lose your patience failing your 98% chance spells and being parried attacks that shouldn't be parried, and playing a lot of hours to receive a half-cooked last Act with a fast ending as closure, you probably shouldn't play this game.

BLACKGUARDS! Wonderful features such as: -EXCLUSIVE SUPPORT FOR 16:9 ratio screens, anything else has massive letterbox black bars that ruin immersion!-Total lack of a 360 degree camera - the visuals might be 3d, but every battle-screen and town is locked to one camera angle!-Really bad itemization! I made my character a 2-handed sword focused warrior. Turns out 2-handed swords don't exist in the loot tables until the second act (1-2 hours in), holy♥♥♥♥♥♥-No exploration whatsoever, anywhere that isn't a 2d city is a 2d battle or a load screen. NOTHING IN-BETWEEN.The only draw of this game is that you play as a group of misfits and bad guys. Except you don't really play as bad guys or misfits at all - in fact, it seems very standard for a fantasy RPG. You are thrown into the utterly predictable universe of The Dark Eye - a German sort of more boring, more cliche version of the already awful pastiche the English world knows as ""Forgotten Realms."" The entire concept of this game was that you play as the baddies, a somewhat refreshing idea on the extremely tired fantasy adventure. Except you don't - at all. Your character - get ready - wakes up in a prison cell after being tortured, and goes on a mission of revenge against the EVIL badguy with the EVIL artifact. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ how original. You spend most of your time doing stupid quests like rescuing a damsel in distress and healing the sick. Sorry, what was the title of this game again? Oh, Blackguards? Wait really?Prepare for a long adventure of boring RNG-decided battles, random and arbitrary interactable objects, and extremely slow loot progression! Repetitive cities, awful dialogue, poor voice acting, and the same 5 load screens 400 times a session. Prepare to reload your game over and over again as your sound strategy falls apart as your heroes miss consistently despite an 85% chance to hit and your mages fizzle their spells due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ standard build that the developers gave them!I don't even know what else to say about this game. It's an embarassment and a total waste of money. Luckily I got it as part of an inexpensive humble bundle, otherwise I'd be a bit more frustrated. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it just don't buy it. And probably don't buy the second one.			"

												This game is a very special kind of misguided. - It takes the stance that the player should be learning the mechanics exclusively through negative reinforcement and repeated failure.The exact opposite of what a modern game with a complex ruleset should do. The tutorial gives you all the non-relevant details. It tells you where to click, instead of how things work. - If you already know the pen-and-paper DSA rule-set, you'll understand how things work. But the system is too convoluted. It does not translate to a single-player on-screen experience in a game that is exclusively about combat, not a full role-playing experience. The game does not properly communicate the 'relevant' deatils well enough. And it displays misleading stats that do not take 'effective' numbers into account, but just some pre-stage calculation that is irrelevant. If you turn on the detail log, you'll not get any more insight in how things work. Instead, you'll just notice that the rolls are very likely rigged. I could sit with a real twenty-sided die all day and would not come up with a sequence of results that much skewed towards failure on my part. Four failures in a row on that special attack that uses 7 arrows? Get used to it. On the other hand, you'll see that the enemies, especially in the later chapters are rigged to basically almost never fail. Towards end-game the mechanics of the game work solely against you, never in your favor. The enemies are rigged so the game stays 'challanging'. That includes NPCs with impossible armor/resistance stats, quasi-teleportation of certain mobs 'at random', so your positioning ends up good or bad 'at random', etc. - The difficulty is based on the QA guy having finished a level. With a perfect party build, knowing all events and scripted enemy behaviour up front. Sometimes, If the RNG was playing along. What sensible game developers would have made the 'hard' mode is 'normal' here. You're going to be restarting battles a lot for reasons you have no control over. The 'retry' button pops up a confirmation dialog that's borderline mocking you: 'Do you really want to repeat this fight?'. - For a tactics game of such a slow pace, the outcome of a battle relies way too much on rng chance. So you're playing that last arena level in chapter three with endless enemy respawn? Pray to god that after twenty minutes of sitting through the tedium of that convoluted level your key char is not double crit-hit by a small mob after two consecutive misses of ninety-five percent to-hit blows of his own. Thanks for playing. Please sit through another twenty minutes of tedium. If the game is generous it will crit your key chars just ten minutes into a level, so you don't have to pointlessly replay as much. Some levels are crafted to the execution of a pretty tight plan. RNG does not like you in a key moment? Have fun restarting. Single failures or mistakes spiral into catastrophic failure way too quickly for this to be fun. There are random actions enemies can perform, especially casters, that can keep your entire team in a perma-stunlock long enough to reduce you to mincemeat. In essence: the random element is too strong on quite a number of encounters. An in this game it means: half the time you have a chance, half the time you don't. - The story and dialogue is jar-droppingly incoherent and outright stupid. Why did they bother to have the dialog spoken, I don't know. Bad voice acting of a minimalist script makes this an incoherent mess. Barely manages to convey the gist of what is going on. Sometimes not even that. My bet is they were afraid of writing, because the masses apparently do not like reading through a story. Well. Now the story makes less sense than the plot of 'Suicide Squad'.- Combat levels are hit and miss. The ones you'll remember are mostly miss. The devs want you to fail certain levels at least once, but preferably multiple times. And since you can't save mid-battle, and have to restart from scratch, it all nicely 'extends' play time, you know. No way to speed gameplay up either. See that tentacle animation of it coming out and going back to water that it does every time? Good thing we have 7 of them on-screen, so you can watch a pointless pre- and post- animation every time one of them does something.- Props for the devs trying to change things up a bit with some 'creative' missions. It's not well done though. Example: there's a mission where you need to 'sneak' past a patrol. Basically stay out of lit areas and run from cover to cover in bushes. Guards don't see you if you stay hidden. Guess what happens when one of your characters has the 'attack of opportunity' skill, which grants them a free attack when an enemy tries to pass by them? That's right, the oblivious guard passes your char by the bushes, and the attack of opportunity triggers automatically, so your char takes his spear and skewers the guard passing by. You can't turn it off short of giving the chars in question ranged weapons. After you 'retry' the level of course. Because you messed up, obviously.... - If they wanted it to be difficult but rewarding they should have gone for bigger combat areas, better weays to utilize terrain, and more opportunity for player agency. They designed the levels to be played in a certain way. You deviate, you lose. You find out the hard way (by losing a lot) what the designer's idea of 'solving' a level was. Your ideas are not wanted, and there's no freedom for you to come up with anything anyway. You're railroaded, because the levels are too small, too cramped, and thus you have very few choices and the enemies have very few choices. So you work on some details, and hope RNGesus is with you. Then you restart the level, because you lost again. There's levels where at a certain point a certain spell must be successful, or you lose (due to limited turn constraints). I've rarely seen such incompetence in level design. The 'hard' levels are designed to be 'clever'. They're definitely not designed to be 'fun'. This is a game, it should be fair, transparent in its rules, challenging, and rewarding. You could make a point a that it is challanging. But not on its own merits. It's merely challenging because its unfailr, intransparent and unrewarding.So. No. I can't recommend it. It's a wrong kind of hardcore. The game goes out of its way to dish out frustration by witholding information, or just screwing you over at the last moment of a long level with a sequence of 'unlucky' rolls. Good strategy/tactics games are easy to learn and hard to master. This one is hard to learn. Up to this day there's a debate on the forums as to how the to-hit system even works, because dev's explanation is inconsistent with what we see in-game and the game certainly does not tell you how it works. And there's too little freedom within the levels to really master anything. You solve a level/puzzle each time around it's 'interactive objetcs', whose use is often mandatory. And then try to deal with things you can't possibly anticipate to happen, but hey, the QA guy managed once and he said he had fun playing, so it must be good. Thumbs down for not thinking about how to present content and how to communicate mechanics. It's almost as if player frustration was their goal when designing this. Too bad, because at its core it has nice potential. Remember the frustration of dealing with the Bed of Chaos in Dark Souls 1 for the first time. Then imagine adding a random element that insta-kills your character the moment you step throught the boss door seven out of ten times. Then add the insult of the game communicating to you that it happens only one time in twenty as a sacrifice of sorts, and that it's just you being unlucky. If you're into that kind of thing, go ahead and buy Blackguards. It has about a dozen or so levels that are pretty much like that.			"

												I have only played 6 hours of this game, and I have stopped.This game will appeal to some of you, but it doesnt work for me.Blackguardsis a style of game I just dont like. To be clear I prefer game that at least give you the appearance of free will and self determination. Blackguards has set out to control your play, not allowing for any random encounters and engineering the enounters that you have so that they are all ""challenging"". Which would be fine, except that your toon build really, really matters.With limited points to spend and ""challenging encounters"" it seems as if there is a certain build type that will work for each toon.If I am right, and it feels so, then giving me freedom to build 'incorrectly' as is my style of play, means I fail.With no random encounters to build toons otherwise, it means either re-start and build differently, or follow the guild for builds as in the forum.(There is a forum guide on 'best' builds for your toons.Seriously, I would prefer auto build if i have that little choice, where certain builds work and others just dont - where you follow the games perfered build or fail.If you prefer Dark Souls over Elder Scolls or Fallout, then this may well be the game for you, else if you like to play YOUR way, wether it is turtling, over leveling your toons, or just building them the way you want, to play the way you want.. then perhaps stick with games that let you do that.

												I can't begin to tell you how many times I've seen people say stuff like ""Gee, I really wish I could recommend this game,"" and that's about how I feel about Blackguards. It's relatively interesting, there are some fun moments, etc., but overall it's just kinda lacking, especially in terms of giving the player a measure of freedom. I'd say just don't bother, it's certainly not worth $40, and I'd say it's only barely worth $5.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this game. A lovely mix of turn based strategy and plain old rpg. --7/10All pro´s and con´s are, ofcourse, from my viewpoint. (As an old school rpg player and fairly hardcore computer gamer.)PRO´s:* No over abundance of +5 Swords of the destroyer with bells, whistles and a blowtorch. A quite minimalistic level of ""Magical"" weapons and armor. * Some great battlegrounds with nice scenery and interactive gadgets.* Likable characters.CON´s:* Some dialouges seemed slapped together in a hurry with no ""own"" background and a lack of engageing content.* Hexagon focus reacts to creatures. i.e. Animated inhabitants of said hexagons neighbour can interfer with what tile you click. Very frustrating ending up clicking the wrong tile while attacking. Forced me to rage quit 3-4 times. :) (Can be avoided by setting camera angle 90 degrees, but then the visual experience is lost.)* Would have liked to be able to configure the apperance of my main character a lot more.

												**Not worth the full asking price, still bugged after 2 years, achievements that are impossible to get and various game breaking flaws even in the main campaign**-This game is like... Being stuck with a Dungeon Master that won't adapt to anything you do, and force you to continue on the path it set for you- even if you don't like it.Usually, when I play a T-RPG, I'll find something that work, blast through the story once to get the pacing right, and then play it again in a harder mode and take my time. Well... it is not possible in this game, and to tell the truth, the story isn't good enough to justify that I ever finish it. Let me tell you : You'll not get it right on your first try. The game will take away things you put a lot of effort into without you having a say in it.You'll have to start the game over, or read a guide to make sure you plan your characters correctly. You'll have to use these damn consumable I hate to use, put your points in these damn debuff I hate to use.In short, if you like to play your own way or feel strong, this game is not for you.If your the kind that like to find the optimal builds, and don't mind a few bugs, buy it for under $10.=> 5/10			"

												Game gets boring really fast. VO/story/atmosphere is terrible. Loot is forgettable and combat is tedious. Basically the game is series of scripted encounters that you can only lose if you made the wrong choices when choosing new skills/lvl upgrades. 80% of the skills/stats/abilities are useless, so the main challenge is guesstimating which skills will be useful in future encounters. I doesn't feel like a RPG at all. It's more like a tactics game with levels to beat (think Elven Legacy with 4 troops and fixed turn order).			"

												What is good about this game:- Character development is complex- Good setting- Varied enemies- Variety of situations you find yourself into- Nice graphicsSo why downvote?Because my friends, of two reasons.The GAME BALANCE. It is so broken i cannot even believe it. Some fights are so unbalanced i had to actually lower the difficultry to Normal to beat them, which i never ever did for any game in my life. This because you are put in situations where you just need luck to make it out alive.And Luck is the real master of this game, not skill nor strategy. Just pure luck. RNG (Random Numerical Generation) (What determines % of success or failure of things) is so determining in the combat that it just rules over everything. In other turn based games there is RNG of course, but also other factors like strategy, formations, class builds, level are critical to win a fight, but not here in blackguards, not at the same level.A single random critical, or spell failure (spells can FAIL casting, yes you got it right), or a random miss with 99% chance, or again some trap which activates randomly decides to turn just towards your party and wipe it out with a blast of fire.All these things can make a fight fail. Random chance upon chance upon chance upon chance. Not even in Vegas there is so much gambling.This more than a game of skill is a game of luck. I have many many years of experience in all kinds of RPGs but i just cannot take it anymore. I find myself by now to repeat fight over and over and over again just to get a fight where the RNG favors me, where traps do not activate on my team, or on the target i have to protect, etc, and make me fail after a well planned strategy.Do yourself a favor, go and buy Divinity Original Sin, that's a turn based game made right, not this disguised slot machine of a game we have here.

Blackguards is a medieval fantasy turn-based tactical RPG based on the Dark Eye tabletop RPG. Framed and tortured by the one you called your friend, you make your escape with a few other prisoners, trying to find out the truth behind the accusations against you. This review takes into account the Untold Legends DLC.Pros: Nice game with enough mechanical depth to offer a variety of gameplay styles: rather than level-based progression, you spend adventure points on anything from attributes, weapon skills, spells and perks and determine exactly how specialized you become with your various talents. The story isn't of a great hero, but of someone who won't leave a mark on history, making your way in shady towns and accepting questionable quests, especially in the multiple side quests added by the Untold Legend DLC where you must take stances on subjects such as slavery. Graphics are good enough for the genre, tactical maps are clean, most of which have interactive environment elements you might use against your foes if they don't use them against you. The game is sufficiently balanced, and even with the occasional difficulty spikes, you can jump right back in the last encounter to try things differently.Cons: Many will find the depth to be a bit too much, scrolling through 5 pages of skills and perks will make it hard to figure the best way to optimize your character. There is a limited variety of equipment, especially armor. The story is pretty linear and not all that complex. The odds of success aren't mushed, so 95% chance of success might still miss, multiple times, in a row, which will frustrate anyone who isn't used to rolling dices. The music is somber, and sucks life and excitement out of the game whenever you're not in a combat situation.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youThis is an ok RPG. It is definitively ported directly from its tabletop RPG roots, which might feel very ""meh"" to the average gamer. I still recommend it, just make sure you also get the Untold Legend DLC, or you'll feel the game is short on side-quests.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												The game starts off well enough but I eventually had to quit.  I was getting so frustrated I nearly threw my mouse through my monitor.  Blackguards is presented as a game returning to the core roots of RPG strategy goodness.  Just check out the multiple videos from Daedalic above for all the stuff that sounds so great about this game.  What is presented sounded awesome to me but in reality my two attempts through the game turned into a frustrating slog from one scenario to the next.  I got hooked on the story from the start which turned out to be a prison break.  Nothing ground-shakingly new here but it worked for bringing three main characters together and launching them off on what was to be a quest to save the world.  The cut-scene interactions just propel the story forward, but did contain some humorous dialogue.  City/settlement locations are really just screens you click on to visit the tavern/shop/quest giver, etc.  Again, nothing earth-shattering for the genre but where this game was supposed to shine was in the combat.And the combat on many of the levels was excellent.  Some of the scenarios were very challenging and I truly felt good when I had achieved victory conditions.  You certainly cannot simply build up your characters and then rush through everything.  Planning was necessary.   All that was great.Specific building of your characters is crucial to the point that if you build them wrong, you will find that the difficulty spikes.  Character building is handled through allocating skill points.  There are a lot of options (FIVE screens worth) and very little in-game guidance on what to build up first.  I am sure most players will do what I did and end up resorting to the forums and walkthroughs to know how best to maximize their points.  It should not be this difficult or nebulous on building up your characters - especially with this many options.  The game reminds you to save often so you can go back to an earlier time and rebuild if needed.  But that still stings a little knowing that you lost that progress and will need to make it up.But then the game started throwing out some curve balls on the scenarios and I found myself needing to restart certain ones again and again.  These levels were often fronted by a cut-scene dialogue that had to be clicked through again and again.  I just do not understand why they couldn't simply start the level with your characters on the field.  Many of these levels had special rules or situations that were not made apparent until you played them.  So you learned the ""special"" rules through failing at the level and had to try again.  And again.  And again.  It does not help when the game chains scenarios together without a way to rest in-between.  You may find that by the end of the 2nd or 3rd scenario you are completely out of potions/health/magic/whatever.  And you may need to not only restart that level, but perhaps go back to a prior level so that you end with enough health/magic to be successful in the next one.  I could see the game doing this on hardcore difficulty for those who really enjoy upping the difficulty, but I just wanted to veg out after a hard day at work.  By the time I was into the gladiator fights in chapter 2 I realized something.  The. Game. Was. No. Fun. I am recommending a pass on this one.  If you do buy it, wait for a nice Steam or bundle sale.			"

												I honestly took a long time to play this game (I knew I eventually would as I love turn based tactical RPG), because of all the mixed reviews.  Regardless, I can't believe how much fun the combat in this game is.  I'll break down some key game concepts that might persuade you to buy or push you away.Good:-Amazing character development using a deep system of random dice rolls and old-school board game elements-Hard battles (some are pushovers) that make you think or have to re-do because of a single screw up-Deep turn based hexagonal board-like combat involving traps and the environment-A Baldur's Gate style of map minus the exploration-The game really focuses on the battles without the fuss of wandering and exploring (ie. not an exploration game)Bad:-The story is not bad, but one shouldn't be getting this game for that reason-The itemization and game mechanics are a bit complicated to understand and required a lot of Google searching-Linear story and no explorationIf you are looking for a game that focuses purely on the tactical turn based combat, then this is truly it.  There is no wandering and exploring with your party and discovering secrets.  The world map is like Baldur's Gate, however, when you visit cities and places, you are either transported into a combat situation with some cutscenes or visit a town where NPC's are static screens filled with innkeepers, healers, merchants, etc.			"

												Love the game so far and can't wait for another chapter to open up the story line. The whole thing has and old school-cool, well rounded feel, and the turn-based fights have always been my favorite!However, a bit more variety in the character customisation at the start would be nice - so deciding in the beginning if my melee fighter should start with sword or spear skills - just giving the player a bit more of a choice... I don't know if that point is coming across correctly. But all in all, I think the developers can be very proud of blackguards: smooth, solid gameplay, fml-moments, loveable characters, face palms and lols - all included! ^^I really, honestly like it a lot! :D and if I had any game-playing friends, I would definately recommend it to them!

												The RNG factor in this game is major issue. I love turn-based/strategy/tactic- games but this game just takes all the fun out of the gameplay in fights. Even if you execute the fights as the game wants you to (clearly), you will get those 90%-95%  misses in row and that makes you using F9 or ""try again"" all time. It is frustrating/repetitive as hell and is sucking the all the excitement out of the game. I must say at this point im breaking apart and will most likely just delete this crap.

												I can't really recommend it.. It's somehow frustating at some point and I never got beyond the first couple of 'towns' and the relevant quests. It started quite good and interesting but when I have to try a fight over and over again vs. incredible strong opponents at the very beginning it turned out, that you rather need some good luck to win a fight, rather than tactics. I'm talking especially about the fight to rescue the baroness and the fight vs. the two dwarfs. I mean why fight such powerful opponents in the very beginning with such shity gear and values for your party? And that stupid turn limit to rescue the baroness is just frustating. Sorry, after a good start it just gets disappointing. If I could sell or gift it on steam, I gladly would.			"

												I'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews that this game has received. I personally found the story to be interesting and engaging, it's dark in places and you need to get your hands dirty, but that's how Dark Eye fantasy generally is. One moment in particular seems to have turned some players off, I thought it was a brave decision by the developers, and I thought it worked well, a story should generate emotion, and this one did. It's not all grim and dark however, and the humour is very finely tuned in places. Turn based tactical games are a genre that I'm very much into, I play a lot of Chaos Reborn on a daily basis for the PvP side of it. Consequentially I often find that with story driven turn based tactical games that the PvE battles are a let-down, I don't think an AI can generally replicate the engagement that comes from playing against a human opponent. But I tell you what, Blackguards comes as close to it as I've ever found. There's a real wealth of variation in the battles that occur from; small skirmishes, arena fights, fighting withdraws, chase downs, there's all sorts. The developers of Blackguards have really gone out of their way to keep the fighting fresh. As a result this is one story driven turn based tactical game that I can see myself replaying. Just taken on their own the fights are a lot of fun.I think the one caveat that I'd give is that this is a game where it's worth checking out what happens to certain characters in advance. I’m not going to give anyway any spoilers here, but making your party build based on that knowledge does make a difference to the overall effectiveness of your party by the end of the game.			"

												""Back in the day"" this would have been called ""a thinking man's game."" If you are looking for ""fast paced"" look elsewhere. EVERY thing that you do NEEDS to be carefully considered and thought out. The Manual says to ""save often."" And it is spot on because you WILL have to go back and retry battles.The biggest problem that I have (had) with it is that while it is billed as non-linear, in the begining it IS. And some of the begining quests are out of balance with the character's abilities. Now, I will readily admit that I am not an especially intelligent person. I'm not stupid, but i feel like it when i play this game. Sometimes I can figure out what i need to do... but i can't figure out HOW to get it done. (Like i KNOW i need to lure the Wood Troll into the swamp gas areas and then blow them up, but it moves too far for me to get him where i want him.)Some games do a very good job of designing a variety of difficulty levels so that anyone can play them at whatever level of difficulty they want to. (ex: The King's Bounty Games, the Witcher games, and the Elder Scrolls series.) some - like this one - do not.If you LOVE a real challenge and don't mind the frustration of failing and having to re-start a game... buy this. If you want a game that you can just play even if you aren't a chess Grand Master... don't.			"

I find the difficulty refreshing. there only a few games like this that are this difficult. Its constantly challenging you wih unfair situations and at times the battles are more like puzzles to be solved. If your looking for a game where you can just put together the most effective , winningest party and then just consistantly  kick everythings♥♥♥♥♥ this isnt it. If your looking for a game that will constantly challenge you to find the way to win each battle or string of battles, this is the one.That being said, there are definitly character builds that work fine up untill a certain battle and then they will not let you procede no matter how hard you try. Its highly reccomended that you check out one of the guides out there that will give you pointers on what to avoid and whats more effective.			"

												Really interesting story with many choices when it comes to weapons and spells, but that's also the biggest downside. All attacks and spells success rates are dependent on how many points you put into the spell. This makes you not want to spend any points on more than one spell unless you want poor hit rates.You also can't grind in this game. I managed to finish the story first time without much thought into where I put my points, but I can see how someone can squander their upgrade points in a way where they are too weak to finish the story. I think a new game plus would be nice for those of us that would like to go back through the game choosing alternate story options and destroying enemies with new unused spells.I only played the base version of the game so maybe the expansions  add more than what I've experienced. I'd say it's worth playing but not for $40. Wait for it to be on sale. I wouldn't spend more than $20.			"

												This game was part of a bundle I bought 1 year ago - together with Memoria and Dark eye: Chains of Satinav. I did not install it at the time because the looks of the game did not appeal to me at first. I even thought back then that this was a strategy game (its actually a turn based RPG :P) One month ago, I decided to install the game in order to get the steam cards. Based on the reviews I was expecting a pretty aweful game. Nevertheless, I decided to play for an hour instead of idling.The first screen I encountered was the character creation. I was pleasantly suprised by the depth and variety of choices and I found myself tinkering at the various options and builds for an hour!Well, after an hour, I thought that the options did not really matter because I wasnt going to play the game given how bad it must be according to the reviews I had read. However, I was still waiting for those cards so I decided to have a look at the actual game. Again, to my suprise, although it started slowly, the game captured my interest. Slowly, but steadily, I started enjoying the story and the battles gameplay. That was it, after some time I was hooked!Here is what I think of the game:+Give the game some time at the beginning. It starts slowly but it steadily builds a strong story! Same goes for the gameplay. It looks a bit strange at first but I grew to like it very much! +The Graphs are really good. +Full sound + Voice + Subtitles +Dialogue options+Decisions matter+Challenging game+Character creation system. There is no level up system - Using adventure points to create unique ways of fighting. +Story twists. +I havent encountered any in game bugs. -Some may find the game TOO challenging. Its not a forgiving game. You have to think the consequences of your gameplay. -Linear. Most of the times there is only one battle available. -THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT IS THAT THE GAME SEEMS TO HAVE SOME PROBLEM RUNNING IN WINDOWS 10. However, this issue can be solved with a little bit of tinkering. There are numerous solutions out there. To sum up, I fully recommend this game at a discount and even at full price if you enjoy turn based RPGS. I dont understand whats going on with other reviews. Perhaps people were expecting a different kind of game? However, keep in mind that the game has some compatibility issues with Win 10. I've already bought Blackguards 2.			"

												A solid strategy RPG that focuses on the combat and doesn't weigh you down with walking back and forth through the same areas. Cities, dungeons, and world are travelled by point and click and I enjoyed the simplicity of it. Combat is done with an isometric view on hexes. Each combat area is unique. Melee combat is fairly straight forward. The magic combat really shines with up to 4 levels of each spell, each level unique, allowing you to pick any level you have unlocked. So later in the game, a mage can have quite the variation of spells to choose from. I felt the game started a little slow, took off and didn't slow down until the anticlimactic ending. I was able to beat the game with over 30 hours which included the DLC. The DLC was integrated into the main campaign, which was nice. I like a game that doesn't overstay it's welcome.Regarding difficulty, I felt many previous The Dark Eye games were much more difficult and appreciated the fact that I was able to get through this game with minimal issues. It is a strategy game, so if you pick poor weapon and spell combinations,you will hit a brick wall you can't pass. If you are having difficulty with the game, lower the difficulty. I like that difficulty can be changed. Another bonus is the game starts up quick and you can skip the intro and get right to the menu. It is worth mentioning with so many games forcing you to wait through minutes of unskippable logos.			"

												I got this game in a bundle and was just curious to try it, so I first cheked the store page to see if there were good reviews. There weren\'t, and people was talking about it as too hard.I agree, the character sheet is very complex and you end up wasting a lot of experience points, but it\'s not too bad.I really enjoyed the story and I find that the voice acting is superb, there\'s a point in the game where you have more than 10 side quests and you really want to go on, but then there\'s a slow down and it gets quite heavy in the end. I don\'t think it\'s too hard, but I don\'t recommend playing this game at max difficulty, it\'s balanced enough at normal.Overall it was a fun game, far from perfection but still enjoyable, I definitely won\'t play it a second time, but I will play Blackguards 2, which is said to be even better polished. Hope you found my review useful!			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. But the extremely clunky UI, the complete lack of explanation of gameplay, and the lackluster story made it very hard to do so. Not a complete waste, but there are much better games out there. Played a few more hours, and it wasn't any better. The game is still wildly uneven in difficulty and very obtuse on how certain mechanics actually work. Everything out of combat is a complete joke; the ""dialouge"" which consists of clicking your way down the dialouge box until you're done, the fact that you'll most likely still be using starting equipment 5 hours in, the fact that all spells (no matter how trivial) have a failure chance, to the final point that Final Fantasy 1 had more freedom than this game does. Seriously, every single thing out of combat is a single screenshot where floating chat boxes tell you what's going on.  Save your money, buy a better game.			"

												First, let me just say that (spoiler alert!) despite the title and hype, the game still ends up with a cliched save-the-world scenario.  Which was a bit of a disappointment.All right, so there's some good points to this game: The combats are each well-designed (often frustrating, but that's part of the fun), and almost every combat has some interactive environment object you can use to either help or hurt you.  This part of the game works great.  I wish the rest of the game was better so I could take more advantage of it.Further good news: The game isn't ridiculous easy, even on the easiest difficulty level.  I had to switch down from Normal in order to make any progress past the first chapter.Now for the bad news.First, the combat system is incredibly complicated.  The rules for combat are mostly invisible, but reading through them (on the help screen) made my eyes cross.  This coming from a guy who plays tabletop D&D, HERO System, Shadowrun, Traveller, and Legend of the Five Rings.  This might explain why the chance to hit an opponent is vastly different from the chance marked on your screen.  Anything under an 80% chance to hit will miss at least 2/3 of the time.  And there's one enemy in particular that you won't hit more than about 1/20 of the time, despite the fact that your hit % is shown as 60.  Always.  I'm not sure if the hit chance is failing to take into account about half the combat rules, or if (as some others have suggested) the random number generator is just broken.  Either way, this drops my enjoyment of the game by quite a bit.The other problem is that there's really no actual ""role-playing"" involved in the game.  There's little to nothing you can do to direct the game, except in some of the sidequests.  And most of that involves giving up a sidequest instead of finishing it.  Sure, you have dialogue options, but they don't really *DO* anything.  Overall, I'd probably rate this something like 3/10.  The combat scenes are great, but the combat itself fails, and everything else is boring as hell.			"

												Blackguards is not a very good game. It's a great example of turn-based strategy gone horribly wrong and just because something uses hexagons doesn't make it inherently worthwhile.Blackguards is cheaply made. That much becomes apparent as soon as the voice acting starts torturing your speakers. The voice actor for the male main character is weirdly familiar from other budget titles. He's not trying very hard and neither is anyone else. The graphics are also fairly poor. I didn't expect much but it looks incredibly cheap and one has to suspect it was meant to be a tablet title originally. The art direction is also incredibly generic. This game makes Dragon Age look like Zeno Clash.Most of the game is really just battles. Towns, numerous as they are, serve to buy gear and heal up and not much more. There are side quests but they almost always result in even more combat. You would think a game that contains this much fighting would have deep mechanics but no. There is not even flanking or backstabbing. Most of the weapon abilities make you hit harder or pierce armor in exchange for accuracy and that's basically it for physical attackers. Abilities that can hit multiple enemies are only available very late and they are not great. There is a knockdown but it virtually never works and most elite enemies are outright immune to it. The game is terrible with double standards like this.Mages have a bit more to do but the spells are horribly imbalanced, ranging from absolutely useless to pretty much necessary to beat the game. You can't even make a proper offensive mage because spells do poor damage and are not very mana-efficient. There's virtually no way to restore mana outside of the very poor regeneration between turns. Potions do exist but they are insanely expensive. They're something you use in a boss fight and not something you can waste in a regular encounter. To make things worse, spells are also line of sight dependent. That means if you surround an enemy with your melee fighters, you can't hit them and if one of your characters gets surrounded you can't heal them. Want to throw a fireball into a cluster of enemies? You can't because you have no line of sight to the center so you can never really hit the whole group. It's as annoying as it sounds. Level 4 spells on the other are insane. They can hit every single enemy or ally on the entire map, no matter how far away they are. Sadly, later on enemies use the same spells against you and it's awful because you can't do anything about it.The game's biggest downfall are the gimmick maps. This is hard to explain. Basically, half the encounters are built some sort of gimmick except... the game doesn't explain these gimmicks to you or warns you that there even might be a gimmick instead of a regular skirmish. The most blatant example is when you plunder a crypt and you get attacked by a gang of skeletons (you never hear about skeleton gang violence in the media, typical) and every time you destroy one, it gets resurrected by some crystal. Fair enough, you have the skeletons distracted by some of your fighters and have another one sneak around and attack the crystal. You attack it with your spear and...it does no damage. The crystal is immune to thrust damage. There is no feedback to it, you can't figure it out on your own through the environment. Well, that would have been nice to know, I thought to myself. Most of the time the best way to beat is a map is to figure out the gimmick and immediately reload the fight in order to actually use it to its full effect. Everything else is an uphill battle.So yeah, it's not a very good game. It's full of baffling design decisions and even the things outside of combat are not good. I could write for hours about the awful, incoherent story but it's not worth the effort.			"

												BlackGuards is a turn based RPG with party combat and grid battlegrounds . It is not open world game but rather simplified system where you move around towns and map by clicking on images .There are some sidequests and text based choices that can effect quest outcome and impact later in game . At the start you will be able to customize your character in depth with skills but cosmetic options are lacking .This game has a lot of issues but I was able to overlook those because the core gameplay is fun and challenging . I will go over some negative points that people mentioned in reviews to give some feedback .-Beginner's trap?- There are several events in this game that can force you to start over if you did not manage your resources properly . You can end up in a position where you can't win a fight and can't go to previous areas to level up on side quests .  Auto Save will not help so you should keep 2 more save points .I don't think that it adds any fair difficulty but I like games that do not hold my hand .This game is extremely hard because you can't always anticipate what happens . Like you may need a speed buff for a mission but you never got it . There are many fights where I had to go back to get the right skills and come back (which is not always an option) . If you are a casual gamer there is a chance you might get stack because you did not build characters correctly .I am seasond RPG player and this was the most unforgiving game I ever played . -Permadeath on Party Characters-?One of the characters in your party will die ( forever ) This is a scripted event so you won't actually loose party members by diying in combat  . It is kinda cool to see a game have the balls to do that but for obvious reasons not everybody likes that . You can potentially waste some gold by buying equipment for that character ( I think you get it back but sellback value is not the same ) The real problem is that you may waste some of your Skill points thinking that you can rely on this character for a specific role .- Too much Luck -?-In this game Ranged,Melee and Spell attacks have % to hit . Luck is a big factor early on  . Eventually you can upgrade skills high enough to where you will hit 90-100% so it has to do a lot with how you level your characters .Dodging is frustraing early in game but not a fair criticism for RPG because it adds depth to character builds . However there is a luck element to using items from iventory which can be avoided by save/load ( so that mechanic just wastes your time )-Very basic loot System -Loot in this game is not exciting to say the least . You get a 3-7 damage weapon and 10 hours later you get 4-8 weapon .It keeps number values low which is good because it makes fights less gear dependent but I would prefer something better than just common white trash as you would call it in other games .Rewards for Side quests are very unbalanced . Some quest chains can take 2-3 hours and you might get the same reward as the 20 minute quest . There are some specific quests that give uniqe weapons but there is no consistency with legth or difficulty of the mission .I also should address god awful inventory weight system . This game kinda requires you to carry a lot of gear especially toward late game but you never have enough inventory space . Like entire game I was between 90 and 100% full . You constantly have to find items to remove even though you do not have that much junk . -Pros ?- Challenging tactical gameplay Good variety of different stages and objectives Text choices that impact later in game Spells that gain new effect at maximum levelDecent voice acting and some good jokes .Score: 7/10 . I am really enjoying the unpredictable and unforgiving nature of this game . Perhaps it is a bit unfair  to new and casual players but it is fantastic for someone who does not want the game to hold your hand . At full price I would not recommend it to everyone but on sale you should consider picking it up if you like turn based party RPGs .			"

												Very nice ideas, even if it lacks in graphics, something oldschool soaring through gameplay. The battles are well balanced and P&P* smoothly combined with turn based initiative system, like in jRPG or Kings Bounty. Nothing more nothing less, the towns are just interactive scenes with available hot spots, side quest, healer, tavern, shop. And this lets you concentrate on pure turn based combat. Mostly I enjoyed the tactic spots on the battlefield, like slippery mud, burning wood and bushes, shooting chandelier and so on. And the voice over is great, such racy accents!* Updated thanks to the [onkelkarlie] firstly I thought that this game uses D&D ruleset, but it uses the P&P rules from german ""The Dark Eye""			"

												PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE REVIEWInitial Review: Ridiculously, pointlessly difficult. Enjoy 85% attacks missing 50% of the time. Marvel as you're pitted against overwhelming enemies while armed with Shakespearean costumes and sticks. Savor wasting money on healing bandages that DO NOT WORK. I understand a challenge, but this game is unplayably hard. Maybe I'm missing something, but the game is unbelievably frustrating.Upon further Review: Had to sleep on it and think of other approaches. OK so the game doesn't hold your hand. But if you give it some effort, time, and thought, you will find different ways to approach things. I was too harsh. The game just may be ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. Maybe I'm the dummy.			"

												A little difficult to get to grips with at the start but all in all a very enjoyable game (thus far). The game has managed to stay at a very good difficulty level so that it is challenging but not impossible which serves to keep it engaging. There are also lots of little quirks and a well written story which really adds to the experience and keeps things fresh. I feel like I'm part of a story when placing this game as opposed to just playing a game. One small thing that annoys me is that there are no concequences of dying which I feel always takes away from the suspence of a game. Also comparing equipment with your current equipment or just reading the stats of things in general is a bit of pain. But apart from that it's a pretty darn good game.			"

												I can't understand the bad reviews.  This is everything I want in a tacticle RPG game.  Every combat is a unique experience, often with puzzles for you to figure out to make things easier.  The story is interesting, with fun twists, the dialogue is well-written.  I particularly love the static town screens so that you don't have to talk to every uninteresting twit there to make sure you haven't missed anything.  My only slight negative is that the upgrade system is rather complicated, and I had to restart the game once after I figured it out.			"

												Known for old-school point & click adventure games such as Deponia and Edna & Harvey, German developer Daedalic took gamers by surprise when releasing Blackguards – a tactical turn-based RPG based on The Dark Eye tabletop ruleset.While the story sells itself as a dark narrative where you play as outlaws, it’s rather cliche and heroic. The Dark Eye ruleset is the true drawing point. While some rules where cut, such as most non-combat talents, it remains a solid and complex (if rather intimidating) classless system, offering ample freedom when creating your character. It’s a joy for hardcore players, but very poorly explained for newcomers. Sadly, the forced party members end up limiting some of your party building possibilities – sometimes even forcing a restart.Blackguards knows its limitations and uses some unconventional design choices to compensate them, betting everything on its battles – cities are presented as simple animated backgrounds with stores and NPCs to talk with, exploration is limited to a 2D world map full of icons, dungeons are but a semi-linear sequence of battles without rest and the story is told via simple cutscenes, with an occasional decision to be made. This leads to an unique “Western Final Fantasy Tactics” feel, and while the game first hours are very linear, it later opens up to a wide range of interesting side-quests.Daedalic’s background as an adventure game developer is felt here in an unusual way. There are no random battles in Blackguards, meaning that every encounter happens in an unique arena specifically designed for it, often with unique challenges or tactical puzzles. There are traps, time limits, holes that spawn enemies, movable and destructible objects, healing orbs, falling chandeliers, mechanical blades, flying dragons, swamp gas, giant tentacles, mind-controlling plants, draw bridges, collapsing passageways, a giant cage on a crane, etc. There’s not a single RPG out there that offers so many interesting combat scenarios. This alone makes Blackguards a must-play for any tactical fan – or RPG designer. Unfortunately, the game stretches out for far too long (40 to 60 hours), and the limited variety of enemies and equipment result in a rather stale second half of the game. Still, fans of Tactical RPGs will have a blast.			"

												SUMMARY: 8 stars out of 10.  A solid and highly enjoyable RPG!PROLOGUE: I show as having 88 hours playing this game, as of this review.  I probably actually was playing for 80 hours of that, for ONE playthrough. I am methodical and slow, so most of you whippersnappers who like to cut to the chase will likely finish in 40 hours or less.  I saw a lot of complaints about this game having spikes of frustratingly high difficulty, so I played the EASY/NOVICE setting, which I believe gives more Adventure Points (AP) than the other settings.  In retrospect, I can understand the complaints; but I never had that problem, maybe because of the easy setting, maybe for the most part because I pushed off what I suspected would be the tougher fights until I had more skills under my party's belts.  I ended the game with 1300 ducats (enough to ditch EVERYTHING the party needed and buy it all back again), lots of poisons, potions, provisions, projectiles, traps, and other stuff I never seemed to have the need to use.  I used one potion, and that in the second to last battle.  Perhaps on NORMAL difficulty I would have needed more...REVIEW:  This game has a main storyline which is fairly linear, but the available sidequests (and locations they open) make it feel less so.  The RPG character development system is versatile and refreshing: You can mold your characters by earning and using AP to buy levels in any of a myriad of basic traits, talents, weapon talents, special abilities, and (for magic users) spells.  You get AP by fighting battles and completing quests.  You do not get enough AP to turn your characters into super heros; but, if you do most of the sidequests, you will get enough to make them excellent in their chosen specialty (magic, melee, ranged) and solid in a second specialty and/or support.  One word of caution: this is not the game for those who want to destroy waves of hapless foes with giant fire or frost balls.  Using magic to buff teammates (and/or debuff enemies) will carry the day. There are approximately 180 fights available in the game, for those who wish to seek them all out, with plenty of tactical variety and some light ""in-fight"" puzzle solving.  In all but a few cases, the game clues you in to what is needed to make a fight easier.  For those few where they fall short, there is the internet: I used it about six times.  There were about three fights I elected to replay because I failed or did not like the outcome.  All in all, I found the combat to be satisfying.Some have complained of running out of ammo (the shops do not re-stock arrows and bolts); but I ran two archers and one crossbow, and did not come close to running out.  I think someone relied too heavily on ""triple shot"" and ""rain of arrows,"" which skills none of my characters learned.The storyline is nothing to write home about; and the ending cutscenes/wrap-up is lackluster.  But the character voice acting, approriate interjection of humor, and plot intrigue that is played out was, in my opinion, quite well done.Replay value is modest.  The plot twists and intrigue are a lot of what pulled me along the first time.  Your party characters are a mandatory set of (up to) five characters, only one of which you get to roll from scratch, and even HIM not entirely (name, gender and appearance are all set for you).  After almost 90 hours on record for my first run, another one (this time on NORMAL) will have to wait until I am up for it.  But, for the pittance I paid for the game (got it on a deep, DEEP discount), one run was overwhemingly worth the price!EPILOGUE / HINTS (which some might consider slightly spoilerish, but I will not give away plot.)-- Screw the game's advice:  Roll your own character from scratch the first time.  It is almost impossible to fail if you buy in as a magic user and start him out good at SOMETHING.-- Take magic, unless you are dead set on a heavy melee fighter.  the 500 AP cost might seem like a lot, but it is a pittance over the course of the game, compared to the advantages it gives.-- Continuing this line of thought, a dedicated heavy melee fighter is probably not the best choice, as you will eventually end up having two excellent ones foisted upon you.  You will be much better served with a magic buffer/healer who is good at bows.-- All your magic users should be good with staffs, or possibly daggers.-- Study spells carefully before trying to achieve high ranks in them.  For most spells, level 4 is not worth the cost.-- Hammer Blow (HB), coupled with level 3 ""Standfast Catlike"" buff is OP.-- The level 3 buff ""Move like Lightning"" (or some name llike that) is OP.-- A fighter simultaneously buffed with level 3 Lightning and Standfast, and also using HB, is beyond OP for most fights.

												The map and so-called adventure choices are little beyond token, though correctly executed. The story is very classic but does have a couple of courageous twists that deserve credit.Beyond the game system that you of course have to like or not (I do), the main highlights are:1) map design, creative and varied with many fun environment elements;2) difficulty: the game is very challenging at the highest difficulty level and keeps getting harder as you progress toward the last act (die you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plant, die). Some maps or quests are quite tough and you'll need to use all you can to deal with the sheer brutality of special enemies. That's very refreshing from the usual strategy game curve (mildly difficult beginning to mid-game then disappointingly easy as your characters get IMBA).The interface is neat and even rather classy.All in all, quite a nice game if you're into the system.

												Blackguards is a turn based RPG game. A very difficult, very unforgiving one. The backbone of the game is made up by the Dark Eye system, a system similar to DnD and (from what I understand) very popular in Germany. I've played  alot of DnD, and read a lot about the game's system and guides before playing Blackguards, but didn't really feel like it made much of a difference. The RNG is very unforgiving, in that if your characters' builds are not razor optimized, you will have an incredibly difficult time with the game, more than it already is. I STRONGLY suggest looking at character guides and just following one to the T in terms of what are good skills, what are must haves, where to put your points, and the like, as it is very easy to render a character effectively useless in a battle as you continue to invest points in skills.Damage and  status efects stay with characters after fights, and consumables are in relatively short supply, meaning strings of fights become very dicey. Magic casting runs off of the same RNG as the melee attacks do, so it's possible to cast spells, have them fizzle entirely, but still lose mana - very frustrating since you then need to use one of your limited resources in money or mana potions to get them back to the point to where they can even begin to be useful again - or so you hope.These difficulties in learning the games system will unfortunately turn people away from what is a very enjoyable and very think-y turn based combat game. Almost every single individual map is handcrafted and presents new challenges to the party, and the game often forces you to use various party members in different compositions: Aggravating if you chose to focus on one in particular, but from a game design standpoint, if executed well lets you offer all sorts of new challenges. The problem lies in the game's very punishing permanent levellnig system. With no way to undo bad choices and mistakes (and don't be fooled: there ARE mistakes and just bad choices you can make in character builds), you might be stuck at a fight you now have no way of winning, fifteen hours into the campaign.The story is not particularly interesting, in my opinion, but I have played  alot of very intensely narrative focused games so I admit my bar may be set a little bit high. The characters are interesting, and it's fun to see a story told from the perspective of sly ne'er-do-wells rather than heroic caricatures. Unfortunately, I never really felt like anything groundbreaking or innovative was really done with the characters or situations they could have used, and instead it just sort of became background set up fora relatively generic story that could have been done with the more ""Usual Suspects"" of heroic characters.Ironically, I garnered the most fun from the game when my frustration was at its peak and I simply used Cheat Engine to level my characters to the max immediately, giving myself essentially unlimited skill points and ability points to make the characters I actually wanted to make. Due to the punishing RNG and the thoughtful, puzzle-y situations the game likes to put you in, in every single combat, this takes less of the challenge out of the game than you might immediately think (it DOES make it much easier, of course.). Your mileage may vary, but for someone that wants to experience the combat system and the story, i would actually recommend just cheat engining your characters to max level and giving them all the skills you want them to have, and then enjoy using them in the varied combat situations the games put you in.In the end, I give the game a thumbs down - but only because I think the game's opaqueness and difficulty in learning the system is such a a negative that many people will feel immediately turned off by a combinatioin of that and the game's innate difficulty that they'll be unable to enjoy the game for its positive sides.

												I bought the game on sale last week because I never really played a turn-based RPG before and wanted to give this genre a try. As it wasn't too expensive it seemed like a choice without too many risks. I never heard of the game before and didn't read up on any tips to be able to start with a clear and unbiased spirit.So far I have to admit I am really enjoying it. The story, characters and global setting don't appeal that much too me, although everything is more than correct. The story isn't that special, but forms the perfect background for the many fights I encountered so far.And it's in this domain that the game really shines for me. Every fight (or almost every) I had so far really left some room for your own tactic. At the very start of the game I was a bit overwhelmed by the turn-based approach (as I  never played it before), but after a while you really get the hang of it. I like the fact that you have to think about the placement of every character aswell as which attack to use. The fact that it's turn-based also allows you to really plan your next move. Some fights were challenging, but I never got the feeling that it isn't fair so far.I also really appreciate the fact that you can upgrade and shape your characters as you like it. The game allows you to create your party like YOU want to play it.I only spent about 6 hours in the game so far, but I am sure many more will follow.			"

												Some decent ideas let down by painfully bad design. The writing and voice acting are decent, and there are some interesting RPG concepts, but the game is centred around an unbalanced combat system. It is so heavily dependant on RNG, and yet many battles are determined by a few key actions - fail the RNG on those, and you may as well re-start the battle. As such, it simply becomes a frustrating exercise in repetition and luck.There may be some good content here, but it's trapped behind some ill-considered mechanics.			"

												When I started to play the game I was surprised that it have so many negative reviews, it looked like a very good game at the beginning, but then its flaws bacame evident.pros: -good storyline-interesting side quests-huge freedom on character development-decent graphic-interesting combat system-interesting magic/abilitiescons:-freedom on character development can turn against you later in the game. there's no clue on which way you should get skills and abilities and you can come across certains fights where you absolutely need a certain skill to win or it will take a lot of luck. this is quite frustrating. expecially if you don't have a savegame old enought to learn the ability you need.-inventory items are uninteresting: you only get good stuff from a few side quest in the entire game, merchants around the world only sell cheap/bad stuff. also I think the weight of the stuff (especially supplies) is unbalanced.-major and minor bugs could prevent you from completing some side-quests-unnecessary loading timesin the end I can recomend this game only if you are a turn based rpg enthusiast.

												This is great fun, and particularly recommended if you're looking for a less daunting, more linear story-driven turn-based RPG. It's perfect for busy people who perhaps have less time for too-open and deep an experience: - Fairly linear, especially for the first half of the game (it opens out a little in Chapter 3, but even here it is still really just about having some choice about what order you do the quests and fights).- Great story, with a central mystery, and lots of believable twists and turns; it takes you to lots of interesting locations and has you meet a range of engaging characters.  - Good voice acting nearly throughout - only a few weaker performances. The main heroes and villains are all voiced very well. - Some great characters, such as Zuraban, the womanising socialite, Niam, the drug-addicted lost soul or the gold-loving dwarf. These may be fantasy archetypes, but the interaction between them often takes you to new territory, and is often funny. - Fairly deep (but not TOO complicated!) skill tree and leveling up system.  - Good turn-based combat, and challenging if played on Hard. The only criticism I have so far is that there seem to be just a few areas that are a little unpolished - for example, you can skill up you 'traps' detection and disarming ability, only to discover that there is no actual mechanic to allow you to disarm traps. And yes, I've searched the forums! In the end, there are other ways around it, so it's no biggie!			"

												TL/DR at the bottom.Save Your Games Often. SYGO.Lore: This games has a great story, or maybe just a good one, but with great soundtrack. Every time the action stops to give me some of the story, be it only with voice over or with a cinematic, it makes me feel like sitting back, dimming the light, lighting up a cigar (I don't smoke cigars, wtf) and just getting immersed in that world. It works. Oh and SYGO.Graphics: Every graphics outside of the spells and backdrops are ok for a turn-based strategy game, cinematics or gameplay. The backdrops are nice. But the spells are one notch above that. They are cool. Let just say that after 80 hours, I'd gladly skip the crossbow animation in order to save 4 seconds every time, but I'd keep the spells any day of the week. Gameplay: I recommend you name your character SYGO. I didn't. I should have. Now I need to restart from scratch. Don't just SYGO. Keep them. You'll need them. This game is unforgiving as it leads you to think that you'll need this skill and that skill in order to make it, yet it surprises you (too) many times with different tactics and resistance to particular damage. If you can finish this game without a single hint from the internet, a walkthrough or without ever needing to backtrack yourself once to change some skill points (let alone back track yourself 40 hours to change almost everything...) you are a God amongst humans. TL/DR: One of the best turn-based game I've played, as enjoyable as your favorite HOMM or Civ. Poor DLC value, very good base value. If you don't want a good challenge (60 hours) that kinda forces you into restarting at least once the game from scratch (do I hear 120 hours?), then this might not be for you. Only negative thing is that I'm really dissapointed that the dev made a Blackguards 2 instead of adding more than one DLC to this game. Did I mentioned SYGO? Yeah, SYGO. Or cry. Like the people that wrote bad reviews for this game. They didn't SYGO. Clearly. But you will, right?			"

												So having finally finished the game, time for a quick review. Is it worth buying?Eh, just about. It's regularly on sale for £2 or £3, and I got 70hrs out of it, so on that basis you'd be a whiny little ♥♥♥♥♥ to complain. Is it any good?Eh, just about. It's a classic TBS affair. The storyline's OK, but gets kinda convoluted throughout the game so by the end, you've pretty much lost the plot and stopped caring. Something to do with a Whisper...? Anyway. One big plus is the characters and writing. They're generally a likeable bunch and have good banter between them, and often their conversations raise a chuckle.Progress is extremely limited - you won't be working your way up through half a dozen better and better sets of gear as you progress: in fact, once you've got a complete set by around chapter 2, you can pretty much forget about upgrading any more. So if you're a loot junky and love waiting for the loot windows at the end of every fight to see what shiny new gear your heroes are getting, you'll be disappointed.Having said that, if you simply enjoy the basics of TBS combat and love moving your guys around a hexboard and using your new skills/spells to smash zombies in the face, you'll enjoy yourself.OverallIt's not the best TBS out there, but it's not awful. The thrill fades throughout the game so towards the end finishing it off becomes as much a chore as a pleasure, but at 90% off there's no reason TBS fans shouldn't have it in their library.			"

												Much like Baldur’s Gate II, Oblivion, Dishonored, The Witcher II, and countless other fantasy and action games before it, Blackguards begins with the player character sobering up in a dingy dungeon. Said dungeon is especially mildew-y and uninspired, packed with boring old barred cells and dirt floors.Then the player meets a wizard with a voice so melodramatic and overacted that some will likely be put off the game almost immediately.But to strike off the game due to its weak opening alone would be shame, as Blackguards grows gradually into its own strategic combat system, and presents colourful and fantastical confrontations that escalate nicely as the game progresses.Blackguards is a turn-based RPG at heart, based within the universe and roleplaying system of enduring German Dungeons & Dragons-alike The Dark Eye. The story is simple and functional: the player character has been convicted of the murder of a noble’s daughter, with whom he or she was a close friend.Towns consist of little more than painted landscapes populated with stationary NPCs that can be clicked to begin a sparse dialogue tree.There’s no overworld to navigate, merely a series of interconnected nodes on a map. Building a game on the back of a pre-existing RPG has pros and cons, and perhaps because of its hardcore tabletop roots, the levelling and character progression system in Blackguards is immediately intimidating.The combat is easy to understand on a basic level. A player can move and use an action, or cover a greater distance by sacrificing an action. The number of actions that can be performed, including spells and attacks, quickly broaden the combat system into a rich tapestry of decisions.That combat is absolutely the core of Blackguards, both in a gameplay and aesthetic sense.An early assault of brown and grey doesn’t do it any favours, but the presence of large numbers of well-animated on-screen characters later on certainly do. The spell effects are similarly excellent, and there are some creative and terrifying monster designs.There may not be an overworld, and the friendly towns found in most RPGs are absent, but Blackguards does possess an extremely well-developed core combat system, and for that it deserves to be commended.Overall 7/10.

												I enjoyed this game (hence the recommendation) but I really must caveat this, because this game is a cruel mistress.Pros and cons as follows, because how much each point sways you will govern how much you get out of this game. On the whole I enjoyed it.Pros:- Funny dialogue and interesting characters. Naurim might be the greatest character in Western RPG history- Deep strategy. There are lots of environment effects, ways to optimise and spells to learn.- Good voice acting. Genuinely good and a nice array of accents. Apart from the main characters female voice- Dark, gritty artistic direction. Few games capture being and anti-hero so well, with murky non-binary decision making- Challenge. Good god the challenge.Cons-  It's a bit... broken. Little things that seem to have been left incomplete, or lack polish. This includes a few bugs with quests and achievements. A good example is that the combat controls list auto-save, but if you try to use it, the game says you can't.- Not explaining things. Sometimes you will see environmental effects or objects, but have no idea what they are or do until they kill you. Sometimes it will drop you in a level with a special win condition, but it won't be clear what it is. This is fine once you work it out, but causes a bit of trial-and-error frustration- The ending is, well, balls. Quite simply. There are apparently multiple endings, but to me the last chapter and ending felt a bit rushed.			"

												   Let me preface this by saying this game is definitely not for everyone. The story is terrible imo, and there is lack of documentation about the ruleset within the game. So good luck if you mess up your build early in the game (some talents and spells are useless). But, if you can get around those two factors, there is a nice TBRPG here.  Blackguards strength is easily its combat. Difficulty of encounters is not determined by the number of enemies nor the amount of hp they have but by the types of enemies and the environmental hazards on the map. Hell, even increasing the difficulty actually makes the AI smarter instead of having cheap mechanics like OHKOs.  For a first time RPG developer, Daedalic did a suprisingly good job. Unfortunately, Daedelic didn't just decide to make a better Blackguards 1 when making the sequel.			"

												A frustrating, boring mess. This is very hard on new players hoping to learn the genre, and will sit you through painfully tedious repeats of battle scenarios and loading earlier saves if you're not experienced or running through without a guide. It actively discourages tactical creativity at times, and I've found through research that some spells and approaches to the game are just blatantly optimal and better than others. Play the ""meta"" way, or good luck.Beyong that, the plot, characters and voice acting are all sub-par and uninspired. All I can give praise to are the environments and animations, which look great but don't exactly generate fun on their own. I really tried to like this game with 20+ hours of playthrough. I'd hoped I would find the fun in all that time, but sadly I didn't.			"

												OK; I've just spent a couple of days playing this game, and I think I'm about ready to turn in my verdict.Pros: - Interesting storyline; - Decent(ish) combat engine; - Some downright funny moments.Cons: - Opaque combat mechanics (i.e., lack of walkthrough, ingame pedia or other assistance to help understand these numbers getting crunched); - Zurbaran is USELESS *sadface*; - The. Baroness. OMG, the Baroness....where to start. The bonus objective is only achieveable if you've looked up where the traps are placed - and that's just to start! - Siege of Morbal. Nothing ticks one off quite like pushing ahead, winning a tough battle....then, as you're winning, having a rock fall on two characters' heads at once, taking them entirely out of the fight arbitrarily! - No ""RP"" in ""RPG"" - it's a combat grinder, little more. There are hints of an interesting story, but no background, no dialogue, no choices....Overall, Blackguards feels very, very old-school (think JRPG from the mid-90s, but darker and edgier) - 2014 was better than this! Would not recommend unless on significant discount...			"

Blackguards Review Overall Score: 6/10  Storyline: (1/2) + Fun dialogues to read between characters.- Bad storyline (I don't see it going anywhere besides a basic story of the advanture itself). Graphics: (2/2) + Well designed character models and gears.+ Good looking battle maps and towns. Sounds: (2/2) + Voices matching the characters.+ Good sounds in battlemaps and overall. Gameplay: (3/4) + Easy and basic training progress to let you understand the game rules and mechanics.+ Main and Side Quests (Each quest is intresting because it gives rewards and you never know who the enemy is and how many there are).+ Visit each town and meet Blacksmiths/Healers/Merchants etc.. (Inventory/cash is usefull)- Difficulties: It's good to have 3 level of difficulties but we need to understand the difference between each one because it feels hard even on Easy for a new player in Blackguards. RolePlay Elements: (4/7) + Different Classes (Hunter/Mage/Fighter)+ Rich variety of equippment (Weapons/Armor Sets/Items to use on A.I/self/enemy)+ Happy Mage (A full page of spells only for the mage)- Special Moves for other characters (You're able to unlock them with a trainer.. But I'm reaching 15 hours and I still haven't found this 'trainer' yet.+ Talents : A sweet bonus in this game which let you upgrade each talent form level 1 to 5 and give you it's special effect [see below]*Knockdown resistance *Animals/Humans stats detector *Healing Effect * Traps detector and more...+- Stats : There are good sides and bad sides about the stats because in one hand you can match the stats to your likingif you want a spellcaster archer or a dual wielding warrior but if you don't know what you upgrade to your character you might have a weaker character than you've expected.- Equippment stats are a bit clumsy.- Upgrade Points: It takes more time than it should be for a player to think about where to invest his upgrade points. Combat: (4/5) + Each combat is exciting and makes you eager for the next one.+ Basic turn-based combat rules/moves but more challenging then other TB games.+ Usefull Objects : You can throw weapons on the enemy, use/disable traps , use battle objects to move them around or use them against the enemy. You can even hide in the bush from the enemy.+ Satisfaction : For those 100% players, you will re-do the battle until you get it done the best way you want it to be.- Frustration : In some battles I felt like my characters are over powered by the enemy. Had to re-try multiply times in different tactics.To sum it up, I'm enjoying my new Turn Based experience with Blackguards.It offers an addictive experience throughout the game so I recommend on trying this game if you're an experienced TB gamer.Don't bother playing this if you're more of a classic TB gamer who doesn't want to focus much on character's stats and RPG elements that might confuse you along the way.You're more than welcome to also check my screenshots for this game [link below] to see what this game has to offer.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDMikeW2k14/screenshots/?appid=249650&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewallEnjoyment: (6/10)Repetetive: (2/10)Replayability (8/10)Frustraiton (5/10)Boredom (5/10)Overall Score: 6/10* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale.****** Recommended On Full Price.Thanks for reading.

												Ok I'm done. Got in to a decent start and I thought the game is alright. But then came the baroness rescue. Tried to bang my head against the impossible for several hours. Gave up. In terms of making a game challenging, it has to be executed in some different way than throwing you into an impossible situation which requires basically every dice roll to go on your favor in a maximum way. Otherwise, reload and against the same situation again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again. Nuff said? Yeah. Killed all the fun for me. Luckily I got this game with a 90% discount and got a few hours of pretty decent fun. It's a terrible shame really, it would've been interesting to dwell deeper into the storyline. The characters seemed pretty interesting with their personalities. Oh well, now I'm off to uninstall this piece of garbage.			"

Neutral: There is certainly enough to love in the story and roleplaying of Blackguards, but the combats are pretty painful.  Drawn out mercilessly in some cases and filled with the occasional newbie trap, the tactical combat system is slow, clunky, and makes the game feel like much more of a grind than it needs to.  Nonetheless, a high-production game that is worth picking up on a sale if the slow pace and high micro on the combat isn't something that turns you off (or indeed, appeals to you).

												This is the worst game i have played in  long time.  Story is linear and boring.  it's cut scene after cut scene forcing you thr4ough the story interupted but completely unbalanced fights.  i have a dwarf in the game who wields a two handed hammer, and i cant hit an unarmoured wizard, on top of that when i do land a blow, the wizard deals more damage to me with his melee attack.  so the mechanics are sort of broken and frustrating.  It is ultimately a bad story mixed with crappy game mechanics (BTW i am playing on normal).  There is no exploration into the game.  i have played 10+ hours worth so far.  just go hear kill this go hear kill that, save this maiden, do this task.  etc...  If you decide you want to gain some xp before you move forward so the game doesnt kill you very easily you do not have an option.  you have to crank the diff down to easy and then it becomes boring and dull with no real challenge.So the two options i found where ridiculously hard and non sensical (wizard does more melee damage than a two handed melee weilding dwarf)or easy and equivelant to pressing play on a bad fantasy movie every now and again to get the story going.  i would not recomend this game to anyone, especially not for $40.  I love turn based fantasy games.  grew up on the dark sun TSR games, baldurs gate, and way back to hero quest in the late 80's.  so it's definetely up my alley.			"

												Dungeons and Dragons meets Xcom. Instead of running from cover to cover, you use your environment to set traps, set oil puddles on fire, or gain health at a fountain. It's the best way to mix the two ideas.Gameplay-wise, it's too slow in my taste, and it shouldn't cost my character's turn to change weapons or activate a switch; it's tedious. The leveling-up system is overwhelming, and it is too easy to make mistakes while managing your XP spendings. Be warned: XP is a limited ressource and there is no possible grinding. Also, There are some ridiculously difficult fights spiking about. If the game design wasn't all over the place, it wouldn't be an option to change the difficulty whenever I want.It's not bad, but there's better out there. It's a really hardcore experience and I'm not a big fan of D&D. I had crashes and had to reload some games. The achievements are stupid : waste your XP everywhere, use an inn 50 times, run in a circle (not a joke)			"

												TL;DR: If you like a game of chance, play roulette. If you like RPGs, buy a real RPG, if you like tactical combat, buy XCOM. But dont buy Blackguards.After 10 hours of playing the game, the game is simply over for me. I am stuck at an impossible fight, the autosave is at a point were I cannot make any meaningful alterations to who fights anymore. And the fight is unwinable with the character I build.Now, dont get me wrong. Its not a badly build character. Its a very straightforward mage. Its not underleveled either for I did every single quest so far. But if your character is a mage, and you dont build it in one very specific way, you will be stuck at the beginning of chapter 2. It is impossible to progress, since there are no potions or pieces of mage armor available so you usually just get one-shot.Unfortunately, this happens quite often in Blackguards. The game is not balanced - at all. You can in theory build a character, but if you build anything other than a fighter or a very specific mage, you just get stuck in impossible fights - like the one that ended my game.I had fights like this before, and I got through them by just reloading for two hours until the RNG finally turned into my favor.  Here is an example:In one fight, turn one, my main character would get shot and fall on his♥♥♥♥♥about 90% of the time. That means the fight is over - I lacked the DPS to win and he would just continually be shot down. There is nothing you can do against this either. You cannot prepare for fights - all spells etc. can only cast once you are IN the fight. So right away 9/10 cases, I had to reload. If my character managed to dodge, I now had to get a very specific spell of to make sure he wont get shot down every single time. However, the spell barely ever got used so it failed in 3/10 cases. If it failed, reload.So right away I could only progress in 3% of the cases. Of course the rest of the fight also included a lot of luck.Sure with a different character build that wouldnt have happened - but if the game is only beatable with some very specific builds than either dont give the players the option to build their characters, or rebalance the fights.This is the main problem of Blackguards - the game is not skillbased, its largely RNG. That means that dicerolls decide outcomes of fights, not your skill or ingenuity. This makes the whole experience hugely frustrating. And its not frustrating in a good way. In Dark Souls, it is extremely frustrating but you know its your fault, and if you get good enough, if you finally figure all the patterns out, you beat it, and its awesome. In Blackguards, you beat a frustrating fight and the only thing you feel is 'finally its over'. Because its not skill that won the fight, its just that for pure random chance the dice have fallen in your favor. Almost every fight in the game is like this. The few fights that arent usually have a very simple to figure out environmental danger that you have to activate in order to basically get a free win.Until this game actually gets balanced, dont buy it.

												While Blackguards has interesting characters, visually appealing backdrop and a good amount of character customisation. It is linear in nature like most tactical RPGs, it is still engaging enough to keep you playing.What could of been an exceptional tactical RPG, is heavilly mared by the skewerd RNG.  Enemies with ludecrously low hit chances will regularly hit, while your group with ludecriously high chances to hit will miss quite often.  This simply plays out this way the entire game.Many of the enemy hits will impose effects but you wont resist them because of penalites of unknown oragin making the skills you developed to resist them, meaningless.  Likewise Enemies will constantly resist your statuses because aparently you dont apply the same penalities to them.This would be fine for the most part if enemies did similare damage to your group, sadly they typically will almost always do about 50% more, leaving you to scratch your head wondering why.  In general enemies will always be better than or equal to your group in combat, even if they happen to be some merchant or alchemist they will be exceptional warriors none the less.  They also wont give you the gear they are using (aparently that vanishes in a puff of smoke when they die)Again this woud be fine through the use of tactics.  However the RNG issues will often destroy the best tactics you can bring to the table.Plenty of places have traps everywhere and the non-enviromental ones will let the enemies happilly walk over with without triggering them.At the end of the day unless you are happy to ignore the RNG issues and vague information on many of the combat aspects, I cant really recomened Blackguards (hopefully the second one has improved those issues).   Even then best to get it on a 75% off sale.			"

												Hello!  This is a game that seems to have nearly a 50/50 split on good and bad comments/reviews.  I've been working through a fairly long LP of this game and I figure that I probably should weigh-in as well.  I am 100% for this game and I'll list the reasons why down below.  I'll give a short version and a long version for those that want it.  If anyone is interested in seeing a bit more of how the game plays out before picking it up, or just wants to enjoy my struggles and successes, feel free to check it out.

			If you are a fan of tactical turn-based RPG's and an amazing story, look no further than Blackguards. The game starts off quite terrifying and more or less sets the mood for the rest of the game.		

or for any of my other games:https://www.youtube.com/bumpymcsquigumsShort version:Blackguards is a tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg.  The story is very funny at times and quite dark throughout.  You have quite a bit of freedom in regards to how to train your party, what equipment, skills and abilities each person should have.  You are on a linear path, but there is freedom in that as well.  There is, of course, the main quest line to advance the story, (which I find rather entertaining, it's funny, but also dark) and there are several side quests that you CAN do, or miss.  (I missed a few)  There are some things I don't like, (RNG makes things rough and a few multiple battles means one bad decision early can be terrible for you) but overall those can be overcome and dealt with.  I recommend saving often, as I SHOULD have been doing all along.  Still, I think this is by far one of the best games in the tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg games I've played in a long time.  I really don't understand all the negativity towards the game.  :(The Long Version:Blackguards is a tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg.  The story is very funny at times and quite dark throughout. :)The Good:The pacing of the game is fun and very enjoyable and this IS one of the longer games of it's type that I've played in recent memory.  The fact that there's more to the battles than just your attacks/skills/spells abilities is a very refreshing change. Now, I love X-COM and I know this game catches some comparison to it, but even in the different missions in X-COM you pretty much just killed all the aliens.  There's different objectives in battle as well as usable/destroyable terrain.  Sometimes you might have to rush across a bridge to save someone within ""x"" number of turns.  Maybe you are escaping from prison and you can fight the guards, or free other prisoners to fight them off for you.  There's usually several ways to achieve the goal and they add enough different things to keep you guessing AND make it entertaining.    You are part of a story. so the linear gameplay makes sense.  There are flashbacks and you learn pretty quickly what all is going on, well for the most part.  There's still a lot you need to discover, but the story is well written even if it's a bit cheesey at times and overly dark at others.  The voice acting is quite a bit better than I would have expected.  I personally think they did an exceptional job in this department.  The music and graphics are also very well done.The different characters you can pick up for your party all play pretty differently.  The nice thing is you DO have a say in all of their training/gear/abilities after what they have initially.  A mage plays very different from a warrior, who plays very different from an archer.  One of the things I did was had a third mage like character and transitioned her into an archer as I lost my archer a bit earlier on.  So she can use a bow decently well and has spells to fall back on.  I think 90% of the battles are pretty balanced, but every so often you get a battle that just makes you think and rethink your strategy 100 times over before you get it.  The game is unique, I haven't seen anything quite like this before.  The concept isn't so different from a lot of other games, but the setting, the story, even just the idea of having a group of misfits, criminals, drug-addicts as the ""heroes""is fairly different from the norm.I could go on and on about the ""good"" of the game, but I want to address the few issues that I have come across that you may want to know about.  It's a very good game, but nothing is perfect.  :)The Bad : (or Frustrating if you will)The RNG can be exceptionally frustrating at times and bad decisions can bring you to a screeching halt.  I don't recommend ""save scumming"" but I DO recommend saving often, as there are many multiple battles with no way to back out.  There were a few times that I ran into a battle that I made a bad decision in the fight before it and it cost me quite a few stressful attempts to survive.  I have also fought a few battles without really changing my tactics and only managed to win because RNG (Randon Number Generations, i.e. Luck) was in my favor.  One fight in particular that I fought 4 times or more, I did MINOR changes but it really came down to my person not missing as much.  In all  honesty, this is really the only BAD thing.  Now, if I had chosen a different team setup in the previous fight, it probably would have been easier. Some of the other ""Bad"" things in the game would be more about personal preferences.  I personally play both open world games as well as linear.  Some people hate linear games.  I don't mind it as I find the story is usually tighter, better told and more memorable in the linear games.  You have less ""distractions"".  You have a main quest line you have to follow and it advances the story.  You can't do stuff from chapter 5 in chapter 1.  There are several side quests however and you can do those whenever you feel like each chapter.  I skipped a few or missed a few in chapter 1 as I wasn't 100% sure which was which.  There's no free-roaming, it's towns, points of interests, people of interests that you click on a map and throughout the cities.    So it's the world map, town maps, area maps, or the battle map you deal with.  Again, I don't mind it, but some people will.You have only 3 choices for your main character.  Archer, Warrior, Mage (not sure what ""specific"" names they give those classes).  However, you have a lot of freedom on how you want to train your character and the members of your party.  The game slowly teaches you how to play, so it may start a bit slow with all the tutorial messages popping up, but the tutorial DOES do a good job at teaching you what you need to know.  Occasionally the camera angles can be a bit annoying or cumbersome, but it's not much of an issue overall.It might seem like there's a lot bad here, but in reality it's just a lot of detail.  Most of which is personal preference or it limits you....only a little, but again, some people hate any limitations.  Bottom Line:The game is very fun, and makes you think.  You will breeze through some fights and then just hang your head in shame in others.  You have a set path to follow, but you can take several side streets along the way and the ride is very enjoyable.  I really really like Blackguards and I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Tactical, squad-based, turn-based strategy rpg games.  It has a few problems, but the good outweighs the bad by a landslide.  This is a shining gem from Daedalic Entertainment, well....a Darkly Shining Gem!  Check it out!			"

												Someone else put this much better than I ever could.I don't remember who said it, or the exact words, but it was something to the tune of ""This game is like a wax apple.""It looks beautiful on the outside, and there's really no reason it should be bad, but the feel of the game is artificial, slow, and not very good. Supposedly Blackguards 2 is better, but I haven't played it myself. This one kinda left a bad taste.			"

												I understand the negative reviews. The ruleset is complicated, and even more jarring perhaps to those used to D&D attributes and rules. That is why you should do as the game suggests and play on Normal difficulty and use the Basic (pre-made) character if it is your first time and unfamiliar to The Dark Eye. That's exactly what I did, and by the time I play a second time, I'll know enough of this convoluted system to choose a different class and choose my own stats.It's a really fun strategy RPG, with an emphasis placed on usable objects on the battlefield, and unique battle maps. Every fight seems to have a ""hook"" to it. You will, however, spend hours looking at the manual, in-game tutorial and rules menu, and ultimately guides to explain what the hell is REALLY going on.Talent modifiers to aid failed skill checks; Damage types as diverse and odd as Infantry, Piercing, Fire, Bashing and Magic (No, there is fire magic, it's just, well, the system is weird, OK); 3 separate attribute checks just to cast one spell; finally figuring out what the ♥♥♥♥ Armor Rating and Encumbrance really mean. This is for all the true OGs of CRPGs.			"

												This is a pretty fun game.  There are a lot of looading pages, and even though the game auto saves before and after a battle, it is best to make your own save file. If you loose a battle, and the game reloads, it will autosave again, and unless you have your own save file, you'll be stuck in an endless loop until you succeed, and sometimes those battles weren't ment to be entered yet. The voiceacting is actually pretty welldone. I was suprised. The art is decent, the story thus far is very predictable, but still enjoyable. There's lots of side quests you can complete. It seems to be a good idea to do them, just to get the experience and the points to spend on spells, and abilities. Makes the game a little easier, and allows for more battle options. I'm not a fan of the buying system. There's seems to be a limited number of arrows. After buying all of them in a shop, it seems they don't restock. I've come back to shops after many battles to see if they resupply, but it doesn't seem they do. The potion prices are rediculous. Though you shouldn't need them very often. There is a little bit of a freedom  aspect. At a certain point you can choose where you want to go, and dialog options give you different results. You can choose which side to be on in some battles. I give the game a 6/10. It's nothing special, but I do enjoy playing the game.			"

												Blackguards ""can be described as a great success for Daedalic Entertainment, an excellent achievement not only for the remarkable and outstanding gameplay shift setting, but also and above all as the first role-playing game software house and the first Hanseatic turn based title developed by the team known for graphic adventure games. Although improved technically, the title shows a deep gameplay and satisfying, nuanced and full of variables. The story is told through exciting and lines of dialogue between the epic and the easygoing, although losing some stain areas due to some ""narrative solutions"" lackluster. Great longevity, for a title that can take you to dozens and dozens of hours: the longevity of the campaign came on 40 hours, but the player pays attention to the quests will have far more to play			"

												I wanted to like this game. It seemed interesting and I liked the character design. I hate this game. I'm forcing myself to finish it because I've heard Blackguards 2 is really good, much better. I'm in the last chapter and I hate this game so much. Most of the enemies in the end of the game use poison attacks. Poison is a massive debuff that is stupid OP but that's not what's bad about it. The bad part about it is that every turn that you're poisoned there is a chance your characters are going to comment on it at the beginning of their turns. I don't know what chance this is but probably about 90% of the time. It is the most annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥I've head to deal with in a game in a long time. ""Poison!"" ""Poison!"" ""Poison!"" ""I hate poison!"" ""Poison!"" ""Poison!"" ""I hate poison!"" ""I've been poisoned"" ""Poison!"" ""Poison!"" ""Poison!"" What's even worse is the turns take an unbearable amount of time. I know this is turn based but most of these things give an option to increase the animation speed. I've found that the tactical decisions I have to make are using the criteria of how long the turns will take rather than if it's beneficial to me. Blackguards 2 better be a golden god of a game of I'm going to♥♥♥♥♥♥on the front porch of Daedalic.			"

												I really want to like this game. It just feels off. Like the whole time I'm going up hill. None of the missions really ever seem fair. My spells never work. I miss all the time. Constantly feel like I don't have enough money. The character progression skill trees are overwhelming and confusing at best.There are two missions that I tried over and over to beat, and absolutely can not beat them. I end up just taking the 'failure' option and feel bad about myself. Maybe I just suck at this game, but it feels like there is no way to really be good at it. I can't even 'grind' to level up my guys. It's just one disapointment after another.			"

												Have you ever played Dungeons and Dragons with a Dungeon Master that absolutely hates you? Do you like campaigns in which dialogue options are almost meaningless and the plot is confusing? Well if you haven't, Blackguards can fill that void for you. The plot isn't bad. It captured my attention fairly early and has some nice twists in it. The main focus of this game, however, is the combat system. I love the combat in this game. Blackguards uses a version of tabletop rules to fuel its combat. There are even simulated dice rolls for damage and hit chance. Unfortunately, (or fortunately depending) pretty much every dialogue option leads to some sort of cliche combat. Very rarely is there a non-combat solution to anything. The character creation is pretty cool also. There are two modes; basic and advanced. The creation is very open and is manipulated by AP (adventure points (I think)). Using these points (earned from combat and completion of quests), you can add talents, special abilities, spells, and basic attributes to your character, none being restricted to your character (except spells in some cases). Unfortunately, this game does have some downsides. Some of the encounters are downright frustrating and (at least for me), very difficult. A number of times I've had to walk away from the game or take a break. These particular encounters seem to me generated specifically to be hard and not at all story oriented. I won't go into much detail about them so I don't spoil the ""fun"" for you. On the plus side however, there is no penalty for losing as the game forces you to keep trying unless you load a previous save before the encounter.The graphics are actually quite nice and are better than I expected. The layout for combat is excellent, using hex-tiles and a partially destructible environment. The cities however seem more like pretty backdrops for my character sheets and are fairly dull. I would recommend this game if you are an avid tabletop gamer looking for your D&D fix, or someone who appreciates tabletop games.7.5/10			"

												Full post: http://www.cublikefoot.com/video/blackguards-first-impressions/Pros:- The gameplay is something completely new to me, never played a game like it- The fighting in the game is well-balanced- Very large character customization system, plenty of skills and such to choose from- The game is already awesome, even in its early access state.Cons:- The game certainly knows how to use my CPU (my fan speeds increased from 40% to 100%)- The segments between the various levels could be better (I should automatically enter the next area instead of having to consult the map)

												It was dark and engaging. Something I've felt that has been lacking for a while. However it is ultimately unplayable due to a plethora of bugs.

												Fantasy Adventure with a dark and mature story eh? Ummm... more like a very PG Fantasy Adventure.Leading a band of misfits, scoundrels, criminals, outcasts, etc. sounded pretty cool, but that was far far from the case when I actually started to get moving along in the game. Blackguards in title and story is very ho-hum and has you playing the hero at almost every turn doing errands for NPCs... not really what I was expecting given how the store page spins the hype around it. Sure there are a few choice options that cater to your supposed anti-heroism but they are few and far between.True to its billing I did clock in completing the game in about 40 hours. I liked the game for what it was (i've played better/worse turn based RPGs) and will most likely play it again with a different hero build but I'm not really in any rush to do so.			"

												Blackguards is a turn-based strategy game with deep RPG elements based on the popular German pen and paper RPG The Dark Eye. You assume the role of your own custom character who is accused of killing the princess in the opening cinematic. Your only choice is to run away, assemble a cast of shady characters such as the suave mage Zurbaran, the feisty dwarf Naurim and the tribal warrior Takate. The storytelling and the characters are solid, but they really don’t stand out in any significant way, for the most part it really feels like a poor man’s BioWare story.What makes Blackguards truly shine are its great combat system and wonderful game world. The combat system is hex based and may at first remind you of fantasy turn-based strategy games such as Heroes of Might and Magic or King’s Bounty. In reality, it’s more like a combination of Disciples III and Neverwinter Nights, a heavy mixture of classic turn-based strategy and role-playing philosophy. The fantastic thing about the combat system is that every single battlefield is completely unique. Not only are they all different from a visual standpoint, but they are all set up differently as well. Sometimes you’re surrounded, sometimes you have multiple goals, sometimes you have to defend something. You can also use the environment to your advantage. Cut the rope to make the heavy wooden chandelier fall on your foes or burn down the walkway spiderwebs causing deadly poisonous spiders fall to their doom.Another big thing different from usual turn-based strategy games is that you’re not building an army, you have a party of up to five characters. As you progress through the game, you acquire adventure points which you can use to upgrade your characters in a wide variety of attributes, abilities, spells, talents and weapon talents. It’s a really robust system that allows for truly deep customization and experimentation. The only negative thing is that the game assumes that you’re familiar with The Dark Eye ruleset when in reality you will need some time to really figure it out.The other problem stemming from the use of The Dark Eye ruleset is that almost any attack can be a hit or miss. Because the game is really tough and the opening battles are rather grueling, it can be really frustrating missing a 95% attack. There are ways to upgrade your characters to offset this, but again, this will take some time to figure out as the game doesn’t really explain much of anything. This can cause some really ugly bouts of frustration and anger, but it’s not a deal breaker.The vast majority of the gameplay is in the battles. Apart from that, you’ll be using a lovely 2D map to travel from location to location. Towns are represented with a single screen depicting various points of interest such as shops, healers, blacksmiths and quests. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the wonderful art style is sort of a mixture between fantasy, medieval Spain and 16th century Caribbean which is actually seldom seen in games. The accompanying soundtrack reflects that as well and fits the game very well. However, the animations aren’t that great and the voice work, while mostly solid, can be a bit cringe-worthy at times.Blackguards is a hardcore game for hardcore gamers and it is completely unapologetic about it. So be prepared for some truly grueling stuff and a steep learning curve. The great thing is, it’s absolutely worth playing thanks to the great combat system, deep RPG elements and a wonderful game world.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

												I've played this game for nine hours and it has been punctuated by frustration, confusion, and boredom.Not let me be clear right off the top, I've played a lot of tabletop RPGs but never the system used in this game, and when I played I kicked it to ""Easy"" right off the top.I'm looking for an enjoyable experience with some good story but I don't have the time to waste with hardcore difficulty.So if you're looking for a hardcore review from a guy who loves hardcore tactical RPGs you'll be dissipointed.My first problem with the game is that even after nine hours in the game I don't know the characters. I have no idea who my character is, what he's done, or if there's any reasoning behind anything I've ran across thus far.The other heroes are so painfully one note it's not even funny. The dwarf is quite possibly insane and is hunting a dragon (which may or may not be real). The mage is a scholor but mostly a well spoken man♥♥♥♥♥. The elf is a drug addict who owes people money. Oh, and has an injured sister.Most of that stuff is what I learned about them in the first five minutes of their appearing and nothing has changed.The story isn't much better. After nine hours I've discovered that we're trying escape capture and figure out what's going on.Which is pretty much where I was ten minutes in. It's just going too slow to really get invested in anything.The second problem is the combat.I will conceed that they did a nice job of varying the maps and throwing in varying maps with different enviromental hazards.Unfortunatly that's about all of the nice things I can say. After nine hours I had access to nearly no abilities to play with, a limited number of spells worth using.Fights for me basically went ""Warriors power attack, mage fire bolts""Most of the fights feel like I wont mostly because I had more HP than they did rather than any tactical considerations.And since most of the fights feel the same, the combat quickly feels very much like a grind.Which is ironic because grinding is something you can't do intentionally.Combat only happens during missions and subquests. So you can't build up money to buy stuff, and you can't grind to build up some extra XP. So if you're having difficulty there's no way to stack the odds in your favor.And if you want anything new you will need a LOT of gold. Sadly, though, you won't find much in the way of new equipment, or new weapons for quite some time.And you know how in D&D looting the bodies after a fight was the most exciting part, because maybe... just maybe you'd get an awesome magical sword, or some kind of unique armor? Well this isn't D&D, you'll get some generic weapons if you're lucky.You want something unique? Watch for sidequests. Nine hours in there are two. And those two weapons are only marginally better than the weapons you pick up after your first fight.*sigh*The final and biggest problem with combat is that it seems to linked to some kind of weird nonsense logic. You can have a 95% chance of hitting and you can (and will) miss three out of four time.I had a mage with an 85% chance of success cast one successful spell in five rounds. The good news is that failing to cast a spell doesn't cost you magic points, but it wastes your entire round.And I am aware that enemies have the ability to dodge or parry your attack, but doesn't that seem like something that should be listed in the to hit percental?If I see 95% to hit, I assume that means that out of a hundred attacks I'll miss five times. The battle Log, which shows the results of all your attacks, isn't any help in deciphering why you've missed. Which is frustrating after three rounds of both my fighters missing an enemy and that same enemy missing them.If I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, I can't fix it.And don't expect the game to explain it to you. It doesn't.Basically all of my complaints seems to come down to pacing. It's too slow. The story is too slow for me to get interested in it, the characters develope to slow (if at all) for me to bond with them, my combat options increase too slow so I'm bored with combat, my equipment changes so slowly I'm not really interested in even winning fights, and my abilities increase so slow I'm not even interested in trying to buy the very limited number of skills in the game.Hell, going into towns in this game is slow! There is a surprisingly long load time to pop into cities which are, for all extents and purposes, a static shot of a the town with three to five people standing around.Don't expect to explore the town, either, generally you get three icons to click on and then you're officially done with everything the town has to offer.But I figured, oh well. If playing it on Easy is still a painfully slow slog maybe I can just cheat to get a ton of gold, EXP and just power through the game.And, unfortunatly, the creators decided that there isn't even a cheating option. Sounds bad for me to complain about that, but after three fights which were basically attrition battles designed to wear down your team and waste your (EXPENSIVE) potions in long drawn out fights where enemies just continiously spawn...Yeah, I'm tired. I just want to speed things up so I can see if the story gets any better. But I can't. So, I'm done.I can't suggest it, which is sad because I wanted this game to be good. I wanted to play this and I wanted to enjoy it.			"

												Very oldschool-ish RPG with turn-based fights, rich dialogues and wide character advancement options.Pros:1. RNG (it makes the fights so challenging)2. Dialogues with humor and consequences3. Rather advanced character development system with lots of attributes, talents and special skills4. Plot twistsCons:1. RNG (when it stops being fun it becomes so annoying you will sometimes hate it)2. Not so many useful spells3. Crappy loot system (traders don't refresh their inventories, lots of similar useless weapons, limited ammunition supply, mage armor almost non-existent)4. Buggy achievementsStill highly recommended to any RPG fan.			"

												""Listen to me my boy. The possibility of you connecting this next attack is %95. But the possibility for that possiblity to be possible is only %2."" I bought this game with a bundle discount and i still regret it. Altough this game has great potential, the whole rng system makes everything so frustrating. And trust me, I'm saying this as a person who's blessed by rngeesus himself. When you slay through all the enemies in one go after ragequitting months ago for missing five million turns on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3rd fight into the game, I believe it's safe to say that there is something wrong with the whole system. There are times that this game feels almost unplayable. I hate downvoting Daedalic Entertainment games, but I must do it for a second time unfortunately.			"

												So, Blackguards, eh? Well it is a good idea for a game, but the realisation is missing something.What could that be?Well the first impressions were good- the characters have a lot to learn, but somehow for the new players it is unknown could they learn everything, something or just few things? There is no explanation.The game gives you to chose between 2 options that will define your game- will the main stats of the hero will be automaticaly distrubuted, or you will do everything manualy.So far for me, my adventure was with 3 heroes, however I was with 2 warriors and a mage. Somehow I did not made a ranger and I found that as a mistake when advansing in the game.I found myself more frequently repeating and reloading a map to find the best solution to win or get out from combat.Yes, the combat. Well, the combat is Turn Based so you have time to think your strategy, however heroes miss a lot, and sometimes a chance to hit or make a spell of 70%+ is not enough. Every fail punish could punish you really badly.The maps are not so big, but for that kind of game I guess they are enough, however, for me, they looked someking small.You could interact with some object in the map or use an object to take a cover from an enemy archer, however, not everytime this thing works. Some archers simply ignore that.The audio is good. The voice acting is in good level.The soundtrack is good. I liked it.I made few side quests, but one of them was really pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in at the end I even did not finished it. It was horrible. Probably much higher level heroes could do it.The grapics are nice for the eye.I did not encounter any bugs, but I can not keep playing the game. It is enough.So for final- this is avarage turn based strategy with RPG elements, however, there are better ones out there that you can play.For me- I would not try this game anymore. I really wanted to like it, but I can't give it more time. 4 hours and a little bit more are enough.			"

												I would very much not reccomend this game. After reading through comments and reviews I saw one of the biggest issues was unfair RNG in fights, I figured it must be a bit like Xcom and similar games with % hit chances where you'll miss the odd 99% chance to hit. Which I could understand, but not when it happens on the 2nd fight out of the tutorial, 4 times in a row mixed with 2 missed spell casts. Again I can handle bad RNG but not when the enemies have a 40% chance to hit and never miss. Even if that was not an issue, running into a bug that stops me from completeing the 2nd fight in the graveyard by not letting me interact with the thing the game is screaming at me to interact with to stop mobs spawning. I came into this game optimistic and figuring people were just too used to easy games that held your hand and gave it negative reviews because they didn't have to think. This game has proven that thinking wrong, its just a bad designed game with subpar voice acting, from what little I saw an unoriginal story (Accused of murder and coviently having no memory of it or anything.) No real customisation and just in general poor gameplay.If you've read this far and have not bought the game I would say do not waste time and money on this and go get Divinity Original Sin for a similar but all round greater gaming experience.

												First time I played this through, I got myself stuck in a position where it was impossible to proceed.  I'd just get wiped over and over again in the late game.  My first impression was that the game was broken.  It's not broken.  It's difficult, challenging, it assumes you know what you're doing from the very beginning of the game.  I read up on preferred magic spells and melee builds and then I went in for a second play through.  BOOM, my team kicks so much butt that even though I do a WTF! occasionally at the sometimes Xcom-like RNG, I'm still enjoying what Blackguards has to offer.  It's not like there's a lot of information on this game.  But one dude (vigomiller) on Gamefaq put together the most comprehensive guide to helping me understand how to succeed at this game and now I have to recommend both the game and the guide.			"

												First: Blackguards isn't bad or good.  It's just extremely mediocre.  If you're into D&D alternatives and dig X-Com, it probably won't waste your time.  But I can't recommend it for most people.The character customization is surprisingly lacking, despite the illusion of choice.  There are twice as many attributes as a D&D system, but they all just sum together to increase your attack, dodge chance, initiative, etc.  There are only a handful of combat abilities to use, so there's not a lot of choice as far stabbing/shooting.  The magic users are more nuanced; there are a ton of spells, each with 4 tiers, so you're constantly weighing the cost/benefit of those.Combat itself is very similar to X-Com or D&D 4.0: you get either a move and an action, or a double move.  This all occurs on a hex-grid, and most maps have some sort of interactable element to spice it up.  They do an admirable attempt to differentiate the levels, but you will take place in about a billion combat scenarios, so a lot of them inevitably feel repetitive.  You'll probably be skipping side quests by the end out of boredom.The plot is pretty linear.  There are batches of side quests that open up at various points, but none of them augment the main plot line at all.  It's your typical RPG ""save my daughter"" or ""escort my caravan"" kind of stuff.  You become enslaved and forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena at one point, so that's pretty neat.			"

												Let's start with character creation; You seem to have a lot of choices, but most of these are just number-crunching to get the few choices that matter. Although even those are just a numbers game, just bigger numbers. You can also choose your starting equipment, this is pretty neat, if it weren't for the fact that you lose all of your equipment after your first combat.Speaking of combat, every action you do has a high chance of failing, from casting a spell to setting a trap to swinging a club. The chance to hit or be succesful is made harder by your enemies' defenses. Wait, that's not all, the damage range of your weapons goes from 1-6, 5-10, or 4-12 for example, this damage is further reduced by your enemies' damage reduction %, and flat damage reduction. This means that on top of the abnormally high miss chance(plus dodge and parry chances!), actually dealing damage is stupendously hard. Now imagine most enemies have around the same health as you, 30ish. So what do you do? You wail on the enemies until they fall down, hoping you even hit them. This makes combat feel sluggish, your actions meaningless, and generally make you waste time.The story? You get to choose which lines are said first.. sometimes. It also appears you get some dialogue options at times. None of these worked, and didn't work the few times I did try them. Perhaps they work later in the game when you have a higher Charisma? Thing is, I maxed my charisma, it wouldn't go higher, so why have those options there at the start anyway? To waste my time? Make me feel like I have a choice? No, this is another kick to the nuts this game gives.			"

Posted: December 5, 2014
												I thoroughly enjoy Daedalic Entertainment's point-and-click adventure games so when I heard that they would be making a turn-based RPG I was super pumped.  I love the Dark Eye world and the gritty fantasy found therein and I feel that this game does not disappoint.  PROS1) THE CHARACTERS! I adored the main characters and genuinely felt that each line of dialogue between them was solid gold.  Every one of them had a great personality and contributed to the overall value of this game a great deal.2) The Dialogue and Story: You can take it or leave it but I what I came across I enjoyed.  While it is true that the story is linear and doing side-missions does nothing but help you grind this was never an issue for me.  I liked the story and the direction it was taken.  You're a bad guy doing bad things for the right reasons and it is not often to come across something that does this trope well.  The game does a great job of putting you into the ""antihero"" mentality.  3) Combat: This game does not hold your hand.  You WILL redo fights, you WILL get frustrated, and unless you know how to build your stats and abilities you WILL fall behind but as long as you play your hand correctly you will always be able to win the next fight.  Similar to older iterations of D&D (which Die Schwarze Auge/The Dark Eye is the German equivalent of more or less) there are weapon AND damage types to consider.  Knowing what kind of weapons and what kind of damage types to use are crucial against certain enemies.  For example, DON'T USE PIERCING AGAINST THE UNDEAD!  They are completely immune to anything that doesn't impart massive physical trauma to their skeleton like slashing or bashing weapons would.  Some enemies are immune to poison, some to magic, and some to physical damage.  It will be trial and error to figure this out but this is also why you can equip each character with three different weapon load-outs which you can cycle through in combat so as to avoid being harmless to a specific enemy.  Other things to note about combat include the diversity of places you will fight in (it makes you feel like you're actually traveling from place to place), the importance of positioning, the use of environmental effects to your advantage, and bottlenecking.  Combat is the meat and potatoes to this game and after 50+ hours of this game I, for one, can say that it does not get old.4) Stat Systems and Leveling: DO NOT RAISE BASE STATS! At least not at first.  This game offers a wide variety of upgrade paths with which you can take your party in a multitude of directions.  Wanna be a crazy hefty tank? Upgrade Warcraft, Body Control, Willpower, Strength, Vitality, and the proficiency of two weapons of your choice.  Wanna be everywhere and piercing armor? Upgrade Agility, Body Control, Spear proficiency, Dexterity, and Vitality for that damage you are most certainly going to take.  Wanna mage it up?  Take Bow proficiency, level your spells like crazy (a hefty investment), and make sure you have a tank or two between you and the enemy.  While some might bemoan the lack of class options with there only being three, Warrior, Ranger, and Mage, it isn't that large of an issue.  This is not a game about diplomacy or sneaking around (ignoring two or three AWFUL missions that can be solved with fighting), it's about slugging it out with the enemy.  To play something that doesn't contribute to the fight directly is to take a difficult game and make it impossible.5) Grittiness: I consider this a plus because I like games that force you to be aware of the number of arrows in your quiver, how absolutely vital healing can be, and how huge a difference is made when you finally buy that new axe that does ONE MORE DAMAGE.  This is a game where all the small things add up over time to take your party from bandit npcs to gods on the battlefield.  Throughout the game you can also learn special attacks which give you advantages in certain situations such as inflicting wounds (Wounds and HP Damage are totally separate things), knocking down enemies, or doing more damage from a distance with ranged weaponry.  The larger and more valuable the effect the more costly the attack will be in terms of accuracy so a very effective trade-off between damage/utility and accuracy is established.6) The World: Not much to say aside from how much I enjoyed it and all the people you come across.  It is VERY uncommon for you to run across nice individuals so when you do you instantly grow attached to them.  Even then most of the ""nice"" people you come across are still awful by today's standards due to their desires to brainwash, enslave, or kill off rivals for a plethora of reasons.  Aventuria (the world) isn't a great place and it's heroes reflect that, but maybe, with a great deal of effort, you can change that.CONS1) The Probability System: IT LIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! Never in a game have I missed five consecutive instances of hitting with a 95% chance of my attack succeeding each time.  It is without a doubt the single most irritating and detracting point to this whole game.  Until you play Blackguards you will not understand how infuriating it can be.  It doesn't just apply to physical attacks, though.  Your spells will fizzle out and do nothing, your arrows can randomly vanish, you will fail body tests where you have a 99% chance of passing and fall down.  This was a HUGE oversight on the part of the developers and if they would just release a patch that made these percentages more accurate I would have nothing against this RPG.2) POISONS and Enemy Buffs! In the latter half of the campaign in an attempt to balance the gameplay the developers just decided to either give the enemies a flat magic stat buff or give all of their attacks the poison quality which will do continuous damage or give you a stat debuff for the rest of the fight.  Not nearly as irritating as the percentage issue but it does somewhat cheapen the joy you get when your party goes into an encounter that you should faceroll only to discover that the enemy basically leveled up with you.3) Stat Building: While I did mention this as a plus earlier you can very easily destroy your game by building poorly.  Seeing as how there is no way to undo this it can prove to be game ruining.  Overall, I would give this experience a solid 8/10.  Fun from beginning to end and if you see it on sale for less than 10 you should instantly snatch it up.			"

												I can't have more than an hour into this game, and it's already crashed twice on loading screens. I force-quit it on the third non-tutorial level.I'm a big fan of daedalic, and I champion myself as being well versed in every turn based RPG of this nature. But this feels like it was never play-tested. It genuinely feels like no one sat down and played it, as a game, and said ""okay, these elements work mechanically, but from a game-perspective, they dont."" Every single time you miss a hit, and your enemy never misses at all, and you sit there for a dozen turns soaking up damage for what feels like--no strategic reason, you realise, ""Oh great, this is one of those games where I need to return to town every ♥♥♥♥ing time I finish a level, to heal up""Why? Why not just heal back to full between missions? What purpose does returning to the inn after every mission serve as an improvement to the pacing of the game? If you take a bow for your caster (I mean, that makes sense right, you've read the reviews, you know you're gonna run out of mana and you're a ranged character) and you switch to it, and ""Oh, I'm pointblank range with this monster. Hit chance 25% 4dmg"" monster has 20 hp. Wtf. So statistically it should take me 20 ♥♥♥♥ing turns to kill this? I'm not talking about this being late game and you made a series of bad choices. This is the first mission that doesn't hand-hold you through a required tutorial.Turns out, yes. It's going to take you twenty ♥♥♥♥ing turns to do anything, while trying to negotiate the ridiculous gimmick (plug those lice holes! Pull those levers!) no. I was done. The game is not balanced in any satisfying way. It's not ""challenging"". At best, it just challenges your patience to see how many times you can watch your ridiculously weak spell miss for the 20th time, before you realise there's absolutely no pay-off. I understand miss and dodge mechanics. But when your game is structured around you missing more than 50% of the time... there's no fun in that. No one is sitting at home playing this game thinking ""Oh oh oh, I missed! What fun! That's 3 in the row!""			"

												At a glance, Blackguards is a fun foray into the turn-based tactical genre. The system is both simple and overly complex at the same time, but it balances out nicely. The graphics and the storyline certainly aren't anything to write home about, but for a turn-based game they are more than acceptable - after all, the real focus of any turn-based strategy game is going to be the combat, not the sparkling wit or crisp graphics.Unfortunately, the combat is where things really fall apart.That's not to say that the combat system itself is at fault. It's passable, and roughly analogous to Dungeons & Dragons. The real problem is that many of the set-piece battles are designed to be inherently unfair. Even on the easiest difficulty, you'll often struggle with scenarios that are designed to be one step short of impossible. You'll often find your character(s) stripped of their equipment and forced to use random items that you don't have the skill to use. You'll often find yourself thrown into insane battlefields filled with literally dozens of hidden traps, endless hordes of respawning opponents, or obtuse victory conditions that require you to interact with five or more scattered pieces of scenery. Somewhere along the line, the designers seem to have gotten just a bit too clever about their level designs, inadvertantly making many encounters more frustrating than fun.Fortunately, the developers made several adjustments as the game went through early release - so if you can power through the first two chapters (Chapter Two is particularly frustrating), then you'll find that the game opens up a good deal. At that point it becomes a much more enjoyable experience, although still occasionally plagued with annoyingly obtuse map design (one optional ""arena"" map can easily take an hour or more to finish due to it's maze-like design and infinitely spawning enemies).If you're a hardcore strategy gamer, then Blackguards is certainly worth buying. For anyone even slightly more casual, though, you should probably give Blackguards a pass.			"

												I don't even know how to explain the lackluster gameplay. Simple put, if you enjoy games where you have to lose battles a dozen times to memorize trap locations, constantly fight unbalanced matches and only like to stick with non-intuitive,  cookie cutter builds, then this game is definitely for you. If you want to experiment with unique builds, play melee or just want some fun battles and original gameplay, look elsewhere, this really isnt for you.Not even a couple of hours into the game and I realised that the battle mechanics are absolutely one of the worst i've seen, in over a decade of playing turn based strategy games. It's another perfect example of developers compensating for horrible AI, by overpowering the player.A few other problems: This isnt tactical, it's nearly impossible to be tactical in this game because the maps are way too simple, if you're looking for XCOM style tactics, this is nowhere close. Most of the obstacles can be shot through and they provide no additional defense(unless of course the enemy is behind them, in which case they will shoot from behind their obstacle and also through yours and still knock you down with an arrow, from the other end of the map), even with 90% hit chance you will constantly miss.I've never once wanted to give up on a game so fast but I already see no incentive to continue with this game, it's just so boring and unrewarding for the difficulty. I regret buying it, even at the sale price of $15.Please, for your sake, ignore the steam reviews and do some proper online research before buying this game.			"

												For all the hype this game received it truly is infuriantingly awful!The story is trope-ridden and uncompelling, a flaw which is compounded by the lack of any sense of progression due to enemies quickly becoming ridiculously overpowered (don't even get me started on the Iribar lily).Combining an AP system with the need to locate a highly specific trainer to attain certain special abilities really damages the game, if you save up your AP hoping to find a trainer for a particular you find the enemies outclassing you due to the lack of uninvested points. When even a single missed hit can cost you the battle (which are frequently overly long) it seems counter-productive to have such low hit chances even when the relevant weapon skill is maxed out and complimentary stats are high.I'm sure if you are a veteran of The Dark Eye, the choice of character build could be optimised such that the battles are easier; on the other hand the highly repetitive battle sequences, lack of character placement pre-battle, dreadful story, and lacklustre town interface probably wouldn't make the game enjoyable.I was genuinely looking forward to this game heralding a new wave of turn-based/tactical rpgs (of which i am a great fan), but now I am left sincerely hoping the publisher never curses the world with a sequel.

												The visuals of this game are in real stark contrast with the game mechanics. Everything looks very nice, but when it comes to the combat, skill system, rest periods and so forth, the game begins to feel like it was drafted twenty years ago.It's just so inbalanced. The classes are not in balance. The attributes, skills, talents, weapon talents and special talents (I probably forgot something) are not in balance. The cost of items and services - compare for instance provisions, healing, bandages, potions and taverns - are not in balance.The game is haphazard inside and outside of combat. You may begin a series of events only to notice that there is no way to return anymore. There are unforeseeable series of battles, and failing one may set you back an HOUR of progress. Failing even one spell might flip the situation completely. Putting all points in a single weapon talent can screw you up, because, well... find it out yourself.But all this got me thinking. Are we too pampered with forgiving games? Perhaps. Here's a game that you can seriously break by playing it wrong (or right, in a good way!). Here's a game that requires putting those annoyingly flexible talent points into right places. So begrudgingly thumbs up for this one.			"

												The first time I came to write a review for this game it was going to be a vitriolic missive of woe and anger. In true fashion, and not for the first time, the game had put me on my♥♥♥♥♥ It was during the games infamous second chapter, where fights come thick and fast, and leave you feeling brutalised and frustrated. I perservered however and came out of the other side happier for it.This game is far from perfect, but for fans of tactical RPGs it is a truly a diamond in the rough. Battles are varied and interesting and party composition and tactical choices really make a difference. The combat system is deeper than it first appears and that hidden depth is one of the games finer qualities. It is also it's biggest drawback. The game is closely based on a pen and paper RPG and unfortunately in many ways just as indecipherable to the beginner. The character progression system is almost arcane in its complexity, to the point that it is almost certain that you will make mistakes in the way you build up your party. These mistakes will be deadly on even normal difficulty. It's reliance on a pen and paper system mean that unless you have a copy of the rulebook and many hours to ponder it and try out permutations, your characters will be woefully shy of optimal. This may lead to you having to restart the game several times as you begin to unravel its mysteries.That being said , the game is sufficiently fun, interesting and challenging that you won't mind having to restart. I didn't.			"

												In brief: fairly linear hex-map RPG with good character system and decent storyline. You'll enjoy it if you like that sort of thing.Blackguards is an old-school gaming experience dressed in modern threads, a pen-and-paper RPG brought to life on the PC. The graphics are appealing, animations smooth, sound effects satisfying and voice acting mostly good. You take the role of an assistant to a noble family who gets into trouble at the outset and goes on the run, and your attempts to unravel what's happened ultimately take on a global significance. The story, chiefly told in cutscenes whose animation is best described as economical, follows a fairly linear path, but a wealth of subplots and sidetracks provides a pleasant illusion of free movement which probably won't convince today's open-world gamers.Your character is provided with several sidekicks and you marshall and move your party on the world map. Movement is essentially the selection of locations and passage of time is not tracked. In towns and similar locations you'll find traders, trainers, inns, healers, and the like, as well as NPCs who advance the plot and give you quests. Party management is done through the stat sheet and inventory of each character, and true to the RPG that gave birth to this game, the system is satisfyingly deep and complex. Your decisions about character development will win or lose you the game, and new players should take note: it is possible to build a character badly and it's very difficult to undo this once you've done it, so take the time to read the manual and the in-game character creation notes (which don't appear in the manual and are very useful).Quests and plot advancement almost always involve a skirmish, and it's these hex-map clashes where you'll spend most of your game hours. It's clear that a lot of thought has gone into skirmish map design: in some cases it's a straight fight to the death, but often there are environmental factors to deal with and in some cases the map is a puzzle which you must solve to win. In fact you can think of every skirmish as a puzzle which must be solved, as enemies differ in their capacities and susceptibilities and you must apply the right tools in terms of weapons, spells and equipment to prevail. That said, the game depends ultimately on the roll of the dice, so luck is always a factor. Fortunately death isn't permanent and so long as you have the last man standing, you'll walk away with your party intact.Some reviewers have complained of the game's excessive difficulty. At the time of writing this review I've completed the game on Normal difficulty and have clocked up over 80 hours of play. I think I saw every skirmish there was to see, well over a hundred in total, and more than half of those I completed first time. There were only a handful I had to attempt more than twice. The final battle is difficult, but so it should be – my only gripe is that the plotting, or perhaps the scriptwriting, feels a bit wrong at the end, but YMMV. If you find yourself stymied by a skirmish, see whether you can go elsewhere to level your party up a bit; if not, it's very likely that you're either missing something important in the skirmish (always check the interactive objects) or you've taken a serious misstep in character building. Be careful not to spread XPs too thin on your characters: you can't take all spells and weapons to the maximum in the course of the game, and you do need some top-level skills and spells by the end if not by the middle.Two things bothered me about this game: loading times, and the ending. My system isn't top-of-the-line but neither is this game, and I saw far too much of the loading screens for my liking (Mengbilla in particular tried my patience quite a bit). The ending... without spoiling things, I was surprised to see essentially the same cutscene after winning the final battle that I'd seen when I lost it. I'm unsure if your choice in dialogues makes any real difference to the way the game pans out, and online chatter suggests that a lot of players were left confused by the denouement. I can't honestly recommend that anyone other than a genre purist buy this game at full price, but if you see it on sale grab it and give it a try, and be sure to get to the top of the bow skill tree as early as possible!

												Great game. I'm an older player. If you like old school D&D themed type of games and turn based combat with quite a few skills spells and stats..... this game is for you. If you want a pew pew own other players in an MMO this game is not for you. The game seems slow to many people because well... it  IS!!! It's supposed to be a kick back and enjoy the world story with fun turn based battles. It may not be the best game ever or anything, I'm not saying that, but it is damn good imo. The dialouge can be pretty damn funny at times and it's a pretty game. The loading screens can be a bit annoying when you are trying to find a particular trainer or whatever so I suggest using a pen and paper if you find yourself forgetting where destinations are. One thing that annoys me a bit is I still have not found anywhere that tells me my AR flat out....and some of the hover overs on new equiptment can be annoying as they are not intuiative... takes a bit to figure out and doesn't need to be that way imo. I'd still give the game a 4.5 out of 5 stars...and it's a lot longer than I expected it to be which pleased me so far. (not finished with the game yet only at the end of chapter 3). I usually don't replay games but I think I will for sure on this one just to mess with stats.			"

												This game is the equivalent of Iron Man 3 - plenty of potential, a winning formula but just didnt pull it off where it mattered.Let me explain..... It has a good story that makes you want to invest time to find out what happens to the characters. It has turn based mechanics with lots of flexibility - shall i use the environment to my advantage, shall i switch weapons or shall i just spam the most powerful attack i have (yes. do the latter). Just the WORST thing about the game is when you successfully miss 4 attacks in a row each with a hit chance of 80%. This sort of treachery happens often and really spoils the battle.The battle map is great and you can easily find your way around the battlefield although in my opinion the user interface is lacking a bit - all the useful buttons are grouped together and are a little bit too small for my liking. You can semi-personalise each character and evolve their skills and attributes to your liking - although unless you want to turn a mage into a bad-boy-brawler (and why the hell would you do that) there isnt that much choice.All in all it is a better than average game although is only worth buying when on steam sale.

												Not a particular amazing game, but enjoyable enough and some cleverly designed scenes here and there prevent you from tackling each and every battle with exactly the same old strategy.  Comparing the number of pros and cons, it's a really impressive game; but one of the cons just happens to be super important to me, bringing the game down to just decent instead.CONSThe game can basically be broken down into four parts: cutscenes; inventory/ability screens; towns/shops; and battle scenarios.  Each of these is actually very well done.  But it leaves the game feeling a bit hollow simply because you don't get much of a feeling of exploring.  You move around the map by clicking on dots.  You move around submaps by clicking on dots.  Even the towns/shops just feel like clicking on dots.  They shouldn't, because they're much more visual, but the game just builds that feeling of dot-clicking into it, and you can't shake it.  The inventories get messy.  Weapons and armour can be seen separately, but everything else is all piled up in one section with no sorting options.  So when you're looking for healing or mana potions, be prepared to go through page after page of poisons, traps, buffing potions, throwing weapons, and EVEN all the 'quest items' - new and old, jumbled up with them.PROSThe cutscenes are well done, the plot's interesting enough, and you really feel like you get to know the characters.There's a good number of abilities, categorised in some interesting ways.  Most importantly, the spells have enough variety that you can really explore a range of different strategies.  Even within typical categories like direct damage or buffing, there's still variety.  (Potential SPOILER examples:  Direct damage has single target, area of effect, enemy hunting single target, cloud spawning enemy hunting single target, and whole map blasts; and some of those stun, or knock down, or curse/debuff.  And that's just within direct damage.  My favourite quickly turned out to be a shadow duplicate spell - which for me meant creating a second archer-mage for 3-5 turns, whose arrows are shadow too, so it was like getting double the mileage out of each arrow).   The variety might take a little while to sink in, because at first it looks like 24 spells with 4 levels of power each.  But within the 4 levels for each, most have at least one significant change, so it's actually more like 48 spells.The options for non-spellcasters are more limited, but still allow for some good variety - especially since you can have up to three weapon sets; and/or make use of traps and throwing weapons.  It's hard to do early on, but each route you take eats up experience points, but this ultimately allows you to do things like: (a) Carry a giant two-handed bashing weapon for massive damage and quick battles, but be ready to switch into sword and shield if you need more defense and accuracy.  (b) Run around with a two-handed pike-style spear, but pitch javelins and poison bombs at your enemies before they get into melee range.  (c) Mix up archery and fencing.  (d) Go all archery, but set traps - especially stunning or slowing traps - around you when melee fighters look like they're going to get too close.  (e) etc, etc.The weapons and armour are pretty bog-standard for an RPG overall, but are just varied enough.  The expense might seem frustrating at first, but I enjoyed the way it made me mix and match parts more often, and set different characters up with different equipment sets.  And when there are all kinds of traps and poisons and buff potions, etc, as well, it feels like you've always got something new to pick up.The combat!  At first it looks like each map is going to be a matter of big vs small, wide vs narrow, and empty or covered with traps or blocking environment.  That'd lead to a bit of variety, but eventually you'd work out a couple of strategies that you'd just use over and over again.  But soon enough, you start seeing unique twists (some are repeated a couple of times; some are just used once).  There are plenty of them, and they are what really make the game worth it in the end.  (Potential SPOILER examples:  A super long get to the end before the poisonous mist catches up to you map.  Skeletons keep coming back to life unless you smash the crystal maps.  Sneak through the dark and you won't have to fight at all maps. Maps with cages to open to let out support.  Maps with cages to close to trap beasts.  Maps with buildings you can knock down to crush some enemies.  Maps with spider webs hidden like traps and as bridges you can knock out from under the spiders.  And more and more.  "

												My main problem is the RNG. Restarting matches (and they are matches of your units VS -random units here-) because of critical RNG failure leading to either important people not dying or important people on my side getting suddenly fireballed. Having all your stuff ranked from you ever-so-often makes me far less invested in ""getting that cool thing"" or even bothering to upgrade past basic equip or drops. I liked combat when it wasn't trying to screw me over. Mages are irritating and not fun to have on party unless they only do one magic spell for the most part.			"

												I really enjoyed it.. The difficulty can be ridiculous on certain enemies, and is extremely punishing if you screw up your builds.. Its very rng based, and people who hated the hit% crap from Xcom EU/EW will hate this as much.. I didnt have many technical issues, and I really enjoyed the game, and am looking forward to playing through part 2 when i get around to it.. I did have to turn the diff down to easy, as I was just unable to get through some fights (one in particular, which repeates later on, and is where i finally gave up) Irribar Illy or something.. Has tentacles, and wisps which can only be dmg via magic..  Not only can melee attacks fail, but so do spell casts.. I dont mind misses when its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chance to cast/hit, but when 90%+ chances miss consistently and consecutively, it just promotes save scumming to advance, and thats what i felt i had to do to progress..  Even on easy, as i said.. Later on, you feel much more powerful, but some other cheap feeling tactics are then thrown at you, often far out numbering the player.. Like I said, I enjoyed the game, but Ill be damned if i could figure out the difficulty, and Im no stranger to tactical games..			"

												Decent turn based tactical game. Tends to get somewhat repetitive over time, and suffers somewhat from the inherent weaknesses inherited from the Dark Eye game system and background. It also lacks somewhat a real feeling of character advancement - after playing a decent amount of matches you feel barely much ""better"" than in the bginning: the character have little more HP, the weapons do little more damage, etc. Full price I'd say it's not worth it, but on a sale it's a nice game to sink some hours into - if you like turn based fantasy tacticals, that is.I still prefer the ""old"" stuff like Icewind Dale or Baldurs Gate for turn based combat, though, or the non-fantasy new ones like Shadowrun - which has both better system, and better plot. One thing I didn't really like was the chained battles - in the later part of the game you can have two or three battles chained after one another, without any opportunity to rest & recover, or even to reload bolts & arrows or potions & poisons. 6/10			"

												Great turn based tactical combat RPG.  The non-combat parts of the game are really just ""interface"" and story board.  Kind of like a Dark Eye based XCOM.  Combat is great.Character development can be frustrating at first if you're not familiar with Dark Eye rules, but once you figure out the basics (focus entirely on a skill or two to start until you're competent at them before branching out), it's a smooth progression.Not at all loot based.  Combat is pure character build and tactics based.  Pay attention to the environments, they are key.  Some battles will seem impossible if you didn't pay attention to the commentary leading up to it and use your ""V"" key to highlight the interactive objects.			"

												I would call this an excelent turn-based fatasy combat game with weak RPG elements.  I stopped playing before I finished the game.  The combats were cool, but plot was far too linear for my taste.  It did not seem that anything you could do would affect on the overall plot and the game sometimes does bad things to your characters regardless of the choices you make.  I don't think the creators have a very deep understanding of the RPG player mindset.  The term ""railroaded"" feels appropriate.  Overall I would rate it a 6 on a 1-10 scale.  Worth my money, but not one that I would played through.			"

												Fun game so far, I'm enjoying it... Scratch that....Combat which you will be doing alot of is bland and repetative. Be prepared to be posioned in alot of battles, also prepare for your spells to fail regardless if you are maxed out in them, For example I had 1 spell called  Cold Shock (Level 18) Maxed in the description I have a 99% chance to cast, in one battle this % drops to 8% with no explaination. This game is not not very forth coming in telling you the negatives that effect you well unless is poison :). Magic, What the game does not tell you is with spells that effect all enemies your chances of casting these spells drops to stupid odds... For example in the last few fights in Chapter 5 I was trying to cast a few spells the chance was 1%, please understand I had all my skills maxed regarding spell casting, even reliable spells like the Fireball one was reduced to 48% from 99%. As a whole being a magic user you are punished. Does the enemy get punished in the same way? No they are able to case level 4 spells at 99%.Storyline, seems non exsistant at the moment and I am on chapter 5 the last chapter, you arent made to care for your choices or characters sorry I like to feel my choices in RPGs actually make a difference.Skill Trees, again like combat it is bland, if you go melee you want to go for Hammer Blow which forces you to take Two Handed Bashing or Axes and Maces. I did start the game of as dual wielding swords how wrong I was :(. There is very little choices in skills say unlike games like Path of Exile.The equipment you get is standard and boring. You would expect from a Fantasy RPG to get some magic items well dont hold your breath, there are a few items that will give you the odd boost but they are few and far between.Overall as a fan of Turn-Based games and RPGs Blackguards comes up short in so many ways.I am glad I paid less than what its on sale for.

I ran into the first ""Strategy levels"".  Really, try and save the Baroness with the Mage character I selected.  Not gonna happen without 30 attempts or better.Then...  Try and beat the level where the ranged guy keeps hitting the same character over and over with a knockdown ability - oh sure, you can put up a magic barrier - but then it fades or the spell fizzles - oh, fun times - try again...I paid HOW much for this?

I have reset the fight a few dozen times and its always the same thing.Its moderately fun when you can play without having to crash the game but the attribute system gives inconsitent results as well.If you configure two characters exactly the same way with the same exact stats, very often one toon will hit 3x harder than the other.  There is no infomation in the log to figure out why and I even pumped up warcraft to see extra stats and they are exactly the same.To sum up, it COULD have been a very good game but the flaws make it too frustrating to play.

So why am I giving it a thumbs down?? its difficulty is just...brutal, before anyone accuses me of being a pancy COD button masher let me say in my defense that A) I have never played COD and B) I am actually an old school rpg'er that has bagged several classic rpg's on my resume, Wizardry games? check, Baldurs gate? check, Icewind Dale? check, might and magic? check, and also most modern RPG's as well such as the Witcher and the Dragon Age series. So I *know* when I talk about difficulty I mean it, this game is absolutely frustrating sometimes; on easy the enemies are more forgiving ( and I am not one to use that setting unless absolutely necesary) BUT the hazards and Obstacles are NOT.I will still purchase whatever DLC the devs decide to release, and I will definitely purchase a second part of this game, just because I am a very passionate RPG'er, and this is truly a gem of game. However, a lotta folks will be put off by the brutal difficulty the game throws at you constantly and the (somewhat) steep learning curve.			"

												Good intro game to the Dark Eye universe. Positives:- fun tactical combat - interesting characters and OK story. - character customization according to the dark eye rules- fast traveling from combat to combat, always in action no pointless roaming- the best part of the game is probably early mid game when you are forced to fight in the arena. It's a nice change of pace. On the negative side:- RNG is sometimes really strong, like missing 95% hit chance 3 times in a row- difficulty spikes, although end game boss was too easy- low variety in armors for mages- poisons everywhere			"

												Looking back at this review a few years later and I see that its still valid:Not an easy game but very fun. Bought the game around Xmas and spent most of the time efter Xmas playing it.(this to give you an idea how ""complete"" my version was of the game)I exited the game more than a few times with the thought ""yea right..."" based on the difficulty of a fight.Yet somehow I returned a while later with a few ideas on how to possibly beat an encounter. Completed the latest chapter (nr 4) yesturday. Has to say its been a long time since I've played a game this addictive.As far as the ""beta"" status:No crashes or any kind of freezing problems for meThere was only one dialogue screen in a trivial discussion that was in german while the rest was in english.The audio was still in english. So I have really nothing to complain about.If your a fan of turned based RPG games and used to playing them on other than easy/normal I'd recommend this.But if you always choose the ""easy"" setting when you play: This game is all but ""easy"".

												EXPLORATION & ADVENTUREThe game has no exploration or sense of adventure. None. Zero. Your experience with exploring the world of Blackguards consists of clicking on an icon on the world map representing a settlement and loading up a marketplace view, said view having a few icons to click on that load up the various types of stores or that occasionally (a different icon) offer quests. And that's it.The various settlements are highly detailed, but all of that detail exists on static backgrounds. The backdrop pictures could have offered a great sense of place simply by utilizing a nice exterior shot. Indeed, this being a fantasy world, and one where many of the settlements offer a rather distinct size and local elements, exterior views could have added a great deal of wonder and adventure to the player's sense of the world. As it is, though, settlements are just a series of the same four stores with minor hints at the diversity that the world has to offer with a few extra flourishes added to some of the marketplaces.For the most part, one's interaction with the world is on the level of an mmo. There are stores to click on and buy stuff, and there is the occasional quest giver that is met once or twice, says his generic spiel to send you off on your generic quest, and one never sees them again after. Leaving the game with no sense of character.STORYThe overall concept of Blackguards is generic chosen one gets chosen for unknown reasons to save the world. It's a bland and generic concept, but there's nothing inherently bad about it. One can take a generic concept and sprinkle originality upon it to make an exciting concept. Operative word being can. With Blackguards, the one conceit to originality is that the characters are ""blackguards"".Except they're not. The main character is, in actuality, falsely accused of a crime he/she didn't commit. And he/she now roams the badlands, an outlaw hunting outlaws...a RENEGADE.Some of your cohorts have committed crimes. But other than a few - very rare - jokes, this never really comes into play. The only character who is actually a criminal during the game is quickly killed off. The rest of the characters are more in the ""gang of rogues and misfits"" territory. And the things that that band of rogues and misfits are called upon to do during the game are the usual generic RPG quests. Find the lost ""ring"", rescue the damsel in distress, kill these bandits, etc.With only that unused conceit to count towards originality, there is nothing original in the Blackguards storyline. It is, unfortunately, the usual generic, bland template upon which to hand an RPG. But it actually gets worse than that, because the various enemies and situations are also generic, and the core development is a jumbled mess, leading to no driving reason to progress through the story. (Stressing here that there is no driving reason to progress through the story, not the game.)There's a core of a good story lying within Blackguards. Evil villains, saving the world, high adventure. But none of it ever gets used. Instead, the overall story sits in the background while the characters get captured - again - and drug around doing random combats against generic foes that have no personal stake in the overall story. The number of times that the party actually fights people who are involved in the threat to the world before reaching the final chapter is incredibly low. Instead, in a world threatened with destruction, it's mostly bandits, gladiators, various animals, and independent undead that the party meets.The characters of the main party have some personality, even if it is a bit two-dimensional. Their personalities are well-written. But there is little there to most of them, and those personalities do not drive the story. The only driving force in the story is the Chosen One main character. The other members of the party simply offer some localized color here and there. And unfortunately, the best personality is killed off early and replaced by someone as bland as the Chosen One main character. The remaining personalities are well-written, but bland. Which brings up one of the major points that are often brought up about games like Blackguards - ""It's not about the story; it's about the combat"". And while it is true that the centerpiece of Blackguards is combat, one also spends a lot of time watching cutscenes following along the story. If the story isn't actually a major part of the game, then it shouldn't occupy a major part of the time of the game. If it does occupy a large portion of gametime, then it is a major part of the game. End of story. RESOURCE MANAGEMENTAt first, the resource management of Blackguards seems like it will be an exciting and detailed system. But like so much else in the game, none of what is met in that first impression is ever fully realized. There is a lot of meat here. The consumables system is highly detailed, with a lot to offer a game that put pressure on those resources. But there is never any pressure. None of the resources matter.  The most glaring of these is rations. The sole use of rations is to allow the group to camp out on the world map. Yet, since there are no wandering monsters and no risk or real time involved in traveling, there is no reason not to simply click on a settlement and rest at its inn rather than lug around heavy rations units (other than the obscurely long loading times for the settlements). The only resource that is regularly bought are arrows, for those rare times when there aren't bundles of them found on the enemy, or when - much more often - all of your equipment has been taken from you. As with so much else in Blackguards, resource management is a highly detailed system that a lot could be done with, but that never comes to fruition. Soon after it's introduction, it becomes left by the wayside.COMBATFor all of the famed glory of the Blackguards combat system, there actually isn't much to it. The party is made up of five members, and they usually fight from 6-7 enemies, occasionally more, sometimes less. The battles take place on a hex-grid, and they take place in turns based on individual character speed and an initiative roll. Unfortunately, the enemies are underdeveloped. There is not a great deal of enemy variety. There are a large number of enemy portraits to fight. But there are not a wide variety of methods of attack. Most enemies are melee grunts who attack using the same pattern and single attack, whether they are mindless zombies or (supposedly) intelligent bandits. A few combats have enemies with ranged ability, which they use in a largely random fashion, instead of a focused aggressive one. And a rare few  have spellcasters, which use their spells in a largely ineffective fashion. Combats against opponents with special abilities beyond that are really rare.On the other hand, it is good for the party that enemies remain stupid and unfocused, as the party are always outnumbered and usually fighting on empty square battlemaps, and thus a focused effort would likely easily overwhelm the party. Likewise, the enemy do not have all of the special abilities that the party do. Again, this is a must for the survivability of the party. The power feats that are available are just so intensely powerful, and there is so little defense against them, that having any of those abilities is essentially an I-WIN button.Which leads to the main issue with the combat - it's is badly balanced. Open character development systems are really hard to balance, and this one is not even remotely in the balanced ballpark. There are some aspects of the character that are hugely beneficial (Super Improved Power Attack), some that are only of minor benefit (Read Enemy hp), and some that are of no benefit at all (fireball). Thus, the difficulty of the lies entirely in the character sheet. Leading to different players having wildly different experiences in game difficulty.			"

												There needs to be a review on this page telling steam users that at least 11 out of the 45 achievements are bugged and most players cannot achieve them. There are plenty of community posts surrounding the faulty achievements.The game itself took a while for me to get into, it wasn't until part way through the second chapter that I found myself actually wanting to continue playing the game.I experienced 2 bugs during my gameplay, once the game crashed when trying to add a new save to my list of game saves and once when casting a spell in battle, nothing happened after the casting animation so I had to crash out and re-load the battle.As for game play and story line, you can tell this game was not finished when it was released due to the map being more than twice the size of the actual parts of the map you explore during the game. I found the ending very anticlimactic. The whole game is fully voice acted, yet the ending has a few words show up at the bottom of the screen over some scenic views... There is no obvious resolution to anything in the storyline and you are not told how the choices you made throughout the game have affected the outcome of the ending, meaning if you were to replay the game you wouldn't know what to do differently.The game is visually very nice and the voice acting is good, although some times in battle I had a mans voice sound when I hit a female enemy and vice versa.As a result, I have to say that Blackguards is a non-recommendation as I don't feel like the story provided me with anything to take away and think about, and also because of the bugged achievements meaning I can never 100% this game!

												There is little to recommend, thinking I shouldn't have bought this.   D&D style RPG that invokes quests that don't use your current stats.  One that takes away all the party's armor and gives everyone clubs.  Another that takes one of your party out of the fight (and kills them off).  While one might say it's a strategic RPG,  that only applies if there aren't so may variables as to make strategy next to pointless (it's mandatory, but still comes down to plain luck far too often).  Bad enough the normal D&D variables to hit, the variable damage, but then lets toss in higher numbers of opponents, invisible terrain traps, and opponents that always have poisoned weapons.  Flanking an opponent doesn't seem to have been included, so pointless, and while crit hits are included, when the opponents out number you, they have a greater chance of getting crits, by benefit of more of them means more chances for a crit role. High level of frustration.Update - 2nd attempt, a little better.  Got to the point I quit first time.  Believe first time it was bugged as chance to hit was only 55% and bugs hit for 8-10 dmg.  This time I see my hit chance at 75% and bugs hit for 4-5 damage.   Meant I could actually get through the quest.			"

												Blackguards is an  average game at its best . Follows genetic fantasy tropes . Character creation is bare bones , you cannot modify starting stats .  Game offers large world map , but due to its linear nature you will be just staring at places you can't go . Story progresses by clicking on hubs where you will either enter a city screen or combat . Side quests are very limited . Appearance customization is limited to picking  out of five pre-made characters per gender.  There is significant shortage of light and leather armor variety . 85-90% of all armors in a game are metal which means you spell caster wont be able to use it . Game has nice sandbox system where you are allowed pick whichever skills/perks you like . Perks require xp and trainer .  It can be difficult to find trainer to teach you perk . For example you might unknowingly leave act 1 and lose access to mage trainer for rest of act 2 . Combat is dull . Most of it involves using same spell/melee attack and hoping you will get lucky.  Graphics and are style are uninspiring .  There is no camera angle rotation and overall camera controls are poor . This can lead to some frustration such as inability to target or see enemy hiding in a corner . You can interact with some environment and there are some environmental hazards like methane gas in swamps. You characters and enemies can slip on wet floor . Some maps with lots of water spills turn into some kind of comedy involving every character falling to the ground at start of their turn . Voice acting is decent . And dwarf you get in beginning of the game is awesome . In terms of bugs and glitches game was polished in its early stages . I've only encountered one minor bug that was quickly fixed .			"

												the random number generator feels broken (it says 90% chance to hit and miss 50% of the time and anything under 90% is pretty much wasting your time), my attacks that do hit will pretty much always do less than their minimum damage.your character attributes feel arbitrary and are very uninforamtive on what they actually do for you.all not worth your time unless you are extremely devoted to the story.

												I wanted to like this a lot but the complexity is a turn-off for me.  In the 75 minutes I played I maybe did 4 fights and read at least 20+ pages of tutorials that almost left me with more questions than answers. For instance, they told me to have my swordsman take cover from archers, so I did, but the archer movement was just as long as his (if not longer) and they all circled around the cover and shot me.  I tried another set of cover instead and the same happened.  In spite of all the other information they were giving, I was unable to find out why this was occurring, but I ended up hammering my way through them anyway.  I'm certain I must have missed something, perhaps to reader's fatigue.Then I fought someone in the mud, and the whole point was to show how to take advantage of the puddles on the ground to make the enemy slip and get some cheap shots in on him.  That was pretty cool.A shame, as it is a decent game, maybe even an epic one, which seems simply surrounded by too much complexity.  I'll give it another go later and see if I still feel this way later.			"

												This game is quite tough, but a lot of fun.  I am still really early in the game but here are my thoughts so far.Money is sparce at best and you can never afford anything but the essencials.  If you picked a ranged charcter like I did, assume all your gold is going to provisions, healers and arrows.  No farming, since you can't just go get in an random battles, if you have an area to explore it is best to visit every location to get all the EXP you can.  Make sure you save in multiple save slots, you can get yourself in a chain of mission that you just can't win without an extra provision or something.  If you don't have that save game from before you trigger the chain of events you could be stuck.One last thing, don't be afraid to click end turn 50 times in a row if monsters aren't activated to get your magic points back and heal everyone and then get them back of to be ready for combat.Overall, I am really enjoying it so far.  I'd recommend a play.  I'll updated the review it if I feel the need later.			"

Posted: December 20, 2015
												I can sum this entire game up in a sentence and a half. A three or four layered pile of stat sheets that serves to slightly improve your chances of besting the RNG gods on a turn by turn basis. With the odds against you.If you think this is a dark, or pessimistic way to sum the game up, I can tell you that that is actually the nice way of putting it. To the list of gaming sins this game commits you may a redundant and unrewarding item system, the most difficult to navigate skill system I have seen since the sphere grid in final fantasy X (which is mainly out of your reach anyhow, seeing as it depends on trainers which appear at arbitrary points in the story), multiple attempts at large scale battles which quickly descend into long lines of infinitely spawning enemies dog piling on your phalanx of heroes, percent chance failures on pretty much everything that mean any well laid plan can come to a deadly end at any point in your game, and a difficulty curve that pretends all the random the dice wielding percent chance jockeys whom designed the game smashed into every nook and cranny of the game does not exist at all. The end result will leave you hitting the (restart battle) button on the second or third turn of each attempted play because your warrior's power attack whiffed, which you immediately realize means you won't be able to kill the enemies quickly enough to keep up with the level. Assuming none of the heals whiff (yes, your heals can whiff to, about 33% of the time in most cases), which is also a death sentence. I could go into the ham fisted attempts at interactive levels, mysterious and all around dumb line fo sight mechanics that let bows shoot a seemingly infinite distance but leash spells at just a few tiles, impossible side objectives, and lack of actual counter play and tactics, but my ranting would fill three pages.All this is a shame considering the clear level of effort and passion that went into designing the graphics, story line, and characters, who despite being completely archetypical adventures manage to characterize themselves wonderfully though they're well developed connection to the adventure is set in. If half the effort that went into all that were part of the game, this would likely be a tbs to the caliber of dynasty tactics or r-type command. Instead, you have either a slightly better version of fire emblem, or a slightly worse version of final fantasy tactics, both of which are mind bendingly boring and tediously frustrating to begin with. If you enjoy either of those than you richly deserve this.If you read nothing else I have written, read this: This game is a pretty face and nothing else. Looks great, plays very poorly. It would be worth about half the forty dollars it costs if it were a graphic novel. Like this, it's not worth the four bucks it was on sale for when I wrote this. WOULD. NOT. RECOMMEND. TO. ANYONE.

												Blackguards is a very interesting game with complex dynamics of the Dark Eye.IMHO this game deserves a 8.5/10 and definitely worth hours of gameplay and to some extent re-playability. I found myself planing for hours what spells to get and how to develop some characters. Pros:- Detailed characters that come to life- Good roles mixture (I played as a mage but my real emphasis was a fighter with usage of the shadow spell)- Detailed scenarios- Fantastic spells and animations.- Hard difficulty requires strategic previous character planning to be able to beat some encounters.Cons:- No 360 camera support- Sometimes win or lose a battle feels more luck than strategy (Fail all the hits and all the magic, bad luck meaning lose).- Mechanics such as Buy/Sell kind of feels incomplete and Weight system feels off- End of the story is incomplete and leaves you wondering (Blackguards 2 continues this?)Overall I must say I did really enjoy the game, and the story development might is interesting although not among the most interesting from the Daedalic games or Baldur's gates games storylines.

												This game is underrated.  If you like turn-based combat, where your characters learn new skills over time, and combat is the focal point of the game (minor story, which I think makes some reviewers not like the game), then this game is great.  Sense of accomplishment on every fight you beat, especially the hard ones.  It takes a while to figure out tactics for some of the harder fights, but there's nothing better than the feeling of beating it. This is a good game.  Try the demo, you'll get the idea from that, but it does get better after a few hours and you level a bit.			"

												After playing the game for ten hours I can see why it has such mixed reviews. I wouldn't recommend it based off of my standards for games but others might still find it enjoyable.ConsTerrible story ( Confusing, presents a lot of questions but gives few answers. Main character seems like a loser)Flat characters, characters seem to blurt out whatever is in their head instead of talking to each otherPlot twists are in poor taste (They come of as 'we did this to you because we can')Somewhat steep learning curve when it comes to training your charactersWeapon system seems biased in the sense that there is little to no benefit to pick x over y in any scenerioGame consistantly pushes you back to square one by taking your gear/characters away from you and forcing you to fight at a severe disadvantageProsCharacters are customizable in their fighting style, although non mages have a limited non passive special talent selection.Difficult (although for the wrong reasons imo)Tactical turnbased gameBug free from what I have seen.If you are a diehard fan of tactical turn based games and do not care about story elements then this game might interest you. I would recommend watching youtube videos first before committing or wait for it to go on sale.Overall rating 6/10			"

												It's just... bad.  The visuals are average, with bits of them bordering on terrible.  The story and exploration are linear, and the story itself is just plain boring.  The voice-work is just good enough to point out how comically bad it is.  Towns are bland and lifeless.  Combat is stagnant, and shows no complexity.  Even if you buy Blackguards on sale, you likely still won't find the time to sit down with it.  There just isn't any single thing exciting enough to make up for the blandness of the rest of the game.  Nothing to draw you back in, after the first time you've played.It's well done from a mechanical standpoint - The skill trees are well thought out and balanced.  There's just nothing flashy in them to draw attention, and the execution becomes poor when you see your character dully performing their moves and abilities with passable graphics and poor weapons/equipment.  Blackguards is a pen-and-paper RPG adaptation that never really got past the pen-and-paper bit.  More of a visualisation of some DM's real-world tabletop setup that would seem much cooler set up with cardboard on your buddy's gaming table.If you're hellbent on playing Blackguards, I hear Blackguards 2 is actually worth the time.  It's on my list of 'soon to play' games, so I'll put up a review ASAP.			"

There are parts that need tightening up, like seeing the console commands on screen, but aside from that it's been a smooth experience for me.The story is interesting, the world is intriguingly dark and the characters, so far, are all interesting (my favourite being Niam the crackheaded half elf). Combat plays out on small, hex based maps that keep the action from getting bogged down or boring. And, while in combat, that's all you focus on; you can't loot corpses, for example. All of that happens afterwards which I like a LOT. The combat system is simple, really, but it works. There are enough special abilties to keep it all interesting and to give you a wide variety of tactics (at least when you get the right people to suit your style) but they're not exactly trying to break the mold here. Basically, you've probably seen this all before. It didn't bother me, but I could see it boring some people.The graphics do their job, though they're nothing to write home about. The voice acting has been surprisingly good for the main characters, although I find the NPCs tend to fall into stereotypes (villains sound like they're about to go ""NYAH I'M EVIL""). It's not really distracting, since their lines are short and to the point, but it was something I noticed so take that as you will.Which is really the best way to sum up this game; to the point. There are side quests and the like, but this isn't an open world game like Skyrim where you can spend a fair amount of time just walking around. You move from battle to battle, taking breathers when you need/want them, and then get right back into the thick of it. It is for this reason that I recommend this game. It's fast, fun but not short. Buy it.			"

												Blackguards is a RPG with a decent number of dialogue choices. The story has its ups and downs and early it is a bit confusing because they throw alot of unknown terms at you and and most of them you will only learn halfway through the game. And the end is kinda lackluster in my opinion.The combat is turn based and the battles are mostly diversed since some can have puzzle elemnts others can have a few stages and so on. And your choices along the game influences some of the battles you have.One of the biggest problem in the game is the amount of stats and character builds you can do makes the game way to difficult and players that dont understand how the game works in that regards can completely screw their games and be forced to start from scratch. The game does a really poor job of explaining how the overall stats work and the only way to learn about them is looking at help menu and read it or go to the manual. On the positive side when you learn to make a proper build your mid-late game characters can have quite impressive abilities and power, the high level spell effects are rather impressive.Also it is worth mentioning some of the achievements don't work properly or don't work at all.Overall I liked the game however the high learning curve that can really punish you is something that only some people can tolerate. And the game only really offers a couple of playthroughs in terms of story and in regards to builds I dont think that people will play purely on the interest of seeing builds with diferent weapons, the spells are nice but they will not make the players play the game again just to see their high level form.

												I have now put in over 50 hours on Blackguards.  I admit, getting started is a bit difficult, you really have to pay attention to what stats boost what spells or actions, but on my third character I finally had something good going.  The tactical combat is not as balanced as I had hoped for, but the challenge is mostly fun and only rarely frustrating - one flashback scene and the damn Iribar Lilies took me a good while to beat, but other than that, good times.  If you are in the mood for a challenge, give this game a shot.			"

												This is again a tricky one. Overal Blackguards is an extremely fun game but it has one big flaw. First the positive points: The strategic turn-based hex battles are great, I'm happy that finally game developers are taking this up again instead of all that RTS nonsense. The combat system with different moves goes smoothly, also the interface using a radial menu is OK. It does take a while getting used to.Nice character development using a skill/talent system which is unconventional. This feels fresh and is an interesting change compared to other typical RPG's.The voice acting is great and really adds to the immersion, also the characters themselves are well fleshed out and the interaction between them is hilareous at times (which is positive i.e. there is a lot of humor in the game).There are many different (side-)quests, lots of items to find and experiment with etc.The story itself is interesting and while the game is very linear it doesn't come as a hindrance. This also is a nice change of pace compared to other games recently where everything has to be 'open'.Now to the one flaw which at times totally screws up the game: 'nonsense' battles ...Each time I play, the battles are sometimes challenging, sometimes easy but overal quite fun. However, when you reach the pinnacle of that fun and are really enjoying the game ... the devs throw in what I call 'nonsense' battles which totally kill the mood and make you want to remove the game from the harddrive.These 'nonsense' battles for example require you to rescue someone in 6 turns. The first say two attempts it won't work since you have to figure out what is needed, the next couple of attempts you run into traps (you can't detect them since there is no time in 6 turns). So in the end you have to constantly reload and reload and reload. Try a fireball on the first turn, if it fails, reload since no miss can be afforded. The game in such battles also feels as if the 'to hit' percentages are inversed. For example a 'to hit' percentage of 95% in these battles feels as if it's 5% since suddenly everything misses (so reload and reload and reload). It thus has nothing to do with strategy anymore but purely boils down to finding that one single path which 'could' lead to victory and then pray that your attacks actually succeed.The above is really sad since it totally spoils the mood. After completing such a 'nonsense' battle (which is really a waste of time) the game is again great and fun until you again reach a point where they decided to dump such a miscreation.It feels as if the game was designed by two different people. One person designed 85% of the game which is great and 15% was designed by someone who's only goal was 'How can I annoy the player the most?"".The game also has some minor issues like incorrect voices in cutscenes or a slight stutter when using certail skills (hammer blow) etc but nothing game breaking. I didn't have any crash or anything, overal it runs smooth.In total it took me 47 hrs to complete it on medium.  Considering the fact that it has some interesting replay value (different starting class, different spells, ....) the game delivers quite some content.So, in summary, it's a great game if you're into turn-based combat and will give you a lot of fun and funny moments, but beware the 'nonsense' battles since they can make you switch to a different game in a blink. When looking at the whole package the 85% definitely outweighs the 15% so I recommend it.			"

												Bad: The story ending feels very rushed and tagged on, compared to the plot development in the other chapters.The  battles clearly have a ""right"" way. (I like this, it feels like puzzle solving, but that's a matter of taste).Items, even basic items like arrows and health potions, are limited.Very, very constrained in level-up points. The leveling up system is quite involved, and the constraint from the points is too tight. It feels like that there is one layer too many,,,The animation is... special. Everyone has a dislocated jaw. The good:Even though you can see the plot twist coming from a mile away, I still struggled to make the ""right"" decisions to try and get a ""good""ending. (Once you play enough games, you begin to see the ""right"" choice.)The game has a high F-U factor. Spent 20 hours and tons of money leveling up a character? Guess what, they're dead now, too bad. You think your arrows can break a crystal and you didn't think to equip your archer with a different weapon? Well, that's sucks for you.  Overall: This game needed a little bit more time and polish. If it had that, it would have become a classic. In it's current format, I find it highly enjoyable but I can imagine if you don't play many old games this will test your patience.  ***IMPORTANT*** Given how limited level-up points are, for your first playthrough you should use one of the pre-created classes. I would advise not playing a mage, given that there is an entire fourth page of skills to level up.			"

												I have wanted to love this game. I really, really have. The character development system is complex and has a depth rarely found in RPGs. The story and choices are a combination of dark and darker, and yet there is no shortage of humor in the game. Having said all of that, I do NOT recommend this game for the casual gamer who enjoys RPGs. This is for the hardcore gaming fans who want to spend hours agonizing over points spent in skill and character development, only to find that you have to start over because you lack core abilities in your characters to survive. Further, the combat system is ridiculous. You get a wizard at the beginning of the game as a companion who has an ~80% accuracy range - however, in my experience, his spellcasting is weak at best, and backfires most of the time, and at often critical moments. Unfortunately, healing is also problematic because it uses an entire action (turn), and so by the next round, you may be down more health points than you were before you healed. Following me so far? That's good, because on top of that, you can count on being outnumbered and outmaneuvered in nearly every battle. I could go on to wax poetic about the ineptitude of the combat system and the way the developers correlated character development with combat in a way that is clear, but I think you can get the gist of it from above. I have to quit playing this game because after too much time trying the same battle over and over again to rescue some baroness who loves the less than useless wizard companion I have, I am going to retire this game entirely and quite playing it. It simply lacks any enjoyment for me at this point. I think the game designers have a lot of work to do to create a product that I would ever consider purchasing again. I feel cheated of my money and my time. Oh, and you don't have the option of really grinding your characters up to par, either. There are a set number of quests and side quests, and you spend those character development points at your own risk. Again, there may be a market for this to hardcore gamers and some others, but it is definitely not for the faint of heart.			"

												Blackguards is a turn-based combat focused RPG, that will most likely frustrate you a lot with the amount of dice rolling in it!My opinions won't really add much to the discussion, as they're mixed... like almost everyone else's. Also, I'm farily new to the genre, so the min-maxing aspect present in the attributes and skill-trees in the game don't really appeal to me, yet (mostly how of ignorance, but anyway...).I really like RPGs in general, but I'm not one to read up on the game's numerous systems to learn what the optimal builds are -- I like to shape my characters as I please, leading to some interesting, fun, but not necessarily good decisions. I've done the same in Blackguards and will admit that, for the most part, it went alright. I played through Normal mode, and never got truly stuck, which was my biggest worry.Many people complained about reaching an unbeatable point in the game because they had a sub-optimal build. Maybe they were either playing on Hard, or I've simply been fairly lucky in my decision.I will say that there were lots of details in the game that I simply did not delve into -- potions (offensive), traps, etc. Those didn't seem all important in any of the battles in Normal.Anyway. It's tough. Some of the battles were infuriating, missing 3x in a row when I had a 90% chance to hit, having some periods of extended battles that far overstayed their welcome, etc.But I did enjoy it quite a lot. Until I finished the 3rd Chapter, that is. Then the game offered nothing new.The game is very linear, although it opens up a bit in the 3rd Chapter, giving you quite a lot of sidequests. The following 2 chapters barely have any of those, which felt strange.It seems like the focus of the game was only the 3rd chapter, the other ones being mostly to build it up or simply carry the story.The story was pretty bland, and the sidequests weren't too interesting either. Gameplay-wise, it's almost a pure combat game. You move from battle to battle. Other than battles, you just go to cities to buy equipment/heal/train, and get sidequests. Sidequests simply lead you into more battles. You never explore anything, never really find emergent gameplay or anything of the sort. It's very, very combat focused.But hey... I really have very little to add that would be in any way meaningful. I want to talk about one thing exclusively -- and that is how opaque the game actually was! It was one of the biggest sources of frustration, for me.Sometimes, the game pushes you into extended battles. Battle after battle after battle without an opportunity to heal, restock, change equipment, etc. These, of course, are a much bigger challenge -- especially because, if you do poorly on one battle, you'll carry that penalty onto the next one.These battles felt extremely tense, to me. Sometimes they could go on for 2 hours, even if they were just 2 or 3 battles. The game is very slow paced, and a mistake can cost you quite a lot of time, which is frustrating. And the game often likes to pull tricks on you that it never pointed to. They're unwelcome surprises.This is one side of it. The other, happened in the end of the game. After the point of no return, you're lead into a serious of battles, but you can heal and re-equip between them. What you can not do, is buy anything. Every healing potion, equipment, etc. that you can use is what you've taken with you. There were a few problems here -- first, you had no idea how many battles there would be, so you couldn't really judge. Second, what the game showed you was very misleading, by having it spread over 2 ""pages"", but only showing you the first.Basically, you're expecting x battles, and suddenly, after wasting most of your potions, you're shown that there are actually twice as many. Well,♥♥♥♥♥♥Thankfully, the game wasn't tricking the player and ramping up the difficulty artifically -- on that second page, there was a healer and merchant that was essentially a safe point. And that was a very nice thing.The problem is how the game never communicated that beforehand. Every battle I fought felt that much more frustrating because a small mistake seemed like a colossal one. Arguably, that the feeling that the game was trying to carry -- I doubt it, though. In this case, it was simply a case of bad communication with the player, it seemed. And similar issues happened throughout the game -- often leading you into ""extended battles"" without warning, and the like.For me, at least, it's a huge source of frustration, to have to ""judge"" something without information. Especially when mistakes can cost hours.So yeah. That's basically it. The game is a huge ""tension"" without the ""release""...Regardless, I enjoyed it. I'm not a hardcore player of the genre, so my appreciation is certainly different. It was a good challenge! There was some frustration with the dice-rolls, but overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tough turn based rpg.			"

												Start the game with two-handed sword fighter, realise everything except one-handed bashing is literally useless because that's all the game is scripted to give you.Struggle and get to the mission where you have to rescue the Baroness, realise it's literally impossible and just try to finish by killing the enemies.First few rounds are spent trial and error restarting to figure out there's invisible traps, and you need to start the round with a spell that has a 45% chance to destroy the boxes and set enemies on fire.First try: Slowly skip through cutscene, wait for enemies to move, fail 45% chance spell, restart.Second try: Slowly skip through cutscene, wait for enemies to move, fail 45% chance spell, restart.Third try: Slowly skip through cutscene, wait for enemies to move, fail 45% chance spell, restart.Fourth try: Slowly skip through cutscene, wait for enemies to move, fail 45% chance spell, restart.Fifth try: Slowly skip through cutscene, wait for enemies to move, fail 45% chance spell, restart.Sixth try: Slowly skip through cutscene, wait for enemies to move, 45% chance spell works, dwarf decides to move through 2 hexes of fire rather than one losing 20 health, take two critical hits from archer, in the end only dwarf left with 2hp and archer enemy with 22hp. Dwarf power attacks archer, deals 18 damage, archer attacks dwarf, deals 4 damage.Stop playing. Look at achivement stats, only a quarter of people finished Chapter 1. I wonder why.			"

												Game is fun, very thought through and have tons of detail put in to every aspect of it. Trully an amazing rpg, the story is great as well which is a huge plus as story kills games for me, if they are bad. Pros- Incredible RPG aspectsLots of costumization aspectsLots of equipment(weapons,armor, ect) Fun spells that make you feel rewardedLots of fun, difficulties are perfectly tunedStory is actually really good, with lots of fun twists. Cons- Some of the technical aspects of the game still need work, such as the mouse isn't locked on the screen, so playing this game if you have multiple monitors is a pain, as you constantly have your mouse go off to the other screen. I would like a few more ranged weaponsSome battles are a bit repetitive and could be done with out. (though this is minor overall) In the big picture, this game is very much worth it, and a great project that this company has done! I hope if Blackgaurds 2 comes out, they will expand on the universe even more, and a few more costumizations to the character looks/skills ect. I will def buy it!			"

												English:Blackguards is a good game that demonstrates the ability of its developers to create games that are not classic point-and-click adventures.

												Good turn based strategy game. Nice use of the enviorment to add variety. The slight challenge is that some battle fields feel small however its is primarily a melee game so it really has no negative effect overall. AI is average and the UI takes getting used to. Its very hard to see how some of the skills effect you character progression - others, like unlocking spells, are more obvious. Pretty good set of tutorial screens thought to explain the basics. Resource management between fights is challenging.			"

												Wow, it has been a long time since I played the old ""The Dark Eye"" - Games. This game brought back some memories.It has a nice atmosphere and is quite challenging. I really missed the roundbased RPGs, which is, for me atleast, revived in this. Sometimes you have to think ahead, sometimes you can just bully everybody down. Some fights are really stressful, while others are straightforward. The point is that almost no fight is like another one, each requires new tactics and strategies, atleast to a point. Of course you have your base tactics, which, in my case was a mostly ranged combat play style. But pure melee or multiple spellcasters sound interesting too. The good thing is that every character is can mostly do anything, aside the fact that only characters with magic potential can become wizards.Another interesting thing for was the whole plot. Having played the other TDE games made it easy for me to fit into the world with its twelve gods, its mostly human based civilisation, with much prejudice against other races and of course its bright and wild country side, which makes this world a beautiful place. But the beauty in this is just a mask for all the darker happenings in this world.All in all, if you love Roundbased Strategy, a good and detailed told story and funny, yet serious, characters, this game is for you. Just bring some time and patience, because the downside of this are the time consuming fights and the kinda missing background story of your secondary characters.			"

												As a newbie to tactical RPG games, I am enjoying it thus far. It is a bit tough if you are trying to learn the genre and the game at the same time. I like the turn-based format vs real-time because for obvious reasons of trying to figure out my plan. I don't like that you can't save your progress within a battle, but perhaps that's just how it is, like dingleberries are brown. Pick it up on a discount like I did and there will be little reason to regret it if it's not your type of game.			"

Well, on the other hand since the score was so low, my expectations were quite low as well, resulting in a nice surprise. It is less RPG than tactical combat game but it is very good at what it is doing. Frustration because of hits are not landing even when the indicated probability is high, comes probably from the fact the people do not develop skills properly.

												While I don't have a lot of time invested yet in Blackguards I must say that I am enjoying the turned based combat and overall feel of the game.  The game is very pretty and seems bug free for the most part at least for the 3 or so hours I put into the game.   I really haven't gotten to invested into the story yet but it is interesting enough.  Visually the game is very pretty and gameplay wise it seems rewarding.   I haven't seen anything that reinvents the wheel but that said what it does it does well.  I so far highly recommend the game.  Honestly in the short time I have been playing I have had more fun combat wise than with games like Dragon Age.  Of course it isn't completely fair to compare a Real Time with Pause game with a turned based game.   I will say that between this and Divnity: Original Sins it makes a turned based strategy RPG gamer happy with glee to see such great games coming out.			"

												This is just the sort of game I love and as it was half price I snapped it up. That is where the fun ended sadly. The skills/abilities sound great but there is no way you can know what you need to go for. I built a fairly rounded party so I could be flexible and now can't even defeat basic enemies. This is, for me, a major problem as I now have to go back to an earlier save to re-spec. Not so bad you would think. Well this is where the problem is multiplied hugely. The point I am at in the game, for some unknown reason, is at the end of a series of very tedious battles. These do not allow you to save of even gather experience between them. So I have to go back beyond this point. Which is frankly killing any enjoyment I got from this game. Honestly this is a decent attempt at a turn based RPG. What lets it down is the total lack of freedom in your choices. No random battles means you have to know where to spend those skill points as you aren't getting any more from anywhere. Couple this with the fact that there is no real way of knowing what you need to spend them on till you have a go and this ruins what could have been fun.I am aware of the online guides on how to spec characters but what is the point of having lots of options only to have them reduced down to a handful that are actually feasible? Really feel that at half price I have been robbed.			"

Felt like walking on eggshells.  Did I do anything profound? Nope.. Just kept loading from a save until it finally continued.After further play, I still feel the game needs balancing.  Some of the fights are super-easy, others are nigh impossible.  I stand by my review.  Will this game be enjoyable at some point?  I bet, sure.. Does it need patching?  Yes it does...			"

												A terrific return to Turn-Based Combat, with a slightly darker, fantasy story. It at once feels like a renaissance of the turn-based genre, but with some newer, unique ideas. Character customization looks outrageous and daunting at first, but with a single type of Adventure Point and clear class-goals, linear guidance eases the pain, while still allowing anyone to experiment with wild combinations. It's a classic tale of old-school meets new-school, all in a really tightly-produced package. Graphics, story and gameplay are all great.			"

												While I don't have a lot of time invested yet in Blackguards I must say that I am enjoying the turned based combat and overall feel of the game.  The game is very pretty and seems bug free for the most part at least for the 3 or so hours I put into the game.   I really haven't gotten to invested into the story yet but it is interesting enough.  Visually the game is very pretty and gameplay wise it seems rewarding.   I haven't seen anything that reinvents the wheel but that said what it does it does well.  I so far highly recommend the game.  Honestly in the short time I have been playing I have had more fun combat wise than with games like Dragon Age.  Of course it isn't completely fair to compare a Real Time with Pause game with a turned based game.   I will say that between this and Divnity: Original Sins it makes a turned based strategy RPG gamer happy with glee to see such great games coming out.			"

												This is just the sort of game I love and as it was half price I snapped it up. That is where the fun ended sadly. The skills/abilities sound great but there is no way you can know what you need to go for. I built a fairly rounded party so I could be flexible and now can't even defeat basic enemies. This is, for me, a major problem as I now have to go back to an earlier save to re-spec. Not so bad you would think. Well this is where the problem is multiplied hugely. The point I am at in the game, for some unknown reason, is at the end of a series of very tedious battles. These do not allow you to save of even gather experience between them. So I have to go back beyond this point. Which is frankly killing any enjoyment I got from this game. Honestly this is a decent attempt at a turn based RPG. What lets it down is the total lack of freedom in your choices. No random battles means you have to know where to spend those skill points as you aren't getting any more from anywhere. Couple this with the fact that there is no real way of knowing what you need to spend them on till you have a go and this ruins what could have been fun.I am aware of the online guides on how to spec characters but what is the point of having lots of options only to have them reduced down to a handful that are actually feasible? Really feel that at half price I have been robbed.			"

												Definitely a must-have for old cRPG turn-based fans.This is the first turn-based I'm enjoying so much after years (on PC Plattform).Simple but very nice story, characters with his own personality, battles are never boring because different goals or external elements interaction, enough spells/skills to customize (shame that you know already all spells in game from the beginning, was more interesting if talents/spells would be revealed only when meeting NPCs who can train it)A game that reminded me FFT and Vandal Hearts on PSX, and definitely a good one! No resource management, no extreme high graphic, just turn-based battles, equipping/healing in cities and pure enjoyment...as it used to be!			"

												Blackguards combines engaging tactical combat with a pretty nifty story. It's pretty much what D&D Tactics wished it could have been, even though I personally liked that as well. The amount of freedom you have when it comes to upgrading your characters is quite welcome as wel, as is the interactive objects on the battlfield. If you're the kind of person who even just thinks this game looks interesting, chances are you'll love it.			"

												Blackgaurds is not a masterpiece, no. I have read many reviews over it and most seem to want a perfect game for one that is from $5 - $10 when on sale or not, and it is definetly worth that. TBS based battles are very challenging and saving often is your best friend. Game throws strong challenges at you as you progress through the story and believe me, the fights are just win-able. If your looking for a interesting take on a story done a thousand times, and a good challenge, this is your game.			"

												Just finished the game.  After getting to the last battle and finding it frustrating not to have Aurelia, I went back through chapters 4-5 changing strategies. The good:-If you really miss Temple of Elemental Evil, this game will be nice for you-Not a lot of min/maxing of gear (some of the best gear is available early in the game, and most of the stuff you'll find in the game will not be an upgrade)-Each of the companions have really well-drawn out personalities (the dwarf, for example, will complain when you heal him that he ""doesn't need it""; the playboy mage will flirt with NPC's you meet).The bad:-There are not a lot of varieties of bad guys in the game.  You'll find yourself saying ""didn't I just fight this battle?"" a bit too frequently- For people that like seeing gear progression, you will not get it here.- The ending was quite a bit of a let-down.- During combat, there is no way to speed up the monsters' turns; and you will sometimes literally be waiting a minute between turns while a slug slugs its way across the screen.Will you like it?-If you liked Temple of Elemental Evil because it was super ""true to the rules""--Yes-If you liked Baldur's gate because your Party AI would let you not have to micromanage--No			"

												While this game shows immense promise at the start as DnD style RPG with tonnes of character trees to customise and fun turn based fights eventually you will encounter the horrible broken boss fights and terrible plot decisions. Without spoiling much the game strips you of characters by force and the balance always seem to be tipped against you. I believe that this game received too much praise from reviewers who did not play far enough into the game.The complaints I had with this game I found had been discussed by other players while the game was in Beta on the Blackgaurd forums. The developers obviously did not take these potentially game saving points on, which is the most disappointing thing of all. "

												Full Review: http://www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk/pc-game-reviews/review-blackguards/Blackguards is a turn-based fantasy RPG from German outfit Daedalic which is solely based on the Dark Eye roleplaying system. It provides a welcome return to the true turn based RPG combat genre which forces you to greatly consider every action you make, whether that be skill points, combat skills and many more. It provides a good level of difficulty, without going too over-board whilst allowing you a ‘life-line’, a bone for when things get tough – i.e. the all-important and crucial save feature between battles. The overall storyline, writing, voice-acting is good whilst providing enough depth to avoid it being a drag.Combat is where Blackguards best feature occurs and is perfect for players who enjoy the battles on hex tiles to that of the stories behind them. The use of objects on battle-maps combined with an easy to understand combat interface and a variety of character abilities/skills allows the player to get in and get on with gameplay.Difficultly in digesting a variety of character abilities, skill points and equipment load-outs, specifically the equipment system, as that proved most challenging and somewhat confusing due to the amount of resistances available. However, once you’ve taken the time to understand how they all interlink, this section opens up to provide the player with a great variety of levelling up elements.Can appear to be somewhat repetitive if players aren’t enveloped in the storyline. Far too many loading screens which stops the flow of the story and battles far too often.A very stylish and graphically intense RPG, scoring high on the styles category, specifically in the gorgeous looking towns/outposts, where players are faced with beautifully designed shops and scenery which differs throughout the storyline.A mediocre score for value with its current (09/03/14) price tag of £26.99.Blackguards provides players with the opportunity to play for hours on end, experiencing a whole array of new content/utilising new tactics, however players are forced to read every snippet of information/guide to fully understand its complicated character system and some battles can appear to be rather repetitive.

												Tough but rewarding. This is (luckily in my eyes) a typical The Dark Eye game. If you do not know this RPG system: it's Germany's biggest and probably oldest Pen & Paper RPG system that is still maintained. And as many things from Germany it is deep and complex, but needs a certain degree of dedication. You will not be able to simply start this game, kill some enemies and have fun. You really need to have a look at the rule system and how all the character values influence your fighting, casting and other skills. The same goes for spending your experience points, if you simply raise a stat here and there you will find the game very hard and probably quit. If you decide what role a character will have and raise the necessary stats and skills for this you will have a much easier time and will be able to enjoy the very complex fight options.One definitive pro from my point of view are the really varied battle maps. Most maps have unique interactive features that you can use in the battle, like alchimistic tables that will poison bystanders when smashed. Or drawbridges that can be raised or lowered. Or cranes with crates that might smash your heroes from the docks - or the enemies if you position yourself smart enough.Alltogether it is a clear recommendation for me if you like complex strategy games with RPG-like character development. Do not buy if you look for Diabloesque casual RPGs.			"

Its great to finally have a game to fill the void left by the lack of tactical rpg's out there. I can see myself playing through the campaign multiple times, and I really hope they expand more on this game with some DLC or a campaign editor or something.			"

												A horrible turn based RPG. The A.I. makes no sense at all and seems to just roll of RNG. For instance, you could be in combat with an insect, a large dumb version of 'lice' that would waltz right by your entire team to go secure an objective that you should be holding that the insect doesn't even KNOW about, story wise. There is no way to view your armor as a whole, to compare it to other armor sets. This also doesn't let you save in combat, and the combats are slow and tedious. Matter of fact, I had the FINAL gladiator fight I was in crash on the next to final turn as a waited out the final baddy to blow up (was on a timer in an arena and covered in oil and lit.)This game will make you rage, not because of the difficulty, but because the horrible interface, no real enemy A.I. (I swear they go full retard half the time. ""Oh hey, spikes. I should jump up and down on this space over and over again until I keel over!)Overall, go with something more polished that you can get your hands on. Only 5 characters to play as in this one too, so I suggest you roll an archer, considering you don't get to keep one, forcing you to roll an archer (or gimp someone else into an archer) if you want a balanced team. Also, no explanation of half the games mechanics makes this a very annoying venture. Really don't recommend this game.			"

												This game is... garbage.  In fact, this game is an insult to garbage.  The engine is clunky, and good luck getting past the boss fights if you don't know the engine like the back of your hand.  Oh, and lets just throw in some gratuitous anti-arab racism just to make things even better.  I do not recomend this game, I recomend avoiding this game like it has plauge.  Plague and bird flu.  I picked it up after spending a long time feeling deprived of a Tactical RPG, but after this, I would rather not a single tactical  RPG ever be made again rather than deal with another moment of this awful game.  I would rate Blackgaurd as a 0/10, for having no redeaming features at all.			"

												the first few fights are all i played, as the game lacks controller and hdtv support... it works, if you dont mind its clunky seeming interface. can't recommend it as i have uninstalled it and won't be playing again, at least not for awhile.    the impression i got from my time with the game is that it's a b-lister, mostly directed at heroes of might and magic fans of the easy-to-please variety. boring maps with just stupid combat, hexagonal set pieces with stupid cover and a stupid skill/attack wheel which is too small to see in 1080p on an hdtv without straining. just the most basic of games whos aim was too low and hit the mark squarely (the 'too low' mark).  if i had played the entire game, my opinion might matter more, but i gave this what i feel was a fair shake, and even submitted recomendations about controller support and the ui, which were apparently ignored (probably because i wasnt♥♥♥♥♥kissy enough, according to one random poster- paraphrased by me of course).      if you are a fan of xcom enemy unknown, you are going to know what you are missing when you play this electronified board game. xcom does all the things right that this game ignores in favor of flashback hour (think ff tactics, but with crappy gameplay). the way you are thrust from one fight to the next is lame, when, given this is 2014, i expected to be able to a) walk around freely or somewhat freely between fights, perhaps with interesting things to do or b) same as 'a'. instead, the story is fed to you between battles and that's it. fight! crappy fight! if the price was 10 dollars, it would excuse the quality in my opinion, but they want to charge like the big boys, they get judged like them.to make a long story one sentence longer, i dont dig it.

												I've clocked about 34 hours with this game at the time of my writing this and have gotten through a fair portion of Chapter 3, so I think it's fairly safe to say that I've formed a solid enough opinion. Simply put, Blackguards turned out to be a rare gem and has already, surprisingly, found its way to my personal list of all time favorites. A few minor glitches aside, it's a lovely blend of dark fantasy storytelling, challenging tactical combat, and flexible charachter development that so far hasn't failed to delight. And it looks quite attractive to boot, with a fantastic UI and lovingly crafted imagery. The cast of lovable rogues that comprise your party is well acted and well written. The story as a whole, at least so far, is engaging without being overbearing, maintaining a light touch while never failing to be consistently interesting. It ain't Shakespeare, but it never aspires to be. Instead, it accomplishes exactly what the early hours of the game promise: it is  a damned enjoyable caper of a kind that perhaps we need more of in the world, a slice of true, unabashed, adventure escapism that somehow evokes the simpler, formative days of a young nerd's nerddom. The subject matter is often dark, but it always feels like an exciting journey above all else. And sometimes that's more than enough to make something worth one's time. While I am sure it's not for everyone, players who enjoy tactical combat, roleplaying games, and being entertained can find plenty to love here.			"

												The game itself is about gathering a group of criminals and misfits together to form a band of anti-heroes to take on the bad guys and rescue a damsel in distress.  Its broken down into Chapters which were released through beta piece at a time.  I bought the game in beta and enjoyed playing it immensly.  The battles are turn based so no need to rush and a much better opportunity to win through tactics and strategy.HOWEVER when the full version was released it all went drastically downhill.  Yes there were a few minor bugs that I could live with when it was a beta.  The final release version has a number of major flaws in it.  My existing save game made any new battles unfinishable as you couldnt end a turn - all your characters just stood there with no end turn available.  That's okay I thought, I will start a new game, it will be fun choosing a different character from Chapter 1.  Oh no ....... BIG FAIL.  When you try to start a new game, you get the character creation part fine but once you finish adjusting your new hero you try to start the game and all you get is a black screen and some music.  Immediately I thougt oh it must be a graphics resolution problem, but yet I had just loaded a older saved game and it loaded fine (even if I couldnt advance through the next battle) and indeed it loaded fine again when I tried.  So now I am at an impasse, with no new game possible and all my saved games bugged.I checked the forums and it is not just me with these issues.  And it appears that the publisher is doing nothing to resolve the said issues.So overall this game now has some major flaws that make it unplayable.  Stay away.			"

												I am glad I only got this as part of the HumbleBundle (Side note, support Humble).This is a turn based, hexgrid, dungeon crawler, rpg based on a not unheard of tabletop system.It plays like a fan created mod to another game, in every way this game screams its lack of polish, it's terrible design and its aweful assets. This game makes NWN 1+2 look cutting edge*FLAWS*1) Inconsistant Mechanics; in short, they're half baked. An early mechanic is terrain tiles (water is slippery, bushes are flammable etc) and in theory these could make for some more complex tactical play, but sometimes thats not the case, water may just be a watery looking tile, or it may cause you to fall on your♥♥♥♥♥and be prone for a turn. Enemies never use them either, they just move to attack range throw fire, ice and poison.2) Incorrect RNG; this is a tabletop system adapted for the PC, so of course its simmulating (with a pretty bad generator I might add) die rolls under the hood. You get told a percentage chance to hit (and can level up enough to see other stats) but the percentage shown is WRONG. That's right, the game actively lies to you because its number generation system isn't implemented right. 100% chance is actualy 90%, 65% is actualy 40%. You will also see the same resualt consistantly for mid range %, every time I fire an arrow at a humanoid enemy with a 65% chance to hit I would miss without fail. same goes for 50% with melee, this makes me think the random generator isn't so random after all.3) Atrocious Voice acting; Dear gods is it terrible, it's not even laughably bad, the actors are often re-used but its like no-one told them they were doing different characters so everyone they voice sounds identicle. They were also clearly recorded completly seperatly without any lead in or practice because they're all delivered with the same dry detatchment of people with a full frontal lobotomy.4) Poor story telling; The plot may improve as time goes on, but from what I've experienced so far I can already tell you my version ""And so it was that the brave ranger stabbed the annoying sidekicks while they slept and went to live away from the continent full of madmen"". Honestly it started out bad enough with the giant wolf having killed (or having been eating) a random damsel, you kill the wolf and then get arrested for her murder. The wolf was right there, you kill it, its body is lying on the ground next to the corpse, yet they arrest you for her murder. The rest of the story was following a bread crumb story into a veriaty of linier dungeons, speaking of which.5) Dull Dungeon Design; if you're making a dungeon crawler then you need decent dungeons, so far everything has been a straight line with preset encounters, no element of maze, mystery or surprise. You know you will need to enter each point on the dungeon map, you know that each point is going to have an encounter, and you know that you will want to save scum the hell out of it just to preserve your precious resources.6) Cheap assets; It's ugly. Very Ugly. There is no sense of unifying aesthetic. Everything is the same blocky 3d models with dodgy shadowing, terrain detailing can actualy conflict with mechanics ""is that shoreline tile a water tile or a land tile? You won't know till you step on it"" the models are barely detailed, only slightly more complex than the 3d models used for CIV V (the ones designed to render quickly at distance and not be looked at too closely). Combine this with a lack luster muZak score and it just doesn't feel good to experience.7) Poor Performance; for a PC game, its not offering much in the way of performance options. You can set nebulous graphics quality but get no fine choice, you can pick a resolution but theres no windowed mode. In game I've seen multiple graphics glitches caused by lighting effects, flickering textures and even the Hex Grid breaking and flashing at the bottom of the screen. "

												For the most part I really like this game. Character development is very deep and interesting for an indie RPG and the combat, while not incredibly nuanced, is fun and challenging. On the other hand however, the game's marketing material tout that you play as a band a criminals and miscreants - even the name of the game hints at this. However the game appears to reward you for being the 'good' guy and punish you by omission for being the 'bad' guy, which is surely counter productive if you want your players to be nasty 'Blackguards'. However that's just my opinion.I can't recommend this game in its current state. There are far too many bugs and design issues that should have been weeded out during testing. Another testament to how pointless and anti-consumer the early access system is. The game is simply not worth the asking price as it is. However once these problems are fixed and perhaps the game comes down in price a little, I'd happily recommend it. At its core it's a very enjoyable game.			"

												Although it has an interesting idea for a story, the gameplay itself is porrly executed. The fight sequences are repetitive and even on normal mode seemed arbitrarily hard, suggesting not a lot of creativity went into the difficulty just number values. The side quests were uninteresting, the characters were fairly stock and it just had the feeling of an unfinished game in general. Too be fair, I never made it out of Chapter 1, so I can't say it doesn't get better; however, I'm a firm believer in having the beginning of the game be the hook, to entice the gamer to play more. Another reason being: if the first chapter feels unfinished, how is the rest of the game going to feel better? And spells that have a chance of failing? I understand Magic Resists/Immunities creating another level of gameplay, but buff spells that have a 46% chance to fail?  Overall 5/10.			"

												This game should be a manual about how to fail a game.It has been a long time I had not the chance to play a game so frustrating:- wrong hit percentages (I once missed 99% 3 times in a row and I would say 95% means 70% for them)- difficulty is scaled not on ennemy becoming stronger but you getting weaker (poison lowering stats, map full of traps) or them becoming more numerous (how great to play a turn based game with 20 ennemies)- repetitive fights (always the same)- useless quests (you can forge a 9 element spear which is as good as other one you can find easily)- mage are useless. You have a low mana pool and will always run out of mana. Mana potions are so expansive you just cannot afford them (but the ennemy can).This game is just a punition. If you are masochist, go for it. For normal people, it is a waste.			"

												Typical CRPG with nothing really new but if anything that redeems it from that is one thing, one name, one dwarf...Naurim. He is by far the only character that keeps you playing because he is a master dwarf with a suspicious aggression for everything. The words that pour from his godly beard shatter everyone in a 100 meter radius.  Hero - ""Why did you burn down a tavern?""Naurim - ""Because the tavern had dragon in it's name, and I hate dragons""420/10 Blaze that Tavern Naurim with your mystical beard, you are a god! Step aside Gimli you ♥♥♥♥♥, Nauim is the top dwarf now son.			"

												Blackguards is at first an interesting turn based RPG, with combat occuring on premade hex grid based maps. It is interesting because it does away with most of the filler that comes with most every RPG. You do not control your characters in any way outside of combat, you simply shift to a different spot in a city where you can talk to a couple of NPCs and that's it. Outside of towns you travel on the world map by clicking on a selectable point on the map and you are instantly transported to a town, or into combat if you have a quest going on outside of town.This makes the game more fun at the beginning, because you always get to the important parts of the game instantly, that would be the combat and the story. However as you progress through the game the positive turns into a negative because you never start feeling a connection with any of your characters. The only time you control them is in combat and in combat they are simply damage dealing stats.So the game becomes tedious as you start clicking through all the dialogue to just pick up the quests and then you do the quests, almost always by going into combat and you soon realise that the primary things you do in the game are combat and clicking through the story, which I might add is very simple and not at all interesting.The combat at first is satisfying, especially for me since I am a fan of turn based, tile based combat. However you will probably start getting more and more annoyed with it because of its randomness (nearly every action has at least a small chance to fail and it seems to happen more often than it should). And also because of the lack of data while in combat, the battlelog is very nearly completely useless so you have to constantly pay attention to know what is happening, since the camera can jump around a bit if it's a larger map and you can lose track of the enemy actions. And there isn't enough contextual information with the game for when you move your characters. For example I'd like to know if one of my characters will pass through where an enemy can do an attack of opportunity on him, it's true that it isn't too hard to figure out for yourself if that will happen, but honestly you probably won't have the patience to do it after you are controlling 5 characters and have 5+ enemies each taking their own turn. The combat just becomes too slow at that point.Outside of combat you also manage the equipment of each of your characters, which isn't really that interesting because there isn't much choice of weapons or armour and what little there is it's always a straight upgrade or not, so there isn't much thinking involved. Somewhat more involved is improving the skills of your characters, but even that becomes straightforward after a while, since you get an abundance of points to allocate throughout the game and you soon pick up the more desirable skills.So to summarise my main points: no filler makes for a fun start, but it also destroys any potential character building, the story is very simple and not at all interesting, the combat is at first fun but it becomes tedious after a while, not much variety in equipment and finally not enough interesting skills which are worth putting points in. Definitely try the game if you are into turn based, tile based RPGs however be warned that the game can become tedious to play and it did so for me.5 / 10			"

												I really don't like this game.Confusing for the sake of confusing doesn't make a game complex or interesting.  The character stat screen tells you very little of the impact that your leveling decisions make.  So much of the directional choices you make with characters appears to be hidden.  The hit percentage system, how to recover health/mana efficiently and the effects of decisions are just a few examples of this.I understand that a fair amount of people believe that this hidden veil makes the game more complex, and that they consequently are ""more intelligent"" because they ""figured it out"".  I would argue that they wasted their time fiddling with a poorly designed game when they could have been playing a game that isn't a waste of time.I should have played the friggin' demo first.  So for that, I entirely blame myself.			"

												Would I recommend this game to everybody?  No, not at all.Would I recommend this game to people who I know love Dungeons and Dragons?  Yep! (Only when the game is on sale)This game, as you know, is based on the Darkeye D20 ruleset and is only for those who like stategy turn-based RPGs.  Darkeye is pretty big in Europe from what I understand but I personally never ran a game with it and I wanted to experience the system in an easier to digest way and I felt I got that from this game.  Package that with the honestly funny writing and interesting characters and I enjoyed myself.  Note, however, that this game is entirely about the combat system and RPG progression.  The story is there, but weak, and there is no exploration.  The retail price is too steep for what you get but if you see this game for $15.00 USD or less then I'd suggest picking it up for fans of the genre.			"

												An interesting RPG game with some strategy that was initially sold to me by referring to it as being in a similar vein as Shining Force (still one of my all time favourite games).  It does have to be said that the premise and characters aren't as dark as you would initially expect, given that this game promises something close to flawed dark 'heroes', but does make a nice change to the usual knight in shining armor.Am only in the 2nd chapter so am not sure how the slighly repetative layouts and fights will play out as I progress, as do feel that it may grow stale after anothter 10 or so hours.  Also the inability to grind to gain AP (like EXP) does irritate in a game where every point counts and you feel as though you have never levelled up the right stat/skill/spell.Bug-wise tha game has been fine thus far.  One gripe I do have is that I expected the bonus from equiping a set of armour to be more obvious and worthwhile than it currently is.			"

												I know its been a long time in the making, but I have finally defeated the game that is Blackguards. In this game you will be taking on the role of a commoner who is friends with those in high places, especially a princess, but wait, what was that? Oh no the princess has been killed, and you are having the finger pointed at you. This is where the true story begins, and where you will met the first of your companions that will help you through the game with either their strength or their magical abilities.Graphically this game has a couple of small hiccups from time to time, but the overall game gives you the feel of a dark and desolate world that is clinging to the world of old gods. Even though you don't get to actually walk through the towns, you are given 3D scenes that you can click on the action icons to interact with, they all have depth and personality. Another thing is that there is a lot of different models used when it comes to interacting with towns, you are not going to see a lot of repeats, though to be fair its not like any of the towns are overflowing with people. Now as far as the combat graphics are concerned you are placed in a 3D hex-based grid system in which you will be moving from 3/4s side view to top down view so that you can see the whole field and make sure you're not missing anything such as traps or enemies that could be hiding behind walls, plants, etc. I do like the fact that at the bottom of the screen, since this is turn based, that there are images of the enemies, and they have about 3 to 4 stock images so that the enemies have a little bit of variety to them. Sure the models all look the same with the exception of if the enemy is a specific class or sex.The music in the game was very well made, and there were quite a few haunting tunes that as soon as they start I immediately think about the game. The voice acting for the most part was solid as well, there were a couple of over the top performances, but sometimes that's going to happen when try too hard to capture a specific type of character.The controls in the game are pretty straight forward. You are going to use the mouse coupled with WASD for most everything while moving around a map, or on the battlefield. You will of course be using the usual 'i' for inventory and 'c' for character sheet.So this game is pretty deep when it comes to all the little tweaks you can make to your character. There is a good number of spells to cast, there is weapon proficiency to think about, active and passive skills to learn, traits to learn, and of course stats to increase. I have to say that this was always a daunting task for me, but for the most part, once I really got into the game, I had the feel for what was really important for my party to not only survive, but to succeed. You'll also be given weapons, armor, and items galore that you will have to learn to balance. I found out the hard way that putting items or equipment on your characters does not take away much if any of the load in your inventory. So when I had my party fully decked out I almost had no room for much else, unless of course I wanted to play encumbered. That being said it didn't created THAT big of an annoyance.You of course have your own main quest, starting off with you trying to figure out what is really going on, and then of course the twists happen and all hell possibly breaks loose. The thing is that there are a ton of side quests to keep your eyes out for. Now I will say this, until the very end of the game you might lose access to some quests, but have no fear you will regain it later on in the game. There's also many quests that you might miss out on if you don't periodically check in on all the cities. Yes, I understand that that means that you will be dealing with a ton of load screens, but none of them are really unbearable, and when you get to the end of the game, you will thank me for making you search for extra quests.I'm going to be totally honest with you, it took a couple of attempts for me to get into this game, but once I was invested in the game I couldn't stop. I wanted to see what was behind the next bend in the road, what enemies would stand in my way, and of course it stood out to me because I've always loved pencil and paper RPGs, and this felt like a pretty good transition from sitting around a round table with friends and experiencing and adventure. So in the end I have to say that through it all I have to give this game an 8.9 out of 10.			"

												A frustrating design nightmare.  Suffers from classic Euro-dev 'difficulty' design flaws.  Everytime you lull yourself into a state of enjoying this game, the devs ♥♥♥♥ up.  You can almost smell the body odour of the geek who thought taking away all your loot for an entire climactic segment of the game was a good idea.Don't bother getting attached to characters or strategically saving points to spend on a worthwhile skill.  You can lose them without any notice, having wasted opportunities to use those points to get you through certain battles.  Cardinal error.Some fights are designed to be artificially punishing.  I haven't used the word 'cheap' since I played Nintendo in the 90s.			"

												I'm going to give it a thumbs up, but don't buy this thing at full price. Its a £5 game that is very simplistic. You can't even rotate the camera.The UI is awful - especially the radial menus for combat. Whoever designed those needs to be taken outside and beaten with a small fish which recently died of natural causes. Whoever signed off the interface then needs to be beaten with whatever remains of said fish. Thankfully you do have quickslots though!The animation during the cutscenes are laughable, as is the voice acting. Undoubtedly it was ""someone's mate"" that did both. The opening cutscene on the other hand is quite good. 8/10 for that bit... all 60 seconds or so of it. The graphics are fairly reasonable, though sometimes things are obscured and with no way to rotate the camera this is slightly annoying. The audio is also reasonable, but a little monotonous.The simplicity and awful UI aside, it is a TBS game with power-ups, and i like TBS games with power-ups. If you like them too, then get it when its on sale.			"

That beind said, if you dont focus your characters then you'll find combat to be brutal and can become very frustrated, but I feel this is more a pro then a con, just giving a heads up.			"

												Blackguards is a turn-based fantasy, often dark and frequently humorous, RPG.While still a beta product it is polished and one of the best RPG's I have played in a while. It is a good feeling to catch myself laughing at the well voice acted humorous dialogue, which I haven't experienced to this degree since way back in games such as KOTOR and Jade Empire. Daedalic Entertainment might just be the new old pre-EA BioWare we all fondly remember.Probably the only frustrating thing I experienced was the questionable stated odds of a spell succeeding, but I am also not sure if that percentage was meant to take into account the defender's resistances.I give it a 9 because it is hard to me to envision a better RPG without my mind drifting back to old BioWare. So this is a real user score, not an artificially inflated rating meant to preemptively fend off the incoming 0's from reviewers that found fault in this product.I eagerly await the Chapter 5 release...

												Really love it! This game is misunderstood very often.+ great gameplay (not as good as XCOMs but still nice)+ based on The Dark Eye - refreshing compared to all the games based on D&D+ nice story+ nice quests (and side quests)+ funny interaction in-between the characters+ really good value for money when on sale+ lots of different skills and builds to explore (a bit confusing and overwhelming for beginners though)+ good difficulty (it will be very challenging at times and you will have to change your tactics which worked before)-	Obviously not a huge development budget (they made the best out of it)-	Graphics are nice but could be way better (eg. cutscenes …)-	Skills & talents can be difficult to understand. You’ll probably need to google a bit to understand the different character values.-	Some bugs can be frustrating, eg. when the healer in-between the gladiator fights won’t heal you anymore. There aren’t many but this one made it very hard for me-	Save often. (same as xcom). It could save you time.-	Usability in the stat/spell/… screens could be better, especially when trying to figure out which weapon does more damage.All in all, I can live without the best graphics and animations (like XCOM does superb). I was willing to learn about the skills and mechanics. I accepted the couple of bugs I encountered – it only lead to the game being more difficult but didn’t break the game itself.After reading many negative reviews I think the problem is that this game isn’t like many other games out there, it’s comparable to XCOM but with possibility to skill your characters in a complex way. You can’t save every minute and decisions you made today could be a problem much later. You may have to do some side quests to get the experience to advance. You won’t be able to blindly upgrade every skill and spell there is. You will have to use different tactics. Using Takate with his piercing skill will work awesome most of the time, but if an enemy is immune to piercing you should better have given him some other weapon and skills (I learned this the hard way).Obviously something went wrong during the beta version, because most of the negative reviews are from back then. I didn’t experience many of the problems from back then. If you like turn based games with a lot of strategy involved you’ll probably like this. If you want to kill many monsters with huge firewalls better get path of exile ;) "

Other than these exceptions however, it's fun-level-challenging for a decent RPG gamer.Have quite a few bugs that made me rip some of my hair off of my head and a ridiculous success chance randomizer. If you miss 95% chance to hit a guy three-four times in a row, it means it's a normal day in Blackguards.Has some companion-NPCs with ""character"" but also has filler/meat/dps guys too (Yes, i'm talking about Takate)All in all, if you are looking for a challenging tactical-rpg and ready to rage quit multiple times, this game is just for you.

												Just finished Blackguards, and it took about 50 hours of play time (this includes the DLC). I am a big fan of turn based tactical RPGs, and Blackguards does very well with the genre. Game difficulty is good, the story (though not amazing) is told well. Graphics are all right, but nothing to write home about. The maps are well designed and do not feel re-used, but the characters look like something from a game that was released over 6 years ago, not just over 6 months ago. Only being able to pick a head out of a choice of 6? I expect that from an indie company, not an established development studio.Enemies are diverse, and they tossed in a good amount of missions with different obectives so the goal it's always just to wipe out the other side. There are times when it does get frustrating as the number of enimies can be many on a map, and we feel like you're spending more time waiting than actually playing the game.When I first started playing Blackguards (during version 1.2) the game was buggy af. Some trainers did not work, some healers did not work (including what that was kind of critical to being able to progress in the game). Thought this was fixed in patch 1.3, but the game still has its bugs. These range from minor annoyance (I swear 25% of the achievements are bugged), to ""Why isn't this fixed yet"" (Big huge massive spoiler --> Seriously, what's up with Aurelia? I trusted her and sided with her on everything, and in the end she still dies... Not that I even got the achievement for that)Despite the frustration of the bugs, it is a very good game, and one I would say should be added to anyone's list if they like turn based tactical RPGs. Just be aware that it still needs some work.			"

												Glad I got this in the humble bundle and didn't actually pay for it. After muddling through some quests and putting up with the seriously terrible random number generator (honestly, the RNG is reason enough not to play this game, but I gave it a shot anyways), I was starting to have some fun and enjoy how my party was shaping up. Then I was suddenly rewarded with the death of my best ranged damage dealer for no reason at the start of a boss fight. Not death as in incapacitated in combat, but a scripted event that apparently just takes the char away from you. Gee thanks. Uninstalled.			"

												8/10, one of the most enjoyable turn-based titles of the past year. Reasons? A lot of innovation: combat and level-up system, plot twists. Most annoying thing I remember weeks after playing it - no way to cancel or speed up animation. The bottom line is: close to a must for the lovers of genre, but I could hardly recommend it to newcomers.			"

												Great game.  The Dark Eye is a good rpg system.  The story is pretty much on rails but still not bad at all; the combat and chardev make this game.  The choices I have been presented with do not seem very significant or have had much of an impact on the story (it seems).  Combat is 10/10.  Chardev is 10/10 but would be nice if I could have created my own party. Some really interesting battles.  The dwarf is pretty entertaining.  I would say this game is a must for fans of JA, X-Com, or RoA series.			"

												This is a good game.  For those, who don't like it - you just don't understand the game mechanics.The best thing is, that almost all things in the games feels right. There is non of frustrating moments, that was created only for blockbuster effects. All seems to be suited within game story and logic. It's rare in moderns games.The battle system, voice acting, music, story and the atmosphere is also good. And the best part - the challenge. It's quite a conundrum at the normal level, and hard puzzle in hard. That's great!I liked this game.			"

												The Combat in Blackguards obviously carries this game through all its shortcomings. Each battle-map is different fom the last and has a unique feel to it. Customizing your characters in weapon skills and magic feels rewarding. The most fun comes from figuring how this game actually works, like when the points you just spent make a noticeable difference in the overall challenging battles. Don't expect too much offensive magic, you're better off keeping your mages in a support-role (where they ROCK hard). You probably heard about the interaction with stuff in battles, but that's totally overrated: Wasting a turn to push a box or set something ablaze is rarely worth it. Occasionally this is implemented quite nicely, like trapping something in a cage, but most of the time there's only boxes to push.I hear people drooling over how interesting the characters are, but honestly your party members are *completely* one-sided and sometimes downright dislikeable  (*minor spoiler* Zurburan selling Takate to some slaver...seriously? *spoiler end*). Their is no intruiging background story to them and definetly no progression in personality whatsoever. The story on the other hand is compelling, but since story-specific dialogue is only few and far in between the dominating combat, it's ultimately thin...very thin (if you know DBZ, you lnow what I'm talking about *lol*). The world itself feels a bit on the bland side and the streamlined gameplay leaves little room for Lore or in-depth consideration of your potentially stunning surroundings.The biggest issue here is how barebone the gameplay is. After a fight you basically point&-)click your mouse button a few times to advance the dialogue or move to the interchangeable towns to check on the completely interchangeable merchants and start the next fight. Combat-Dialogue-Click-Combat-Repeat. Kudos for the quest-writing though which I found top notch!So: Combat: AWESOME. The rest: *MEH*. I enjoyed it a lot, also because it is more fast-paced than some of its TBS-brethren.			"

												If you like Turn Based RPG this is a game for you, story is decent, fights are challenging, and the luck involved reminds me alot of playing table top games! The graphics are good, combat takes tought, and the game lets you do your own thing, build characters however you want, and have fun. That beind said, if you dont focus your characters then you'll find combat to be brutal and can become very frustrated, but I feel this is more a pro then a con, just giving a heads up.			"

												Great game!This is my 3-part review of the game. 1. The RPG system, 2. The actual roleplay, 3. The feel of the game. It is worth mentioning that I am a RPG guy with long experience in both Pen and Paper RPG (mostly PF, but also Vampire), and a lot of CRPG. So, naturally, this has an impact on how I liked or disliked the game.1. The roleplaying system The Black Eye is really nice and has a lot of depth and will be candy if you, like me, havent tried it before. I cannot accout for the differences between the pen and paper 4th edition (witch the game mechanic is derived from) and the system Blackguards has implemented. But as far as I am concerned its really nice. Different attributes combinate to give different base statistics - and control how well you fight / use talents / casts spells. There are no levels for characters, insted you gain Adventure Points from combats and finished quests that you either continually spend or save up to spend on more expensive upgrades. It really is a fun system and has similarity with the way Vampire the masquerade works. The turn based tactics is nothing but pure enjoyment!2. The actual roleplaying is somewhat linear. If you like that then no problem. If you want more choice, then it has shortcomings. Things are pretty much set up and you cannot deviate too much from the path. The choices you are given doesnt even have that much impact. For instance one side quest presents you with two identical twins, the one is evil and the other is good - but who is who. In the end, if you chose to root out the good guy OR the bad guy there is no impact on the game other than your own conciousness. (...and honestly, who cares abouth truth when it comes to a book worth 50 ducats?!)3. The acutal feel of the game is, at least to me, awsome. The characters you pick up are rather strange, a paranoid dwarf, a sleezy magician and later on a drug addict elf to name some. But this is what strangley keeps it interesting - actually highly enjoyable. Bugger off with the lawful good paladin that does good at every turn. Here its like ""plant unlawful poison at a highly esteemed noble to get him arrested"" or ""Get a new slavegirl / trophy for the master of the city"".To sum up, I really enjoy the game - (not finished yet as this is written) and I see a replay possibility with choosing differet abilities. If you enjoy RPGs and in particular the combat part - this is a game for you.			"

												A very challenging but interesting tatical RPG with puzzle like battle maps.  And by that I mean the battle map may be unbeatable if you don't figure out which enviornmental trap to use at what time and figuring out how to get the enemy to stand where that trap will be most effective.While the games tatical battles are quit enjoyable due to this puzzle aspect, at the same time can be frustrating because you can end up spending hours having to try and retry a map to only figure out that in addition to the puzzle you already solved but keep losing at you need to rebalance your attack/parry skill points on your weapon type for the fight in addition to solving the puzzle. Which brings me to the only thing I have come across so far in my play that I have disliked about the game, the combination between having no way to gather more xp since each map seems to be doable only once with the fact that there does not seem to be a way to respec where you allocated your xp. I don't mind that the game does not allow you to grind to over level stuff, infact I like that it prevents you from doing that, but it also means that if you spent all your xp in the wrong areas you can reach a point to where a battle becomes unbeatable because you have all the wrong skills win.  Maybe later in the story it allows you to realocate xp at the cost of gold or something, but currently where I am in the story I can see mismanagment of xp making the game unbeatable.With that said, despite this one major consern with the games mechanics dealing with xp I would say it is a very enjoyable though sometimes frustrating game. I would say play this game on normal difficulty and if you get stuck on a puzzle don't feel bad having to turn it down to ""easy"", because some battle maps are hard to complete even on easy unless you have the perfect build where no xp was spent in the wrong place. And as I say this game is definitly worth picking up might I just suggest that for a few of the puzzles do not sell your torches even if your close on weight limits because you will come across some puzzles that become 100x easier to solve with having more then just a mage to use fire damage.Edit: Also the soundtrack is pretty good, is it $20 of value good, eh, to most people no, but just putting it out there for those debating on picking up the regular edition or the one that comes with the soundtrack.

												Very nice tactical RPG. Characters reminicent of old school bioware characters and the combat is very thought-out. Each battle map is very different from the last in the way it impacts the battle, the developers seem to have spent a long time designing different terrain and objects that have effects. For example in one map there are fire braziers which you can have your characters knock over and they set large patches of oil on fire. In another there is a huge crate hanging from a crane which is operated by the enemy and it moves to block off your advance and knock your characters into the sea if they are in range.Overall if you are looking for an RPG with smart combat and a non-generic story, you could do no better then Blackguards.

All of the encounters are hand-designed, and they play like a tabletop campaign, with environmental effects being hugely important on many maps. The game is also huge - about 40 hours of content is a good estimate.			"

												Great hexed based rpg, I really enjoyed this game and would recommend this game to any rpg fan. I have read some of the reviews that were negative and I don't understand how people give this game a negative rating because they thought it was something different. That is their fault for assuming they knew what the game was. If you watched the trailer, it shows what exactly the game is, a hexed based rpg with strategy elements and has a story that has been done before a bunch of times. That being said I enjoyed the game very much and while the story wasn't groundbreaking the story kept my attention, kept me interested enough to see what was going to happen next and did have a few suprises. While the game can be cheap at times during combat, in no way is the combat broken or unfair, you just have to use your head a bit and have a strategy which I can understand might be hard for some people on here. Great game and you should be able to get it on sale but even at full price game is still worth playing.			"

												Beta: 7/10Launch: ?/10Played several hours of beta and had a great time. The combat is pretty standard turn based strategy with a hex grid. The early parts of the game were pretty combat focused. Some optional quests were pretty challenging. The main part of the game is character custimization, every character can learn anything you want. Now that it is fully released I plan to go back for a fresh playthrough. A nice feature I already noticed is the advanced character creation. You can choose between the standard warrior/archer/mage types or just make a unique character with anything you want.			"

												A great turn-based RPG without all of the random wandering fluff. Being based on The Dark Eye gives the rules a sense of deep development that you don't see in games that have invented their own ruleset. Pure classic tactical combat with enough character development and such to keep you playing well past when you should.			"

												Very enjoyable gameplay with a compelling story.  Couple of shortcomings:1. I did not connect with any of the characters, not enough depth2. Nothing evil about this game.  When I read that I was going to be the villian, I was exciting to be playing a different role.  However, I seem to spend all my time rescuing people and playing the hero... Maybe I don't understand what beinga  villian means3. Action Point system is flawed.  I can't tell a difference between the character I started with and the one I ended the game with.  To test it out I downloaded a trainer from {LINK REMOVED}www.cheathappens.com and added nearly a million action points, maxed out everything.  Was still not even able to one shot basic mobs If you are a fan of turn based RPGs, I say put this on your wish list and wait for the price to drop.			"

												I have purchase this game base out of curiosity and a fan to rpg. I have no idea of the Dark Eye stuff or the what I am going to expect. And right now, I simply enjoy it.I tried out the demo and it was quite decent and have good characters. Although when it comes to character creation I wish they add more option. The battle is simple to quite implex battle that could give a love or hate it with a scorn. It is quite the first time for me to decide and upgrade upon the talents, skills, magic and stuff.Another thing that I like was that you can equip any kind of weapon. Very nice to see that and so much possibilities to put for your character.Although I am bit perplex about the ending, I am quite enthralled with the game and was addicted to finish it.			"

												I like the game so far. I give it a B. Nice combat system. Nice stat system for upgrading characters. Loot system is ok, I personally would like more armor options. Character customization needs more options. THe story and voice acting are decent.However, the cutscene graphics are pretty bad - especially the backgrounds- not very pretty. The overall graphics are disappointing. Some light exploration would be nice as well. However, as a former AD&D player and RPG fanatic this game serves it's RPG fix in a satisfying way. Lastly, I'm playing the game on ""Easy"" and it's not difficult at all. I hear the difficulty curve is very steep.			"

												Not for the weak at heart, or those looking for an ARPG.This has got to be one of the hardest RPG's I have played since Pool of Radiance, and I'm tempted to place Blackguards higher in that category just because I know very little about The Dark Eye rules, or at least much less than D&D. And it is great because of it.Graphics are wonderful. They won't blow you away but are for the most part hand drawn and look phenominal. Musical score is excellent. (Really wish I had gotten the SE for the bonuses) The story seems well written, however I have not gotten very far to give a decent opinion about it.The combat may turn some people away as it can be very difficult at times (and since it relies on dice rolls it can be quite rage inducing) but if you show determination (there is no shame in saving and walking away for a bit, might save a monitor and keyboard or 2) the combat is extremely rewarding.If you like The Dark Eye world, or am just a fan of strategey based RPG's, take a long look at this game. Just don't forget to spend time reading details about every skill and stat before you use your AP (like XP) on them, because it can be really easy to screw up a build.			"

												I could not safely recommend this game to anyone, because I'm not sure who it appeals to, and this is why:1.  It's certainly not for rpg gamers because at its core, Blackguards is nothing more than a series of battles, one after the other, with the 'choice' being where you're going to fight next and a brief respite in 'towns' that are no more than venues to heal and restock between fights.2.  Strategy gamers will find the combat tacky and repetitive because it always comes down to enemies trying to overwhelm you with odds with very simplistic AI.3.  It can't possibly appeal to people looking for a great story because the story is clearly an afterthought.  You get brief looks into your characters pasts between drawn out combat sessions but there's no real development.  Things just happen and force you into the next fight.So really, who was this game made for?			"

												RNG is godawful. There is no way to properly strategize, because you can miss a 90% chance to hit 3 times in row. It's all luck and restarting a battle hoping the next time it all works out better. I finally gave up on this game when, in the second chapter, after a long, long series of battles, I had finally defeated the boss and only had to kill off the trash mobs when a gamebreaking bug made me unable to move or act with one of my characters. I couldn't even have him wait or end his turn.Even if you got this game for free, don't waste your time.			"

												Stale and unappealing, but it's close. If I could give a thumbs-sideways, I would.Actual battles can be enjoyable, offering challenge and rewarding strategy. Too often, though, the challenge is presented unfairly, in a way the player can't possibly avoid; taking away your party's gear or positioning your party disadvantageously at the start of a fight are examples.Character building has interesting elements, the way stats and abilities interact and a slider for individual weapons to favor chance to hit or block/parry.But Blackguards as a whole is disappointing.

												I really enjoyed Blackguards. For the same reason I enjoyed other old school CRPGs. It had enough of a story to keep it interesting, the combat was challenging and very tactical, and the character/skill/spell system was deep and interesting. If you like old school CRPGs, I highly recommend this game.What does old school CRPG mean?Graphics - while good for a CRPG are nowhere near cutting edge. If you must play something to justify your $1000 dual video card setup, this game is not it..Sound - voice overs a generally very high quality and clearly done by professionalsCombat - this and the skill system are the meat of any CRPG. Combat is very tactical which makes it fun for me. Anything on the field of combat can be pushed over, destroyed, lit on fire, etc. So for example you can lure your opponents to stand in bushes and cast a fireball on them and not only will they take the initial damage they will take per round damage when the bushes catch fire. Lots and lots of tactical depth and different options make combat fun and at times quite challenging.Character/Skill/Spell System - the other key part of any CRPG. I like The Dark Age system and this game uses that system to create a very deep and interesting set of skills, spells, and attributes to choose from to build your main character and your party of NPCs.Party-based - Old school CRPGs are almost always party-based and this game checks that box with 5 NPCs that join (and in most cases stay) with your group throughout the game. You'll play most of the game with you PC and 3 NPCs.LInear - all good old school CRPGs are linear so they can control the level of opponent you face and unfold the story in a particular way. Books and movies and are linear too and that's what makes them good. I like old school CRPGs to be linear and tell a story and create custome encounters (rather than random ones). Don't get me wrong, I like games like Skyrim, but I generally prefer old school linear CRPGs as the rule and open games like Skyrim as the exception.Story - good enough to keep it interesting.....If you like old school CRPGs don't miss this one.

Invetory system feels very dated and cumbersome, but it gets the job done, compared to other RPGs though its a little annoying.  Despite a few minor flaws I'm enjoying myself playing this and am glad I bought it on sale.

												Blackguards has issues. As an avid fan of turn based games, this is severely lacking. Inconsistency is the biggest flaw. The game is seemingly okay for the first few battles however soon after, it quickly becomes a reload and try again, 12-20 times. Go to a prior save, make adjustments and try again. Too often, for instance, my mage character with 80% and above chance to heal fails, too often failure to use the environment will make a battle impossible. Too often your characters will miss leaving foes drooling at another chance to make you reload.I had high hopes for the game. The menus are not great, the story is rather drab, but it only felt horrible when every map because a reload the game fest. If you're looking for turn based... I HIGHLY suggest looking elsewhere.

												Its not a bad game and I do appreciate a developer bringing turn based fantasy RPG's back to the market. However, it just feels like it fell short of its potential. Not to knit pick but starting with the lack of facial customizations. I know its not a big deal but in my opinion, it starts the game off on the wrong foot and goes on from there.there is really no exploration, its extremely linear and predictable as far as the encounters go. The rules of turn based combat are also not the greatest and are very vanilla. No attack from behind bonuses that I could see so you can retreat and not worry about taking a blade to the back if you were standing in a hex next to an enemy.My biggest frustration was in upgrading my gear. Theres RNG involved for what you can loot from battles, so dont count on picking up that axe that this guy just done done whacking at you with for the past 10 minutes.  It just vaporizes apparently leaving you with your trusty ol' starter torch. Weapons and armor cost a lot of money and while you may be able to gear your guy up with a basic sword after the first half dozen encounters, that will be it for quite a while until you can afford more. Meanwhile, wave after wave of baddies wielding swords, shields, axes, armor, bows and arrows will make sure you pull your hair out before you can afford to gear your party adequately enough to fight them.

												Let me just say off the bat, I'm a huge fan of turn-based rpg's/strategy rpg's. I'm a long-time player of the Heroes of Might and Magic games as well as the King's Bounty games. Now, I'm not saying that these games are the same, they aren't, but they should at least have prepared me for Blackguards. I felt at home in the first few fights, and had a great time leveling and progressing. But, and this is a big but (tee hee), things soon fell apart, and I could not be more disappointed. Here is the list:1) Difficulty Spikes - Elitist players can go on and on about how 'you aren't playing the game right', but this game is fundamentally flawed; with *five pages* of things to use your AP points (think leveling points) on, it becomes *incredibly* easy to spec your character incorrectly, thereby completely and utterly breaking your game, forcing you to start over. Not to mention the fact that the first handful of fights are pretty easy, then suddenly the game shoots up in difficulty. A game like this should have the ability to respec your characters, or to at *least* give you more of a guide on what you should be spending your points on; it's WAY too easy to make a mistake if you're not familiar with the system the game is based on.2) The Fighting - The basics of the battle system seem quite good; all of the things are there to make them an enjoyable experience, however... The sheer amount of missing, dodging, and obviously AI-weighted dice rolls makes this game ridiculous. People can say what they will about ""99% chance to hit still isn't 100%"", but there are clear patterns of AI-rubber banding/favoritism, making the game *incredibly* frustrating, and fights lasting WAY longer than they should.3) Spellcasting - Never have I played a game where spells fail so. bloody. often. What is the point of playing a mage? Their spells fizzle so incredibly often, and they take so much damage that you're pretty much forced to use bows or crossbows to keep them alive, and, as another reviewer mentioned, the only point in having them around is to heal/buff/debuff. Incredibly disappointing.4) Poor Battle Structuring - I probably should have put this onto the fighting or difficulty section, but I felt it merited it's own section. There are times where you're in a tough battle, but you manage to scrape by by the skin of your teeth, and you're elated. Bask in your rewards! All those AP and Go...wait what? There's ANOTHER battle IMMEDIATELY after? And you don't get a chance to heal? What? You're out of Mana??? Guess that means you're going to have to start the first battle all over again! What's that? There's no potions left? Etc, etc etc. There *needs* to be a way of either warning you of multiple fights in a row(some places like the Gladiator Arena does), or at *least* give you the chance to heal between battles. I'm currently at said gladiator arena and have basically given up on the game and wish I hadn't spent my time and money on it.This game could have been SO much better; the story is interesting enough to keep you going, and the visuals are quite nice, (and DWARVES!) but the poor battle structure, difficulty spikes, flawed dice rolling (Seriously, a weak 'normal' monster dodged me literally 11 times in a row from all four characters..?), and unfortunate leveling flow choices make this a ""do not buy unless changes are made"". If things are tweaked, this could be a fairly good game, but at it's current state it's nothing more than a frustrating game of blindfolded tennis, (Whiff, whiff, whiff, whiff) and I regret spending money on it.

												Its a great game, with many flaws. Itll keep you entertained and its great at what it is, but the flaws make it worth much less that $40........pick it up on a 60% off sale or more and youll be happy with the investment.			"

												This game is based on a tabletop RPG called ""The Dark Eye"" which will likely be new to even most pencil and dice junkies out there.  It's a turn-based, hex-based, combat-oriented game that presents some of the most wickedly challenging combat scenarios I have had to face in a turn-based game.  The developers have made excellent use of the environment, using traps, environmental effects, hindering terrain, and interactive objects integral to most combats.  This, combined with a wide array of special abilities available through warrior training or spell effects, makes combat very dynamic and challenging.  It can also be very frustrating.  On the plus side, when you lose a tough battle, there is an option to replay the battle from the beginning of the battle, as well as from your last save, so you need not redo extensive amounts of replay to ""get to the good stuff.""There are four character generation options for this game, three basic with pre-builds of a melee warrior, a hunter archer, and a mage, and fourth option to custom build a character from scratch.  I have tried all four, but recommend trying building a character from scratch only after having tackled at least the first chapter of the game to get an idea of what the game is like.  I wanted to build an archer-mage, and found that it was easier (and you got better abilities) by starting as a straight mage and then investing experience points in archery talents and proficiencies to make up the difference.  The NPCs in the game are fun and all dialogue is voiced.  The dwarven NPC (your first ally) has some really good lines.  The story is VERY linear, literally a ""go here and do this"" with arrows pointing your next route, which is nice in some ways and very frustrating in others. You get advancement points for every fight and story event, and you get a lot of them.  They accumulate quickly, but you need a ton to advance a stat or skill.  Stats, talents, weapon talents, and spells all rank from 1 to 18, with varying costs from 6 to over 480 to advance to the next level.   Experience comes in multiples of 25, depending on encounter difficulty, with more coming in the later stages of the game. Still, your Special Abilities are what makes your character be able to do extraordinary things like being able to regenerate Astral Points (mana) or Knockdown an opponent in combat.  These are relatively cheap to buy, at around 300 Advancement Points, but Special Abilities often have stat and weapon talent prerequisites that in turn cost advancement points to purchase, which all adds up to more advancement points....  I could not imagine playing ""The Dark Eye"" without a computer to aid me, especially as your Attack Value, Parry Value, Dodge Value, and Ranged Attack Value are all based on three stats added together and divided by five.  And that every roll in the game is a test against three ability scores.  All of this is handled by the computer and done very nicely in a battlelog that summarizes it in a percentage chance for you.  It can be a bit confusing when your 100% chance to hit misses, because evidently the computer rounds to the nearest %(?) but that's a quibble.  In all this is an exceptionally fun game.  I keep telling myself I am tired of getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by the game and will quit THIS TIME for sure, but in minutes I am back to beat the fight that got me.  It's so linear you can hear the train whistle when you play.  You will have your butt kicked routinely.  But if you like challenging turn-based combat and designing your own characters, you will likely love this game.			"

												Before you read the review:1. Ignore Daedalic fanboys who praise and defend their every game with religious zeal.2. This is not a good game, not worth 40€ at all.3. Since I was a little boy, I have played A LOT of turn-based games (from Jagged Alliance, Silent Storm, Heores, Disciples, Age of Wonders to the newer titles like Frozen Synapse, Xcom, Expeditions Conquistadors and more) and they are probably my favourite genre.Oh boy, where to start? On paper this game looks fantastic and fools you into thinking that you are in for a exciting experience. You are not. Every aspect of this game is lackadaisical, poorly executed and underdeveloped. Let's take a look at each component of Blackguards:Character creation:You create your character from three available classes: warrior, ranger and mage. However, classes don't determine anything as you can specialise in anything you want. I choose to be a dual-wielding fighter who helps with buffs and some offensive spells. I quickly abandoned that idea, because the game heavily favors archers and maybe heavy-hitting warriors. Not really adequate for an RPG, is it? The battles became impossible and I was literally forced to respec and become an archer. Also, certain skills are a must, other are a bust.The world:On your quest you travel across the land, visit different cities. Each city/town is represented by an image on which points of intrests are clickable (tavern, blacksmith, healer). Those town screens are pretty but mostly unremarkable and you only visit them on some of many, MANY fetch quests. In fact, everything in this game is point and click (like in adventure games), which creates a very static feel.The universe itself will be familiar to players that have played other Daedalic games (Chains of Satinav, Memoria etc) - the Dark Eye universe. As with many other games by this developer, there are references to the their previous entries here and there and you may encounter characters that appeared somewhere else (ie a certain NPC from Chains of Satinav can be found in Blackguards). It's definitely a nice touch.Your party:Before the game was released, there was a lot of hype concering your party - a bunch of outlaws and criminals. Ugh, not really. Playing Baldur's Gate 2 and taking Viconia, Edwin and Korgan is waaaay more badass. You never get the feeling that they are really on the run, criminals with disgusting past. No, nothing like that. Half of your party (which is fixed, you can't choose between a bunch of characters) is bland (main character included), the other half is fleshed out, but not spectacular.Dialogues:The dialogues in Blackguards serve one purpose only - to push the story forward (or give you fetch quests). As a player, you just click every option of the dialogue (not a lot of them) and very rarely can choose between different answers. Voice acting is hit or miss. Dialogues are done through the dialogue boxes and again, they feel extremely static.Story:As for the story, it is indeed intriguing. Side quests are a grind - you just run errands and they always end up with a fight. Main story is what drives you forward. The ending may be a bit underwhelming but I won't spoil anything.Items, loot:Forget it. Basic weapons and every once in a while their magical variations, which are still unremarkable and differ only slightly from the ordinary equipment. Combat:Ah, Blackguards is supposed to feature a deep, dynamic turn-based combat. Well, I can tell you it is turn-based. It's nowhere near 'deep' nor 'dynamic'. Out of advertised 40 abilities I used maybe 5 throughout the entire game. Out of 90 spells (wait, what? where?) I used 10 at best. The combat just fails to be exciting or rewarding, despite the environment interaction which becomes repetitive and not worth the trouble. The saving grace here is that each battlefield is special - you will not find two the same, reused battlemaps and that's a treat. The challenge (beware of sudden and unexpected difficulty spikes) comes not from tough opponents but from a vast array of cheap shots and irritating design choices the developers throw at you when it's time to ramp up the difficulty. Examples: you fight a giant lily and a wood troll. Giant lily takes control over your character and draws him into the water where several tentacles (they come out of nowhere) rip him to shreds in a matter of few turns. Now, giant lily grows in the water - if you want to approach it with you fighters and beat it to death, forget it. The tetnacles will block your way and pound you. So you figure to stay on land, as it's a viable option to defeat the lily. You use your archers (did I tell you the game favors archers?) and have 60% to hit the lily. Out of 16 shot, 4 connected. I counted. Some of the hits do no damage (don't know why, it's random). Magic should work, but usually does no or very little damage. Sounds fun? Well, don' forget about the wood troll knocking your guys down every turn. Yay.Another example. You have to hold on and kill 27 zombies that just keep spawning. You try to hit a zombie, have 75% chance to hit and surprise, surprise you miss 4 of your 5 blows (then you read 'Zombie dodges the shot masterly'). Then you hit the damn thing with magical short swords and do 3 damage. Zombie retailiates and does 14 damage with his bare hands. Logic anyone? Whatever. Bottom line is - combat is rarely interesting, mostly infuriating and frustraing. And this is supposed to be the main point of the game... Ah yes, there are also stealth maps, but they are flat out awkward.Graphics:The town screens are indeed a joy to look and the world map is arfully drawn. Other than that, the graphics is mediocre and so are the animations. Whan characters speak their jaws are flapping unnatrually, but you won't see that other than in cutscenes.Music:Ah, yes. Apart from the story, the only strong point of Blackguards. The music always accompany you and creates a curious mood as you progress through the story. It's always in the background, never imposes itself, and yet you remember the motifs and find yourself humming the melodies.Immersion:Unfortuantely, I was never immersed. I blame the overall static feel of the game, the point and click nature of it. There is no fluidity, as the game is chopped by frequent loading screens as you jump between towns. The lack of environments to explore (I'm not expecting Skyrim here, just your ordinary Icewind Dale locations), lack of movement is what absolutely kills this game. Maybe it would be salvagable if the conversations where meaty and interesting, but the interactions between characters are limited to few lines.Bottom line:Do not buy this game unless you are absolutely desperate for a turn-based combat game set in a fantasy world. It's annoying and frustrating. Tell you what. Save your money and buy Divinity Original Sin instead. Or go play Jagged Alliance. Blackguards is a waste of your time and money.Score: 2/10PS.Man, this game was bad!PS 2.Before purchase, try the demo out.Peace.			"

												Game is funny , but short , not much customisation but have good story. Far too much fighting and it's easy when you know what to do. Yet have something which made me rush to finish ;) It is like a good movie , but longer. Was hoping for more but 35 hours and game finished :) Characters in game are awsome especially my beloved Dwarf ;) almost like  from pen and paper games ;)Music sometimes is annoying , few to loud sound effects of few spells but higly recomend game.Do not play anything else then expert mode it is easy to read all descriptions. Last fight is difficult so prepare for it do not let somones down in first faze as it will not be present in 2nd.ALSO IMPORTANT : do not  use magical dmg weapons  only as in few quest you have to have only normal damage.

												man seems to me alot of these reviews are harsh on this game. i have played many tactical strategy games over the years and this is a pretty good one in all parts.  I think the thing most people have a hard time with in this one is the dificulty of the game and them not really explaining on how attacks work. like in the percent chance to hit someone.  but if you do a little research you can figure out how to make it easy. like all spells have three attributes allocated to them. so if you want to cast a spell that has agi, cha, const then you would want all 3 of those stats to be high. the higher they are and the higher the spell lvl is the better chance you have to hitting someone with them.for rng and mele you want have the stat to be high to hit. for range its dex for mele its str. think there are also others that help. then you need the weapon you are using good also. plus therre is also a slider on the weapon. that lets you decide if you want to defend or attack better. so if you are on defend on the item you wont hit as often or as hard. so set it to attack.all in all i think this is a decent game worth a shot. at least on the demo for anyone who has an interest in tactical strategy rpgs.  i got it on sale and im not disapointed at all. also the difficulty can be a little harsh you will not win a battle the first time everytime. but im not one for easy games i loved temple of elemental evil and others that are harsh.

												It's a good game in general,Positives:1) Long Playtime; I got around 40 hours out of my first playthrough, got half the achievments2) Story and Characters are good, interesting and likeable3) Voice Actors and Music are both great4) Complexity of Character Building and Fighting is something I hope for in most RPG's and I got it in this one, lots of stats to invest points in and to costumize your characters5) Sometimes the dice won't roll your way, sometimes they do, it's as close to a D&D experience in a modern Video Game you will ever getNegatives:1) Loading times when you enter a city, or go through areas in a city are attrocious and can get really on your nerves when your try to check NPC's for side quests2) Unbalanced Encounters, Not that big of a deal but sometimes you can get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked out of the blue which can be frustrating3) Encounters that don't tell you what the goal is4) Slow Battle System, the more enemies there are the longer it takes for everyone to finish their turn which can♥♥♥♥♥♥me off5) Lame EndingTips for Beginners:1) Choose Hunter as your MC; You won't get one for 80% of the game2) Sword and Shield sucks, Spears are great and so are 2 one-handed Weapons3) Always carry a blunt weapon with your chars to switch to when you encounter UNDEAD enemies, they are immune to piercing dmg4) Train Perception high with your quickest Character(With highest initiative, mine is Takate) and use it at the begin of every fight to check for traps5) Spells to lvl for your Mage: Haste to lvl 13 and cast it on your best fighters, it rly helps and is srsly good; Also I like Fireball @lvl 3 and the AOE Spell the 2nd Mage gets can be rly great coz it knocks down enemies.6) Try to push ""Astral Energy Regeneration"" as soon as you can, helps out alot too.

												A decent core game completely undermined by the worst RNG I have ever seen. Even with a 80-90% chance to hit, you will miss consistantly and your spells will fizzle. Whatever strategy might have been is soon undone, as all encounters are eventually reduced to a group of units all clustered in one part of the map, swinging and missing each other.			"

												Blackguards has issues. As an avid fan of turn based games, this is severely lacking. Inconsistency is the biggest flaw. The game is seemingly okay for the first few battles however soon after, it quickly becomes a reload and try again, 12-20 times. Go to a prior save, make adjustments and try again. Too often, for instance, my mage character with 80% and above chance to heal fails, too often failure to use the environment will make a battle impossible. Too often your characters will miss leaving foes drooling at another chance to make you reload.I had high hopes for the game. The menus are not great, the story is rather drab, but it only felt horrible when every map because a reload the game fest. If you're looking for turn based... I HIGHLY suggest looking elsewhere.

												Altough not being your tipical RPG, Blackguard is very interesting and fun to play game. A gameplay is a mix of genres and playstyles which remind me of Heroes of Might and Magic series, Dungeons and Dragons pen and paper and good old RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. All in all it holds a nice niche and a nice RPG refreshment for many fun hours.			"

												Daedalic's first attempt in the RPG genre is a solid one. An experienced software house, mostly famous for their many graphic adventures, managed to bring us a game which delivers a grand amount of turn-based tactical rpg goodness, focusing on combat, even if it doesn't shine in terms of storytelling and pure roleplaying. What is mainly fine with the game is the fact that it never gets boring, since every battle is different, well thought and characterized, other than being intelligent for example making the battlefield often interactive with the party characters skills: a mix of variety and possibilities with a functional adaptation of the TDE combat system. Personally enjoyed all over the long duration of the campaign, planning and battling with satisfaction on a game that needs attention and ability over situations thankfully non-easy nor banal. Dealing with improvements on the less considered sides of this role-playing game, like story, characters history or C&C, would make a perfect sequel for an already substantial and well-directed game.

The NPCs in the game are fun and all dialogue is voiced.  The dwarven NPC (your first ally) has some really good lines.  The story is VERY linear, literally a ""go here and do this"" with arrows pointing your next route, which is nice in some ways and very frustrating in others. You get advancement points for every fight and story event, and you get a lot of them.  They accumulate quickly, but you need a ton to advance a stat or skill.  Stats, talents, weapon talents, and spells all rank from 1 to 18, with varying costs from 6 to over 480 to advance to the next level.   Experience comes in multiples of 25, depending on encounter difficulty, with more coming in the later stages of the game. Still, your Special Abilities are what makes your character be able to do extraordinary things like being able to regenerate Astral Points (mana) or Knockdown an opponent in combat.  These are relatively cheap to buy, at around 300 Advancement Points, but Special Abilities often have stat and weapon talent prerequisites that in turn cost advancement points to purchase, which all adds up to more advancement points....  I could not imagine playing ""The Dark Eye"" without a computer to aid me, especially as your Attack Value, Parry Value, Dodge Value, and Ranged Attack Value are all based on three stats added together and divided by five.  And that every roll in the game is a test against three ability scores.  All of this is handled by the computer and done very nicely in a battlelog that summarizes it in a percentage chance for you.  It can be a bit confusing when your 100% chance to hit misses, because evidently the computer rounds to the nearest %(?) but that's a quibble.  In all this is an exceptionally fun game.  I keep telling myself I am tired of getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by the game and will quit THIS TIME for sure, but in minutes I am back to beat the fight that got me.  It's so linear you can hear the train whistle when you play.  You will have your butt kicked routinely.  But if you like challenging turn-based combat and designing your own characters, you will likely love this game.			"

												I am not sure why this is getting so many negative reviews. I have played a pretty good amount of this game so far. Is it the best? No. However it is not bad by any means.If you like turn based RPGs then this game is great. People REALLY should research games before they buy them. The game has a little bit of a steep learning curve but if you are even a semi-decent gamer and are familiar with TBS games then that should not be a problem at all.Personally I am REALLY REALLY sick of all the games nowdays hand holding you and making things so simple. What some say about the leveling and skills/stat points is true however. There is really not alot of explaination about how to do this. Trial and error is all you have. I ended up starting the game over a few times before I really started to figure out how to do it properly.The story is not the greatest and neither is the gameplay or graphics. However I have had alot of fun with this game. I like the darker story. I like that your crew is not a bunch of goody goody types. The movement and cities are pretty bland but that is ok beacuse the fights are alot of fun IMO. The enviornmental parts of the battles are very cool. I like that you have to open cells to create a distraction and get away from the guards. It was way cool that I had to lead the troll into some flammable gas and then shoot him with a fireball to do a ton of damage. Cutting the rope and dropping a chandelier on some  guards was pretty damn cool. There is alot to like in this game if you can get around the mediocre graphics and horrid voice acting!If you are looking for a AAA super polished graphical game this is not for you. If you like a decent story, dont really care about graphics, and you like TBS RPGs then this is for you!Overall this is a pretty good game. There are not alot of TBS RPGs out there to pick from and if your a big fan of that genre then you will like this game.Divinity: Original Sin is a better choice IMO but that is still in Alpha and has ALOT of bugs. I bought both of them and I really enjoy them both.Again this is not the prettiest game. The voice acting and cut scenes are ATROCIOUS!!!!! But who cares as long as the combat and RPG elements are good.Graphics: 5/10Sound: 5/10Story: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall: 6/10Like I said its not the greatest game out there. But in this genre there is really not much to choose from. TBS RPGs are probably my favorite type of game and this game does an above average job.Buy it if you are like me and really jonesing for a TBS RPG!			"

												Bought this for the Classic RPG Flavour,  after finishing the main quest and buying the DLC I am left with nothing ...I feel an emotional void, with some hints of vague anger,  but to be honest,  I can't even get worked up enough about the game to articulate that anger,it is a bland dull lifeless trawl through the mire of cut scenes and surviving waves of peasants with pitchforks and a purple hued aura of ""I'll oneshot your party cuz I'm all evil and Purple!""  .. did I mention ?  Purple is the colour of evul and it makes minoins super badass.that said,  if you optimise your characters  (and I mean REALLY get into the math and the 500 page book of rules from the boardgame .. if ur into that shizzle for a PC game ... then you may actually kill some ... oh no,  wait .. RNG will just make you fail anyways...in short  TL;DR  .... save yourself from losing some hours that you will never get back.wait for divinity or Wasteland 2and for gods sake do not buy the DLC ... it's a few missions they cut out the original game that you actually cannot access once you complete the main quest line ...  Don't ask me how THAT works !			"

												Blackguards is a hexagonal turn based strategy game with some fun elements to it. The story line is fairly interesting, with many offshoots in the plot to keep you entertained.The graphics are nice and clean and the voice acting surprisingly good, with many humorous lines from the characters as they play off of one another during your adventures together. The learning curve isn't too harsh and the tutorial helps a lot during the start.However it can at times be a little punishing and you will find yourself hitting the restart button on quite a few occasions, especially any levels involving poison, to which there seems to be many. In my opinion the mechanic is used maybe a little too much throughout the game and the effects can start to become a little irritating, so spec to counter this when you get a chance. There are a few bugs, but nothing I would consider to be game breaking, so all in all Blackguards is worth the buy, but I would recommend waiting for it to be on sale and avoid the full price. I picked this up discounted and am more than satisfied with what I got for the money.			"

												This game is such a tight experience.  Combat is refreshingly good, and it offers a healthy amount of customization for your characters, with multiple viable builds.  The story is sufficient to get you to keep moving, but it's no Planescape: Torment (which is fine by me).  With all of the other RPGs on the horizon and in Early Access, I took a bit of a flyer on this one, and I'm really glad I did.  I don't know who these devs are or where they came from, but they have created a really good game here.			"

												The game is about combat but the combat sucks so dont bother!The worst are the mages, they dont regenerate mana after battles and they make too many mistakes which means that too often they cast nothing. which ruins your tactics completely. Its slow, sluggish and unsatisfying. The loot that you get is 90% useless and there arent many sets of armors. I felt cheated way more often than rewarded in this game mostly because of the mages. I dont like to be frustrated so i didnt like this game..			"

												I decided to give this game a go and said to myself ""I'm gonna finish this one""...oh, how I was wrong. The world is interesting, but it gets lost when you fight very samey enemies all the time. Story could be interesting if characters wouldn't change their motivation every now and then, yet they keep being predictable. Also the world is very limited to a 1-3 screens per town.Battles could be fun - the system has some neat ideas, enviroment has traps and cool strategic placements, but you very rarely get to use that, since you have to attack or you get surrounded and can't move. But the major flaw is that the game FEELS UNFAIR all the time (even when maybe it is not really). Instead of making battles interesting, the game more than once takes your whole inventory and offers you bad equipment in exchange, then you have to battle and find out that enemies in that arena are better equipped than you.Attack chances are random at best  (a number like 90% chance don't mean anything in this game). Damage you inflict is always small unless your character has fully invested in one weapon skill (which I had to change for one character because it had the same setup as my main character and then spent many hours inflicting 3x less damage than the enemies). The whole unfairness also applies to experience point requirements - some skills seem very out of reach (I can see the options ahead, but what I can actually afford/choose is 1-2 options and get stuck with that for hours). ""Special"" attacks make very little difference most of the time and are in no way interesting. "

												I enjoyed Blackguards. The gameplay is fantastic and the level design is great. Unlike most of the RPG I played, this game is brutal*: the heroes are either undernumbered or weak compared to the enemies and you have to take advantage of the environment in order to win. On top of that, my mage, the squishy guy with low initiative was always in the wrong spot at the start of the fight. On the other hand, some fights (only a few tho) were simply bad designed: in one of them I had to fight a mage and a tank with my mage and tank who's weapon was poisoned. They were way better than my guys and there was no trap, no object, no catch on that map. It took me about an hour to win and it was only possible with the help of the RNG gods. I did not like the story. The ""RPG"" aspect is ok. There are a few weapon categories with unique features and access to a number of skills, but there are only a few weapons in each category**. My main character used a spear, but later on the spears look more like strange polearms. I wanted to see a partisan spear as endgame weapon, instead of a mace with a spike mounted on a big stick. The spells are interesting. I like how they gain a new effect when you level them. The character development*** is similar to NWN / Drakensang. However, due to the low numbers of characters in the party some characters need to go hybrid and fill multiple slots. They ask 40euro for it. Well, that is too much - 20euro is more like a fair price for this game.* I have only played on the hard difficulty; don't know about the others;** I don't count this as a ""con"";*** attributes and how they influence the gameplay			"

												Not for the weak at heart, or those looking for an ARPG.This has got to be one of the hardest RPG's I have played since Pool of Radiance, and I'm tempted to place Blackguards higher in that category just because I know very little about The Dark Eye rules, or at least much less than D&D. And it is great because of it.Graphics are wonderful. They won't blow you away but are for the most part hand drawn and look phenominal. Musical score is excellent. (Really wish I had gotten the SE for the bonuses) The story seems well written, however I have not gotten very far to give a decent opinion about it.The combat may turn some people away as it can be very difficult at times (and since it relies on dice rolls it can be quite rage inducing) but if you show determination (there is no shame in saving and walking away for a bit, might save a monitor and keyboard or 2) the combat is extremely rewarding.If you like The Dark Eye world, or am just a fan of strategey based RPG's, take a long look at this game. Just don't forget to spend time reading details about every skill and stat before you use your AP (like XP) on them, because it can be really easy to screw up a build.			"

												Its not a bad game and I do appreciate a developer bringing turn based fantasy RPG's back to the market. However, it just feels like it fell short of its potential. Not to knit pick but starting with the lack of facial customizations. I know its not a big deal but in my opinion, it starts the game off on the wrong foot and goes on from there.there is really no exploration, its extremely linear and predictable as far as the encounters go. The rules of turn based combat are also not the greatest and are very vanilla. No attack from behind bonuses that I could see so you can retreat and not worry about taking a blade to the back if you were standing in a hex next to an enemy.My biggest frustration was in upgrading my gear. Theres RNG involved for what you can loot from battles, so dont count on picking up that axe that this guy just done done whacking at you with for the past 10 minutes.  It just vaporizes apparently leaving you with your trusty ol' starter torch. Weapons and armor cost a lot of money and while you may be able to gear your guy up with a basic sword after the first half dozen encounters, that will be it for quite a while until you can afford more. Meanwhile, wave after wave of baddies wielding swords, shields, axes, armor, bows and arrows will make sure you pull your hair out before you can afford to gear your party adequately enough to fight them.

												RNG is godawful. There is no way to properly strategize, because you can miss a 90% chance to hit 3 times in row. It's all luck and restarting a battle hoping the next time it all works out better. I finally gave up on this game when, in the second chapter, after a long, long series of battles, I had finally defeated the boss and only had to kill off the trash mobs when a gamebreaking bug made me unable to move or act with one of my characters. I couldn't even have him wait or end his turn.Even if you got this game for free, don't waste your time.			"

												Stale and unappealing, but it's close. If I could give a thumbs-sideways, I would.Actual battles can be enjoyable, offering challenge and rewarding strategy. Too often, though, the challenge is presented unfairly, in a way the player can't possibly avoid; taking away your party's gear or positioning your party disadvantageously at the start of a fight are examples.Character building has interesting elements, the way stats and abilities interact and a slider for individual weapons to favor chance to hit or block/parry.But Blackguards as a whole is disappointing.

												I really enjoyed Blackguards. For the same reason I enjoyed other old school CRPGs. It had enough of a story to keep it interesting, the combat was challenging and very tactical, and the character/skill/spell system was deep and interesting. If you like old school CRPGs, I highly recommend this game.What does old school CRPG mean?Graphics - while good for a CRPG are nowhere near cutting edge. If you must play something to justify your $1000 dual video card setup, this game is not it..Sound - voice overs a generally very high quality and clearly done by professionalsCombat - this and the skill system are the meat of any CRPG. Combat is very tactical which makes it fun for me. Anything on the field of combat can be pushed over, destroyed, lit on fire, etc. So for example you can lure your opponents to stand in bushes and cast a fireball on them and not only will they take the initial damage they will take per round damage when the bushes catch fire. Lots and lots of tactical depth and different options make combat fun and at times quite challenging.Character/Skill/Spell System - the other key part of any CRPG. I like The Dark Age system and this game uses that system to create a very deep and interesting set of skills, spells, and attributes to choose from to build your main character and your party of NPCs.Party-based - Old school CRPGs are almost always party-based and this game checks that box with 5 NPCs that join (and in most cases stay) with your group throughout the game. You'll play most of the game with you PC and 3 NPCs.LInear - all good old school CRPGs are linear so they can control the level of opponent you face and unfold the story in a particular way. Books and movies and are linear too and that's what makes them good. I like old school CRPGs to be linear and tell a story and create custome encounters (rather than random ones). Don't get me wrong, I like games like Skyrim, but I generally prefer old school linear CRPGs as the rule and open games like Skyrim as the exception.Story - good enough to keep it interesting.....If you like old school CRPGs don't miss this one.

												It could be a really nice game but it's plagued with bugs. Unfortunately it's the kind of game that will irritate you to a point where you just don't want to play it anymore - and it's not because of it's difficulty level, which is really nice. Two big issues here are the constant game freezes and bad math for hit calculations. 100% chance to hit? Sorry, you've missed three times in a row!  These kind of things happen all the time in this game. I don't mind having crappy chance to hit in the beginning, as long as I'm correctly informed about it. About game freezes, it appears that enemy spellcasters tend to try to take some action that they're not allowed to in their turn, hence not finishing it so battle moves on. I've faced TWO spellcasters and both times I had to reload a LOT, because the aforementioned problem happened like 80% of the times. There's no screen rotation on battles. The official excuse is that ""it's because of the way the levels are built"". C'mon, guys... This game's visuals are not that intricate, some rotating functions would help a LOT, specially when scenarios have so many ""dead spots"" where you can't properly see enemies. I think that Blackguards developers might actually be talented and competent, however this is not a good job. As a turn-based strategy fan, I've played many smaller games that were much more satisfying and polished.			"

Super satisfying tactical combat, but a little short of brilliantThe meat of this game is developing your characters and engaging in challenging tactical combat. I played on hard difficulty and it was no joke. You know you have a winner when your first time through a fight feels like a hopeless battle you can’t possibly win, but coming back for another try (or 5) you start to see a path and sure enough you snatch victory from the claws of your enemies. I found myself saying a lot of “No no no!! and Yes yes yes!!” and that is a good sign indeed.A decent system for equipment and hard choices to make for what kind of characters to develop and when make for pretty reasonable strategic choices between fights. I never quite felt like re-starting to make different choices but I switched focus and direction a few times as I learned what worked and what didn’t. Better yet, different fights call for very different approaches and play to the strengths and weaknesses of your character.

There are minor choices to be made here and there but rarely do they feel all that impactful and while the order you do quests is often open, there is rarely a feeling it matters all that much either.The game is worth the money, especially if you love tactical combat and like a stiff challenge.

												This game is one of the best squad turnbased rpg's i've played, you can customize the weapons and armor on all your squad members, level up and distribute points. Blackgaurds is very fun and very challenging, great graphics, backgrounds, animations and story, and it is a long game with alot of sidequests.  9/10			"

												I liked the idea behind the story of Blackguards; there aren't enough games out there with 'evil' characters, however this game had a really slow story with frustrating blockages from not being as overpowered as the game expects and no way to 'grind' up the levels.  The middle section of the game was probably the most interesting with its non-linear gameplay, but a slow and boring 8hr lead-up and a slow and boring 4hr let-down of an ending accompanied by its repetitive and repetitive and repetitive fights in between.  The only thing keeping me going was the vague hope that it would get better, or stay as good as the 3rd out of 5th chapter.  Only worth playing if you are *really really* into repetivie turn-based combat			"

												I think that this game can best be compared to playing chess.  Chess is often a slow game and to play it you have to think.  Sometimes you have to put several minutes of thought into a move before making it.  This game is like that but you have to put a fair amount of time and thought into almost EVERY move that you make.  When I was younger, I liked chess a great deal and I probably would have liked this game more.  But I havent played chess in years and find this game to be agonizingly slow to play.   The graphics are fairly decent, the voice acting is ok, the combat IA is pretty good but its just way too dang slow!  Im glad that I got it on sale for 3.99.  I may come back to it and play it some more on a rainy day sometime but probably not.  Actually, I havent played 2 hours yet.  I should just get a refund...PS: BTW, I put ""no"" for this game based on whether or not I would recomend it to myself.  Nope!  But folks who like turn based games should go for it.  They would probably enjoy it very much.			"

												I don't get it why its size is 17 GB, cause the graphics are far from sophisticated. And I don't get it why its price is so high, cause its gameplay is mediocre at best.There's one basic, huge condition that could ""make or break"" when it comes to turn-based combats: don't let the random factor be too important. That's the same hugely important condition this game failes completely to fulfill. It says 95% yet it feel like 50, and when it says 90%... well, you'd better skip it, you're screwed anyway. Using the ""try again"" button a couple of times after some lost battles proved nothing but the fact that random is all that matters. Only based on random I nearly won, I clearly won, or I badly lost the very same battles. Only based on randomness, and not on the decisions I made. And that's simply not Ok.			"

												Blackguards is an interesting concept with quite poor execution. The main problem is that it's built around an obscure role playing system that is both punishing and not fun. It's based on the Dark Eye role playing system in Germany. It's a fairly punishing system that gives too much power to the RNG and not enough to the player. What do I mean by that?It's just no fun having a 50/50 chance of casting a spell fail 6 or 7 times in a row and that costing you a battle. It's luck, not tactics or skill, that will get you through battles and luck doesn't make for a fun game. The ""tactics"" are minimal and your choices in leveling a character are severely restricted because if you don't take certain paths with certain classes you simply won't be able to proceed through the battles. This is the core problem with the game. It's like playing chess with an RNG. It simply defeats the purpose.The game wants you to play it one way. It discourages experimentation and creativity while demanding that you play it the ""right"" way with the ""right"" skill and classes or woe to the user. This isn't a strategy game but more of a puzzle and one that's not fun to piece together. Either you read a guide or you will be forced to start over at some point. That's just really poor design.As for the other aspects of the game, consider me unimpressed. The voice acting is truly horrible and the plotline is both forgettable and so dumb as to be insulting to the player. You can't rotate the camera and often enemies are obscured. The graphics are decent but nothing fantastic. The videos stutter and tend to happen too often. When it comes right down to it, there's really nothing redeeming about Blackguards beyond the fact that when you finally uninstall it you'll clear up 17GB of hard drive space to use for something better. You'll get better tactics out of King's Bounty and Divinity: Original Sin than this game plus better exploration and more personality. Save your money, buy those and you'll have far more fun than you would with this game.			"

Blackguards by Daedalic - A promising game with some annoying flawsI've spent 112 hours meticulously stripping down every area, every character and every side quest I could find during my first (and so far only) playthrough of this game. For the record, I'm a seasoned RPG-player and accustomed to the old-school turn based games.Short version: Bl♥♥♥♥guards is an average game which could have been a lot better without some of the bugs and a more intuitively developed story engine.For those of you who remember the glory days of the genre with Baldur's Gate I and II, IceWind Dale amongst others, Blackguars might still be worth looking into. I enjoyed playing it, but I would also like to post a warning about some of things that knocked down the total score for me:The main plot is... kinda slow. And dull. I actually enjoyed several of the side-quests a lot more than the main story. The ending is very dissapointing (and without giving any spoilers, that is an understatement). I also missed having background stories unfold for the main characters, but perhaps Daedalic are saving those for the sequel(?). Several achievements are (still) bugged. 5 of them simply can't be completed at all (confirmed by the steam community) but I've had a total of 6-7 that bugged in my game. It's been more than a year since these bugs were first reported and the steam forums have had no response from the developers yet. Like I just mentioned above, they are currently developing a sequel to Blackguards, so chances are that these bugs might never be fixed. Hence: be warned if you're one of those players (like me) who wants to cross off every achievement from the list. For future reference: I have not bought or played the DLC. Some of the game mechanics are not explained (at all) in the manual and I had to scavenge the steam forums to see if they actually worked or not. Armor is perhaps the most obvious aspect, where players have no way of telling if the armor skills makes any difference or if the character is encumbered (and if so, what penalties to expect in battles).An abundance of spells and skills makes things look very promising at first glance, but in reality, most of them are pretty much useless. Even when taking in account different preferations/play styles, at least 50% of the spells are likely to never be used by any player. Unfortunately, that goes for weapon types, talents and weapon skills as well. I can't shake the feeling that these worthless skills where put only there for marketing purposes rather than adding flavour to the game. It's either that, or Daedalic simply ran out of time/funds and had to release the game without proper (re)balancing tests.Although you are frequently presented with alternatives and choices in NPC dialogues, it rarely matters what you choose. I guess you could say that they are there to add some RP, but even so it could have been handled with more finesse. Instead you're bound to a main plot that you have no chance of altering the outcome of. I really don't want to spoil anything for you, but a frequent bother is when the game removes one ore more of your followers (and sometimes even your main character) without warning. A new player might have to start from scratch halfway through the game. Hint: make sure that your main character is at least somewhat decent in ranged combat.The 20th time the game presents you with two choices where one gives you a handsome reward (typically the ""evil"" aligned choice) while the other leaves you empty handed you can't help but wonder why? Most players expect good deeds to add up to some kind of greater reward later on. In my personal opinion, this is perhaps the single biggest flaw Blackguards has, and it feels like the developers rushed the story instead of taking time to plot out great stories. Let me underline that I don't think that ""good"" alignment should be favoured in any way. The rewards doesn't have to be better gear or more gold, it could for example be new dialogues/NPC's that are unlocked at some point further down the line. For a game that relies so heavily on RPG stereotypes it's dissapointing that karma is pretty much non-existant in Blackguards, And yet, sometimes the choices you make are actually so important that it could warrant starting over from the beginning. I would advice all new players to SAVE, SAVE and SAVE their game as often as possible. Think of Blackguards as a Bethesda title in that aspect.With the bad stuff out of the way, let's round things up with the more positive aspects of Blackguards: it's an ambitious attempt at rebooting the genre (yes, I'm aware that there are several other similar games on the market nowdays) based on a popular tabletop theme. The graphics are decent and the voice acting is top notch.Currently priced at €39.99, I'd recommend potential customers to wait for one of the steam sales before buying. For that kind of money you'll likely to find plenty of better alternatives. Personally I bought it in a Daedalic bundle and 120 hours of gameplay is more than I expect to get from most titles these days.All in all I'd score Blackguards a somewhere between 6 and 7 out of 10.

Its got limited characters but theres lots of routes you can go with them skill/training wise.  Its all about the stratagy.  Don't be expecting your graphics card to come under any pressure, this game's graphics are about 20 years behind mainstream games,  I played it through twice but it was a bit easy 2nd time around once you know whats coming.  Theres really only one way through the game so the replay instantly felt repetative.			"

Super satisfying tactical combat, but a little short of brilliantThe meat of this game is developing your characters and engaging in challenging tactical combat. I played on hard difficulty and it was no joke. You know you have a winner when your first time through a fight feels like a hopeless battle you can’t possibly win, but coming back for another try (or 5) you start to see a path and sure enough you snatch victory from the claws of your enemies. I found myself saying a lot of “No no no!! and Yes yes yes!!” and that is a good sign indeed.A decent system for equipment and hard choices to make for what kind of characters to develop and when make for pretty reasonable strategic choices between fights. I never quite felt like re-starting to make different choices but I switched focus and direction a few times as I learned what worked and what didn’t. Better yet, different fights call for very different approaches and play to the strengths and weaknesses of your character. There is no one right answer or best build, just a lot of different good choices you need to learn how to utilize. The only mistake you can make is not learning the mechanics and failing to do any specialization at all.On the other hand, while the voice acting is fine and the writing is decent, I was never all that compelled by either the characters or the story. It was never daft or cliche or bad in any way, but rarely all that awesome or intriguing. There are minor choices to be made here and there but rarely do they feel all that impactful and while the order you do quests is often open, there is rarely a feeling it matters all that much either.The game is worth the money, especially if you love tactical combat and like a stiff challenge. If you are looking for a story driven RPG or something with a feeling of grand adventure, this might not be your game.			"

There is non of frustrating moments, that was created only for blockbuster effects. All seems to be suited within game story and logic. It's rare in moderns games.The battle system, voice acting, music, story and the atmosphere is also good. And the best part - the challenge. It's quite a conundrum at the normal level, and hard puzzle in hard. That's great!I liked this game.			"

												It could be a really nice game but it's plagued with bugs. Unfortunately it's the kind of game that will irritate you to a point where you just don't want to play it anymore - and it's not because of it's difficulty level, which is really nice. Two big issues here are the constant game freezes and bad math for hit calculations. 100% chance to hit? Sorry, you've missed three times in a row!  These kind of things happen all the time in this game. I don't mind having crappy chance to hit in the beginning, as long as I'm correctly informed about it. About game freezes, it appears that enemy spellcasters tend to try to take some action that they're not allowed to in their turn, hence not finishing it so battle moves on. I've faced TWO spellcasters and both times I had to reload a LOT, because the aforementioned problem happened like 80% of the times. There's no screen rotation on battles. The official excuse is that ""it's because of the way the levels are built"". C'mon, guys... This game's visuals are not that intricate, some rotating functions would help a LOT, specially when scenarios have so many ""dead spots"" where you can't properly see enemies. I think that Blackguards developers might actually be talented and competent, however this is not a good job. As a turn-based strategy fan, I've played many smaller games that were much more satisfying and polished.			"

There are certain combination of spell which make you nearly invincible.  Which is probably a good point because if you visit a new location you can be 90% sure there will be a fight. It's not as much a roll playing game as a fighting simulator with fancy spells.The worst part is that the entire thing is just so freaking linear, and oh boy is the story predictable.It's kinda fun but certainly not for 40€. at the moment of writing you can get it from humblebundle for around 6€ which is more appropriate.

The mood is somewhat dark, as opposed to ""We are the Good Guys!"" we see in so many heroic fantasy games, with all of your companions -- and yourself -- having a ""shady side."" For example, a central theme to the story is that you were falsely accused of murder but, as the story develops, you are starting to suspect that maybe you DID do it. . .			"

I also prefer easy-to-understand games, so its fairly complicated stat and skill system isn't quite my cup of tea either. I do recommend this game if you're very good in RPG and turn based games, since besides the absurd difficulty it plays nicely, but be warned.			"

												This game has some good concepts, but unfortunately it simply balls it up. It commits every sin in the CRPG handbook. Ultimately this game is NOT an enjoyable experience. The first mistake the developers make is confusing complexity with challenge. The character system in this game is needlessly complex and completely opaque. The fights are incredibly unbalanced, and while it is possible to scrape your way through using tactics, it all comes down to luck.The combat system is absurd. My archer has repeatedly missed 100% chance to hit shots. Not parries, mind you, just completely missed. When you miss 5 90% shots in a row, against an opponent that has no special buffs, and meanwhile the enemy are not just hitting you but criting away, leaving you wounded and dying.Twice now the game has committed the cardinal sin of CRPGs of taking away your progression for the sake of a gimmick. Too bad if you were trying to make an archer, here's a club, go knock things on the head for 2 damage. See, the thing is, unless you picked the fighter class you won't have power attack, which makes melee weapons as good as useless since you'll just be scratching the ticks of the enemies back. You can play as skillfully as you want and you will still be screwed over by RNG and the absurd combat mechanics. Here's an example: My archer just missed 5 90% shots in a row on a target. Missed. Not parried. The target was not buffed with dodge enhancing stats. Now, in some games that would be okay, you'd curse your luck but recover and reorganize your strategy. In Xcom you might pull back and try to lure the enemy into an overwatch trap while you heal up your guys. In this game, every shot you miss, every hit you do not land sets you further and further behind and it is completely out of your hand due to the level up system and comparitive enemy strengths.This is not fun. The game itself is boring enough without having to go back and redo every freaking fight over and over trying to find some way to have just one of your guys survive. The loot drops are hilarious. Fifty pairs of hardened leather boots. Not one usable piece of armor. Boots. Boots all day. But don't think you can just buy armor for your party, the gold costs of the items mean that at best you will have one reasonably equipped and maybe leather pants on your other guys. And why on earth do the combat percentages change every round? Why when nothing else has changed does my warrior go from 90% to 50% then back to 85% ... if anything, im hitting the enemy it should go up. None of this makes any sense, it makes tactics pointless. Nothing is every explained.Honestly do not waste your money.			"

												Absolute garbage. lmost right at the start of the game at the graves you are pitted against FAR superior enemies with no alternativesd or permutations to consider other than where on the field you will die.  Far too much story telling and poor game play. Would not recommend this if they were giving it away.			"

												I have to admit that I bought this game blindly: Daedelic had such a good name with me that I didn't read any reviews. So maybe this is just a case of disappointed love. Anyway: I only played a few hours and then stopped, because:- imho the dark eye rpg system is clumsy and makes for rather boring fights- the game restricts you to fights on small hex fields without any exploring or experience of a world, to small towns (basically a static screen which allows you to click on merchants and trainers), and static travel screens. - the story and the characters are stereotyped, especially strange from a company wellknown for its storytelling.- the interface is very counterintuitive (fighting, selling etc.) "

After a scarce hour or two of play, with wonky ""cinematic"" interruptions, weirdly paced combat, and absolutely awful dialog, I just had to put it down and ""delete local files.""Gameplay seems to be more about picking battlefields from a world map menu than anything.

												When I first started this game I was like:""Oh it's gettind difficult"" a sensation, we gamers long for in a tactical, strategy game like this.As I played it and encountered many quests, I realized that some of them, not all, are basically the same:*Go kill this, collect this, bring back* after this grind fest there is a few moments of joy when you become a gladiator and fight for your life but even that gets simply taken from you with just a few kills.The problem rises with Lysander, the guy who enprisons you, acuses you of murder and tortures you and than later on _________________SPOILER_____________________________________You find out he is your friend and he never trusted you and he is actually against the Nameless one and Urias.____________________________________________________________The game than ends shortly, I mean seriously! I finished the game in less than 22 hours of playing!Short game, and this is with the DLC (which I never felt as a unique experience).But the game provides some good experiences in controlling the battlefield with your unique spells, skills and etc.Btw Takate is useless as a Spear user, as you soon realize: Zombies, Golems, Humans with armor and mostly everything including those annoying healing crystals which you need to kill are immune to Piercing damage! Switch him to Bash damage.Do I recommend this game!?For 50 bucks, No!Than why am I in the helpful notes? Because when it is on sale for 20 bucks or less, is worth the 22 hrs of fun they provide.			"

												Blackguards is a good game but has it's flaws. Mostly I had fun playing the game. - The difficulty of the game is quite easy at the begining but later on it becomes really annoying because mostly your enemies use spells that lower your move speed, attack chance and health. Also it will become quite impossible to fight your enemies if you don't finish all of the side quest.- Interface/Combat  is excellent, but the controls are a little wonky and sometimes quite slow. There are some monsters that take up more than 1 hex ( places on the field) and it's hard to locate the spot to hit but it's not that bad that you will ruin your whole turn.- Information is a little unclear  but after few hours you should figure it out.- Loading screens. You will spend some time on loading screens.- There is not much of different gear and weapons. Don't expect to find a lot of variety of great weapons, few of my characters had the same weapon from the 1-2 chapter to the end of the game. Also my wizards had the same clothes from the 1 chapter to the last part of the chapter 5.- Opponents. There are a lot of different opponents and interesting ones. There are also opponents that are just frustrating you because they have have spells that lower everything (so yout hit chance isn't 95% but 45%) so they are hell to beat but when you beat them it's beautiful.- Characters. All of the characters u play have different personalities that are unique. In some dialogues you can choose what your characters will say.- Story. It's not a bad story at all and has some twists.- Graphics. Some people might not care at all about graphics but I like it when the game I play has at least deacent graphics. The graphics are not that bad at all but when you talk to some people they will look totally different in the picture then they look in the game. - Playability it depends on what difficulty you choose to play but It will surely have around 40 hours (surely more).- To conclude this review I recommend you buy this game but on sale. You will enjoy it and be frustrated. "

												Avoid this game.  I don't understand why game developers think that RNG and setting the odds against you makes a game fun.  If you enjoy loading over and over again until you get a perfect roll and get the scenario down perfect is fun than this is the game for you!The graphics are mediocre, they characters look mediocre and no way to customize, the classes are mediocre and you don't gain enough skill points to keep up with the difficulty curve.The game is linear, offering no real exploration.  Just move from one scenario to another.  One scenario will be easy the next not to bad and than they throw one at you that you have to reload over and over again until you get lucky.  No skill involved, just luck on RNG.  This game gets the terrible reviews it deserves.I am in the second chapter stuck on fighting the ""newcomer"" gladiators.  They split your group into 2 groups.  So if you didn't choose a warrior in the beginning you will be stuck fighting 2 ranged against a tank and range setup, which is painful.  There is making the game difficult and then there is making it silly just to extend the life of the game.  I will try to finish the game and see but my will to continue is slowly dwindling, I am beginning to think that this company doesn't know how to make games.OK Made it past that point, now I am to a part in the gladiator games where they throw 3 waves of enemies at you without any rest.  This really is some of the worst game design I have had the misfortune in playing.  You get no breaks, no way to bind your wounds... nothing.  I made it to the 8th wave and there is an instant win button the enemies can do that you have no way of stopping.  It is completely random.  I am very close to giving up on this game, it isn't difficult, it is, to put it country simple, stupid.  So far this game deserves all the bad reviews it has gotten.			"

												Do you love endless battles on a hex grid? Because that's what this game boils down to. At the core, this game requires you to really have some strategy and luck. The battles are always stacked hard against you, often feature respawning monsters that all need to killed at once, or have you slogging through ranks of enemies that are immune to your particular weapon type. The story is totally forgettable, the ""tricks"" to certain fights are not always clear, the inventory system is bizarre. While the game is slightly better now than in pre-release beta, it's still not what I'd call a ""fun"" or ""gripping"" game. I think TOEE pulled this whole thing off a little better, plus that game is way cheaper. I wouldn't pay more than $7 for Blackguards.			"

												Blackguards has a pretty standard premise, in that it is a save the world fantasy story.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is stilted and often disjointed and the gameplay is dense and perhaps overly complicated.  I can forgive the voice acting, and odd story easily, but it is the game mechanics themselves that perhaps need tweaking.   The dice rolls are punishing and heavily weighted towards failure.  It is laughably common to miss 3 75% chances in a row and taking a risk on anything under a 50% chance is pretty much a guaranteed miss.   It has been said on various forums that there are many mechanics that are affecting the probabilities that don't appear in the shown hit chance.  That sounds to me like a User Interface failure and a pretty important one at that.  Perhaps the most glaring issue of this is the arena fights at the beginning of Chapter 2.  When you have to pull off 6 hits in a row to kill the first enemy and then another 8 hits to kill the second.  Unfortunately you A) will die in 3 hits, B) Will get poisoned if you take a single hit, and C) the NPCs don't have an issue with the weighted hit dice.  Add to this the fact that you can't go back and level due to your captivity, can't buy potions (though the enemy gets 2 or 3) and lose all of your items means that you are pretty much screwed.All in all I was pretty disappointed.  It was exactly the kind of game I wanted.  It just wasn't.			"

												I won't repeat what the other reviews already said, so I keep this short:Pro:-Round-based strategy game (its like X-Com but with an actual story!)-complex character builds are possible and a lot of content (there are 5 chapters but I am still in the middle of chapter 3 after 19 hours of gameplay)Unfortunately the negative points are too much of an issue to recommend this gameContra-all towns kinda look the same and it gets repetive if you don't love grinding and collecting item sets-incredibly difficult to play because of unbalanced setup ( since you can build every character the same, you basically choose between characters that can use magic and characters which dont)-RNG makes your game so much more painful and very frustrating ( e.g. you have 2 casters who got a success spell cast of 93% but both still fail 3 times in a row which leads to an abortion of the spells; similar cases also with 95% melee hit chance and still missing several times)I don't know what the numbers of these probabilities are for, since they do not reflect the actual probability of hit or miss, but probably its a feature and not a bug. As long as this issue is not fixed, I cannot recommend at all.Update (after finishing the game):Another negative point: story is extremly linear. Your choices make no difference at all, because the outcome is always the same. The choices only affects the ending you may get but you notice this only at the very very very end (if you can keep playing that long that is...)			"

												The game is based on a complex rule system, which is not explained very well, if at all.  They try and simplify it where possible to simple percentages, but it is often unclear what exactly causes these percentages to rise or fall, leading to the game feeling much more complicated than it needs to be. Coupled with a difficulty curve that transitions from too easy to too hard with nothing inbetween, makes playing this game a frustrating experience.  There are much better turn based strategy games out there, wouldn't recommend this one.			"

												Incerdibly annoying game. Tends to cheat whenever it can. I suppose the game's dice-rolling system might be a bit f.cked up. It's very frustrating that any slomo zombie can outrun almost any of my heroes, and the enemy's self healing is somewhat miraculous as well. Makes no sense to reduce the spellcasting chances of higher level spells either since any casting chance under 90% is hopeless. (Not to mention the hit chance with weapons.) The game is average in itself but way below expectations because of these 'rules'. Would not recommend it.			"

												Difficult to rate this game. I really really really wanted to like it. It seems like it has so much potential. But so far I have been unable to complete a play through without boredom or extreme crashes. I still plan to play the second game… I just gave up trying to finish this one before I do. Pros -	Thorough character creation-	Fun/beautiful environment and settings-	Interesting charactersCons-	Complex (and at times confusing) character skill selections-	Continuous failing high percentages ( 98% ) attacks often makes strategies pointless-	Many technical issues (crashes) makes it difficult to complete game "

												Quality SRPG, that is both strategy AND real RPG. Xcom fans will appreciate the turn based style of combat, but be amazed at the depth of character customization and talen trees. RPG fans will appreciate the sensible approach to letting you move about an over world map with freedom, and continue moving in dungeons via a map of rooms.And lastly, strategy fans will love the character devolpment, voice acting, and over-all attention to detail that is lacking in most SRPG games.While there might not be anything stunningly ""new"" or unseen before in Blackguards... there's so much that's done exactly as you'd want it done, that it's easy to overlook what few missteps they made.A solid reccomendation for fans of turn based strategy games, RPGs, and fantasy gamers. A no brainer for pen and paper fans!			"

												This is not an easy game. Loot does not come by easy. The battles come at you at every turn. Littile mistakes can cost you and force you to reload later to a previous save. The game was recently released, but I have not encountered any serious bugs. One bug/mistake is that the Icons in the character/inventory sheet do not match the correct placement of the gear.I love the story and I love the difficulty. It feels great when you complete a map. Some games lately just make it to easy or just force you to grind out to make you feel better about the game. If you like turn based strategy I would buy it. I am enjoying the game.			"

The story is engaging and, like the old SSI D&D games, lets your imagination fill in the rest!  You earn what loot you get and the character development is in depth almost to a fault.  Battles are turnbased and fun and you have to manage your resources.  This game will not be for everyone, though.  The demo is coming, so try before you buy.

												To get it out of the way, like all Dark Eye computer games this game is built from the ground up to appeal to the ""rules lawyers"" of the tabletop gaming community. The Dark Eye is like Dungeons and Dragons for people who think that what Dungeons and Dragons really needed was more math and latin.In keeping with the analogy for Dungeons and Dragons, which I use because as a franchise it is one that most people are more familiar with, the Drakensang games were kind of like Neverwinter Nights. This game, by contrast, is more like Temple of Elemental Evil. The game is almost entirely action, incorporating as much of the nuance of the tabletop game as possible, and takes place within a turn based framework, although with the incorporation of an actual hex grid battlemap rather than the approximation thereof. The combat options are numerous and exceptional in variety, with a number of opportunities to interact with the environment lending additional depth to each of the maps. If it has any weakness, it is perhaps that it is too pure; encumberance limits and limits on the skills offered by trainers and the goods offered by merchants seems inconvenient at times. More than once I wished that I had unlocked a skill at character creation that I can no longer find a trainer for once I discovered that one of my abilities lacked the punch that I expected of it.This is not a game for everyone, most people will probably find the experience frustrating. For gamers like me, however, it is exactly the sort of game we've been waiting for.			"

												Took roughly 40 hours to beat the game and enjoyed the majority of it.Though there are some serious bugs and exploits possible in the game to beat encounters (such as the final boss), I vastly enjoyed this game. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys tactical RPG's or just decent RPG's in general. However don't expect a super duper in-depth story experience. This game is based heavily on the turn based combat and in a lesser extent on the storyline.Things that are good:- Stupidity gets punished- Upgrading characters is really mandatory- Reasonable dynamic encounters, that ask for different approaches.- Letting you wander around the world to do sidequests and unlock trainers- The exp-gain system (named AP)Less impressed by:- Cutscenes were useless and lacked in quality compared to the rest of the game.- Balance in the different roles is off, my Archer is 1-shotting 80hp enemies.- Encounters vs caster NPC's are completely random; no synergy or logic in their spells.- Best in Slot gear is fairly early obtainable, roughly 50% of the game. Didn't feel like a superduper reward.- Few bugged encounters- Storyline bit meh, jumps a few things if you chose the wrong conversation choices. Which can complicate the logic of the chain.			"

Though I don't like parts of the looks, seems like they don't even really cared about making it look like real TBE stuff that is mostly inspired by real historic armor and weapons instead of D&D fantasy stuff. On this I prefer the Drakensang stuff.But I wouldn't buy it for full price, because thats way to much, I bought it in the Daedalic bundle on a Steam sale. Wait till it costs about 10 €, I think that would be a fair price.			"

												Bloody brilliant. There are some seriously bizzare negative comments on this game but let me clarify some points. 1. Does it have a plot? Yes. Is it linear? Yes. Does it matter? Not really.2. Is the interface aweful? No not in the slightest, you can choose between a right click menu or a standard button bar.3. Is it full of bugs? No, the bugs like the character inventory head and feet images in the wrong place has been fixed.4. Is the character creation and character sheet bad? No, actually its very good. You spend 10-15 mins reading everything and realise there is so much death there are lots of replay options to have a different game. Its essentially D&D stats. Played Baldurs Gate, Diablo or any other game like that and its simple, intuitive and in this case, very good.5. Its all combat, is this bad? Not really, I enjoy limited dialogue and lots of fighting. Baldurs Gate 1&2 are mostly this and they are cult classics. How good was The Banner Saga, I mean we all loved the talking but the hexed passed fighting where was it all was. This is that game on steriods.6. Is the fact the game based on a roleplay system a problem? No its actually its strength as it has lots of depth. You can turn the battle log to simple mode if you like or you can have the log go mad with the dice rolling detail. (I turn it off).Its a damn fine enjoyable game, the fact the scenery is a part of the game (Giant birds dropping rocks, crates being knocked over, tenticles from a monster breaking walkways, oil being set on fire, slippery mud, quicksand and bogs) makes this an awesome and unique experience.

The voice acting for the most part is well done, the environments are all varied and offer unique ways to defeat the enemy as opposed to the traditional way which is also a neat touch.

												Overall it seemed like an interesting game.The combat is what I dig for and the huge charactercustomization is just the thing I like.But it pains me how the companion are handled.Basically every other character than your main/self-created-one has predetermined stats, which cannot be reset.So you're more or less stuck with what the game gives you, instead of developing the team that you want to play.You can also lose companions midway through the game, for the sake of the story, which makes it even harder to have complete control over your team.The story seems decent and the combat is okay, but It would have been better just giving us overall predetermined characters, included our starting one, and make it fit the overall game, if the story was that important.

												""Blackguards is a wonderful tactics game with some rough edges. The core gameplay and character progression elements are easily some of the best in the genre, but as battles tend to drag on and more and more enemies scream “owAUGH,” the interest tends to fade. The story is easy enough to follow and interesting enough to keep players interested, so fantasy buffs should feel engaged the entire time. Even if the sound effects weren't satisfying, the gameplay itself more than made up for that, and it’s easy to see that Daedalic Entertainment has a bright future ahead of them in the strategy sphere.""In other words, a great game for fantasy/strategy fans!

												With the popularity of Dark Souls at the moment, difficulty seems to be the buzzword of the industry. This can be a great boon and imbues games with a sense of accomplishment and worth when done correctly. Blackguards seems difficult for all the wrong reasons, from an obtuse user interface to mindbogglingly poorly designed stats pages. While I appreciate that any game coming from an existing Pen and Paper world will always have a higher step up for the user than most, Shadowrun earlier last year seemed to create a system both faithful and functional while Blackguards seemed bogged down in it's own mechanics.The story is about par for course and the voice acting is quite refreshing, but it just seems like the clunky mechanics just get in the way of that experience and the difficulty wildly differs so much you bound between feeling elated and cheated every few minutes.While people howl off the rooftops at the percieved ""dumbing down"" of videogames, sometimes it has a point. Parts of the design feel snobbish, as if it wants to pat it's faithful on the back and tell them how smart and clever they are while with the other hand swatting away the ""casual, filthy masses"". Blackguards needs to get down of it's high horse and reduce the barriers to entry that stop it from being the good game I know underneath is has the potential to be.			"

												Incerdibly annoying game. Tends to cheat whenever it can. I suppose the game's dice-rolling system might be a bit f.cked up. It's very frustrating that any slomo zombie can outrun almost any of my heroes, and the enemy's self healing is somewhat miraculous as well. Makes no sense to reduce the spellcasting chances of higher level spells either since any casting chance under 90% is hopeless. (Not to mention the hit chance with weapons.) The game is average in itself but way below expectations because of these 'rules'. Would not recommend it.			"

												This game got my attention with the hex grid and turn based strategy.  Interactive fighting environments brought tons of potential in being a great strategy game.  In the end this game fell short on every level.  It was a real bust.			"

												There are bunch of reasons I won't going to recommend this game, it's playble and good at some sides, but: Some time ago when it came out it was unfairly overpriced and bugged. Time is passed bugs may be fixed but price are still unfair, but you can avoid it during sales and discounts. Also it's almost linear and you don't have any real or illusory freedom, optional side quests are mostly required to be completed, otherwise you are going to suck hard without your extra XP and loot, are they really optional?RPG system and combat touching for a first time, but in the middle of the game you are getting extremely bored of nothing new and doing the same things till the end of the game, watching the storyline which can give some fresh feelings. Personalities of your teammates can give a fresh air too, but it's not enought to be impressed for such a price.There are not so many useful charcter builds that can help you to variate your game, time would pass and you would realise a few efficient builds to play through game and after that you won't want to replay it at all.

												A game with the feel of a decently run D&D campaign, well worth the money. Especially if you get it on sale like me.The combat is usually more than just filler between story, it is part of the story and flows very well.There is a lot of versatility in your main character (mage/fighter/archer) and secondary characters as well. The skill point system is a bit unclear at times, but if you save often you can always go back and change something that wasn't as good as you thought it would be.Remember, though, that spells will not be great at first -- you'll have to use points carefully to make a good character.The story is also very engaging, and voice acting is quite good too -- for the most part.And side-quests: plenty of interesting little adventures to explore, and skill points to earn.All said, this is one of my favorite games from recent years, and I highly recommend the experience.

												The game locks up consistently.  Which means alot of restarts and lost time.Regardless it's still boring.  Latest lock up came around the point I was feeling like it was all such a waste of time anyways.  Won't bother restarting again.  RNG, I hate to complain about it...but...it's ridiculous in this case.  That's coming from someone who didn't mind it in Darkest Dungeon.Linear.  With not much to do.  Imagine boring battle sequences with an even simpler point and click game in between.Character progression.  Bleh.  The RNG has this covered to a point of non-consequential upgrades because a 10% chance to fail still means a 110% chance not to succeed.  Not always, just sometimes three times in a row... Clunky.  So clunky.  Not alot of turn based combat games out there, which sucks.  But I'd give this one a solid pass if you're considering it.  It's just not worth the time.  I don't care how starved you think you are for that genre.Bought this in a bundle for fairly cheap.  But even if it was free I'd still suggest a pass.  It's just so booooring.			"

If I had paid full price I'm not sure what i'd have done.  Save your 4$ and get a coffe or something.Graphics are fine, no ability to rotate map to get a better view,  menus are just meh, loot drops are trivial, there are not enough quests available to prepare the characters for extended fight with multiple times the number of higher lvl npc's, animations severly interrupt the flow of the game, just all around annoyance.

												Here is the deal with Blackguards.  If you liked the drakensang games, or the Blade of destiny remake, you will like this game.  I happen to like TDE games, and so i recommend to you if you are into that.  It doesnt have the free roaming of eather, but it has a less painful version of the Blade of destiny(remakes) combat. An interesting easter egg in the english naration are black library narrators (wh40k audiobooks) like toby longworth, and someone else that i dont recognize by name but by voice.			"

												A good hexagon based rpg, decent visually, with a fun storyline, my only primary complaint about this game is the rng and percentage based moves appear to be broken- I'd never try to keep count of the amount of times an 80 or 90% chance of spell success would result in casting failure. That frustration aside, it's still a pretty tactical and interesting experience among rpgs.			"

												Like Might and Magic X Legacy, this title is going to polarise opinion madly. Both are old-school turn based rpgs with more of a focus on tactics than on roleplay, and the ambition of this title is to feel like a real-life in-person, yes-there-really-is-a-live-DM kind of excperience, at which this game is mostly successful.The writing is adult, the tactics are tough, and the game has the sort of arbitrary cruelty and imperfection you get from a DMs interpretation of the rules. This is not a fps or action game, in any way, its a game for reflection. And yes its a pity there are a few genuine bugs.This game will appeal to fans of HoMM, Disciples, XCom turnbased, Badurs Gate turn based, and as I say to players of IRL RPGs. I would say right now that I prefer MMX - Legacy to this, and its kinda stoopid that both games came on within a few weeks, given that its 5 years since the last half-decent rpg.But if you're the kind of person above, then this is a truly excellent title, and you should buy both !!! Don't be put off by some of the reviews that score it for what it isnt.... "

												This is my first early access game.  I had reservations, but so far I put in a few hours into it. It's fun, there are some mechanics that are not as intuitive, and I'm early on in the game.  For instance buying weapons.  Would be nice when buying a new sword, that it would list all the characters that can use that sword and their +- stats if they were to buy that sword. Hoping for more weapon variety in upcoming patches.  The game is sufficiently challenging.  Gold is hard to come by so items you purchase can be frustrating at times. If you spent all your money on an axe, you just happen to find during the next battle for instance.  But that's the nature of the beast I guess.  The battles are a bit more like HOMM vs xcom.   Overall, I would recommend this game! Good turn based strategy games are hard to come by so lets support them!  btw Bellarita mission =  Worse most frustrating mission ever.			"

												From the trailers one is given the impression that you're playing the roles of the ""bad guys"" for once but have to ""save the world"";  a more apt analogy would be to say that the characters would probably fit well into the world of the former T.V shows Breaking Bad & Sci fis Battlestrar Galactica.  Does each character have skeletons, of course but I've yet to see one that actually warrents a ""Blackguard"" title; in fairness here the Blackguard definition, a-la from Dungeons & Dragons, is in a different context then from this title.  As has been stated in other reviews & from Daedelic Entertainment, the game is based off a tabletop role-playing game from Germany. This is my first foray into this system in any case.  The story is OK, but not much more then that.  You don't gain levels per se, but you gain adventure points (AP) when either defeating foes or completing a quest.  You use these points to raise just about everything pertaining to your character, be it statistics, your skills, your resitances, & for magic users how effective spells are & the astral points needed to cast them.  The higher the ""level"" of the STATS, skills etc, the more AP they cost.  Unfortunately, I've not come into any battle where my group has had a ""windfall"" of AP, so far  I've either gotten 30, 60 or around 120 AP depending on the battle (whether mundane foes or major ones).   I've gotten a bit more AP when completing quests though. In fairness here I'm playing it on the easiest difficulty, maybe battles give you more AP on the harder ones, though I doubt it.  The hightlights of the game are the battle system, I've yet to encounter any ""cut & paste"" battle area.  The upgrade system for your characters is fairly subtle, but noticable for the most part.  In short, you don't feel like you're spending AP to upgrade your character & they don't feel like they're more powerful.   The spells are diverse & effective. Mapwise there is a fairly large area to cover in both the in battle maps & world map.   The weaknesses of the game, thus far are:  No areas to really grind for AP,  with possible exception of arena, but even there I believe you can only have a certain amount of battles in the arena.  You can't actually make things, not armor or weapons, at least not at the point in the game that I'm at.  There's no height or lowlands difference in battles; in short I've not had so much as 1 battle where either I or the enemy started at the top of a hill.  I've also yet to have been involved in a battle where I've gotten a huge amount of AP. I'm roughly at the halfway mark, going by what the creators wrote on the main page, but I've yet to see so much as one magical item, whether defensive or offensive item.  I don't know the tabletop RPG this is based off of so perhaps the world lacks magical items or if they're simply more subtle in nature when compared to games like Final Fantasy Tactics.   The spellcasters also need work, I find them more useful as party ""buffers"", and from what I've read on the forums I'm in the nearly overwhelming majority.  This game needs some minor tweaks to really grab you & keep you in it's grip; but so far any issues I have with it, in the scheme of things, are relatively minor & not game breaking.			"

												This game is somewhat interesting, but mostly meh, in my opinion. There's gameplay in there (and if you think of every battle like it's a puzzle that needs solving, it becomes even more interesting), but there are a lot of confusing and idiosyncratic elements that hold it back. The English translation is not very stellar, the story is pretty much nonsensical, there's no way to grind at ALL, and the party mechanics can be frustrating at times, making the game harder than it should be. It uses some D and D stats like Treat Wounds that make the levelling bloated. The battle environments typically work against you more than you are able to use them to your advantage. There are no ways to win some of the levels because they were designed so terribly (I'm looking at you, mission near the end where you're chasing away birds), and in others the AI doesn't actually do what it's supposed to do (mission with the alligators is pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Also, one of your characters dies in the middle of the game (it's unavoidable), which is annoying, and another character turned on me even though I did everything the wiki said I had to do to keep her faithful. Don't play it unless you absolutely LOVE turn-based RPGs. Three dollars or less would be a good value for this game.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: The elf chick dies in the final match of the arena, the other girl turns on you.

												This game somehow made me feel nostalgic for the first turn-based combat rpg I played as a kid, which was Farland Tactics 3. This is a good thing since I can hardly get into most games these days, but this one sucked me right in.I happened to love the town overview and simplified map where I only need to click the things I need without needing to walk around and finding things. This helped me to focus on combat, while the town illustrations and some dialogues from the overview gave me a sense of adventure at the same time. The difficulty is perfect when I played this on hard - a little challenging but rewarding. Also, the combat does depend on luck quite a bit, but I felt like this kept me at the edge of my seat. Character creation and development was simple and intuitive. I didn't need to spend time trying to figure out how to build my characters by looking up at numerous guides, so it made me focus on my own game. All in all, this game was what I was looking for. If you love turn-based combat while being able to have some rpg experience without certain tediousness that comes with rpgs, this would be it.			"

												Note: While I do recommend the game it's more of a niche, hard core-ish title meant for the more dedicated turn based tactics and rpg fans. I read many complaints about the immense difficulty and frustrating rng before playing Blackguards but when I got into it myself I found the complaints to be exaggerated though it's a subjective impression of course. The Dark Eye rpg system can seem strange to those who've never encountered it before and are mostly used to dnd-esque games but if one takes the time to study and understand the stats and skills and plan their characters the game will flow much more smoothly though there are a few missions that can feel overly long and frustrating. The most underrated part of Blackguards is the writing I think. While the overarching story is fairly forgettable the characters and their interractions with each other and the world around them are a treat on many occasions and the humor feels fresh and I found it genuinely funny as opposed to meme-ish or pop culture reliant as is often the case. The game setting is gritty and reminiscent of the eastern regions in A Song of Ice and Fire (popularly know as Game of Thrones). It's a place where slavery and blood sports are considered the norm and the Poisoners Guild is the ""most respectable"" It's a great place for your band of greedy liars, violet thugs, lazy misfits and romantic rogues to have their adventure. I found the English voice acting for the main characters very enjoyable as well. I won't go indepth into the gameplay rules since the game is a year old now and there's dozens of reviews and let's plays already. The system isn't perfectly balanced (is it ever?) and certain skills are not so useful to put it midly but it also offers a lot of flexibility in how you build your characters and it's satisfying to see your characters mature into serious♥♥♥♥♥kickers.While Blackguards is a bit of a rough diamond I enjoyed my time with it quite a bit.

												I spent perhaps the past 4 hours playing this game and find that it's just not good enough to keep me plugging away at the repetitious win the roll or die battles. I've played several similar style games to this like Xcom, but this just lacked the feeling of tactical control of the situation. My suggestion for someone looking towards a good PC RPG with tactics - Divinity Original Sin. I just finished that game and found it to be very original in game play and enjoyable all the way through.			"

												This is a game that was recommended by my games magazine. Still after reading the reviews here on steam I was not convinced so it ended up on my wish list,  I gave it at a try when it was for sale at 75%.This is a game of tactical rpg combat but for me it gets old very fast, I want more from my rpg:s than only combat. Also since this is combat only they should at least have let you build all characters but no you can only build one, you are stuck with the rest of the team.The layout is also in my opinion clunky and you can't rotate the map to get a better view, sometimes characters can be hard to see hidden behind objects on the map.I cannot recommend this game but if you are really in to the tactical combat part of roleplaying games and want a challenge give it a try.

Starts with a common trope of put in prison for something didn't commit and has no memory. Another prisioner ""rescues"" you for no apparant reason, and you resuce another prisoner on your way out. So of course you become close friends and adventure together.Combat was bland. I chose a ranger as my class and after the first battle which saw me kill a single creature in two attacks, I spend the next three combats using a torch as a melee weapon against armed and armoured guards. I won of course.Maybe it gets better over time, but I'm not wasting mine after the introduction.			"

												The game itself is fun and worth a full playthrough, but that's about it. The loot is pretty uninteresting, and I wish there was more things that mattered.EDIT:Finished one playthrough. The game story itself isn't that interesting honestly, it feels rather cut in pieces. Also, the whole 'choices' thing seems to be a trend lately mostly along with the popularity of visual novels that actually are totally based off only those choices...but if you're going to have a game that really wants a diverging story up to that level, blackguards isn't your thing.The selling point, however, is that the battle system is awesome and pretty fun. True, it can get a bit repetitive and annoying, and perhaps easy if you're not playing hardmode. Still, the combat is solid and pretty fun. Overall, I'd give this game a 3.5 / 5. Good enough for a single playthrough unless they come up with more updates. Is it worth the money? I honestly dunno, but I'd pay around 20 i guess. If you want this, perhaps wait for sale period or something			"

												Turn-based RPG's are usually sterile affairs that lack the grit provided by many of the modern day role-playing games. However, if anyone can deliver on the dark side of fantasy in that particular genré, then it's Daedelic. Engrossing and challenging - this game is different to the other strategy offerings like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and such. It's more refined and delivers hours of entertainment. Easy learning curve but a very deep game with many nuances and less than obvious solutions to problems.			"

												For a game stripping down RPGs down to the basics - combat encounters - it sure does a tremendously bad job. The combat UI is clunky as hell. You cannot turn map apparently, so every obstacle on the map is also an annoying obstacle for your mouse and eyes. The game loads a lot and I have no idea why, because the graphics are not anywhere near current single player games standard, but rather low on the MMORPG scale even. Inventory management really sucks a lot, not too mention quirky little fun things like characters using bandages to cure lasting injuries only on themselves - means you cannot reliably heal with a character you build for such stuff. This game is a big disappointment, if you want DSA nostalgia, buy the very old Nordland-Triology, still better and technically more adapt than this here. Certainly not worth the price of a AAA-game, which sadly it features.			"

												Shame really, there's a good / great game desparate to show itself among the mess that overrides it. The balancing is just wrong for me in this (as others have said) and it's never a good sign when you have to change difficulty just to have a chance at doing a quest (save person in 4 combat moves with 9 men on you, hidden traps and objects / said men blocking path for instance even having done all side quests).It also doesn't help when your playing an excellent turn-based combat game at the same time that gives you freedom and reward in levelling and experimentation like Divinity Original Sin (just buy that!) where while challenging the rewards match the effort and the party feel capable against all odds (not missing 4 out of 6 times on a 85% swing) and complement each other truly.So in closing if you don't mind shifting difficulty or following a strict guide to levelling / using characters etc (all of which feel cheap as your not making your own choices / victories) then go for this otherwise go for suprior alternatives like the excellent Divinity Original Sin or XCOM Enemy Unknown heck even XCOM Bureau (early days on that one but seems far more balanced / rewarding / less restrictive).

												Blackguards really opens up as you proceed through it, there's a lot of great content here. In the game though, the traditional aspects like the resting and healing really show through, reminding us why we moved on from some of these mechanics. You are not going to enjoy this game if you don't have a passion for this type of combat system. Make sure you like this kind of combat before you purchase the game. For me, I love it, because I love the hex based strategy gameplay. This game is going to be a hit or a miss between different player types, a niche audience is going to truly love this game while other players may feel a bit intimidated and put off by the pacing. The only true strong point Blackguards has going for it is the combat, so make sure you like it... Full review here - www.gamesta.com/review/blackguards-review/ "

												BlackguardsBlackguards eschews the traditional “you are the hero!” trappings of most games and instead places you into the shoes of escaped convicts. Granted you are still on a quest to save your world, but you do go about it in a slightly different manner. Does the game differentiate itself enough from similar competitors, or should it have remained in solitary confinement? Suppose you’ll have to read on to find out eh?Let’s be honest, if you have enough interest in the game to have happened upon this review then you’ve probably seen a couple of videos. From there we can assume you know what kind of art style is at play here. It’s dark, it’s got a lot of browns and grays, and it’s a high-fantasy setting. Dwarves, mages, swords and archers are all present. This is all to be expected, so we won’t cover the art beyond that. It’s pretty generic but it does the job. So we’ll go ahead and move on to cover something you’re more interested in instead.The gameplay! This is what you were looking for, right? It’s alright. You don’t have to be ashamed that you skipped directly to this section. I won’t hold it against you. I’ll still tell you all about the game and help you decide if it’s worth the price or not. Let’s begin shall we? Blackguards is an isometric turn-based strategy game with all the expected trappings that come along with it. You begin by creating a character via a fairly detailed skill/attribute tree using a preset number of character points. You may begin as either a warrior or a mage, with the mage class costing you extra points to unlock. Points may be spent on spells, skills, attributes and upgrades for all of those. Further character points are earned by completing quests and missions throughout the game. As you play, you collect various companions who can be fully customized in the same fashion, giving a great deal of customization options and variations to be had. Each character, including your own, is fully voice acted and animated. Though it is hit or miss, none of it is particularly bad. It certainly doesn’t detract anything from the game even if it doesn’t always add to it either. The gameplay itself boils down to what you might expect; characters act in turns based on their initiative values, which are affected by what armor you have equipped. Heavier armor lowers initiative, light armor lowers it less. It’s fairly straightforward. Combat is equally typical of the genre. During a turn you may move and attack, or move a little further and not attack. It has a bit of depth, but not so much that it needs any more detail listed here. Where Blackguards separates itself from the pack is with its tone. You aren’t a band of heroes out to save the world. You are a band of outlaws, cutthroats and brigands who just happen to be on the path that might end with the world being saved. As a result a lot of your quests have to do with helping a party member engage in some…bedroom fun times, we’ll call it, with a local baroness. Also robbery, murder, chaos and overall mayhem. It’s a nice change of pace from the usual save this person or that thing and be all heroic that usually come in games like this.Overall, Blackguards is a fun game. It has some downsides, being low-budget, but nothing that detracts in any meaningful way from the quality of the game. It’s worth the price of admission if you’re looking for a turn-based rpg to sink some time into. Give it a shot if it looks interesting and you like the genre. I don’t think you’ll regret it too much. "

												While I only played this for 30 minutes I was bored out of my mind the entire time. Story is all over the place. Starts with a common trope of put in prison for something didn't commit and has no memory. Another prisioner ""rescues"" you for no apparant reason, and you resuce another prisoner on your way out. So of course you become close friends and adventure together.Combat was bland. I chose a ranger as my class and after the first battle which saw me kill a single creature in two attacks, I spend the next three combats using a torch as a melee weapon against armed and armoured guards. I won of course.Maybe it gets better over time, but I'm not wasting mine after the introduction.			"

												Great turn based RPG. Combat system is good, and gearing and skilling up your characters is rewarding.At first I was disappointed about the absence of random encounters, worried that the game would be on rails, but once you get into the game there are enough side quests to keep you occupied.

												BlackguardsBlackguards eschews the traditional “you are the hero!” trappings of most games and instead places you into the shoes of escaped convicts. Granted you are still on a quest to save your world, but you do go about it in a slightly different manner. Does the game differentiate itself enough from similar competitors, or should it have remained in solitary confinement? Suppose you’ll have to read on to find out eh?Let’s be honest, if you have enough interest in the game to have happened upon this review then you’ve probably seen a couple of videos. From there we can assume you know what kind of art style is at play here. It’s dark, it’s got a lot of browns and grays, and it’s a high-fantasy setting. Dwarves, mages, swords and archers are all present. This is all to be expected, so we won’t cover the art beyond that. It’s pretty generic but it does the job. So we’ll go ahead and move on to cover something you’re more interested in instead.The gameplay! This is what you were looking for, right? It’s alright. You don’t have to be ashamed that you skipped directly to this section. I won’t hold it against you. I’ll still tell you all about the game and help you decide if it’s worth the price or not. Let’s begin shall we? Blackguards is an isometric turn-based strategy game with all the expected trappings that come along with it. You begin by creating a character via a fairly detailed skill/attribute tree using a preset number of character points. You may begin as either a warrior or a mage, with the mage class costing you extra points to unlock. Points may be spent on spells, skills, attributes and upgrades for all of those. Further character points are earned by completing quests and missions throughout the game. As you play, you collect various companions who can be fully customized in the same fashion, giving a great deal of customization options and variations to be had. Each character, including your own, is fully voice acted and animated. Though it is hit or miss, none of it is particularly bad. It certainly doesn’t detract anything from the game even if it doesn’t always add to it either. The gameplay itself boils down to what you might expect; characters act in turns based on their initiative values, which are affected by what armor you have equipped. Heavier armor lowers initiative, light armor lowers it less. It’s fairly straightforward. Combat is equally typical of the genre. During a turn you may move and attack, or move a little further and not attack. It has a bit of depth, but not so much that it needs any more detail listed here. Where Blackguards separates itself from the pack is with its tone. You aren’t a band of heroes out to save the world. You are a band of outlaws, cutthroats and brigands who just happen to be on the path that might end with the world being saved. As a result a lot of your quests have to do with helping a party member engage in some…bedroom fun times, we’ll call it, with a local baroness. Also robbery, murder, chaos and overall mayhem. It’s a nice change of pace from the usual save this person or that thing and be all heroic that usually come in games like this.Overall, Blackguards is a fun game. It has some downsides, being low-budget, but nothing that detracts in any meaningful way from the quality of the game. It’s worth the price of admission if you’re looking for a turn-based rpg to sink some time into. Give it a shot if it looks interesting and you like the genre. I don’t think you’ll regret it too much. "

												Engaging and complex turn based strategy, which surely has its flaws. This includes the graphics and story telling.

												I've found Blackguards to be a very challenging and rewarding turn based strategy game. It can be frustrating in that you aren't going to make enough money to equip your party as well as you'd like and some maps force you into uncomfortable decisions as you have a fixed number of turns to achieve an objective. Blackguards, in my opinion, is worthy of a sequel or, at a bare minimum, expansion packs.			"

												Starts solid, fizzles BAD later.Balckguards is challenging tactical RPG great focus on tacital, the characters strenghts are based of of the skill points you allocate into different areas such as weapon profficancy and constitution, and to note you can only carry four items per character in battle that includes arrows.  Combat is the typical turn based Hex grid goto but this is when the game can be a pain, traps are invisible of course you can take an action to scan the area around you for them, BUT to scan furthur areas you must move another character into the area avoiding the traps that are reveal. Movement is crap, the Hex grid makes thing wonky and you end up having the character accidentally move through a trap, inflicting damage, possible status effects, and ending their turn. If you don't end up walking through a trap on your way to the empty space you will likely hit a trap that is still hidden. Also the  AI opponents know where the traps are so unless it plays stupid and tries to make it's way to a weakend ally it will almost never hit them.I am saddend by this spike in difficulty but if you enjoy masocistic gaming feel free but other wise avoid.

Continual misses by your characters (at 92%!!!!!) but the enemy will hit you, for two or three times your damage, at 45%!!!  WTF !?!?!?!?!?  Dead-alic.........we're done with you.  You couldn't program your way out of a wet paper bag.  It takes a helluva lot more than some pretty sprites to make a worthy adventure game.  And the notion that because this takes place in the Dark Eye somehow justifies this travesty of computer coding.  You're fifteen years to the party too late, and you STILL can't hold a candle to classics like Baldur's Gate.  That's SAD, SAD, SLOPPY CODING.			"

												Blackguards is a great rpg. The characters feel nice and different, they folow certain cliches but those are unavoidable. For me what makes this game shine is the characters and he conversations, i mean how can you not love the joke ""An elf a human and a dwarf were wading through a river, the elf said 'This water is up to my chest' the human said 'It's up to my neck' the dwarf said... nothing."" The combat in this game is often a challenge and requires you to think out your attack, use the environment and each character's abilities together or suffer heavy damge in most situations. The story is a nice break from the typical ""We are the heros out on a noble quest to defeat evil."" that often plagues the rpg genre. Overall if i had to rate this game i'd give it an 8/10, great game, fun characters and a nice story ut very unforgiving at most times, but at leas it gives you a ""Try again"" button for every fight.

												Very fun game though it can be extremely difficult. Some maps drags on for way too long.Though with that said, having character missing hits at 85%-95% hit chance range makes you want to flip the table when it does it 3 times consecutively, and it doesn't only happen once over the course of the game. I gotta say, I swear the game has sneaks some awful dice rolls to troll you. Especially when it comes to damage, many ennemies would survive just at 1 hp and kill off one of your teammate(s).I wish there were more variety of items in each category. Overally, it's a good game in general.Gotta restart the game and build my characters better since I know how to play this now.			"

												I think this Blackguards has a strong base and may lead to a very good sequel.  The game is flawed though.  For a game that states:""Your choice of spells, skills and abilities determine your battlefield tactics. Aggressive? Defensive? Tactical? It's your call how to tackle each challenging encounter! ""There is very little choice.  If you want an RPG where you can build your characters and team this is not it.  The game give you a very well defined group to play with.  It makes the game extremely difficult if you do not build your characters to a certain role.  The other characters are far enough down their progression that it makes little to no sense to try and change them.  What is so maddening about this game, is that there is a lot of really cool things you could do.  You are just not able to do them, because they game gates skills, and locks players into roles for you.  If the game just let you have 4-5 characters to build as you see fit it would be far better.  The story was fine.  The voice acting was ok.  The game is good.  There is no real choice in the game though.  No characters progression choice and no choice in what you do.  That is why the game falls short for me.  It is not worth the full price.  If you are looking for a decent game that has limited flexibility and is on rails this might be for you.   This game just falls way short of how it is advertized. "

The voice acting is superb, except for a few characters- executioner.... It's a pleasure to look at, and for the most part the game runs smoothly. That said, it can be worth it if it's on a 75%+ sale.I'm still giving it a negative rating because of how many times the damn game crashes or freezes on a loading screen. The latest save-game file constantly corrupts making you backtrack. The tooltip isn't kidding- save often!!! Waaay too much fubar and frustration, when most of my games work fine.<Edit: I am struggling to just play without crashes, and it completely took out my new rig last night. Unexpected shutdown was attributed to the apps path of this game, as well as the temporary files in memory. I don't know why I'm even strugglebusing myself through the rest of the game when it freezes on every other loading screen...>			"

												Turn-based RPG's are usually sterile affairs that lack the grit provided by many of the modern day role-playing games. However, if anyone can deliver on the dark side of fantasy in that particular genré, then it's Daedelic. Engrossing and challenging - this game is different to the other strategy offerings like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and such. It's more refined and delivers hours of entertainment. Easy learning curve but a very deep game with many nuances and less than obvious solutions to problems.			"

												100% manure.While first 2 chapters are fun, from 3 it goes down hill. Especially chapter 5, which is incredibly cheap and frustrating. The game explains itself poorly and people comparing it to xcom should play xcom first.In this game hit chance % is actually not a real one, because the one that is displaying doesn't add dodge/parry/block to the equation, so the real hit chance is much lower in the end.Graphics for a game from 2014 are meh, but fps droping to 35 on gtx980 show what an unoptimised mess it can be. If you want to actually check where it drops like that, go to arena and when there is a level with torches and what appeares to be rivers of oil, touch the torch, so half the map is on fire. If you will make them all fall, the fps will go down significantly. Music is unmemorable, characters are just there (with no real development) with really awful VO work. If you thought Bethesda was worst, check this game out on youtube. Completely stoned elf chick is horrendous.Overall the game is incredibly buggy, from missing sound to other hilarious things.The only pros for this game that I can think of are:- cards, which you can sell- if you really care about playtime, it can be from 20 to 50 hours.- it is buggy. Why count it as a pros? Because there is a bug in the final fight when the game will beat itself, even if you lose, so you don't have to suffer this cheap and unfair fight anymore (with a trophy for completing and supposedly best ending!). At least I got it and I'm really happy.2/10, stay away.PS I will give you some awesome trivia and food for thought - only 7% of the owners actually beat the game.			"

												This is for those die-hard fantasy gamers. It has some DnD elements that just makes the inner-nerd happy and superb voice acting. The characters are fun and the story is decent. Combat-wise it's annoying missing attacks that have a 70%+ chance of hitting and this happens a lot. It's also a bit of an adjustment constantly preparing your ammo and healing your characters before each battle since they don't just regenerate fully or have unlimited ammo by themselves. Overall a good game, not worth the price but is a must-have when it goes on sale.			"

												I was not certain whether I will like it or not due to some negative reviews on the  board complaining1. random battle resultsand 2.  the difficulty of the game. However, it turns out that this is one of the top 5 games I played in 2014 (including Last of Us, Distant Worlds, Dominions 3, and Tomb Raiders). If you like turn based combat in a fantasy world, this is a must. I enjoyed this game far much more than I did for UFO Enemy unknown.  I do not have any experience with the dark eye world so I browsed steam community guides (class guide was most helpful) and some forum posts. Concentration (on certain skills or spells for a character) was advised and it is really important.  I tried to max weapon talent, base stat and skill which are matched (refer community guide). Chapter 1 was a bit difficult since the system was new to me but the remaining chapters became more comfortable as I learn combinations of spells and base stats (for example, one of the  spells that I specialized requires cleverness and constitution). All the information is well presented in game. Carefully building your character not wasting points here and there is crucial. (Dont be afraid if it sounds complicated. If you play 3-4 hours, every thing becomes clearer). Certainly, randomness is there but every RPG has that element. So it wasnt a big deal for me.I am looking forward to Blackguards 2. Congrats Dev for a quality game.			"

												6.5/10Blackguards is a decent turn-based tactical RPG with gameplay mechanics based on The Dark Eye, which is basically the German equivalent to Dungeons and Dragons.  But unlike most games based on D&D, Blackguards (and most TDE games) is based on a relatively low-magic world.  This and some other things makes me think that TDE was perhaps not the best ruleset to base the game's engine on.THE GOOD-Challenging difficulty-Characters are cliche, but well written-Battlefields are almost always unique for each battleTHE BAD-Needlessly complex character customization with very linear results-Extremely frequent loading times-Occasional chore-like battle-Story falls flatBlackguards plays like a more linear King's Bounty, except more linear and with actual party members instead of squadrons of soldiers.  I played Hard Mode on my first playthrough I found it to be very challenging; the game punishes you greatly for building characters incorrectly, doing poorly in certain battles (because you don't get healed for the next at!), and picking the wrong fights at the wrong time.  However, there is a good amount of diversity in game objectives and the battlefields are mostly unique for each battle.Strategy in this game favors positioning above all else, because the strongest abilities in the game belong to melee and rangers whose primary attack abilities have no cooldowns and insignificant downsides to their use.  Mages are primarily support characters, and their best spells simply involve turning your melee guy into an even stronger skill spammer.  Had they used a different ruleset or made one of their own, they could have improved the strategy element of the battle system.  If you're going to make a turn-based strategy RPG, isn't strategy a lot of what the whole idea is about? Don't expect the same kind of class diversity that D&D games have.  Despite the complexity of TDE's character customization, there isn't a lot of customization to be done.  Blackguards doesn't take a lot of steps to simplify the rules, but despite all of the little things the player must keep track of, the end result is almost always the same; melee and ranged guys hit hard, mages either cast support spells or suck.Load times are unnecessarily frequent.  The game features a lot of cities, most of which don't have much unique to offer, yet trying to find quests in them involves watching a loading screen for each one.  It gets ridiculous because some of the cities have more than one section, with each section requiring even more time at the loading screen to move around to.It was suggested by previews that Blackguards would set the player in the role of being the ""bad guy"" or at least the guy most people think is the bad guy.  The story even sets itself up with an intriguing mystery of laser guided amnesia, but aside from a couple scenes falls flat after the first chapter.  However, the voice acting is pretty good, and the characters, though cliche and mostly linear, are written quite well. Hell, Naurim is more memorable to me than any of the characters from Dragon Age: Origins.With all of this negative stuff being said, I had decent fun playing Blackguards.  It's challenging, offers some diversity in scenarios and battlefields, and has decently well written characters.  Definitely try the demo before buying, it contains hours of content.  Buy it on sale.			"

												I wish there was a middle choice like, ""If it's your cup of tea,"" or; ""If it's on sale.""  Anyways, I can't openly recommend this game though I will continue playing it and do enjoy aspects of it. It's a start over too many times kind of game. Sometimes the CTH (chance to hit) can frustrate you more than anything else. Because it's played tactical turn style this makes some battles painfully long, and some easy battles unneccsarily hard. I truly had a fight where luck jsut spit on my and I failed every spell, before writing this review actually, and I was killed by two wolves...eh. It does get better, obviously as I said I will keep playing it. Nice feel, voice acting is ok, story is fine so far though nothing pushing the limits I feel it could move forward readily. I'm interested to see how strong I can make my characters and well I can customize them. Still, I can't recommend it.Why?It falls into a category of games where there are many options for you that are easier to pickup and just as customizable. If you've already played through a plethora of these titles you will then enjoy this as you're out of new stuff to do. But get a coffee, or whatever relaxes you, because it will frustrate you to ****.			"

												The game itself is great, really nice graphic and a story that keeps the game entertaining.. but then theres the bugs, in combat i had to reload my savegame 3 times so far, because of a combat bug that just makes ur charater stop attacking on the second hit, u cant get past that point, unless u havd unlimited patience, and wait for that one out of 20 times where it doesent bug and u can actually get past that place.. it happened in several other combats aswell, and ive tried to get support for it, check the forums, write em.. hell even google.. but nothing.. no fix.. no support.. nothing.. and for 40 euro for the game and 5 euro for the DLC.. as much as i love the game i dont reccomend it.. because the bugs is just to frustrating.. and without any support for the game, seems the devs just left it.. then id say if it was a 5 euro game then the bugs, i could live with em, and just think pff it was only 5 euro.. but in this case its NOT just 5 euro wasted.. its 45 euro wasted..

												I bought this on sale for like $3. I regret buying it.Pros:Hex-based tactical combatLots of character customizationPoints system for leveling skillsEnvironmental effects such as setting bushes on fire, slipping in puddles, or knocking stalagtites off the ceiling of a caveCons:You will likely hit your opponents maybe 10% of the time. You have a hit percentage ranging from 0 to 100. This is based on your skill with the weapon, your attack stat, and the level of the creature you're attacking. This does not take into account their ability to dodge or parry. A character (opponent or ally) can parry the first physical attack against them each turn. They can dodge any number of attacks per turn. So, if you have a 90% chance to hit, it is then further reduced behind the scenes by their dodge rating, and again by parry if they have not yet been hit. If you have anything less than say, 80% chance to hit, it may take you dozens of turns to end a battle that could have ended in like 6.Enemies at the beginning of the game hit every hard, and rarely miss. You can increase your dodge and parry ratings through skills, but at character select you can't exactly make it huge. This would be fine, if it weren't for the fact that enemies can quite often hit for 10-15 damage, while your character only has about 30 health. Early game you only have 3 party members, and very often face off against 5+ enemies. It's easy to get swarmed, so using choke points is a must-- at least it would be if the majority of the levels they put you in weren't open rooms.Cover doesn't seem to do anything. One of the earliest tips you get is that you are harder to hit in partial cover, and even harder to hit in full cover, like behind a tree. Archers have no trouble hitting you from the full length of the map behind full cover for 5-8 damage a turn, and it will take at least 2 or 3 turns to be able to reach them.Some quests/scenarios are outright impossible if you try them too early, and the game has no qualms about sending you to your death. A good example of an early scenario in this game is facing a Wood Troll (like a treant). It has a ton of health and does a lot of damage (like 15-20 per hit), but it's slow and in a gaseous swamp. You can stand in front of a gas pocket and  use a fire spell or torch on the gas to explode it a few times to win the fight. You could do this at level 1 if you wanted, but an uninformed player would try to rush it and die quickly. A bad example is later on. You fight some dwarves in an arena. They have a lot of health, do a lot of damage, and can move as far as you. You're *supposed* to use the same method as the Wood Troll. Stand in front of the mace trap before it activates, lure the enemy into it, and do most of the damage through the trap. My issue is I was underleveled, and there was no way for me to know this until it was too late. The enemy dodged 100% of my attacks, knocked down a character per turn, and the melee dwarf hit for 15+ damage per turn plus 5 poison per turn while 2 of my characters had ~30 hp, and one with 46. The melee dward also parried the trap that was supposed to deal the damage to him each turn, so he was functionally invincible. I tried at least a dozen times, looked online, and saw the only real way to win the fight is to ignore the mission until you had another party member and were a little more leveled. Looking at my saves, I had one auto save right before the fight, a quick save right before the fight, and a manual save about an hour and a half prior (Which isn't the game's fault, but frustrating nonetheless).You can't level skills without finding a trainer, even if you meet the pre-requisites to unlock it, or had the option to learn it during character creation. If I don't spend at least one point into the mend wounds ability at character creation, I cannot learn it until much later when I find the right trainer. I would understand for some skills, but for the basic levels of some passive abilities or skills it doesn't make much sense.Overall, the game is difficult for the sake of being difficult, but not in a way that self improvement can make it any easier. Unlike an action game like Dark Souls, dying isn't always the result of you ♥♥♥♥ing up. A lot of the time, it's because a creature rolled the highest it possibly could 3 turns in a row, or all 3 of your characters missed every single roll 3 turns in a row. If you're okay with restarting a mission over and over just to beat it, or to avoid getting knocked down and started on fire before your first turn, go for it. If you're as easily frustrated as me at a game where RNG is the core mechanic of the game, avoid it, even for $3.00			"

Blackguards is an interesting game. Although linear in story progress, the fights themselves are very tactics based like FF tactics, X-Com and other such titles.But the real beauty is in the character customization itself, allowing you to cros class is unique waysi.e. A Bowmaster who can also cast Powerful Magics, or a Warrior with the ability to heal and perform other  support role  abilities while being a Front line Tank. The Skill Combinations allow for a very broad range of character types and you are only  limited by your own imaginationMy recommedation is a big YES to those that enjoy Tactics, Customizable characters to your own specs, and a game that has battles aplenty amongt a comprehensive storyline with choices along the wayBUY IT ! ! !

												Wow.  This game is 3.99 right now. If you like turn based combat it's definitely worth a shot.  The character progression and how to build your character properly is a bit different from the norm, but half way through the game I was at the point where I was seriously considering restarting just to focus my builds a bit more. Aside from that though, the game can be quite challenging and will take up a good chunk of time, so you will surely get your monies worth.			"

												Everything that can be wrong about this game is wrong.The mechanics are broken (IE you get 1 parry a turn except for when you dont, that guy who has parried 3 attacks already, well your 100% to hit which you should never even have got because a 20 is a crit fail, he parried it because he also rolled a 20 on his parry roll, 4th parry out of the 1 he has per round),They are also counter intuitive (fairly normal for a D&D clone),And outright stupid (Why do shields give no bonus at all?  Why can you only switch your melee skill between offensive and defensive outside of battle, why does changing it make no difference?  Why can I get 100%s to hit when 19-20/20 is always a crit fail? etc.),Random to an excessive level (Nothing you do means anything.  Your completely non melee focused mage can work better as a tank than your completely tank focused sword and board char.  Your spell which does 8-18 dmg (firebolt 2) actually rolls for between 3 and 27, before factoring in resists/weaknesses)On top of that, the AI cheats (They get 100%s to hit fairly regularly, they can parry a seemingly infinite amount of times, they parry your 95%s to hit about 95% of the time, they still maintain accuracy despite having every possible debuff put on them, they get access to things like potions in fights where it is explicitly stated no one has them, they succeed/fail skill checks in a completely disproportionate amount to thier displayed chances of success (etc)),The story is both unoriginal and bland,The world is completely nonsensical, you can walk across what is described as a ""Vast empire"" and back in less than a day,Apart from your PC, Naurim and the fat mage, all of the voice actors are phoning it in, especially Neera (or whatever she is called),The game is ugly as all hell, yet still has horrendous loadtimes and FPS drops (I am on a 4GHz 3770, a GTX680, 16 GIGs of DDR3, and a high speed SSD, yet it still drops to below 10 frames per second at times, seemingly randomly),The UI is♥♥♥♥♥♥(IE every spell has 4 levels, each needs to be put onto your hotbar at a set level).The progression is♥♥♥♥♥♥(no matter how difficult the fight is, you get 23 or 45 exp),Probably more, but this game is so painful to play through.  I wish my kindly friend hadnt bought the humble bundle for me, as then I would have bought it myself and could have just never played this game, but since someone bought it for me I HAVE to finish it so as to not waste thier money.Heres hoping it stops being♥♥♥♥♥♥at some point... Here is hoping it isnt 40 hours in...*Edit, I didnt quite force myself to 40 hours, close enough though, and I did give up in the end.  It never got good.  Its entirely possible the story gets good later on (though from comments I have seen it doesnt, BG2 supposedly has a good story if still unoriginal, and it having a good story is always mentioned as a positive comparison to BG 1), but if the gameplay is tantamount to pulling your own teeth out through your♥♥♥♥♥♥ why would you even bother getting that far?

												I can't say I like this game. The story is somewhat nice. I like RPGs in which you begin as an outlaw, unimportant nobody. Though very soon the story turned out to be generic and unappealing. The settings seems totally boring. You don't seem to really travel in an open world. The first town you appera in is not really a town, it's just one screen where you click four vendors. What a joke. I like where the combat tactic element is going so far, but overall I don't feel like playing this game again.			"

												Saying that this is an easy game is simply a load of arrogance. This is an easy game to get into but a hard game to master. Unlike many games of this genre, Blackguards is very unforgiving and will teach you a solid lesson for every mistake you do. Every action, moves and attacks you do should not be taken lightly. Even if the odds appear in your favour, not using cover, trying to get an attack on every turn and forgetting to equip valuable potions and such will quickly turn your battle sour. While a bit frustrating at times, I rather find this game a lot of fun. For the few hours that I've played, the storyline isn't bad and the characters are interesting. This basically a straight to the point, no BS RPG. There's no running around a village 2 hours just for the scenery. You get somewhere, talk to the npcs, get quests and you're in battle. The difficult battles are what keeps you hooked and satisfying. This is probably more of a 90s generation type of game.			"

												Altough I love RPG games I am really dissapointed in this one. Ok this is rather a strategy game than an RPG, but it even fails at that. There are virtually no strategy options on the battlefield. Attack or cast spell. If you are a fighter you stuck with the first option, and hope for some decent damage. Most damage I did was around 9. Enemies constantly do damage over 10+. And spellcasters fizzle their spells 50% of the time. Combine this with the fact that you can't even cast spell out of combat (eg: no healing). And you get this complicated luck based game, with 0 fun factor.			"

												I really wanted this game to be fun.  Only 6 hours in doesn't make me an expert by any means, but 6 hours of frustration and boredom is enough for me.  The towm screens are all static,  with certain activities highlighted.  You can shop which doesn't take long as everything costs allot of coins and what the player gets on drops is insignificant.  Weapons drop and they are all inappropriate for the ""basic"" games preset skills.  For example, your warrior is proficient in single handed axes and the only bladed weapons that drop, initially, are swords.  So, in order to even hope to survive any of the battles you have to pump AP ( which are earned by combat and quests) into a weapon that you have found, rather than saving them for other talents.  Armor is virtually non existant as drops so you have no defense really.There is virtually no game here other than scrounging for gear and combat.  Your path is pretty much preset with no real exploration and each location is either a static town or a combat grid.  The other really stupid mechanic is your starting companions.   You get a dwarf warrior that is pretty good and a mage that is as useful as a box of combs for a bald man.  Now if you choose a mage as your class, the party has great ranged dps ability and very weak melee.  If you chosse a warrior its the reverse and you are in even worse shape as the preset companion mage is useless.  When looking at the mages's stats, you wil see he has the best ""ranged weapon"" skills of the three.  He also has the most Astral Points ( mana ) of the three.  Yet when equipped with a ranged weapon like a bow he misses every time.  His casting skills are not bad but the only really good spell is an AoE fire attack that does little or no damage and uses up all his mana in 3 turns.  Oh, your mana regens at the alarming rate of 1 to 2 points every 5 turns.  You are long dead by then as a mage can't wear armor, has little or no melee skills and now cant use magic.Casting is a thrill, the effects are nice especially the failures which occur more than 50% of the time and the melee companion will miss 80% of the time on the only attack that does decent damage and the attack that has a high chance of hitting does insigificant damage.Now I know that any starting party is releatively weak and there is an expected number of failures in any combat until the combat system is learned.  However, the punishment vs reward system in this game crucifies a new party.  The typical battle has the odds at 3 or 4 enemies to 1, so you have 3 party members that miss and fizzle spells most of the time with no armor and medocre weapons against 6 or more enemies that miss maybe 1 in 10 times.  Your mana is used up pretty quick and the regen might let you cast one 10 pt heal just before the 3 enemies around you hit for 10 pts of damage each.There was one battle in a cave of sorts, the 30 odd enemies were seperated from the party by twisting tunnels, but you can see them, so you know what is up a ahead.  After killing the 1st batch of enemies, about 10, I got to sit there mindlessly pressing the space bar until our mana regenerated enough to heal.  Yes heal pots, well they are  very dear, almost never drop and best saved for combat.   After healing the party I sat there pressing space bar for another 40 turns to regen enough mana to move forward and take on the next batch of enemies.  Needless to say that aside from the very deep skill system this game is visually boring and the combat is more so.  Quite a few words come to mind for this game:  Dark, Dismal, Uninspirering, Frustrating, Boring.  It seems that the publisher is punishing the player for being stupid enough to actually give them money for the priviledge of being bored!Blackguards is the sort of game that if you had a choice of getting a root canal or playing the game, you'd rush to your dentist with a smile on your face rather than load this game up!I may get back into it, but there is no desire to spend many hours in this mess as there are other more rewarding games out there.

												I thought it would be fun. It kind of is, but it's incredibly frustrating. Poor detection on clicking enemies and random luck screws you over worse than it does in XCOM. It's really inconsistant in its mechanics. You'd think it would be simple, that highest initiative goes first. But it doesn't. It seems like it only improves chances of going earlier in the turn order. Because I'll restart a level and a different character gets the first move. You'd think this would make things interesting but it just makes it incredibly difficult to learn from your mistakes when it constantly changes. Wounds just break immersion so much it's baffling that they put them in. Your characters get ""wounds"" that carry over from one fight to the next, which cripples them somewhat and you have to see a healer constantly if you didn't invest heavily in some kind of ""do-it-yourself"" wound healing. Really kills the immersion for me at least to leave a dungeon, go get healed and come back after every room. Some maps are just really unreasonable and you have to try over and over again to even almost win. I mean, it speaks volumes when the first option in the esc menu is ""Try Again"". I mean, I'm trying to be fair. The game is fun and the concept is great. Overall it's an okay game but if it weren't for the overwhelming swarm of tiny annoyances, it would have been amazing. All in all, it's far from a waste of money, but I honestly wish I had bought something else.			"

												Scripted mis-chances and rather insane mis-chances are just the start. (I had a 5% chance to hit a troll 7 hexes big...really? Or tried to cast a spell and had it fail 3 times with a 90% and then another 85% all in a row...which is about a 1 in a million chance I believe)  As well I at least disliked both the dialog and the leveling system which rather then letting you pick what you want if you do not go up in certain skills you will make the game impossible since there are no methods of leveling up other then the pre-set battles.  I tired with 4 different setup and every time(sometimes sooner then others) ran into a just stupidly setup battle where I would have selected a much different skill set then I had.I did end up not playing this game much but unless it takes off(always a possibility) it seems that you are just meandering through life without much direction other then random people giving you quests that I mean go to X and have a battle...no real interesting battles other then some I get to run through enemies with everyone killing me in a time limit or press a button causing some other random thing to happen that I feel was just put there to make the battle go on longer rather then for flavor.I am sure there are plenty of people who like this game but I just don't see why I would play this when there are so many better games out there even in this genre then this.

But I don't think there's a fix to the problems here, without just making a completely different game.			"

												Interesting take on the genre, but I lost my desire to play it halfway through Chapter 2 (of 4 current, and 5 planned).  Little RPG to it, mostly repetitive tactical battles.  Impossibly difficult battles with only ""one solution"" burn you out quickly when the game is 99.9% battles.			"

												Altough I love RPG games I am really dissapointed in this one. Ok this is rather a strategy game than an RPG, but it even fails at that. There are virtually no strategy options on the battlefield. Attack or cast spell. If you are a fighter you stuck with the first option, and hope for some decent damage. Most damage I did was around 9. Enemies constantly do damage over 10+. And spellcasters fizzle their spells 50% of the time. Combine this with the fact that you can't even cast spell out of combat (eg: no healing). And you get this complicated luck based game, with 0 fun factor.			"

												I bought this game having read a lot of the reviews. I was expecting it to be primarily centered around hex-grid combat. I knew this and dived in - I love games like HoMM and Kings Bounty. Other reviews have mentioned that the game is essentially battle to battle, with a few static village screens thrown in to try and create a background. Even so, I was expecting so much more. Everything in the game seems to have been implemented with the minimum amount of thought. There are relatively few upgradable skills and I found it fairly easy to just divide skill groups between party members and max them out fairly early in the game. Other reviewers have mentioned difficulty spikes in certain battles and this is occassionally true - some of the early battles are harder than the 'legendary' arena battles you have to overcome later on.Actually, one of the main sticking points for me was the distinct lack of equipment - or at least variety of equipment. If the game is going to be based entirely around battles, surely you should feel like winning is going to bring some great bounty, but in the end all you get is a pair of boots and 5 coins, or whatever. There aren't even any item conditions to mix things up (rusty swards, superior buckler, etc). The amount of XP you get after a battle seems to bear very little resemblence to its difficulty either. All of this leaves the game without any reason for you to be excited or want to carry on into the next battle (apart from the inherent addictiveness of turn-based RPG combat). You feel like maybe you should be progressing the story, but I also found the story boring for the most part, apart from a few of the cut-scene events. I recently bought the Baldurs Gate 2:EE and played for a few hours, the contrast in characterisation is ludicrous - straight away I was enjoying the quips and comments from party members - while the characters in Blackguards just aren't really memorable, I found myself interested at the beginning, but raply lost interest, either through poor writing or due to the incredibly slow pace of storytelling.Overall, I felt there weren't really any redeeming features for Blackguards - sure its graphically competent (although by no means pretty), sure the combat and strategy is acceptable (but by no means exciting or ground breaking in any way), sure the character concepts are interesting, but they just don't go anywhere. It's all a bit of a muddle really.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a RPG(RNG) Turn based strategy game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a difficulty level settings available.You are able to toggle the tutorial.There is a master volume slidebar available and it is also % based.There is a music volume slidebar available and it is also % based.There is a effect volume slidebar available and it is also % based.There is a voice volume slidebar available and it is also % based.There are some different resolution sizes available.About the game.Before you are able to play your game, they will ask you if you do wish to be a Mage, Hunter or a warrior. Each class has their own advantage and disadvantage. This game is borderline... Well let's say uncreative. You click on a map location and that level will start. You are either fighting against an enemy or you are in a town. Once in a town you are able to buy/sell items at a shop, Rest to recover the stats, Talk to some people or even doing quest activities. Whenever you are fighting against an enemy the combat rules are pretty simple (It's like Heroes of might and magic). The battlefield is on a Grid and each unit take turns for their action. The character speed is known as ""initiative"" and the higher number, the faster a character is able to perform again in a battle. Sadly enough the game suffers from ""Random number generator"" in fights (Such as X-Com) which means, Even if you have a 95% attack chance against an enemy. Well jokes on you, The 95% is not really 95% as you are still missing pretty often. Your character is able to level up and they are able to learn new spells, talents and other things. They can be equipped with items to make them stronger in battles.Subtitles are voiced over. You are able to skip and fastforward it.Great Graphics.Turn based Combat.Decent story.Random number generated % based in battles.Character has some customiziation.There is a rules control overview.Alot of ingame tips/explainations.It has dialogues and cutscenes.Other things.The random number generator in turn based games is simply NOT WORKING and will always ruin the game. Xcom is a good example (MY OPINION) as the enemy always have a higher hit chance than you will ever get.So in short words. ""Combat mechanic is unfair towards the player as it is happening too often""-------------------I Give this game a 5/10			"

My first character was built to be a 2handed sword monster (blademaster style) but I have yet to find a two handed sword, which is a shame.

												Blackguards is a Turn-based, Tactical RPG, where you have the freedom to customize your character to your own playstyle.  You can roll a Hunter, Warrior, or Mage, and cross train each if you choose. You will lead up to five characters whom you save or recruit on your travels to help you in your quest. Blackguards has a dark story, which may not be suitable for the very young gamer, but teenage gamers have seen a lot worse on television. Visually speaking, Blackguards looks beautiful, it is well designed, intricate and detailed. There are over 100 different scenes, each as detailed well designed as the last. While I am not a huge fan of turn-based play, this was a very fun game I could come back to again.			"

												I have bought this game, as it was early access. I have played each chapter, which came out, until the end. I have spent 48 hours of my life for this ... game. During of the game play I was trying to find only one word for me to describe the whole game. Finally, after the final chapter ended, I have found this word of ""banishment"": annoying!I would say this game is a typical example where a good idea meets bad story and bad implementation. I would not recommend to buy it, even if it would be on sale for only 9,95.. The fights are nice but only because they are turn based... the so-called story is meaningless... there is no good gear to buy... I would even say it is not even needed, because all limited money will be spend on heal/mana potions, which costs 1-4 times more than any good/best gear or weapon.. The game is badly balanced or completely unbalanced at all.. The AI is sometimes very stupid, sometimes cheats badly... All spells/talents are worthless…I would say, a good game must be interesting and enjoyable... On my opinion, it does not suit for this one.Buy it, if you do not trust my words. Buy it, if you would like to make your own opinion. But do not say after that, that you have not been warned! "

Hearing some generic fantasy story, have a boring fight, buy items, repeat. It's like a really unexperienced dev team tried to create their first TBS. Can't recommend. Buy Divinity: Original Sin instead; this is worth your money.Oh, and the mages suck. Failing their casting check all the time.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  I am a big fan of D&D and have played more RPGs than I can count.  I am also a huge fan on XCOM and that style of strategy so this looked like a match made in game heaven.Alas it was not to be though.  Here is the good the bad and the ugly.Good:- Graphics are wonderful.- Voice acting is top-notch.- There ""appears"" to be a lot of character customizations.Bad:- Storyline beats you up in the second chapter and you lose your ""investment"" arbitrarily.  Sad really.- There really is a lack of ""strategy"" as you are at the whim of roll of the dice.  Not XCOM calibre, not even close.- $39.99?  I got is pre-release cheap.  Save your money it isn't worth that much.Ugly:- XCOM style strategy doesn't play as such.  Random roll really makes this a flawed game.  You can employ the exact same strategy move for move and breeze through a level, and other times get decimated.- There is no place to ""grind"" it out to build up your characters if you are so willing to do so.  Early in the game you will find yourself redoing levels because you got a bad roll and you haven't enough Ducats (money) to do what you need.- Some levels (first one) become closed the moment you go to another map.  There is no turning back until later.  A big map, but very linear and very unforgiving.You have to REALLY love D&D style play to get into this game.  It will take a while to get used to, and even longer to become skilled at this game.  It feels more like work and less like fun.I would not buy this game again.			"

												I would first like to pre-face this review by saying that I bought this Deluxe version and Blackguards 2 as part of the Daedalic bundle for £9.99, making each game in effect worth £4.99 to me. Based on this price I think Blackguards is definitely worth it. The full price of £29.99 is however WAY off the mark for the amount of game you get (hint: not much) Despite me finishing the game in 40 hours, it is a very combat focused where pretty much every event you’ll encounter will be a fight. Whilst this is fun to begin with, as a lot of battle maps are quite interesting, after 20 odd hours it just got tiresome. After every cut scene, conversation, exploration, etc I knew I would be fighting something. So you can imagine my utter delight when after defeating the final boss, the final cut-scene was just that a cut-scene!Outside of combat there is unfortunately very little to the game, hence I only recommend it at a steep discount. There is no exploration to speak off, the town screens are static and the story kind of gets lots amongst 180 fight scenes you’ll have to slog through. I also have a few gripes about the story, but these could just be personal preferences. For example, I don’t see how this is a “dark” story as it seems very much like any other RPG where you-are-our-only-hope-to-save-the-world story (spoiler: you save it). Also this games is called Blackguards and makes the point of your character being an outlaw. I was picturing more of a vagabond, a mercenary on the run, or some petty thief down and on his luck. What I wasn’t expecting however was for my character to be buddies with a PRINCES whilst chilling at a home of a COUNT in the first “memory” cutscene. Less of a BlackGuard, more of a Brodude! Also in this game you have no meaningful choice – it really just railroads you along the main story-line with some side-quests where you have a choice between killing guy A or guy B... with no impact on main story-line. A lot of negative reviews about this game are regarding the dodgy RNG, and whilst I have encountered some odd miss on a 95% chance, I have never experienced a 3 in a row miss. If you read the manual and understand how the rules work. The % you see isn’t the % to inflict damage, but rather to do an action, then the enemy gets a couple of saving rolls – parry / dodge. So you might have successfully rolled an action, but then the enemy might have rolled a saving throw and so all you see is your guy missing or spell fizzing out.			"

On top of being a fairly flat story filled with shallow characters and bad dialogue the story is a piece of misogynistic crap. Female victimization, female alienation and the male sidekicks being posterboys for hypermasculinity (no exceptions!

												I have not been so bored with a game in a very long time. Blackguards is a hex turn based rpg type game, with much less of the traditional rpg feel and much more of the board game elements. As a genre, it’s not my cup of tea but I can see why people enjoy the thoughtful strategy of it.Playing Blackguards felt sort of like playing a chess match over and over again with the outcome being nearly entirely based on luck. Perhaps it boils down to the visuals not being all that visceral, but even things like positioning relative to the enemy seems to have no effect on combat outcomes. In the hour and a halfish I played I did little more than click on enemies and wait to either win or have to reload. It was as if the game was trying to distance itself from me.Definitely not a recommendation on any of my lists; if I wanted a strategic RPG I’d reinstall Neverwinter Nights, if I wanted a board game I’d find a free online chess game.

												I really like this game, the graphics and animations are tight, very fluid, the engine behind the battles is great, very roll of the dice feel. The game is hard and challenging but at the same time very relaxing and good for a quiet night of gaming.  The only problem i would have with it is that the inventory weight is shared between all the heroes and the fact u cant equip items mid battle, i get why you cant but its still bothersome when i need a certain item and cannot get it, or am thrown into an unknown battle without prep time, otherwise this game is sick. The way you level and gain skills/spells for each character is very neat too! I realy enjoy the story, you feel for the characters and when u get hit hard you cringe and rethink all your stratagies for that fight.  This game is fantastic i recommend that everyone try this at least once.			"

												I wasn't sure what to review this game, but I thought a thumbs down would get the attention this comment merits as an OG gamer.  The biggest problem is that the harder settings make experience points go down and the mission harder...  breaking the standard expectation of harder missions and more experience that I wanted.  I don't want to go through on uber hard mode and end up with a nerfed character.  I suppose the other problem, and if you're thinking balancing trouble is the deal with the criticism, I know, I've thought of that, the problem is that you're pigeon holed into one kind of min/max or maybe two if you want to beat the game on hard.  This, to me, is not acceptable, lol.But, also, not that the difficulty setting thing means that, when you finally have to switch back to normal to kill the gators with your incorrectly min/maxed character build, you might have to make the disgusting decision to set it to easy...  which I know a lot of gamers like me just cannot fathom, lol.I suppose this brings me to another failure of modern gaming...  it's not like and can grind out another level in the middle of the story, which I would love to do rather than abandon my character... but why nerf my powers when I have it on hard, really...

												A good turn-based RPG game. Graphics, sound, music and story are good. This plays similarly to X-Com combined with Original Sin (and is about as difficult as X-Com, with a mercilous RNG).  Lots of puzzle maps to figure out, and battle maps are very unique, and beautiful. There are a few things to look out for: it's totally possible to build your character in a way that will make it difficult, if not impossible to finish the game. Each character needs to focus on their strengths and ignore superfluous stats/abilities. The kicker is the stats on your characters, and the gear do not make it abundantly clear how you should build characters, what stats do, how much better gear Y is than gear X, etc. I suppose if you are familiar with the system this game is based on, it all makes sense, but if not, you will be confused and probably have to rely on guides and forums.

Os personagens são ótimos, as vozes são ótimas e você se pega viciado no jogo sem perceber. EU costumo jogar, quando muito, duas horas por dia. Bem, com Blackguards eu joguei 9 horas em dois dias.

												Great game, took decent amount of time (40 Hrs) to beat story (side quests too). Wait for it to go on sale.Pros-Endgame is really fun when your characters start to synergize after building them up.-Great stat customization-Tactical RPGCons-Basically no character designer (art)-RNG will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Sometimes it says 100% chance and you still somehow miss.-No random fights to raise get money or make your characters stronger.-No character choices, you get and lose certain people who are a specific type of character (mage/figher/hunter) And theres no way to prevent losing characters.

												First of all I want to say that I dont regret buying the game (discount) . 8 / 10Pros:- challenging- good variety of battles (win conditions, interactive objects, environment, enemies)- multiple ways to win battles depending on your party- amusing dialogue- not a single crash the whole time I played and no other bugs- good lengthMinor Cons:- awkward character development / training and AP gain curve (the currency you improve your charaters with)- small selection of armor (lets just say I didnt equip my 2 casters with new clothing until the last chapter)- not many weapons either (many special spears, only 1 or 2  improved versions of other weapontypes)Tipps & Tricks (light spoiler warning): - do not rely heavily on the Niam character- make sure your fighters are good with secondary blunt/slash weapon set (for skeletons and crystals)- make use of the ability to delay your actions with a character by using the space-key (sometimes being the first to move is critical, but other times you want your enemies to move first, so you can move then and hit them- dramatically increase your chances to hit enemies via wounding them, poisons, knock them down / incapacitate them, attack them with a weak character first so they lose their parade- have a caster who can cast axxeleratus level 3- poison your weapons before entering a hard battle (you dont want to waste a turn to poison your weapons in battle)- use savegames to try out different spells if you have a lot of saved up AP, some are turds but others can really shine / decide a battle (the beserk one can be very good, lightning cloud too)- get your casters best possible manaregen via gear / talents, maybe archery as a secondary profession "

												Not good at reviews so I'll keep this breif.  The randomness of this game is just too high.  I had to restart fight after fight and the increadibly long load times are very annoying.  With my attack power maxed (hit rate) I still miss or get dodged/parried 50% to 60% of the time which just makes for a really long and teadous fight.  Outside of this the overall game is good I'd give it about a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10 so guess I would recommend it.  Though if you don't like watching your characters die over and over due to just really bad machanics, I wouldn't play this.  The late game has the other team with casters and 100% spell everytime and no amount of resist seems to work			"

												I really enjoyed this game!There are a lot of missed opportunities, but I got a nice introduction to the Dark Eye universe.I got it for $5.5 and played for ~30 hours (and to be fair I didn't look for a super long challenge, I wanted a game I could finish in less than a week, so I played in easy mode).The biggest frustration I've had, came from the loading screens. Simply put, any change in location (Map, Street, Battlefield) will have to go through a loading screen. It gets old very quickly.The character customisation is not necessarily the strongest point of this game, with only one character entirely customisable (the main character), and a few different companions pre-defined, there won't be enough room to craft a custom team.That being said, I understand that it is better suited for someone new to the genre. Personally I didn't mind it too much.I enjoyed the introduction to the Dark Eye's universe and while I would probably not play through this game a second time, I got a fair share of entertainment for a very low cost and I am considering getting into the tabletop version.

												Maybe this game will get better, but I think eight hours is enough to get a feel for a game.So far this game is frustrating in the extreme. The developers got more things wrong than they got right. First of all, the game is extremely unbalanced. This wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't also extremely tough. I'm sure some people will say that they found the game to be too easy, but that would only serve to prove my point, the game is very unbalanced. If you pick the wrong attributes to improve (and how would you know which ones are best), you can get stuck.The interface is also very clumsy. It appears that the developers have abandoned the game to move on to Blackguards 2. Overall the game is a tough slog, all frustration and no fun.I've formally been a real fan of Daedalic, I've bought a lot of their games. But lately most of their games have been really poor.			"

												7.5/10Blackguard is a very fun turn-based strategy game. You will come to love most of the characters. The dialogues are simply amazing. Your party members are exactly what you expect your most extreme type of role-playing friends to be during a sesstion of a tabletop game like DnD.""I AM A MAGICIAN OF LOVE. I WILL SEDUCE EVERYONE!"" and then you get into battle because he fails all of his seduction.Everyone takes it to the extreme. One is hella dumb, funny and racist toward the elves. Another is just always sarcastic and mean most of the time.That covers most of the story telling. Let's get into the gameplay.THEDARNTHINGWILLTRY TO BREAK YOU.The hex-based map is great.The game using the ""automated diceroll"" system as if you were playing an actual table top is great.Problem though is that the other side cheats way too often for you to really enjoy the combat.Somes of them are insanely easy.And the next one is just demanding you to either get the spell to work on a 50% rate at the start of the turn with the follow up attack from your friends hitting everything on the first turn or you might as well retry the battle.And to make it worse. Everything, except for some of the weak fodders, are either as strong as you or much stronger than you. It's funny the first few time you see a lizardman sniping your team with a javelin better than your archer can shoot someone with his bow but after about 2 to 3 hits, it stops being funny because they deal much more damage than you do and even has additional effects until you manage to get to a certain point where you can finally learn your cheap spamming moves too just to destroy everything.And ""HARD"" mode isn't even hard. It's just frustrating and cheating. Usually, in a strategy game, repeating the same failed strategy oftens lead to the same fail result. However, in Blackguards, repeating the same strategy is what you do until you finally roll enough damage and hit rate to actually carry out that strategy, and that the environment isn't messing with you. RNG governs everything. Mobs are predictable but overstat as heck that they will deal your critical-like damage on a normal hit so you just have to retry over and over until the 35% hit rate on them actually miss instead of hitting 3 times in a row while your 90-95% are still missing over and over, or dealing minimal damage when it actually hits, leaving the mobs with 1 hp.Because this game offers no between-combat regen so sometime, delaying a battle to 60 turns + is necessary although you can end it in 7. It wasn't challenging. It was just the game forcing me to repeat the ""Whole map kite"" for the next 10 minutes just to full heal the whole team. At normal or so, this isn't always necessary. I can try with 75% health and mana on the next map. On hard? You better be full or you might as well restart the whole battle chain.But that's really the annoying part and it can easily be somewhat remedied by just setting the mode to ""Normal"" unless you're ready to go through pointless self-torture that makes you want to ragequit because of a single crit or a slip on an overstat mob forcing an instaretry. Other than that, I see nothing wrong with this game. People often makes fun of the voice acting but it's only horrible on the trailer. The in-game voice acting is so much better and really fit the situation when the characters are trying to be mean or sarcasting, which isn't really something you can see on the trailer.I also recommend getting the big pack. The artbook is simply amazing.			"

												Let me just start by saying that this game is really great but the devs DON'T deserve any bit of your money!Pros:    -Story was really good    -Loved the gameplay(turn based combat and how cities were handled)    -Lots of sidequests    -Really nice char development ""tree""Cons:    -There are known bugged achievements(0.2% players have this) that noone can seem to get and also there are some achivs that some ppl get and other can't get even tho they did the same things that ppl who got em did..    -Forums are full of achiv problems and noone has heard anything from the developers for a long time(for at least 6 months if not more)    -The world map is huge wich is really great BUT this game takes place on only like 30% of the map the other 70% might be used in the sequel so that kinda sucked cos I was really looking foward to playing even more of the game but then I just went to the last chapter    -The main hero has 4 male and female char models, they could have made it a lil bit more customisableConclusion:A great game sadly ruined by sh*t developers who dont care. I would totally recomend this game and definitely buy BG 2 when it come out in Jan 2015, but with devs like this there is NO WAY I'm getting BG 2 or recommending this cos they deserve everything but your money! -.-			"

												Great game - FUN. I recommend this game if you like turn-based tactical RPG's. Overall the game is a fun experience. The biggest aspect of this game is gameplay and story. Other strengths such as atmosphere and tone create a nice world. Great soundtrack as well. Couple things to point out. The world map movement is point and click/adventure, which I did not expect to enjoy so much at first. This creates a little slower pacing then I am used to in other RPG's. Just kick back and relax during world map movement and you'll learn to enjoy it. Customization can be a ""gift or a curse,"" depending on your personality. Personally, the party customization screens were cumbersome and confusing for the first 5-8 hours. If you get overwhelemed at charcter customization screen, I recommend going with the default builds, or research other builds online for direction. Try not to waste allocating points until you decide on a main build. By the end of Chapter 1 you can handle all of the customization options though. If you love stats and numbers, you will no doubt enjoy the customization. Sometimes battles take party-management prep work before you engage. Overall the game is a good experience and I recommend it if you enjoy turn-based RPG's. Great story involvment. The game has a slower pacing, but this is not a bad thing. Just relax and enjoy the world, story, and gameplay! "

												I too was excited about this game. It had a great intro video, and looked crisp. I have enjoyed rpg's since I tried Might & Magic 7. That game had a pretty long learning curve with no proper introduction and my younger self had no idea of the concept of doing quests for xp. But slowly I got stronger and stronger, and I learned my way trough the game.Every time I encounter games without tutorials or hints to character building, I think of myself learning to play M&M7, thinking I just need to invest a few hours and things will clear up.So me and a friend bought Blackguards, and played it both. He is older than me and I got a lot of grief from him, when I complained about the learning curve and difficulty. He said I am from a time when games are easy and I am a spoiled gamer.That seems to be the issue here. People throw grief at the people not willing to spend 13 replays of a fight. Probably because they did 13 replays and want the rest of us to suffer the same. I play games to have fun, and Blackguards gives me no pleasure.Am I a spoiled gamer? Maybe I am! Maybe I just dont want to sit and redo the same battle 13 times in a row. That gives me no pleasure! It does trigger a lot of screaming at the computer, cursing and pulling out hair. Maybe I am a spoiled gamer, but I would much rather chop off my arms than play any more than 8 hours of Blackguards.			"

Posted: January 6, 2015
												I really tried to like this game, in spite of reading very mixed reviews. Alas, I ended up quite frustrated with a few aspects that are quite game (and immersion) breaking:1. losing vital companions at crucial times makes party build options very limited. Essentially, once you figure out what will happen to X, you need to rethink your entire strategy for party build. This sometimes means restarting from scratch, or a very earlier save, as party build is very important in some of the encounters (especially the main ones)2. lack of clothing for non-metal wearing characters - while there are several pretty good sets of armour for warriors, the (complete) lack of mage oriented outfits is a bit mind baffling. I could not fathom that no mage outfits EVER dropped, although you battle many mages wearing unique outfits. And none can be bought. As a consequence, you mage characters have to either wear horrible looking leather armour, or spend a lot of time buffing/running/dying. This is also important for...3. almost 100% spell failure when wearing metal armour. I can accept offensive spells (cast outward) failing, but having a healing/self-buff spell have a <25% of success is nonsense. So playing as a battle mage/arcane warrior/cleric type role is pretty much out of the question4. tedious battles - which can go on for a long time, with a lot of time sitting, and staring at the screen while seemingly endless hordes of critters/monsters/lice/etc. go thought their turns. Even tentacles get their own turns, and usually have a higher initiative than your party...5. endgame decision disasters - going back to #1 - at the end game you find out that you are 'supposed to' have made certain vital conversation decisions with one companion, otherwise they will be lost, which as mentioned before, can be a disaster for the party.So, if you want to play this:a) read the guides and build a cooky cutter type that the developers had in mind, andb) follow a pro-forma discussion template to placate one party member, or lose them at a crucial stage (or build with their loss in mind)c) have a good book/magazine handy to read during battles, as you otherwise stare at the screen waiting endlesslyPity, had potential			"

												I never really liked the whole ""Yes/No"" recommentation. A game shouldn't be decided if it is loved or hated solely based on other's experiences but rather on if it is appealing to you. With that said I gave it a Yes since even though it does has it flaws, I personally enjoyed it. Now to the nitty gritty part.What this game is (if you couldn't tell already) is a turn based DnD style type of game and it is heavily based on DnD mechanics. For those that don't know DnD, Here is a quick breakdown on how combat works: Roll for initiative (i.e. RNGesus happens at the beginning of each battle to determine who goes first), move characters around the map and you can do an action like attack, cast a spell, drink a potion or place a trap. Or you can just wait until your next turn. This process continues until every character has made a move/action. Then it is back to the top and you keep taking turns and making actions until either you or the enemy is dead.Now, keep in mind that this game is RNGesus based and that even though you have 90% chance to hit that doesn't mean you'll hit..just like DnD. To keep this short...also my spelling is bad...Pros: Interesting characters, combat is intuitive and changes per environment (i.e. environment interaction), very challenging scenarios (for those that like to get kicked around). Cons: Very challenging scenarios (for those that want to get spoon fed victory), Character customization is limited (you can create a rouge/mage or a hunter warrior but you can't create something like a palidin where you hit people in the faces with maces and then cast cure. Reason being is that wearing heavy ""Metallic"" armor takes away your ability to cast spells and regen mana. This is a con for me because I wanted to roll a palibro). Keep in mind if you do a split class like rouge/mage you will have more skills/abilities however you won't be as strong as a pure rouge or a pure mage.			"

												So I have only played this game for a few hours, but I think what I have learned already will not change throughout the course of the game.Blackguards is a hard, challenging game, it is most certainly fun and the voice actors REALLY make this game a story to be part of, I simply love them. Now, don't get me wrong here, I'm all for % chances to hit, finding tactical ways to defeat the enemy and such, however I really resent the constant <70% chance to hit, and even at 70-90% I've had several times alredy where I do this action 3-4 times and each hit has missed (or failed)(not including piercing to skeletons etc.)Therefor this game is very inconsistent in how any battle will turn out even by using the same movements and actions each time, and this kind of (almost) luck based combat makes Blackguards very hard to want to play again.HOWEVER, I would recommend this game to anyone with the inclusion of this shortcoming.

												I was really excited to play this hoping it'd be XCOM in a fantasy world.  While the combat and graphics are similar, this game just lacks a lot of the depth of XCOM.  There's almost no point to the skill trees because each character will just use the same attack skills for the whole game, most skills are passives anyway, and the others are so situational it's not worth it.  There's really no role-playing choices outside of your character ""build"" which is pretty shallow and one decision at the end.  The few characters that you get to play with have some personality which is cool but there's too few of them and one of them is taken away almost immediately.  The combat is pretty simplified with basic line of sight rules and dice rolls which almost never go in your favor if 60% or less.  Also, as a completionist, it was really annoying that some of the quests / achievements are bugged.  The only reason I recommend this is if you are like me and itching for a Tactical Turn Based Strategy RPG-lite game this will hold you over but don't expect to get blown away.			"

												Finished this game about 2 weeks ago.  Wish I had reviewed it sooner when it was fresh in my mind but here it goes.The difficulty is very high and there is a ton of content to explore over 5 chapters.Can't stress this enough.  If you are easily frustrated you may not enjoy this game.But it sure does feel good when Naurim wins the battle with only a few points of health left, or when you manage to outrun that damn poison mist :)Story is good, I got really into it from the beginning.  You are trying to investgate the murder of the princess and its possible you are the killer.  As you play more of the story is revealed.Some good walkthroughs can be found online if you feel the game is too hard, but basically whatever character type you go for you need to invest in one weapon skill to at least 14-16 to avoid missing most of the time.  Also its a good idea to save your experience points until you absolutely need to spend it, and its a good idea to plan ahead what kind of skills and spells you want to invest in as experience points are limited and there is no going back once you purchase a skill.Don't be afraid to turn the game to easy in order to enjoy the game :)  I did in some parts and its a great RPG experience.

												I saw a bunch of reviews posted bashing how hard this game is, do not be fooled, I am on normal difficulty (which is on by default) and I breezed past the entire first part of the game and made it to the world map with no problems at all.I am not sure what they mean by ""only one way to play"" it would be nice to know what gave them such trouble.. maybe they tried the game using the ""basic"" setting instead of ""expert"".. I opted for expert because I wanted to adjust my own stats and skills.. the game is pretty straightforward, you read all your stats.. it tells you what stuff does.. its basically D&DThe story is also pretty interesting, the game is sure to be a good adventure ahead.. don't listen to the silly people saying its too hard to click on things.. not to mention you can always restart a battle.. the ONLY thing I do not like is that you cannot take back your movement actions once you have made them and its still your turn.. but it will tell you if you click the spaces BEFORE you confirm what your attacks and stuff can hit.

												To be honest, I don't know where the mediocre ratings come from. I had huge amounts of fun with this game. Since update 1.3 you get all the combat feedback you need.If you like turn-based strategy with a touch of RPG you owe it to yourself to give this a shot. The Dark Eye might lean more towards a generic fantasy setting, but I really like the European ""style"" and love the level system. You will probably have to get used to it, if you are unfamiliar with it, but it gives you great depth and customization opportunities. I for one, can't wait to get my hands on Blackguards 2 in 2015!			"

												This is a turn based tactics game where you control (after about 30 hours gameplay) up to 5 heroes who walk between nodes on a world map in a very linear way and follow a more or less entertaining story (At least I found some of the dialogue mildly enjoyable). Some nodes are cities where you may learn skills, buy equipment, and get/perform quests, other nodes are quest nodes that may sometimes be skipped. Most of the time is however spent in  hexagon based maps fighting various bad guys. The game has a lot of skills and stats that you may experiment with, but mostly it makes little difference what you chose to skill up (For spells any nuke will do, some early bosses are weak to fire, but it makes little difference for most enemies, a healing spell is pretty much required, you will alternate between those two and auto attacks for the whole game), and as most stats and skills are needed in the end anyway the customization adds little depth to a shallow game. The major problem with Blackguards is that fights are mostly based on luck. Want to attack someone? Well, usually you have a 90% chance to hit (not bad, but that's as good as it gets unless someone is knocked down), but if you use a more powerful attack it might drop down to 85%, 70%, or 60% (based on dodge stat vs dexterity I think), further reduced with wounds that are randomly obtained when taking damage (I think your to hit chance can potentially go all the way down to 30%). If you manage to hit at all the damage dealt is then further randomed in a fairly large spread, and rarely it will crit for double damage. The damage is fairly high, so 3-4 good attacks is enough to drop most enemies and heroes.This means that missing more than a few attacks will result in one of your heroes getting knocked unconscious, and the enemies snowball from there.It's typically the enemies who get the good dodge stats, so while your heroes will mostly take full damage from anything that attacks them late game, your heroes will miss, miss, miss,miss, and miss some more as you watch them slowly die in frustration. The game's ""difficulty"" slowly ramps up as you play. Every encounter is level (in)appropriate, so every fight is a challenge. Since spell damage is fixed your magic users slowly get weaker after their 2 main spells hit level 3. While this makes sense in a way you will never get to be satisfied with how much stronger your heroes have gotten. Enemies have about the same stats and skills and do about as much damage as the heroes do, so fights vary little in practise between various encounters.The game could still be a mildly enjoyable grind with the above mentioned issues, but clearly the devs were obsessed with making the game into a never ending series of encounters by a power tripping DM trying to make your party lose.I got through several unfair fights like Running past all the enemies who get to hit you for free for 6 turns to get to the girl before she's killed, shoot a giant tree with 150 hp to death with arrows that each do 1 dmg because it 2 shots everything in melee range, run through a basement filled with traps to get to the guy you need to kill before he gets away, kill the necromancer who's surrounded by unkillalbe skeletons that block your spells and arrows, and many many more. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the fight against the tiger lilly where one of your heroes is turned against you, you have to run up to a plant that always has a 60% hit chance, is immune to magic damage, every turn one of your heroes is knocked down, and 5-6 tentacles you're not supposed to kill get to attack your heroes freely while blocking off healing spells you might want to cast on the hero being bullied.I understand that something like this was necessary to make the game interesting, as the fights by themselves clearly aren't. With a different combat system these fights might have been fun, but in Blackguards you will just keep doing the right thing again and again untill it finally works and you get to go on. So, TL;DR: Turn based fights heavily based on luck, little customization in practise despite the wealth of options available, you get weaker as you keep on playing, and gimmicky fights where the devs metaphorically throw your miss chance and weakness in your face again and again by setting up scenarios that force you into doing stupid things over and over untill the RNG gods decide that you may finally pass. If it sounds like your cup of tea then you will probably enjoy Blackguards, but I did not.			"

												It should be noted that I picked up this game in a sale at a discounted price, my opinion is based on me paying about £18 for it rather than the full price. I think it is likely that my opinion on this game would change if I had forked out £30 for it.I knew about Daedlic's point and click games like Deponia so I was interested to see what their take on a RPG would be like. As it is something that I almost expect in a RPG nowdays it is important to state that this game is very linear. If you are expecting something like Dragon Age you are going to be very disapointed (to be fair expecting all RPGs to be like Dragon Age will invaribly lead to disappointment). Also I think the game description is a bit misleading, you and your companions do have a slight criminal air about yourselves but at the end of the day it is standard save the world type stuff, nothing too ground breaking.The game has three main views, the first is the world overview you use for travelling around. This is basically a map type view with marker locations for villages, towns, places of interest etc... To move around you click on where you want to go and jump to that location - so no player controlled wilderness exploration or anything like that. The next view is the ""town view"". This is pretty much a static view where you can click on characters to buy goods or obtain/advance quests. The final view is the battle view, this is a map split up into small hexagons where the player controlled combat takes place. These battle maps range in size, though none are particularly huge. They consist of different environments and obstacles that sometimes require a change in tactics for some scenarios. Combat is turn based attack and move type stuff with close combat with swords, axes, maces etc..., ranged with bows and crossbows and ranged with magic. The combat can get a bit repetitious but there is enough in there that it does not feel too much a grind.You get to pick one of three classes for your main character, a mage, a rogue/archer type or a fighter. On levelling up you pick attributes and combat skills and there is the freedom to create hybrid classes by giving your archer some mage abilities for example. I did find though that each class tends to have one particularly powerful skill or skill combo that you will just tend to repeat in combat.The game itself has a lot of good and bad points, it is quite a mixed bag but there is probably going to be something in there that does end up annoying you, it certainly is not perfect. How much that thing annoys you is probably the defining factor in whether you will ultimately enjoy the game or not. For me it was with the combat, there are some monsters which are only vunerable to one type of damage. However, ahead of the battle you do not necessarily know what type of monster you will be fighting so in my case I frequently had everyone inflicting either piercing or magic damage. That was my best set up given my characters, weapons and prefered skills. However, in some fights monsters will be invulnerable to piercing so you have to quit the game reload and re-equip characters with maces so you can inflict bashing damage. Nothing game breaking but it did really get annoying, you learn pretty early on to have back up weapons handy and make sure your party is at least a bit flexible. You can look on that as somewhat of a positive as my party was really not set up for those particular battles so it did add an extra challenge, making what should have been an easy fight a bit more difficult. I think one other problem that needs highlighting is the party make up. You have a limited number of companions that you can recruit, essentially there is one party for the game. You do not get to deicde if you would rather have a mage or a fighter in your party you get what your are given. I do not want to spoil anything but at some point in the game something happens that means that really to fill a specific gap in your party your main character needs to be a specific class. Luckily I chose this class anyway so it was not a problem in my play through. If I had selected a different class it may have negatively effected my opinion of the game.On the positive side I liked the story (the ending is a bit meh but nothing too objectionable) and found the characters interesting with some nice back story and different personalities. By the end I found myself invested in the story and felt fairly satisfied with the experience on completion. You do get some ""choices with consequences moments"" that give you a sense of control over how the story plays out. My play through took me 26 hours and I pretty much did everything quest wise in the game.I would recommend this game but I did pay about £18 for it. if I had paid the full retail price I would probably not recommend it as I think at that price some of the problems I have glossed over would have seemed a lot more annoying. My advice is to pick this up if you see it discounted as on the whole it is a relatively enjoyable experience. However, at full price there a lot better RPGs out there and I would be a lot less forgiving of the game's flaws.			"

												Maybe this game will get better, but I think eight hours is enough to get a feel for a game.So far this game is frustrating in the extreme. The developers got more things wrong than they got right. First of all, the game is extremely unbalanced. This wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't also extremely tough. I'm sure some people will say that they found the game to be too easy, but that would only serve to prove my point, the game is very unbalanced. If you pick the wrong attributes to improve (and how would you know which ones are best), you can get stuck.The interface is also very clumsy. It appears that the developers have abandoned the game to move on to Blackguards 2. Overall the game is a tough slog, all frustration and no fun.I've formally been a real fan of Daedalic, I've bought a lot of their games. But lately most of their games have been really poor.			"

												This game as a lot of potential the gameplay is engaging and the game offer a good challenge which isn't something that can be said from most RPG. I would recommend this game if you have a lot of free time because the battle (which is 95% of the game) are super long. You'll spend a lot of time waiting for your turn. If you are used to turn base table top game like DND heres some insight. Most of the  fighting involves around 15-20 mobs each time each critters moves around... one at a time and if you use the environnement most of the time you will block some path and they will just move around back and forth.. Its a major inconvenient ... the development team had really nice ideas of dynamic and unique fights that are really awesome, but most of the time even nice creative challenge will bore you because of the heavy and painful waiting turn... if only mobs could play all at once it would have been easier to bear. +great gameplay +animation are great +variety of spell and special action are nice +action centered game (not much time wasted on story) + innovative and creative fights + engaging strategy must be used to win + difficulty is good + good AI------ WAITING TIME for turn IS AWFUL and ruins the game			"

												A good turn-based RPG game. Graphics, sound, music and story are good. This plays similarly to X-Com combined with Original Sin (and is about as difficult as X-Com, with a mercilous RNG).  Lots of puzzle maps to figure out, and battle maps are very unique, and beautiful. There are a few things to look out for: it's totally possible to build your character in a way that will make it difficult, if not impossible to finish the game. Each character needs to focus on their strengths and ignore superfluous stats/abilities. The kicker is the stats on your characters, and the gear do not make it abundantly clear how you should build characters, what stats do, how much better gear Y is than gear X, etc. I suppose if you are familiar with the system this game is based on, it all makes sense, but if not, you will be confused and probably have to rely on guides and forums.

												I got this game during the humble bundle that was put up a few months ago, so I'm writing this review accordingly. In other words, if I had bought this game at the full price tag of $39.99, I'd probably be more inclined to hit ""Not Recommended"". But on sale, I think it's a good game that will definitely keep you playing for a couple of hours at a time if you don't have high standards of character. That being said, you will probably not be interested enough to keep playing this on a binge where you spend hours on end.The tactics style gameplay is pretty neato. That's... about all I can say about that part of the game. It doesn't really add anything to it or really borrow from some more advanced takes on it like XCOM: You've got area-of-effect attacks, you've to melee attacks, you've got ranged attacks. Don't expect to have any innovative takes on cover-combat, field of vision, and so on. The characters are decent. Not really involved enough that I'd say I particularly cared about any of them one way or another, but not bland enough that I wasn't at least interested in seeing where they fit in the story. The character you kind of play as doesn't seem to really have a major stance on anything minus how you decide to direct his dialogue, but it's one of those games where you're kind of your own guy and you kind of aren't. There's a lot of good side quests here and there that you are definitely going to want to do to keep yourself armed and leveled for the main questline.As for the main questline itself, there's really nothing that much to it. The game tries to differentiate itself from other RPG-style adventure games by having the cast of characters be completely unlikely heroes. You, the main character, find yourself traveling with two fellows (a stereotypical and somewhat superstitious dwarf and a casanova mage) who collectively break out of a prison. From there, your party's membership includes a drug-addict elf whose pretty good with a bow (I think she's an elf at least. She's got the ears), a tribal dude who was ready to kick your♥♥♥♥♥before, and a childhood friend who ended up becoming an (alleged) nymphomaniac witch. This seems like an interesting premise on the surface, but the game doesn't really apply itself that well. We don't really get much in on the character's pasts, and the interactions with the main character and the story are very limited. For a game that could've very well built onto a unique premise worthy enough of it being a constantly talked about title, the developers didn't really do much to apply themselves here, and I'm afraid that might still be the case for the sequel, Blackguards 2 as well (I haven't played it yet, so I won't judge).So basically, this game is good if it's on a really, really good sale and you're already into fantasy and tactical games, but aren't looking for anything too innovative on either ends.

												Blackguards is without a doubt a fun game for the old-school turn-based RPG-combat interested. It feels like a solid title through and through and it has hours of fun and enjoyment in it where you will be redoing battles over and over until you find the right strategy for them and beat them easily. This is definitely a challenging game with a lot of good sides to it, but it has one major flaw, and that is that it is far from complete and full of game-ending bugs. Expect to go somewhere and not being able to play if you make that choice because the game will crash if you make that certain turn, if you were lucky you had savegames prior to that choice, if not - then you have to start all over again.By game-breaking bugs I mean that when you reach a certain location, the game will just crash every single time you go there. Reloading the game won't help, it will continuously crash and if you had an old savegame you can get around it, otherwise you are screwed until they either fix it, or you move on to another game, alternatively give this game another try and remember what choice you made that led to the crashing.Unfortunately this is a dealbreaker for me, and while I did have a lot of fun, I didn't get to experience the game as I played it, and I refuse to go back to change how I played just because the game is unfinished. Supposedly it's going to be done this autumn, but I doubt there will be much more development on this title, they've been releasing a DLC for it already, and announced a sequel, which is underway. It's a pity that a title that has such great core mechanics get ruined in the details, but such is the way right now. It is quite possible that you do not run into these bugs, and have an excellent experience, but keep in mind, you might end up like me.  "

												Before playing this game I spend some time with Blackguards2, and ultimately decided to wasn't worth my time.  I fired up Blackguards 1 to see if the original got it any better.  Surprisingly, the first game has a better pace to it, things move along a bit faster and the story gets way.  The protagonists seems more interesting, at least to me, and my crew is certainly an improvement.Ultimately, the gameplay is still just so slow.  The combat and movement crawls like a snail.  Other titles like Banner Saga have succeeded quite well with turn-based combat. Pros144hz supportDecent graphics, art tends to look reasonably good, it will immerse you.It’s better than Blackguards2ConsEven though the game is turn based it needs to allow the user to speed things up a bit.  It takes far too long time to accomplish anything in the gameNo camera rotating?  Some objects are placed behind others with an obscured view.  It's not an isometric game so this is seemingly pointless limitation. Combat doesn't seem to have a lot of strategy to it. "

This game makes poking your eyes out with red hot pokers seem appealing.			"

												I'd really recommend avoiding this one.  I've already had to delete my game and start from scratch a couple times (which is amazing as I'm only at the beginning!)The game is extremely linear. You can just choose points on a map and your dot travels to that location for a battle. I just made it out of the first city and did the first optional quest (Giant tree monster in the swamp). The fight is literally impossible and it autosaved right at the beginning. Considering I spent quite a bit on this I might try again....but I don't really feel like taking the first optional quest in the game to try and gain some money was such a horrible mistake that I should have saved beforehand.

Combat became more about figuring out the trick to the map, rather than strategic play.

												Very enjoyable turn-based strategy game.  Easy to pickup, and a fun cast of characters that make your party. The core storyline is linear, but the battles are incredibly fun.  There is a lot of challenging battles, and plenty of easy battlse without a sweat.  It keeps the game tight toward the battle, because the overmap screen really gives you the chioce of what quests to pickup and what items to purchase, but there is not any unnecessary travel.  Essentially, you fast travel from location to location, and many times entering a battle at the various desitinations. There a few main enemies that show up multiple times, and adds to the drama.  However, the story is enjoyable, the battles at the last stage leading to the ultimate battle are quite good, however, the ending is a bit of let down.  However, that doesn't take away from everything they did to make this game awesome. If you like controlling your party for turn based D&D battles, you are going to love this game. :)			"

												Want to smash your monitor? than buy this game.if you have any range of spells they'll fail more often than not, also the percentage that it gives you as you casting chance means nothing, a 70% casting chance but it will fail four out of five times. rage quits everytime, especially when you get hard missions and your success is completely based on luck not tactics.so i restarted the whole game (because you have to max 3 specific stats just to make one spell actually work) and made a character that could cast 2 spells. how quickly does that get repetitive. you can't go and level your characters, there are no optional quests because the apparently optional ones are nessesary for you to get xp. it takes for ever to actually level enough to make it worth it to attempt casting a 3rd spell.i love rpg and turn based because it is about tactics not button mashing but the messed up casting just makes it all about non existant luck.

												The ap and loot system feels more like living real life as a poor person oppressed by over priced rent, wishing he could buy steak at the grocery store only able to eventually afford the spam.. But only after he spends a few more days cleaning urinals. The limited amount of story line options in general make this a lack luster experience for a RPG, as its pretty much linear. For a tablet game, playing this while traveling on a plane, would be a decent experience, for a pc game it serves to make me want to go back outside and spend time in the real world despite trying to escape from it for a moment. I do continue to play it, and yell words I dont want my mother to hear when I miss 95% chance to hits over and over while the archers on the enemy side hit with 5% chances. Reminds me of my childhood when I played ninja gaiden and swore the game cheated hahah.All that said, once you get across the border, things get a little more interesting and slightly more free. IF you can find this game on a deep sale, and love this sorta play style youll find it is an easy game to fill the void between what ever else you are doing with your life.			"

												I bought this game with a bundle of a lot of games by the same company, and didn't think much of it. I had seen the positive review by TotalBiscuit, but I was not sure I would like the genre.However, the game surprised me positively. The combat mechanics are well designed and implemented, and it makes the game fun and additive to play. Thanks to this good design, the game doesn't feel repetitive (even though most battles are very similar). It does also help that the battlegrounds are often different and sometimes with additional challenges.The lack of possibility for level-grinding can make the game sometimes spike in difficult (at one point I was forced to lower the difficulty setting in order to get past one point, as there was no way to level-grind my characters), but for the vast majority of the game the problems arising from this have been largely avoided. (There are many similar tactical games that have no level-grinding where it results in the game being exceedingly difficult, but this game successfully avoids it for the most part.)			"

At the beginning, I was as irritated as some others about the hit/miss chances, but it already had started to enthrall me with its dark story, the DSA system where you can add your earned EXP points (called AP) after every battle to increase skills and get better. However, what in the end really made this a great game are the many battles, more than I expected, and make it a rewarding experience. So its tactical RPG with a dark setting with nice enigh graphics to make you happy. Will definitely buy Blackguards 2 now.			"

												Pros:*Interesting system mechanics, with a LOT of depth to advancement.Cons:*Tutorial and Tips are useless.  I had been playing for over 2 hours (8+ combat missions) before I got a couple of the tips on how to do basic things.*Horrible camera system.  Unable to rotate the camera, forcing you to revert to top down view in many areas just to be able to see the hex map behind objects/allies/enemies.*No resource regeneration out of combat.  You can camp to restore Health and Astral points, which isn't bad, but when you hit one of the first major fight areas, you are prevented from camping.  You are forced to use town healers to restore HP out of combat, even if you have 2 mages with healing in your party.  No Astral Point (mana) regeneration outside of combat, even with talents that grant passive Astral Regen per turn, forcing you to use your very expensive Astral Potions to be able to actually use a mage character.*Treating injuries with bandages has a chance to fail (very high chance) outside of combat, and almost useless to try in combat (6% chance of success at first rank).*You are forced to buy belts to be able to carry many items into combat with you, but you are encumbered in combat by ALL the equipment in your bags, even you quest items and camping resources.*Almost no income, with horribly high priced item.  At one point, you are given a large amount of money and told to go to the armorer to get equiped to help defend a town.  The armorer has 1 type of armor, 2 sets of it, and you are given enough to buy 1 piece of equipment.  Not a set, 1 piece.  You have to choose between upgrading a single piece of heavy armor, or to buy Astral and Health potions.*Horrible UI.  Almost no explanations as to what means what, or as to how anything is calculated.  When comparing armor pieces, it does not compare piece to piece, only how it will change your whole, and armor/encumbrance always shows a penalty, even if it is an upgrade.*Horrible combat encounter design.  In many of the fights, all of the mobs will sit back throwing poisoned javelines at you, each of which hits your heavily armored character for 15-30% of his total HP, and also poisons him.  Was forced to use the fighter as a tank, both of my mages as pure healers, while slowly grinding down the mobs hp with my archer (arrows cost a lot, and have weight.  I overmaxed my encumbrance just from provisions, which you need to camp, and arrows alone).*Buff, healing and utility spells have default fail chance, which until you pick of a very very expensive talent, are almost impossible to cast (22% fail chance to heal an ally, 68% chance to fail to dispel a poison with a spell that only dispels poisons, 48% chance to fail to cast a ""wall"" spell, etc).  Combined with no innate astral regen, very low astral point pool and high astral point cost to cast makes playing a mage character feel like your being penalized for playing the game.			"

The story is engaging, the battles are fun and the difficulty scales to stay challenging.  I am glad I got this in a Humble Bundle and would have paid full price for it had I known how good it was.

												Want to smash your monitor? than buy this game.if you have any range of spells they'll fail more often than not, also the percentage that it gives you as you casting chance means nothing, a 70% casting chance but it will fail four out of five times. rage quits everytime, especially when you get hard missions and your success is completely based on luck not tactics.so i restarted the whole game (because you have to max 3 specific stats just to make one spell actually work) and made a character that could cast 2 spells. how quickly does that get repetitive. you can't go and level your characters, there are no optional quests because the apparently optional ones are nessesary for you to get xp. it takes for ever to actually level enough to make it worth it to attempt casting a 3rd spell.i love rpg and turn based because it is about tactics not button mashing but the messed up casting just makes it all about non existant luck.

												I bought this game with a bundle of a lot of games by the same company, and didn't think much of it. I had seen the positive review by TotalBiscuit, but I was not sure I would like the genre.However, the game surprised me positively. The combat mechanics are well designed and implemented, and it makes the game fun and additive to play. Thanks to this good design, the game doesn't feel repetitive (even though most battles are very similar). It does also help that the battlegrounds are often different and sometimes with additional challenges.The lack of possibility for level-grinding can make the game sometimes spike in difficult (at one point I was forced to lower the difficulty setting in order to get past one point, as there was no way to level-grind my characters), but for the vast majority of the game the problems arising from this have been largely avoided. (There are many similar tactical games that have no level-grinding where it results in the game being exceedingly difficult, but this game successfully avoids it for the most part.)			"

												Great game 8.5/10! At the beginning, I was as irritated as some others about the hit/miss chances, but it already had started to enthrall me with its dark story, the DSA system where you can add your earned EXP points (called AP) after every battle to increase skills and get better. However, what in the end really made this a great game are the many battles, more than I expected, and make it a rewarding experience. So its tactical RPG with a dark setting with nice enigh graphics to make you happy. Will definitely buy Blackguards 2 now.			"

												I'd really recommend avoiding this one.  I've already had to delete my game and start from scratch a couple times (which is amazing as I'm only at the beginning!)The game is extremely linear. You can just choose points on a map and your dot travels to that location for a battle. I just made it out of the first city and did the first optional quest (Giant tree monster in the swamp). The fight is literally impossible and it autosaved right at the beginning. Considering I spent quite a bit on this I might try again....but I don't really feel like taking the first optional quest in the game to try and gain some money was such a horrible mistake that I should have saved beforehand.

												Turn based combat system? Yes please!One thing I appreciate about the game is that so far I haven't encountered any battles that felt repetitive. The maps, the environments, interactive elements on the maps (starting fires ftw!), and the variety of opponents have kept it fresh so far. Of course I need to state that I'm only on Chapter 2 at this point, so maybe that changes. Some battles have been easy enough, others have been challenging. There's been a few battles that I've had to retry but it's been a fun challenge, not a drain on my enjoyment of the game.So far, I'm loving this game and have been looking forward to playing it as time permits. I started over 6 hours into the game to switch from a basic character to an expert (custom) character. Having become more familiar with the game, I wanted to be able to customize my character more. I'm 20+ hours into this game and I'm still enjoying it which is a positive sign!			"

												Blackguard is difficult. Blackguard is long. Blackguard is fun. The game forces you to utilize your envirounment on the maps of the different battles you will fight. The Mano a mano approach often leads to defeat or severe injurie. There's a lot of thinking, planning and retrying involved (when a strategy doesn't pan out), especially since you can only save before and after a battle, not during it. It's great though, makes the feeling of accomplishment that much stronger once you beat a battle while achieving all optional goals.The length of the game is very refreshing. 40 hours can very well be exceeded, depending on how often you fail ;) All said and donde, Blackguard is a real treat for all fans of tactical round based gaming. The story is kind of nice, but the gameplay is what kept me glued to this game for hours since I started.  "

												Pretty good SRPG, decent graphics,gameplay and leveling mechanics in terms of many choices to level up in and really create characters you want for your tactics.Some of the fights, or rather mechanics in the games are kind of broken. You can miss like 10-15 times on a row, even with maxed skills and thus lose fights on it, and other times you might hit and crit on bosses constantly and wipe them extremly fast... A quick examples are bosses that has 40% dodge on any attacks you do. Now imagien that they also poison you, and spawning mobs that are basically impossible to kill. Now, you can lose this fight, like I did 10+ times because you keep missing everytime. And yes, then another time, you might hit basically every swing and boss is down before you know it. Thats not balanced, its just random and in a SRPG based on tactics luck should never play a big part into it. I can understand some luck mechanics for the rpg-elements, but 40% miss on a boss that hit hard back? and he is a tank? Come on...I would give this game maybe a 7.5 or 8.0 of 10. When this game is at its best its actually really good, but when its at its worst its horrible. Probably need better beta test for the sequal in terms of balancing out battles, be more open about what to level up in, lots of trial and errors if you dont know what your supposed to level up or not. Also, the story and sidequest need to be better... basically as it is now, side-quest are kind of neccessary to finish for that vital AP which you level up in. So its not even a choice to do them or not.I finished the game in 40 hours on normal difficulty, so this is a pretty lenghty game I guess 35 to 45+ hours.Would I buy the sequal? Probably, yes, especially when its on some kind of a cheap discount, because I love srpg's and wanna support them (Final Fantasy Tactics need a sequal...) - but if the sequal for Blackguards, which is in development at this moment, get good reviews from the critics, I would probably buy it at launch. As I said this game could be great, it isnt however atm in this state in terms of balancing and storywise.			"

												I want to start off by saying that despite its many apparent flaws there is something that I find deeply compelling about this game.  The battle system is pretty good, you have quite a few options during combat and the interactive battlefields add a layer of fun and somewhat fresh gameplay.  My primary gripe with Blackguards is the difficulty.  To say that Blackguards is a challenging game is an understatement, but I feel that the way that Blackguards challenges you is a bit contrived and ultimately kind of cheap.  I've played difficult games in which I've lost or barely won a battle and have walked away thinking ""wow that was a good fight"".  In Black Guards if I lose I usually feel like I've been robbed.  You constantly miss spells and attacks and the enemy constantly connects whether you're fighting a semi-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ goblin, a backstabbing rogue or a giant tree.  And the dire situations that you are placed in again and again suggest to me that you're not so much a group of badasses so much as you are really gullible and kind of incompetent.    The main character feels really generic.  Pretty much everyone or everything that you encounter seems better suited for combat than the protaganist.  And so far I don't feel like the four playable characters that I have encountered live up to the name Blackguards.  They actually seem like relatively nice guys.  When I saw the name Blackguards I got excited because I had assumed that I would be taking on the roles of the Lannisters from GOT.  Instead it feels more like I've signed on with the Partridge family.  I've only  played a few hours so far and I'm not giving up on the game entirely just yet, but that's mostly because of the price tag.  This is not a 40 dollar game and I would not recommend that anyone pay that much to play this.  I work as a merchant sailor and I am literally stuck on a boat for the next month so I will be playing on.  If I get to a point in the gameplay in which I feel that my assesment was premature or unfair I will return to humbly apologize and I sincerely hope that, that happens.			"

												This is possibly the ugliest modern indie game I have had the displeasure of playing in a very long time. Everything from the sound mix to the graphics, down to the skid-mark brown art style. The only reconciliation is that I purchased when it was packaged with other junk and highly discounted. I highly recommend you do some research and watch some videos before buying this. If it wasn't so expensive I'd give this as a gift to people I don't like. It's so bad it makes me want to punch puppies and burn kittens. I mean it is just utterly atrocious. To put all that into context, it should be noted that I enjoy games like NEOScavenger. So yeah, don't buy this game unless your'e a masochist. The only darkness and gritiness here is the quality of development. I'm fairly certain they just dragged their taint accross the keyboard a few times and shipped it as a game. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻			"

I've only  played a few hours so far and I'm not giving up on the game entirely just yet, but that's mostly because of the price tag.  This is not a 40 dollar game and I would not recommend that anyone pay that much to play this.  I work as a merchant sailor and I am literally stuck on a boat for the next month so I will be playing on.  If I get to a point in the gameplay in which I feel that my assesment was premature or unfair I will return to humbly apologize and I sincerely hope that, that happens.			"

												a GREAT disappointment. The game barely even attempts to explain the character progression and skill tree and if you spend AP on skills or stats that do not do what you want you are severely disadvantaged down the line; with the potential need to restart the game entirely. I should not need to have intimate knowledge of a table top RPG to play this game. The game had considerable potential but it's incredibly poorly executed.			"

												Blackguards is a tatical rpg set on the Dark Eye universe with dungeons and dragons rules. I can't recommend it though. I am a long time fan of turn based tatical RPG's, since Shining Force, and this game has nothing special going for it, quite the contrary. I can't really tell you about the story, mainly a generic one with some plot twists. But as any good tatical rpg fan would tell you, the juice of the matter is the gameplay and theevolution of your party and it fails. Gameplay is soooo boring and minimalistic, and the inventory and hero atributes are a mess.Stay clear.			"

												This game is just terrible.Shame because the looks and ui and the feel of it all is topnotch.The problem lays in the balance, there is no way to go around and level up and get better gear, except to do the linear preset battles, terrible design. BUT the real problem lays in the fact that you are too weak, cant afford the items they have for sale etc, close to starting you will find yourself against lots of Lice , just one can take you out, but you deal best around 10damage, so do they, but there are lots of them, you can take a couple down but thats it, and that is on easy mode.The game is really hard even on easy mode, a good game wasted, i feel like shooting the brainless devs.Do not bother, if you do dont say you was not warned. Check the forum first for a true insight.Avoid this one and the devs no nothing about balance etc.Also if you play on a high resolution, forget it, i run on a 2560x1080 monitor and even that isnt supported.

												Fascinating turn-based RPG. I love the story so far, enriched by these interesting characters. If you're into the Dark Eye universe, this is a must-buy, for everyone else: If you enjoy challenging battles that involve the environment, you will find yourself at home. Don't expect anything groundbreaking tho - fights can drag on for a while and there is no way to quicksave during a battle, which can get frustrating if you can't figure out a certain tactic - especially on the hardest difficulty.

I really want to love it, but I can't give it more than a... 6.5/10. The equipment system is just so ill explained. With quite a few hours in, I STILL don't under what equipment is better and how. I got it as part of a bundle so take this review for what its worth. I probably paid about $1 for this game and I'm still kind of... meh, about it.

												The game is bad. Level designer is (bad language) and should be prohibited from making any game or anything which include brain activity as he clearly doesn't have one. I'm not going to count all stupidity of the game here. In short: most times it's frustrating and unfriendly to control and as I said designs of some levels just terrible. Don't buy it even on sale as I did, you will waste your time playing it. Want to feel like you're playing this game? Grab bunch of dies and throw them few times, it's easy like this. So in the end it's not so much important how you develop your characters most of the times result of the battle will depend on dies. Once again: don't buy this game!			"

The dwarf does 0 melee damage because he's fighting with a torch because you can't afford an axe. Defeating an enemy means another crawls out of a hole, so one character (out of three) has to spend at least seven turns closing holes while your useless mage (53% chance of doing 5 - 10 damage) and worthless dwarf are swarmed. Who the hell is stupid enough to keep playing after such a horrible start? Screw this game.			"

												i regret buying the game at 50% off . I enjoyed the first chapter then it got a bit tedious , it seemed a game designed to make sure you had no fun. I love turn based tactical games and i dont think i've ever played one i didnt enjoy before.character develpoment and advancemet is dreadful , worst of any RPG or CRPG i've ever played , It's so boring and mundane. There's an illusion of freedom but really you just stick to a few skills and spells that are clearly miles better , if you dont you end up with useless underpowered skills and characters.I think i am still using the same 1 skill with my melee and archer characters 10 hours into the game and the same 2 spells on my casters. There's just not enough variety to the game. In another 10 hours i probably be using the same 2 skills. Thats not enough depth for a tactical game or an RPG.As an RPG it is without doubt poor but i expected that and assumed the tactical combat would make up for it , it didnt , the combat was worse than i expected and that is the reason i eventually got bored of clicking the same 2 buttons and stopped playing			"

												If you are a friend of AAA turn based tactial games like XCOM or Final Fantasy Tactics, this is a game just made for you! Daedalic Entertainment made a real good job on this one. The Story, settled in ""The Dark Eyey"" Universe is immersive, the graphics are real nice, the tactical approach is kinda advanced and pretty tricky from time to time and even the voice actors made a great job! Two thumbs up!			"

												Well, there are games you like to play, just games, and not games at allBlackguards is the last one kind for meNeither Heroes, nor Dragon Age, and nor Diablo/Dungeon Siege/TorchlightSomething more closely to mix of Heroes (turn-based) and Assasing Creed/Dishonored/Thief (In logic, mainly - Agh, I should use water arrow here to turn off light and hide in the dark)All you do in Blackguards is running on the battlefield with only one though - ""Hell, hell, hell! Where is this magic lever that kills all my enemies? Faster, I have only one XP. Agh, already zero""As mentined, first time playing is blind - there is no understanding or planning how to develop character even after tutorial. Due to reason above, character page seems to be useless for the game at all.Playing as mage is awful. You have 2 places on belt, already used these mana potions and out of mana again. What next? Go to close combat (for mage!) or wait for 50 turns to recover your mana. Ridiculous.So don't even try if you want to relax a bit with your favourite game. This one is not of this kind.			"

												so first of game is extremely liniar, doesnt do anything we havent seen before and it does everything worse then we have seen before...secondly which idiot thought it was a good idea in an RPG to keep on taking away ALL the players gear?....seriously!! i have only played for 5 hours now and because of ""plot sht"" all my gear have been stripped from all the chars 3 times untill now -.-it is infuriating when its an RPG with focus on finding gear that the design keeps on stripping all your gear away -.-when that is said there really isn't much too it, everything is very generic and not very well made...anyway the gear stripping was what really got me to rage quit at the end -.- (scenario: so dwarfs refuse to interact with you unless you allow them to drug you and steal all your gear (first of seriously who came up with the ""either get drugged or they aint talking to you""-.- the fact you got no other choice and cant continue the quest if you dont is completely stupid...)), then all your gear is stripped for the third time and now you have to fight fully geared people on their terms -.- seriously... soooooooooooo annoying....i can't recommand such bad design decisions to any one...

												WASTE OF MONEY! Wait for the full version and hope they add in more stuff. No character customization, you get 5 hair & face options to pick from, which is unacceptable. Sorry but not everyone wants to be ""white guy with an epic beard"". Blond hair & beard? Short brown hair and beard? Stylized brown hair & beard? Way to limiting for my tastes. At least give me the option to get rid of the beard. Especially with WAY better games out there like Fire Emblem or Dragon Age: Origins, this is a bad choice. Combat: While I do enjoy the combat, you miss WAY WAY to much which will flat out turn players off. I thought XCOM has some bad RNGs but this takes the taco. I got this on a flash sale for $12 and I pretty much want my money back. With games on the way like Divinity Original Sin, Wastland 2, Leige, and Dead State, this will be passed over and flat out forgotten. I may go back to it after they release a patch or two but right now, playing anything over $10 is a waste of your money. You're better off saving that cash for Wasteland 2 or Divinity.  "

												Game offers very little tactical possibilities. There seems to be lot of choice, but basically most of the choices are useless as are mage and hunter class. Especially mage is very weak and requires astral points to cast spells that most of the time miss the targets anyway.RPG elements of the game are poorly made and feels very clumsy. I usually like RPG games and especially turn based tactical games, but this was a huge dissapointment and I would not recommend this to anyone who expects certain quality from their purchases.			"

												Highly recommended for fans of turn-based fantasy and role-playing games in general.Pros: The adventure system is a welcome relief from wandering around huge towns of useless NPCs. It's similar to point-and-click adventures of old. Let's you get to the story and/or combat quickly.Cool level-up system. Characters really start to feel powerful at later levels.Attractive graphics and runs smoothly.Neat battle set-ups. Battles have traps, special objectives, secrets, and ambushes. There are a good number of straight up fights, but the set piece battles really spice things up.Interesting (but not completely original) story with an compelling (but really not original) cast. It keeps you interested enough to follow along rather than just clicking through the dialogs, and the cut-scenes are simple but well done.Cons: I strongly recommend starting on ""Easy"" difficultly. This really feels like it should be the default and is best for first-time players. The mechanics of the game are a little obscure, and having one play-through under your belt is best. Easy offers a good challenge without being frustrating, and gives you freedom to explore the game.Again, obscure mechanics and no way to respec makes the game progression rather unforgiving.Sparse loot. Don't get me wrong, I think it is a nice chance of pace to have magic items actually be rare and not drop 11 times each battle, but it feels like the game is really stingy with the rewards. It does make the few items you get feel more special but, unfortunately, they're not even that much better than the standard ones you can buy.The characters you get aren't very customizable in their roles. But they do what they do well. Low replayability. You could replay the game on a harder difficulty, but why? It's a long game and nothing is really randomized. It's not really much of a con though since the game is so long with lots of optional quests.			"

												Blackguards is a turn-based strategy game with strong RPG elements, rather like XCOM but with a much greater variety of character customization. (Though it has a reasonable story, you might be disappointed if you're looking for an RPG. It isn't open world, there aren't many meaningful story choices for you to make, and there isn't much customization available for your character's appearance.)The campaign is reasonably long, though the game doesn't feel repetitive thanks to reasonably varied fight scenarios and win-conditions. Early problems with bugged quests and translation issues from the original German seem mostly resolved at this point (I only noticed some spelling errors in the English version and had no problems with bugged quests.)Common complaints about the game focus on numerous loading screens and an unintuitive UI. I found the UI fairly easy to pick up myself, only issuing incorrect commands once or twice. Though there are a lot of loading screens between scenarios, each one lasted only 1-3 seconds for me so they didn't detract from my experience. People playing on systems using HDDs rather than SSDs may find the loading screens take longer and so are more annoying, though.I was worried by the relatively low Metacritic score for this game, but I'm glad I wasn't deterred. If you like single-player, turn-based strategy games that put you in control of a small group of specialized combatants, you'll probably like this.			"

												In a nut-shell, you'' definetely like Blackguards if you are into turn-based, hex-based linear tactical RPGs. For one, i do!The combat is nicely done and obviously the strong point of the game - it works, and keeps you challenged (at least, up to now).The graphics are nice, but a little too cartoon-ish for my taste (and for the atmosphere the game tries to create).The story is good enough to carry you from chapter to chapter, although it's a little obvious in its twists.There are obviously a few cons as well:- The biggest minus for me it's the inventory, and the way it works. You don't get a clear comparison between your equipped item and another one, in your pack or at a vendor - this alone makes choosing weapons a nuisance at later stages. The inventory also becomes cluttered extremely easy. - Also a minus is the auto saving system. The game makes it that, quite a few times, you have to fight battle after battle, without possibility of resting&healing. And the autosave saves as you enter a new battle. This means that, if you don't take extra care, you'll end up (it happened to me once) in a position i hate most in RPGs - making some bad decisions in a 3rd-in-a-row battle, i had no chance of winning the 4th. And the autosave was only for the 4th. So i had to restart not only the 3 battles before, but the whole branch of the chapter (a lot of dialogue and cinematics included) - and i hate remaking choices i already made, listening to the same lines over and over again etc. They should have made an auto save for each battle, and an autosave for entering a chain of events/battles - this way, you can restart the fights without restarting the story itself.Anyway, all in all, is a nice game (and i bought it during a sale) - so i give it 7.5/10.

												If you've played Baldur's Gate and enjoyed it, you'll enjoy this game. To be honest, it's the first rpg I've played that actually reminds me of Baldur's Gate and games like it. While different (you don't run around each town looking for quests), the fundamentals are very similar. It's a real RPG. I wish there were more games like this.Looking forward to a sequel.			"

												Blackguard got some bad reviews, however this is a fine pice of old-school RPG. Battles are hard and tactical, and you might need to reload often (or cheat like I do). The story is good, and captivating. I like that there is no idle going around in big places and killing random monsters, each battle and each place somehow furthers story.So I recommed Blackguard for all those old-school RPG loving fans out there!

												Highly recommended for fans of turn-based fantasy and role-playing games in general.Pros: The adventure system is a welcome relief from wandering around huge towns of useless NPCs. It's similar to point-and-click adventures of old. Let's you get to the story and/or combat quickly.Cool level-up system. Characters really start to feel powerful at later levels.Attractive graphics and runs smoothly.Neat battle set-ups. Battles have traps, special objectives, secrets, and ambushes. There are a good number of straight up fights, but the set piece battles really spice things up.Interesting (but not completely original) story with an compelling (but really not original) cast. It keeps you interested enough to follow along rather than just clicking through the dialogs, and the cut-scenes are simple but well done.Cons: I strongly recommend starting on ""Easy"" difficultly. This really feels like it should be the default and is best for first-time players. The mechanics of the game are a little obscure, and having one play-through under your belt is best. Easy offers a good challenge without being frustrating, and gives you freedom to explore the game.Again, obscure mechanics and no way to respec makes the game progression rather unforgiving.Sparse loot. Don't get me wrong, I think it is a nice chance of pace to have magic items actually be rare and not drop 11 times each battle, but it feels like the game is really stingy with the rewards. It does make the few items you get feel more special but, unfortunately, they're not even that much better than the standard ones you can buy.The characters you get aren't very customizable in their roles. But they do what they do well. Low replayability. You could replay the game on a harder difficulty, but why? It's a long game and nothing is really randomized. It's not really much of a con though since the game is so long with lots of optional quests.			"

And it is turn-based squad strategy with a strong RPG element - can't say nothing bad - the gameplay is good (and I like such games since the very first X-COM :).

												Blackguards is great. Based on The Dark Eye setting and tabletop roleplaying game rules this game really captures those rules and lets them shine in a way previous real-time titles have not. The turn based nature of the combat system in the game really lets you see the benifit of the various different builds of characters where in a realtime combat game such as Drakensang based off of the same rule set does not.The plot is engaging, lengthy, and at times really does feel like a transcript of a tabletop campaign, which is great for someone who maybe used to tabletop and just doesnt have the time to, or doesnt get the opportunity to as often as they would like.All things said, I paid full price for the game, and don't think I spent even a penny more than the game was worth.

												Blackguards is a fairly entertaining tactical RPG. It can be hard at times,frustrating and random. You do need to put some thought into your character stats and abilities as they develop. It would be nice to be able to reset it by paying a cost or through some in-game service.It is fairly complex but no more so than other JRPGs out there.There story is pretty good with some decent voice acting. I am not sure why so many people don't just give this game a proper try.			"

												I played till the end and it wasn't a bad trip, but there are some points that annoyed me.Broken achievements the most.I'm a achievement hunter and this games is so full of bugs concerning achievements it made me crazy. (20% !!)You just can't get them.Some achievement don't even make sense!! Why would I upgrade every spell to 10?! Why not 8 where you get to the next level of the spell?! Getting all spells up to 10 is a HUGE waste of EP!?Same with teaching a character all weapon types. Why would I do that?! That's just stupid!Why would I upgrade character specifics that are only good for a mage or a warrior?Second, is there really much of alterning the storyline? Because they tried to act like it but it seems to me that is rubbish.Fighting system was fun and okay, but it is true that there should have been a little bit more variety of enemies and also goals. The story... well, could have been better. A bit confusing and in the end I don't really know what we needed that big word we searched so long for... what ever.I bought the game cheap and I would do it again, but don't buy it for the regular price, it isn't that good.

												This game has kept me interested for hours and hours of play.  The different scenarios forcing you to use different stragies, defeating you over and over, then finding a different strategy to kick it in the dirt is so satisfying.  The game allows you to build characters in any which way, whether you wanna shoot at the baddies from afar with bows and crossbows, or be a complete juggernaut and get your hands dirty with beefy armor and an axe.  Some features might cause the game to be a little too easy after a while, such as massive gold accumulation making cheap healing outside of combat very convenient.  Even so, this game is a great one to check out and play around with.			"

												Blackguards is one of the best games i have played in this style. Its characters are superb, and in depth combat system that is also quite simple if you dont look into it that far, it has great scenery and graphics, and to top it all off it has a great lore and map. The whole amnesia thing doesn't annoy you as much as it does in many other games because you get to play through most of it learning as you go along just enough that it drip feeds your imagination of what will come next.

												Just so much failure in this game. I really wanted to like it, but it just does so many things just wrong. Everything is ridiculously expensive, there is zero immersion. For example my guys all have crappy torches, and we have had crappy torches for well over an hour, killing guys with axes and swords. When we defeat said guys, you'd think we get a sword right? NOP! Still stuck with the crappy torches! And still can't afford 1 crappy hand axe, which the game seems to value at 13 gold! These developers are clueless at both medieval history and game balance (a hand axe would NEVER cost anywhere that much) !  Oh, and then the game wants to kill gigantic troll with your crap weapons! It's like the game is trolling you! I didn't even mention that almost everything to do in this game can just fail as it does nothing and waste your turn. It seems the way the developers want you to  get through this game is to save scum your way through, just hope you hit the all the monsters all the time and load if you don't! How fun!  This game is just a package of false promises that ends in dashed hopes and shame; just stay away.			"

												Great tactical RPG.  The sequel is better in some ways, but they're both great, so I recommend you start here.  There are a few ugly little graphical issues here & there, but they're not common, so it's not a big deal.  I love the relatively low-magic fantasy setting & the fact that just casting a spell successfully, not to mention hitting the target, is genuinely difficult at first.  The ending is the weakest part, unfortunately.  One issue I have before that is the way the game handles damage types.  It seems a bit odd & nonsensical to me.  For instance, if you get an enchanted mace that does fire damage, (& don't expect to find any such wonders easily,) it does pure fire damage & no physical damage, & this is just one example.  Skeletons are completely immune to piercing damage, etc., etc.. Still a good game, though.  Battles are pretty difficult at times.  A lot of people seem to think this game is too hard, but I disagree.  I enjoy the challenge, & I hope you do too.			"

												I've been playing the game for around 4 hours at this point and I'll be honest...  I don't get the bad rep this game is getting...  The characters (so far) are well voiced, the story, although fairly generic, is decent enough and the combat system is decent.I will admit, I bought the game as a part of this weekends sale, so got both Blackguards 1 & 2 along with a bunch of other games for about £12.  I've been tempted by both of these for some time now, but was put off by the reviews and the price.  So far, I have found these to be unfounded.I dove straight in on character creation rather than have the system do half the work for you and I am learning it as I go.  There's a lot to choose from so I just went with basics at least to start with.  It looks diverse enough to branch out later, which is always nice.Sure, there is a large element of RNG, but look at XCOM...  That game has continually devastated its players by repeated 95%+ shots missing at the, single, most crucial shot of the game.  I can't count how many times in that I have missed that said shot and the mission suddenly went to hell.  This is no different, though I have yet to encounter anything so drastic, but it's still early days.I can certainly see the game getting repetitive after a time, but there seems to be a lot more variation than XCOM in terms of attacks you can do, especially when you take in to account the spells.I would say that this game is definitely recommended to fans of TBS games and also to those of strategic fantasy games.  I would also definitely say that this game 'should' be recommended.To set 'not recommended' as others have because it's niche is just a tad overkill tbh.  If they aren't interested in a game just because it's a TBS or fantasy, then why are they looking at it in the first place?  It's a moot point.			"

												First of all this game does not deserve the mixed reviews it has received.  I've been a fan of CRPGs since the days of Might and Magic.  Maybe it's the nostalgia of the Dark Eye ruleset that reminds me of games like Star Trail, which even with its flaws I love. I cannot understand some of the complaints I've heard here. I find the battle difficulty perfect. I know this may turn some people off, but I love it. I typically play all of my RPGs on the hardest settings. I play this on normal. There is an easy mode if you need. It's understandable. That said everytime I'm frustrated I put it down, come back to it later, and succeed.  I will say that I restarted once because given the difficulty I was unhappy with how I had planned out my characters. Let me also say that I am happy there was not a ""respec"" option.Pros:Feels like a classic CRPGSuperb characters and voice actingGreat truly tactical combat systemSuprisingly mature storyline and writingLengthy - some might see this as a flaw, I love itCons:Limited character creation/customization optionsUninteresting and simple models/textures for armor/charactersA few bugs, some graphical, at least one gameplayNote: For those complaining about the RNG, please remember that the mother of all RPGs D&D is a dice game. Get over it.TLDR:Great game worth the 4$ or whatever it is in the store right now. I would have bought it for much more. I can't wait to start the sequel.			"

When a plan doesn't work you reassess and start again. Personally I felt the story was very weak but the gameplay is solid.			"

												Fun game overall, pleasant enough to play - and quite longer than I originally expected - but didn't like it enough to throw myself onto the second installment. I might wait for it to be on sale. For the time invested, the ending felt rushed and not all that satisfactory, but overall game still gets the thumbs up. I remember when this initially came out awhile back that people were going on about the darkness of the anti-heroes, the crudeness of the dialogue, almost juvenile humor, etc. Maybe years of playing the Witcher games have heightened (or is that lowered) my tolerance bar, but nothing in Blackguards even raised my eyebrow. In fact, rather than being the EDGY ANTI-HEROES that seem be everywhere these days, it was kind of relaxing to find out that my party were just a bunch of losers, with a lazy, whiny main character, a dwarf who is possibly nuts and most certainly an arsonist, a philandering wizard, and that's just to start with. Rather than choices that are downright eeeeeevil, you mainly get the choice between being a cold-hearted pragmatist or a bit more charitable, which works great. Voice acting was quite good for the price and the type of games, and the graphics, well, they are what they are, I don't mind (honorable mention goes to the fire effects which may be the prettiest I've seen in ANY game at ANY price tag.)I didn't find the combat to be as intense, strategic or engaging as Original Sin, but it was satisfying enough. The lauded interactive elements were for the most part useless when the surest, easiest strategy (on Normal, anyway) was to fall back, put my tanks in front of my glass cannons, hop the former up with all the buffs I could lay on, and let rip. But the game would fairly frequently throw a curve ball to shake things up; some fights have limited turns before you lose an optimal victory condition, others force you to move forward with ever-spawning enemies or poison gas. There was enough variety that it never got too repetitive or boring, though obviously some of the fights are going to feel annoying or unfair, or leave you way too open for the revenge of the RNG demon. Conclusion: I feel no rush to play this again, but I have no regrets buying it in the first place.			"

												Worth it if on sale otherwise not worth $40 for game content. Pro: Story is mediocre. Turn based combat is fun, strategic, and varies in setting. Con: Another enemy force has magically spawned on the map behind you type of difficulty.			"

												I have mixed feelings on this game. I got it on sale and would recommend it as such, but this game is not worth 40$. Nothing in this game is bad except for the UI, but nothing is good either. Nothing impressed me at all. The spell system having 3 stats associated to every spell just doesn't make sense. I need strength for magic? Wait what? Okay it would make sense if its a force push or something maybe that fits right? Well one of them creates and arcane wall, the other is a debuff. How is that associated to strength at all? Most irritating part is some fights are just not properly balanced. There is one fight I spent over an hour on, had the moves mapped to a science, and just needed the RNG to connect. If you let the guy hit you on the second turn and poison you, you simply cannot win. So one companion has to move the perfect amount of tiles away from the enemy so it will chase him, while the other moves away and shoots at the non poisoning opponent. Kiting of this level doesn't have a place in a game like this. When I have to take my tank and run him in circles to not die, I feel like the developers missed something...  And to put it in perspective, I have the best armor and stats possible at the current place for a tank, and he cannot tank nor do I even consider him ""tanky"". Your shield will add a lot to your parry, but you can only parry once per turn turn so what is the point? My mage honestly has just as good of a chance to survive as he does wearing cloth without a shield. I love games like this, and this one just doesn't shine enough for me to recommend it over what is out there. As I said I don't feel it is bad, but I am not finishing the game.			"

												Update: Finished game, would hardly call unfair, most fights in the game took a max of 2-3 tries, plenty were 1shots. Did all sidequests I ran across before completion, not sure how close to 100% I was, but I'd guess I probably did a good 85-90% of the content on offer. It's just about learning the game to be honest, there's nothing super difficult here. I play a good variety of games and hardly am ""an expert"" at turn based tactics games for comparison to what you can expect. Fun game, a couple of times I found the combat very slow and wished I could skip through enemy turns when there were lots of enemies (last dungeon had a couple like this...)Pretty funny seeing all the people here whine about this game being unforgiving or super difficult... I am completely new to Dark Eye game systems and have just taken my time in looking at the character trees etc and sort of feeling my way into where I'm spending my AP. I would say that if difficult = not 1shotting every single battle, then the game is ""difficult"". But beyond that, it's not very difficult. Every single encounter has taken me no more than 2 tries barring the end encounter for Chapter 2 (louse queen as a 3rd battle in a row with no recovery time. I decided to power thru it vs trying to load an old save and set myself up for easier success over all 3 as a whole with the knowledge I'd gained... too lazy to do that). And I can even say that the first attempt is often experimentation or trial/error with the different maps, traps and interactables etc and perhaps new enemy types. It's fairly easy so far, although I will say that the difficulty is spiky; it runs the gamut from faceroll to mildy challenging (and some of the reviews I see whining about difficulty are from people that spent far less time than I, so I doubt it's where I am in the game) -- honestly if you are having trouble, maybe reevaluate your movement and positioning. I've found that there is a lot of advantage to be gained and strategy in positioning and more or less ""gaming the map"" to keep control and manage some of the risk/rng. This is a hex based game, and sometimes moving 2 hexes right or left can change a whole lot. To give an example -- I saw a ""WTF is"" by TotalBiscuit, where he played a fairly early map and thought it was frustrating and difficult... immediately started making major positioning oversights in the very first turn he had. The corridor is bottlenecked to 3 hexes wide and there are like 6 active crypt lice. Why would you not move 3 characters onto each of those hexes and wait for the lice to come to you? Then you are only fighting 3 at once you only have 3 characters of your choosing taking damage (far more control over damage intake). Following this, you have infinite recovery turns on the map to heal before moving forward and ""activating"" the next group. This is just a very basic example... and I don't really even dabble in strategy games all that much. I just don't see how this game is hard. It's fairly simple with a bit of trial and error involved. The RNG complaints are also pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... there is even a ""wounds"" system to manage the RNG... which I discovered at my leisure after continually investigating the ruleset as I played. Have some patience... you definitely don't need to read character guides to suceed. I've learned after playing and reading around that the optimal route is playing a mage as the hero (there's 0 disadvantage since there are basically characters that can cast and characters that can't -- everything else can be developed as you see fit as the game goes on...), and I'm doing just fine.

												This game isn't perfect, hell most will say that it isn't even good but I really enjoyed it, I liked the characters and a few of the  ideas in a game, like belts or the way towns worked in it, but I'm probably in minority when it comes to liking this game.			"

												Great writing and voice acting.Fun use of evironment in battles. (not hitting stuff when 100% chance, not so fun).Beatiful map, but painful traveling in the cities.Seems to be rushed development, ending feels.. pale, few ""Adam add textures here"" moments.Buy if you like grumpy dwarves!

												I want to like this game, I really do. But there are several critical issues that the game designers should have fixed before release or fixed in a patch.The most critical issue is there are points in the game that are dead ends. What I mean by this is there are situations that will force you to restart because you won’t be able to get around them. One example is a scenario where your players cant leave a series of encounters and if you can’t beat the one of those encounters the game is effectively over. Scratch 15 hours of play. I assume there are more to come.The game looks great and the system is deep enough to make it interesting. The issue is with the encounter design and the above is only one example (although be it the worst) so far in my playthrough. "

												Another example of a great (in places) game putting off players do to poor presentation of core game mechanics to player base / very poor ingame feedback. I don't know what the developers were aiming for with the way the final product turned out (it is NOT due to technical ineptitude or lack of creative ability - the game mechanics are consistent with its defined rule set, full of intelligent puzzles and reasonably bug free).The lack of transparency (markedly unsound - it badly hurts their sales numbers by quickly alienating the ""shallower"" player base. ) seems to be caused largely due to intended design. Maybe TDE (dark eye) game rules are were so second nature to the developers they coudn't see how difficult it will be for ""foreigners"" to make sense of their otherwise ""working within parameters"" product. It almost like the game is made by aliens strangers to earth based game interface progression in the last 20 years. Maybe this what a game made by programmers/designers that don't play computer games should be expected to turn out (speculation). cons-very limited ruleset/mecanics exposition and ingame feedback (steam guides mostly fixes this)-alien game interface: bits of relevant information are scattered all over the place (need to navigate 5-6 ""screens"" to gather basic info about a character - a feat the good modern games can achieve in 1-2 ""screens"" with overwelmingly superior amount of detail - wastes player time, hurts immersion)-stoneage like combat log functionality (mising a lot game critical events and the ones presented lack detail)  -rough spell/ weapon class balance-nearly impossible to read opponent's percentage based resists ( some even have vulnerabilities to certain damage types but it is extremely hard to tell due to the hidden resist stats , RNG damage component and poor combat log features)-liniar story, set drops(limited itemisation issues) and poor spell/abilities balance (few powerbuilds builds) leads to poor replayability value. (maybe the obfuscation was intended to mask/hide the poor balance to the players - or the poor balance is the result of the obfuscation making it hard for the devs to see the problems ?)pros-the community with a bit of help from developers managed to unwind most of the critical game mechanics (check out the game's player guides section)-the game is well oiled (very few bugs), the creative people did great - very high intelligent puzzle combat variation(enjoyable once you start grasping the game mechanics).   I still recommend this game despite its numerous flaws because it has the capability to enthral players for hours, but wait for significant special offer discounts .			"

												Presents a problem when you hit a wall because you cant beat the bad guys.  Theyll talk about strategy and whatnot, but the reality of it is, when youre missing on high % shots (at least a high % based on what the computer tells you) strategy doesnt matter.  Theres nothing more disheartening than watching your team drop one by one and knowing there is nothing you can do to stop it..just load last game.  This imbalance causes more frustration than the game is worth.  Could have been better, just wasnt.			"
