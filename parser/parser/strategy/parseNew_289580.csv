												while i don't have much time on the game yet, it has been one of the best RTSs i have ever played, it has a unique mix of Paradox's Real Time overworld map and the RTS elements of the battles, of course there are a few bugs of course, but no more than any large scale game like this. The lack of Navel combat is kind of annoying, but they make up for it with a large roster of ground units, everything from pre-World War I infantry to post- World War II fighters. i highly reccomend this game with a 9.5/10. I wonder how this game slipped under my radar			"

												Agression Europe under fire makse for a very fun and interesting game overall. IT has a complex yet fairly easy to use Nation management system and this is what makes up the bulk of the gameplay. There is also a decently basic RTS styled fighting system where you can watch buildings blow up in graphical detail and lead your tanks and infantry to vicotry! This is an interesting feature beacuse it easily breaches the gap for gamers who cant play Risk styled map games without a little bit of breakup with action, Like myself/This game takes place in a period of history very rarely displayed in video games and i think this is will the core audience will come from. it goes from 1910 to 1950 yes thats right you can be france in ww1 and ww2!!! omg ft 17 renaults and Schneider tanks and sweet sweet interwar period vehicles.In conclusion you will  feel like the master of your nation during one of its most interesting periods of history. History buffs will love it tread heads will aprechaite it and strategy gamers will add it to there collction. Lead your nation to glory through ww1 and ww2 for $9.99			"

												Pros:Wide variety of units to use. Explosions feel and look good. (In other words, it doesn't look like a fire cracker went off when a artillery shell hits a surface.) Pretty good destruction Physics. Covers both World War One and Two Warfare, so it caters to both interests. (Refreshing concept I have to say.)Detailed animations on units. Cons:Limited soundtrack. (It's good but needs more variety.)Some bugs, typos, etc.  (But nothing really new from what I see in other big games like this.) Occasional wonky AI. (Although that isn't really a new problem in the Strategy genre.) Tutorial covers only one portion of the game. (The battling portion of the game isn't too hard to understand. But it would be nice to have an explanation on what to do.) Overall, despite the flaws Aggression has, it is still a fun RTS to play. Theres a huge amount of content in this game, so for ten bucks you can't really go wrong.    "

												what is the game about?you play as one of 4 countries (russia, france, germany, britain) in europe between 1910-1945. You play on a strategic map, where you can build units and buildings, manage your cities and population and explore technologies, which range from the first to the end of the second world war.Except for the strategic map, there is also a tactical battlefield, in which you battle your enemy in real time, whenever you encounter an enemy army or city. it is like a (simple) total war game. there is also a littlebit of roleplaying too, for there are some important characters, with different abilities and professions, which you can send over the map and improve their skills/choose new ones.+: old, but nice and very detailed grafic,nice atmosphere (f.e. animals that roam through the map;)good effects, like bombing explosions and crushing buldings;good strategic map/partwide verarity of unitsthe first world war is a refreshing experience, also to see a game which combines the first and the second world war.-: very annoying tactical part/rts battles: very bad pathfinding, no formations, if you select more than one unit (even if they all are of the same type) you cant use any of the special order buttons; the game sometimes doesnt seem to recognize your orders/mouseclicks from time to time; it might happend that you suffer an unexpected fps drop; there is a bug in which your units sometimes cant leave buildings anymore; it happend to me that my infantry suddenly couldnt jump over fences anymore (4 of my squads where trapped in a garden, thanks of this -_-), the battle AI is quiet stupid, it will seperate its army and sending troops to every single flag/conquere area and than doing nothing but standing arround; also: boring and old soundtrackbad tutorial (it only explains the strategic map part, nothing about the tactical battles, where you have to learn on your own some very important key functions, like different units, special orders, ammunition, etc.)no multiplayeronly limited singleplayer = only main campaign and 5 scenarios; no editor, no skirmish battles; you cant modify the scenarios or campaign in any way. (f.e. you cant choose a different start date, etc)very limited diplomacy = war/neutral/allied, and a tradeagreementyou can only play russia, france, england and germany, althought there are spain, austria, italy and the ottman empire as mayor powers, you are not allowed to play them.fazit:while the strategic part of the game is really enjoyable, the tactical part is quiet annoying, with all its bugs and the stupid AI. althought i like the idea, and the love for detail, i cant recommend this game.also, since this is allready a pretty old game and i didnt find any patch, it is unlikely that there will be one in the future.

												Do you want to manage surprisingly-sparse resources with unfriendly and broken menus over a time period that covers 2 world wars? If yes, you might enjoy this game. I've heard a great deal about Aggression's depth, and even with my limited playtime I managed to experience some of it.However, to say Aggression is an unfriendly game is an understatement. While not the buggiest game I've played, Aggression is prone to crashes. The tutorial is easily broken, but this is actually due to poor design rather than poor code. Multitudes of information windows are lacking important information or hold no information at all. In game objectives suffer from the same bad design as the tutorial, ensuring they are far too easy to fail (if you don't have, say, an exact number of troops exactly close enough to reach an out of the way area of the map by a very short deadline).I don't usually play large-scale strategy games, so perhaps when I say resources were uncomfortably limited I mean that it would take an expert or a person willing to fail over and over to really learn the ins and outs. I never had enough resources to feel comfortable with the economy, and I set all of my cities to auto-construct to compensate. Unfortunately, if your not invading or managing your cities, you really don't have much to do beside moving your ministers around (your ministers effectively being agents of your will). The most interesting part of the game is therefore management, but as I said many features and windows are either poorly explained or missing information completely, so you really have to research outside the game to figure out what it all means.Combat is the weakest point of Aggression. The AI is some of the worst I've ever seen, and while the enemy can usually figure out how to kill you, your own units will struggle simply to follow your orders without getting slaughtered or running in front of tanks. This means that the second game mode, ""Missions,"" which consists only of combat, is entirely a waste of time. the campaign mode, the only real mode, features an auto-resolve button that should be used unless you're confident of overwhelming superiority or have put in the time to figure out how to abuse the system.Not fun and not worth it, even on sale.

												The game in strategic view is good and research too but in tactical battle pathfinding is like catastrophic some guys in a squad cannot reach destination and the autoresolve kill a lot of your unit so i recommand to go through tactical battle even if it's bad.			"

												Ok, really wanted to like this game, love the concept. On the strategic map its not to bad, but once you go tactical the game is really hampered by the horrible pathfinding and the constant crashes. So unless you want to autosolve all the battles, this one may not be for you			"

												I had to fight this game for more than a week before I could start effectively playing it. In the beginning I suffered crashes on every battle which made the game virtually unplayable.Despite that, with a lot of patience, trial and error and tweaking I finally made it work and I have to recognize it is a great game. It has that mix of grand strategy with tactical battles that is tipical of the Total War series, but spans from before WW1 to after WW2, which is a period that very few games explore. Besides that the game has a great variety of units, decent graphics, most of the important historical figures and many character skills that give more depth to the grand strategy aspect of the game (just don't expect it to be like Hearts of Iron or any of the other hardcore strategy games). It has to be noted that the Ai is simple, the game has no multiplayer and you can only play 4 factions (Germany, France, UK and Russia), but considering that this is a game from a small developer I don't find these limitations a problem.In a nutshell: it is a fun ""Total War"" style game set between WW1-WW2, definitely worth the buy. A piece of advice: PLAY THIS GAME FROM THE TOP-DOWN VIEW ON THE TACTICAL MAP OR IT WILL CRASH CONSTANTLY. Also try to avoid pausing the game during the tactical battles because it seems to increase the probability of crashes.If you are interested I've created some mods to correct some of the game's bugs and to tweak gameplay a bit:https://steamcommunity.com/app/289580/discussions/0/357285562493973871/https://steamcommunity.com/app/289580/discussions/0/357286119116351240/ "

												For anyone looking for a real time strategy game covering the turn of the 20th Century, keep looking. This game will only frustrate you as you fight against its incredibly clunky and poorly laid-out UI, its terrible control over units, battle AI that will swarm over your forces like a horde from the Steppes and a bare-bones strategic campaign. Imagine the campaign of a Total War game and the real-time combat of Men of War, water both down and then take out all the polish and refinement.  Throw in a lack of feedback over what in the name of Sigmar is even happening (Did my entire army just get wiped out by a single infantry squad?), random events which require you to send your army to the♥♥♥♥♥end of the world to fight rebellions for your worst enemies (Good thing the German army was there to keep those damn commies from claiming France...) and cavalry that can destroy armored cars while shrugging off artillery barrages and you get this sorry heap.

												Lousy.  The RTS Tactical battles feel like it was programmed in the 1980s.  Poor Camera Control, Poor animations, LAUGHABLE quality.  The main map portion of the game is not intuitive and you stare at it wondering what to even do.  The random missions dont give you enough time to even complete them.  for example ""research X within 3 weeks them build y number of Z within the same time period"" turns out to have a research requirement of 19 weeks.this was a total waste of $5.99 fo rme and a total waste of the programmer's time to make this POS.

												As far as single player World Domination games go - this one has its ups and downs. Overall it is an enjoiyable game but I believe it is lacking in its depth. There could be much more to the game. If you are looking for something that is more simple and straightforward and covers world war I and world war II, this is a game to play - but don't expect too much out of it. Recommended for those who like World Domination games and strategy but who don't want to put a metric ton of time into it.			"
