												I was starting to get into it. A nice, casual free to play MMORPG with turn-based combat. Detailed story. Plenty of things to do. I hit level 10 and got access to my Haven Bag, which is like a telelporter to your personal space. They gave me a chest to store my items, so I immediately tried to offload my starter equipment. Dragged my old boots from inventory to chest. ""This content is restricted to subscribers."" They follow this with a list explaining that only subscribers can have pets, play PVP, get special quests, visit all of the lands, ETC...At level 10, this free to play becomes a DEMO.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I've re-written this several times, unhappy with each. I have decided to stop doing that and just write how I feel instead of sounding professional. As someone who found Dofus when it was first in beta, I feel almost ashamed to admit I've been playing this game as long as I have. In fact, It might be for the best that it's only now reaching steam, as I fear seeing the hours I've poured into this game might be traumatizing. Heck, the hours I might pour into this game AFTER this point intimidate me..... but alas, there's a reason I have stuck around as long as I have. THIS. GAME. IS. AMAZING. Why? because I said so! Okay, I'll be a bit more specific.... Appearance - I start here, because I frankly see little reason to go over it. You see the top of the page, you saw the trailer (granted it's a mishmash of the movie and the game, well done, nonetheless). And it's the thing that will catch people's attention. I, for one, LOVE the artstyle and direction Ankama has chosen to go, but something I should mention. It looks cartooney, and childish, don't let that throw you off, this game is VERY much aimed at young adults and adults. It might be a bit too complex for young children, and the dialogue and....ahem...references... assume a respectable level of maturity. That is to say, there is adult humor all over the place (think condom sword, and rabbits vandalizing fox(tanouki) statues by placing a giant wooden log between their legs...) so don't be afraid. Also note this game isn't just a ton of sex humor, Ankama is pretty classy, after all. Gameplay - The main reason you'll get sucked in...or turned off. Dofus is a turn based strategy MMORPG, which I can understand some people not enjoying, I do. The game is very skill intensive, almost no reflexes needed. There are currently 17 classes to chose from, and I can tell you, don't bother asking what the ""best"" anything is. There is no ""best"" character, ""best"" build, ""best"" equipment or the likes. Ankama has done a marvelous job at keeping the classes ballanced. Speaking of the classes, the 17 classes all play VERY differently, leading many people to play multiple (oh yeah, multiclienting is a thing, and is supported in this game. That is both good and bad, depending who you ask). If you're just starting out, don't worry about playing multiple characters, it's not necessary to succeed, just keep in mind someone using 6 accounts will progress faster than someone using 1 or 2. Uniqueness - The only thing even remotely comparable to Dofus is Wakfu, which is almost a sequel to Dofus, and is the same company. There's nothing even remotely comparable in the MMORPG market. If you've ever played Final Fantasy Tactics, or a similar game, you should catch on pretty quickly. Accessability - The game is flash based, making it so it's not particularly taxing on even weak computers. After major updates, the game can be a little less comparable (such as the recent interface changes) but even with a mid-range laptop with integrated graphics, I had little issue playing several accounts at once. I also run on a poor net connection (I'm talking average ~200-250 ping, with spikes regularly) and it causes little trouble for me. There is a respectable free-to-play area that anyone can try out to find out if they like it before paying a penny. The game is also multi platform, working on mac and I believe still linux. The learning curve can be steep, and the initial game overwhelming, but that can't be helped with something as unique as this. Management - Ankama as a company is one of the companies I respect the most. They have been phenominal at maintaining ballance between the classes, They are good at storytelling (granted they could use some work in the presentation in game...) and their use of the cash shop (Also known as the Ogrine Market, their cash currency) has been great. The items you can buy on the cash shop are almost entirely cosmetic, with a couple minor convienances. Also you can buy the currency with in-game money, as is the case with many games, and it's pretty reasonable to do so, and you can also use the method to subscribe characters. Customer support is famously aweful, by american standards, but when you look at it with the realization that the company is french, where customer support is a totally different perception, it's actually not bad. Izmar (the community manager) is also incredibly helpful and friendly, and very good at making sure things are running smoothly (she deserves a big raise!)Longevity - I've been playing it for well over a decade..... I think that's enough said. I admit I am not a crazy hardcore player, but there's still plenty I haven't done and still want to do. Customization - Character customization is a weak point here. Hats and cloaks are the only displayed equipment, you can chose colors of your character by picking 5 predetermined areas and coloring those to your liking, and you can chose between m/f and 8 different faces. Otherwise there's not a ton of options. The interface has recently gone through an overhaul and you are now able to move interfaces around to your liking, but even that could use a little more freedom. Social - The guild system is O.K., the alliance system is interesting, and multiclienting people can play on their own no problem. With that said, You will meet some interesting people in this game, there are plenty of chat channels you can access, and the community is generally pretty friendly. In PvP obviously there is drama and hostility, but it's nothing comparable to what you'd find in arena games. Bang for your buck - The game is relatively cheap for a subscription game, and the cash shop is nothing near necessary to keep up (in fact, you CANT realistically keep up with other people just by dumping cash into the game), and you can subscribe with in-game currency at a rate that is normally relatively decent. I would advise avoiding trying to use in-game currency for your first month or 3, but after that is when alot of people are able to transfer over, not that supporting ankama is bad by any stretch, and paying with real money makes the game less stressful, as you don't have to worry about upkeeping subscription. Footnotes - Note that this game is oldschool. Level 200 (max) isn't when the game starts (or ends, for that matter), so you don't need to rush to high level. There is a huge amount of content. The official forums and subreddit are also great resources for newcomers, and those may help you avoid being overwhelmed. If you're into solo play, awesome, but keep in mind this game is designed for team content, and high level content will require you to team up at least some, or a ton if you find yourself questing. I look forward to all the new faces! ~Pirotek of Rosemary on Rushu			"

												Note: if you’re picking this up with friends, just make sure you’re put on the same server, so you can explore it together. When you first start, you’re going to be randomly sorted into one of the available INTernational servers by default. You can click the small “Manual server selection” to make sure you go on Rosal server together, for example.Don’t be fooled by the cute artwork! Dofus is not a typical mmo, and has a lot of depth. The game was released more than a decade ago, and has kept evolving and growing since then. If you’re at all a fan or interested in tactical gameplay, you will like the combat. I’ve always compared it to FFTA (final fantasy tactics advance), but far more dynamic, and set in a large MMO world. It’s the many interesting classes and their mechanics that have kept me playing all this time.This unique world has a wealth of stories, secrets, quests and achievements. You’ll also play the game through your friends, as this is an MMO after all, and play against them too: there are opportunities to fight against others not just nearby, but internationally and across all servers as well.In the end, Dofus is a game set in a fantastic universe, that lets you choose what sort of experience you’d like, with no shortage of content. I’ve personally tried many other MMOs, and nothing (except for Wakfu somewhat, and it’s the same developer) comparesIt’s free to download and try, and subscribing (not a recurring thing, you get 1 week/month/3months/6months/year at a time) allows you to interact with things outside of the first few areas. Believe me though, it’s definitely worth it. There’s also a system that will essentially allow you to play for free, and use the in-game currency to buy subscription time.http://www.dofus.com/en/play/silverhandii "

												Played this game religiously when I was 11/12 years old. Back at it again at 22 and still loving it just as much as I did the first time. Must say they did make the graphics a lil more childish but the chess like turn based gameplay and build-a-character RPG aspects are what makes this game so much fun to me. Very casual but very fun if you can handle slow paced games.			"

												I absolutely love dofus. I have been playing it since  2009.  Originally  i started with My   2 friends we all played together. Than eventually they stopped playing i continued playing i outleveled them got to 200.   There is so many things to do on dofus including professions dungeons  pvp  meeting awesome people.  You  can   use Pets/Mounts.  Join a guild and be part of an alliance!  All in all i believe its a well   thought out game and i would 10/10 recommend.   As always if anyone decides to play the game and im able to access dofus. I would be more than willing to   give you a week subscription once you finish incarnam. And Welcome to Dofus!For more information regarding dofus  you can  go to  the links listed below.http://forum.dofus.com/enhttp://www.dofus.com/enhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Dofus/http://impsvillage.com/ "

												this game is not free to play it   has a demo mode. where you default to if you dont have a  sub. i and a lot of players who are veteran at the game make enought game gold to pay for subs and never have to spend a penny. but i would not expect rookies to be able to pull it off has the demo mode is pretty restrictive.however this is a great unique mmo using a turn base battle system. (much better then wakfu in my opinion) there 35 spells you can use 33 of them in pvp. there no holy trinity.  you dont need a spesific class for a dungeon ether.each class feels unique. and you can level up all spells and use all 33 spells in a fight. (about 20 of your  spells are class spesific with the rest being global)a bit of a note tought. leveling to max level is not hard when new classes come out people hit max level witin 24-48 hours. (level 200). (but that requires loads of in game money/knowledge) it dose not feel like a grind to 200. your main focus will usually be getting money/equipment and the levels come natrually.			"

												This is my childhood turn based MMORPG similar to final fantasy tactic advance, one of my favorite gameboy game. This is not a F2P game, its a sub mmorpg with a ''zone trial'', though there is no other game like this out there. Dofus 3 is on the way so until then, try it out its great for its age!My only con, is the new artstyle wich is very childish.. its sad, but the game remains very good.			"

												It's old, it's weird, it's not perfect in any way, but it is charming and [I think] very fun. The fact that it requires a sub at a certain point is no big deal IMO as it is MUCH cheaper than other sub games. I agree with others that the f2p is a bit misleading, but it's not really a big deal. I say give it a shot. Honestly you'll know if you want to play more of it long before you hit the sub wall, and again it's really cheap. Cheers :)			"

												I remember being apart of the beta launch and couldn't continue my character afterwards due to all of the subscirption restrictions. I'm so glad there is some lift off of that, and I can enjoy this casual game again. The artwork and soundtrack are so well done, and the game play is incredibly smooth. I'm hoping that the restrictions won't lock out of the majority of the game or storyline this time.The syncing between Ankama and Steam is a little buggy, so don't freak out if you notice your achievements aren't showing up. I currently have 53 in game that aren't showing up on Steam.  Apparently they're working on making it sync better. Knowing Ankama's service though, I doubt they'll cooperate quickly or even fully. Read other Dofus veterans' experiences with the comapny below and you'll get a quick understanding on this.  Support/lack thereof drives a lot fo players away, but hey! It's on Steam now, so maybe it won't be that bad this time around? :)			"

												I have poured hundreds and hundres of hours into this game. I really liked it, but got a little burned out and left for a while. When I came back, I found my server to be almost completely dead. There is no one here who does anything with other people, its all a bunch of people running 6+ characters at once and soloing all the content. Which is not a terrible thing.  This is really the only mmo where you can realistically play solo, which I really like. However, as a new player just starting out it makes it very difficult. No one is available to help you, you just have to figure it out on your own. I would still recommend the game, just be sure to check out which server to start on. Some are much more active than others.Also, as mentioned before multiclienting is allowed and even encouraged, and in my opinion is the best way to play the game as it can take quite a long time waiting for your turn with only one character, but I have not been able to figure out how to do it off the Steam client, which is a deal breaker for me since I have 5 characters.

												If you've ever played a turn based game in your life and even somewhat enjoyed it, you really need to play DOFUS. I've been playing on and off for 10 years. Occasionally I'll take a break because of life/boredom and I'll go try out another game. Yet DOFUS always pulls me back in due to how frequently its updated and how unique it really is. How many mmorpgs do you know that offer an enriching turnbased combat? I have yet to encounter a single one outside DOFUS/WAKFU. Not only that but the class system is great. 17 soon to be 18 classes that are both distinct from each other and so unique from many mmorpgs. How many games do you know where there exists a class solely devoted to getting drunk and throwing people across the map? I acknowledge that without subbing you can only get up to levels 40-60 or so without really pulling your teeth out, but the subscription cost is very cheap as far as sub-based games go and definitely worth it. Final comment on the matter is the pvp system. 1v1 pvp is very enjoyable but the rewards are mostly cosmetics. However the 3v3 pvp system that unlocks when you hit level 50 is amazing. I'm someone that usually avoids pvp, but turnbased pvp with friends (or even randoms) in a small team like that just somehow works so well. Not to mention you get tons of money and various rewards for winning.  I don't have much else to say besides please give this great game a try. If you ever need help starting out just message me and I'd be glad to show you around and get you started.			"

												Ok everyone, This is my first review of a game EVER. This is not totally F2P, but it is F2P till lvl60. But the subscription to this gamee is only 6.90 which is quite cheap and is quite worth it. I love this game so far, Ive leveled two characters now up to level 21 and both have been quite fun and challenging. I really wish there were more guides and such to classes and such tho because it does get confusing as to what to level up and what to put points into sometimes. Sometimes there are a bit of difficult quests that you need to look up online but overall they are pretty easy. If youve played MMORPG's before its pretty standard. I kinda wish the resources would refresh quicker but no big deal. So...thats my review...hope everyone gives it a try and enjoys it as much as I have!!!			"

												Oh man...where to start?! This game...i have played it for....well... almost 11 years on & off now... once you start and get into it..kiss your life goodbye. You will never leave ;) ;) This is unlike any game i have ever experienced and played.  The community is amazing, the developers always have something up their sleeve, its always striving to get better-- the people you meet will eventually become your family :), the friends you make, experiences, everything about it just keeps you returning no matter what  :) Don't get me wrong tho, there are ups and downs BUT there are more ups than there are downs :D :D ;) I've been sitting here typing, erasing, retyping, trying to explain Dofus perfectly to draw you in but i just can't seem to get the words right...!

												Hello, and welcome to Dofus!Dofus is a turn based strategy MMORPG. It started out with 12 classes (hence the name ""World of Twelve""), but in the past couple of years they've added more and more classes which have spiced up the game a lot! This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I'm not just saying that. I've been playing this game for over a decade and I've loved every minute of it.    This game will challenge you in almost every way a game can. There are 17 classes (with hints of an 18th), and each class has 22 spells that are unique to that class. There are even more spells that all classes can have, but you must overcome different challenges to obtain them. Dofus takes a little getting used to when you first start playing, but as soon as you start getting on a roll the fun is endless! There are over 16,000 achievements that you can unlock ranging from extremely easy to damn near impossible! Unlocking an achievement will give you a certain amount of gold and experience depending on how difficult it was to unlock it.This is a game for both the hardcore gamers and the casual gamers! It just depends on your playstyle.There is an awesome system for Guilds, and Alliances in place that allows the players to control the map. If your Alliance is in control of the area you get a boost in EXP and drops! Other Alliances can attack areas they don't own to try take them over and you have to defend in a timed King Of The Hill that can result in a warzone of PvP fights!The players own the economy, so depending on which server you play on, the item that you want to buy may or may not be in the market. Unless you want to make the item yourself you can level up to 18 different professions by creating items using all the materials in their respected recipes (harder to make items give you more EXP, but require more mats).There is an enormous variety of monsters of different skill levels that each drop their own unique materials that you can sell, use, or make into certain items! You won't find yourself sitting around looking for things to do! There's so much more, but I would be typing for days, and even I don't know everything about the game!USEFULL EXTERNAL SITES:https://www.dofusplanner.com/  Use this site to find certain item combinations that will make your character even stronger!http://dofuswiki.wikia.com/wiki/Dofus_Wiki  This is the Dofus Wiki page; it will help you a lot with your journey if you ever get stuck, or want to know what a certain monster does, and how to beat it. Keep in mind though that it is player made, and so it might not have everything about the game in it.I HIGHLY recommend you play this game, I know you won't regret it! You can go to http://www.dofus.com/en/play/trilkgh to register your account and start playing today! Hope to see you in game! (Izmar, Please tell me if it's against the rules to advertise my Friend Referral link. Thank you!)  "

												10 years later, i'm still playing this game. I know the graphics may seem childish, but i'ts pretty much addictive for a basic mmorpg. The game always evolving month after month and the developers are making a nice job for their community.I guess we like it or we hate it. I play two months or three and after i can be an entire year to set this game aside.			"

												Definitely recommend.I've been playing for years, and although there have been some changes I disliked, the game is constantly being updated with new, better content to keep it exciting and fresh. The community is fantastic.Although it is advertised as free to play, the game DOES run on a monthly subscription model. You do not have to sub to play, and you can get a feel for things in the two starting areas. The game is NOT pay to win, either. You pay to play, but you don't have to buy gear or buffs or stats from the company to be on an equal footing with everyone else.I highly recommend giving it a try.			"

												I originally started playing this game almost ten years ago, before Dofus 2.0 (current iteration) released and when it was a very different game (such as alignment wars between Bonta and Brakmar were far more involved than they are ever since Kolossium.  Nonetheless, if you have the patience for grinding (quests are almost all fairly worthless compared to just leveling off specific PvE mobs) and prefer a more tactical style of combat with turned based actions, Doufs is worth a shot at playing.Granted, Ankama has made a large number of mistakes over the years with development decisions and had a nasty habit of completing ignoring large portions of the community in favor of specific niches, but the game itself has still managed to survive a company that did its popularity no favors.  Hopefully trying to start a revivial by making it available on Steam will help, because this is definitely not a game you should try to play alone.			"

I'm not terribly good at writing reviews so I'm gonna keep it short. This game is fantastic and one of a kind. Do NOT try to play it alone however. It is a community based game, and it always has been. Get some friends or try to find some in game. That said, if you like strategic, turn-based combat and a story-driven world, please give this game a shot. It deserves it.			"

												Sorry, just this is sad that they're still trying to milk money out of a game thats been around for so long. I mean in Wakfu, they did amazing ideas for pay to play that didn't screw over the free to play players. They did:- You can't vote for the election of your Nation- You don't have access to the newest update (1 month delay before you can)- You can't transfert item from one of your character to another (You can use your friend/guild/alt to help you so it's just a facility you don't have)All on wakfu, so there was no level cap and the newest updates would come to free 2 play after a month of it being out, so they could still explore. Please take a hint of what you did with your last game Ankama and do it with this one, since I love the ui and how this game is setup. However, I'm not gonna play something that I have to sink money I don't really have into.			"

												Dofus is not your typical MMO. It is designed, from the ground up, to be a fun, engaging, and visually stunning game... in 2D. Aesthetically, there are few games that can compare to the cohesive, stylistic beauty that marks Dofus, which transports us to a world where fantasy and magic feel real and new, much like my generation saw the bright, vast world of WoW at a young age and fell in love.Dofus, however, is not a mass-appeal game. I can only compare its team to Eve Online in this respect: It knows its audience, and it does a damn good job of pumping out the kind of content that they love. There are many aspects of Dofus that are unorthodox in today's game market - Non-binding items, a robust economy where professions actually do matter (as they produce all the items in the game), and a class of professions where it is actually possible to change the stats of items and add stats that were not there previously.It isn't all about professions, though. The turn based combat is carried by a gorgeous and well executed litany of spells, abilities, and animations that absoulutely showcase the dedication of the art team. This combat is made interesting not only by the mechanics, but your choice of character build. Character build in this game is, absolutely, your choice. Dofus features the old-style characteristics system where you allocate the points, rather then having them automatically assigned. There are still, of course, cookie cutter builds that some follow, but you do not have to be follow of them to excel: if anything, a person who learns the ins and outs of Dofus has innumerable opportunities to try out novel and interesting character designs that may surprise their fellow players.On the topic of fellow players we reach one of the games many strengths. There are alliances that do nothing but PVE, if thats what you enjoy. There are alliances that do nothing but PVP as well, and of course a smattering that do all sorts of activities together. If alliances are too big a community for you (although alliances themselves vary greatly in size), you can choose  to be in an allianceless guild that is a bit more cozy. (Or you can play solo, talk to nobody, quit, and wonder why you can't enjoy MMOs.)This game has been around for over ten years and I am still amazed by how many helpful, sociable veteran players there are. Although there are complaints about technicalities, as with all game communities, the Dofus community as a whole is passionate about the game they play, and more than willing to guide newcomers on their path to glory, loot, and lasting friendships.I cannot recommend this game enough: Try it, and if you like it, welcome home.

												I have played Dofus since about 2004. I stopped playing yesterday, Christmas of 2016, because a forum moderator banned me from the Ankama forum on Christmas when I explained in my own words what Christmas was about in a reply to a ""Happy Holidays"" forum thread started by another forum moderator. The moderator who banned me wrote a nasty letter to me blatantly insulting and persecuting me and Christianity. I told Ankama that as a result of this mistreatment of me, a loyal paying customer of about a decade -- and I have spent many thousands of dollars and so much time playing and contributing to the community -- Ankama denying or otherwise supporting this religious persecution of myself and other Christians, they have lost a customer. Let me be clear that Ankama supports International Human Rights violations and misdemeanors and felonies -- and when you are their victim, you have no recourse except to stop playing their game. Ankama does not issue refunds, nor have they shown any concern for the thoughts of players; they say one thing and then turn around and do the opposite; they lie to your face. Their business is run as a fascist regime, and players must fall into line or be made to suffer. My recourse is that they have lost my business.Dofus was fun for about 10 years, but the very low population in players among the English communities, the complete arrogant elitism of their French company (they are so extremely arrogant in their nationalism, I cannot even explain to you except through citing the stereotypical Frenchman, you would not even believe me if I told you how bloated this French elitism they exhibit is -- for example, they make excuses to IP block everyone from other countries), the lack of respect towards players by their customer service and community managers, and their history of initiating changes that completely ruin the fun of gameplay styles makes this game and any association with this company a disappointing experience for thousands of French and non-French players like myself over the history of the game. Their stifling of free speech is disheartening, and the nasty attitudes of moderators and community managers is seriously off-putting. The community manager Izmar is usually friendly, but experiences with the rest have almost always been upsetting and disappointing for me and those players who have shared their experiences with me.I honestly highly advise the Steam community to stay away from Ankama and Dofus. This is a gaming experience that will cause you harm and no good at all. And if you give them money, you become an even worse-off target in their crosshairs. Do yourself a favor and invest neither time nor money in this game or its company. They are going down the drain, so obviously headed toward bankruptcy and ruin, so don't let yourself get flushed down the toilet with them. You will not have any fun installing and playing Dofus. And God help you if you use their web sites at all. They are a basket of vipers and you will get a snake bite if you let them see you.			"

												i dont see myself subscribing to this game. thanks for letting me try it out but its not for me. turn based game at its slowest. yes thats right. its a turn based game meaning you get so many moves per tick and then its the enemys turn. sometimes your out numbered 3 to 1 and thats what i saw in the begining, hard telling what awaits you later on.long story short, this game would of been 10 times better if this wasnt a turn based game meaning if i could just hack and slash without delays and use my powers i would subscribe. i guess im just not a fan of turn base games. doesnt mean you shouldnt try it though. well... im going back to my other game, wurm unlimited. now thats the game for me			"

												Terrible Steam release... No way of connecting my existing account to play on Steam with it. Download the standalone version from their website instead.			"

												I've been playing this game since 2007. Had to take a break from time to time but I always get back on the game. One of the cheapest MMORPG in the world (7$ a month or 65$ a year), you will spend a lot of time fighting mobs, farming resources, in order to craft your own stuff or buy it with Kamas.Easy to learn, hard to excel, the world of 12 is huge: 18 classes, thousands of items, hundreds of mobs, hundreds of resources, dozens of jobs ...The game is complete !

												I've been playing this game on and off since 2006.  I love this game and it holds a very special place in my heart. Unfortunately, the game isn't what it once was. What was once an amazing social experience has turned into everyone playing multiple accounts and rarely grouping up with other people to level/do dungeons. The english speaking community is very small compared to what it once was and most people that play, like me, have been playing for many years.I will never forget this game and the love it has instilled in me for turn-based combat. Give it a shot and I hope it brings half the amount of joy it has for me to you. "
