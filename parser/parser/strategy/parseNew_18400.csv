												Game is not beatable at carrer 1-4 due to the wheel not move down the slightly slanted ramp. Even with verified correct solution it just does not work.			"

												I think placement was too frustrating to truly enjoy what is otherwise a good adaptation of the Incredible Machine concept.I found the game was way too picky about what was placed where.			"

												The concept of this seemed very interesting, but the game is clearly made for very young children. I would say it's best for ages 6-12, but it certainly doesn't pose a challenge for adults.Almost every text is read aloud, and the experiments tend to only have one solution. The menu structure is a bit weird and the controls could have been implemented way better.In general I would say: Buy it, if you got a child / cousin / friend in the correct age and let them play it, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.

												Even though I havn't played this game very long on steam, I was actualy introduced to a vertion after it came up for free on Amazon. My daughter and I played this game off and on for weeks until there were no more puzzles left.  No, Crazy Machines isn't nessarily *FOR* adults but the game is enjoyable enough so that adults could get into it. Those of you who are having technical problems try this link http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-695153.html . We got Crazy Machines 2 working on our windows 8 laptop by installing the nvidia PhysX driver.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS if you don't have a Pixelshader 2.0 combatible NVIDIA card. It will not run no matter what you do.To be honest you should not buy this game even if you have the required hardware because it seems to be coded like crap. Starts with the first start installation where it can't continue to install software because the version you have installed is newer. And no it doesn't just skip those steps, it just refuses to continue at all. End ends with non existant combatibility checks of the game.			"

												Just not worth it. Reviews are right. It's not an game of ""inventions"", it's just whether or not you can set everything up EXACTLY how they want you to, in essence just seeing if you can mimic them, which is the opposite of innovation. Also controls and placing of items are finnicky and annoying. 3/10.			"

												The game shows potential but any form of enjoyability is ruined by the clumsy and poorly designed user interface. Rotating objects is a pain because of their small size, you have to click the object extremely precisely; even then, the pop up menu appears after a second or two (the delay becomes very annoying). Attaching ropes to objects is a pain. You have to place the objects first, then click each end of the rope and attach them to the objects. That's about 4 clicks but turns out to be 20 because of that extreme precision required. I have still not been able to figure out how to resize walls. Sometimes they obey the clicks, at other times they stay unresponsive.The backgrounds and shadows in the game make the levels seem very cramped and cluttered and if it were not for the on screen markers at the start of the level (a bit like how they show play-by-play in sports like soccer), you would never be able to guess which object they were talking about. The shadows can be disabled but the backgrounds can't (or at least I haven't figured that out).WIth the large number of objects available, you would think there would be comprehensive information about how some of the trickier objects work. No such luck.The positive points of the game include smooth and beautiful object animations and well implemented physics. Due to the problems listed above, I couldn't progress much into the game to properly appreciate it. It was THAT annoying.All in all, the game can be enjoyable if the user interface and responsiveness are improved. In its current state, the game quickly becomes irritating.			"

												This game dissapoints me. It runs fun on my computer and I have no trouble getting it running on any of my laptops but as an incredible machine style game it fails on several levels.The first is the Part variety, now there is a wide range of interesting parts and even some that use Nvidia physx, I particularly like the water physics, HOWEVER there is a distinct lack of things like walls, floors and slopes in player made puzzles. Yeah you see all those curved walls everywhere in the screenshots? To the best of my knowledge you either have to unlock those or cannot use those at all in your own puzzles. Also the only walls you can make can be broken and both the shelves and walls have very limited size.This leaves me feeling creatively stunted as it looks like I more or less have to use everything they give me in very specific ways rather than letting me expeiriment with using things in ways other than its primary use.The other thing that dissapoints me about this game is that they slapped a completely arbitrary limit on how many of every item you can use in free build mode, granted its 20 per item but its still dissapointing to see item limits applied to specific items rather than across the entire contraption as a whole.I did not have trouble getting the game to run, it started up completely fine for me but I've heard that some people have issues with getting the game to run and I cannot comment on that because I don't have that issue.Now when I saw this game back whenever I bought it several years ago I had three things on my mind that sold me on it ""its the incredible machine, it has physx, and its in 3d."" Having spent a LONG time as a kid throwing together rube goldberg contraptions in the incredible machine this sounded like a dream come true for me. And then the let downs started rolling in:First: you don't have all the parts unlocked at the start, you have to go through the campaign to unlock them, this is bad because you don't have all the tools nessasary to start building puzzles on your own. Second: the way the basic walls and floors are discourages building more interesting puzzles because you cannot effectively seperate things out to force the player to think the way you want them toThird: the campaign puzzles seem arbitrary and lack a lot of the life puzzles in the incredible machine had, the decoration elements are very much lacking compared to what you could do in the incredible machine(meaning I hope you like the brick background because you'll be seeing it a LOT)Fourth: Physx is cool but I get the impression that even with the fluids dlc(which came out some years after the game itself) that it isn't being used effectively, it seems to work fine for solid body physics but considering the trouble it causes for people to install the game I would have liked to have more things be destructable(like some of the floor blocks in the incredible machine)All in all I'm dissapointed in Crazy Machines 2 as a follow up to the incredible machine because I think moving to 3d put a lot of the basic mechanics a step back even while it added more advanced mechanics. I don't feel like these new mechanics have as much potential for interesting puzzles or are as open ended or well thought out as some of the things in the original Incredible Machine game.			"

												Negative review which is not related to the actual design of the game...or wait, maybe it is.The developers decided to make this ""PhysX"" based. Unfortunately that means that if you're (most likely) not using the supplied PhysX version some levels are simply uncompletable. Of course you could be rolling back to the ""correct"" version of PhysX, but whoever designs a game to only run correctly on ONE version of a graphics driver that is being CONSTANTLY updated has a severe lack of foresight. I just completed the last CM 1 missions and the game to this day and age still works flawlessly. Why ♥♥♥♥ with that formula and introduce randomly behaving elements that can break the game? Very nice.So far it's only levels 1-4 (spoke doesn't move) and 1-7 (barrels do not behave the way they are supposed to), but I wonder how many more levels are broken and of course never fixed. The devs have even acknowledged these issues, but they didn't seem to be interested in fixing them. Old game and all. Even in levels that can be completed the physics are somewhat questionable (if a ball hits a spring it should be catapulted back based on its weight and the speed with which it hit the spring...this is clearly not the case...at all, it's just random). That's why it gets an automatic ""not recommended"". Apart from that the game launches at least.To give you an example of 1-7: There are 3 barrels that need to be delivered into the end zone in a particular order. However, the barrels don't move the way they should at the start (where you can't even influence them). I was able to get all barrels into the end zone, but the order is impossible to achieve, which results in mission failure. I tried it with a guide, I watched YouTube videos. The barrels just behave differently. I even tried the integrated solution system in the game, which auto solves a level. Well, that one can't even get all barrels to the end zone. They get stuck well before. So, it's clearly a PhysX issue. I refuse to go through the hassle of uninstalling PhysX and reinstalling the old version. Since it is not possible to have 2 versions installed and all other games might break if I do that and because it's generally a lot of hassle...So, I'll just finish what's possible. At least there are cheats out there to unlock all levels.			"

												Seems to be working fine. But then, this machine is at least 5 years old. CPU must be 10 yo.

												Sadly I cannot recommend this game :/I can tell the devs have had a LOT of work in the creation of this game, however there are quite a few issues that just make this (at least for me) an experience that's more painful than enjoyable.By far my biggest complaint about the game is that it's so chaotic on the eyes!All pieces are really finely textured and with tiny little details while the backgrounds are also really busy messes that WILL confuse your eyes with or without shadows turned on...So that aspect alone made me have a less than enjoyable experience with the game, but I still battled through it because I like this type of games and wanted to give it a shot...However the main problem is this: Solutions are not consistent!Not only do things happen slightly differently each time, I assume because they use real time physics and whatnot, but also, as seen on other reviews, on level 1-4 they just DON'T WORK.I struggled a lot with it, tried a solution that would allow me to complete both objectives but the wheel always got stuck... I gave up, and just focused on the main objective with the parts that I had... I then  checked the ""correct"" solution and it was the exact same I had before, but even with that the wheel didn't go down the slope! :/So I cannot recommend this game until those 2 things are fixed: - Simplify the models and make the background either simpler or dimmed so it doesn't interfere with the objects that do matter;- Make sure the result is always the same regardless of lag, etc and what type of computer you have...I know it's a tall order but the models and background shouldn't take TOO much work to fix, and the gameplay mechanics HAVE to work properly otherwise the game doesn't really work right?

												Ultimate and best version of all Crazy Machines games out there. Great, fun game for the family, kids, teenagers, even found it fun as a student, but buy and play only non-steam CM2 and it's Add-On Back to the shop.  Tip: Disable Post Processing and force high quality Anti-Aliasing like SSAA and similar for best visual quality.Puzzles are nicely designed, this has by far the highest production value of all Crazy Machines games and a lot of content. Sometimes you can stray off the path for a better solution, though it might be tricky to find such one.But somehow the developers managed to partially brake the game. It's now impossible to solve first task of the Back to the shop add-on. Also each time starting or installing it, it reports an error. Can be clicked away in my case, but nothing changed since months and this issue is very well known. Kinda sad to see this otherwise really fine game to break down like that. The physics engine was by far the best and reliable of all Crazy Machines games, but not anymore. Fix your stuff and if you don't, stop breaking it.The time travel add-on was a huge letdown. While the main game and the first expansion Back to the shop featured high quality content, the Time Travel add-on as well as the Liquid Force add-on were a desaster. Not only Liquid Force doesn't run on non-NVIDIA cards, but it also features breakable puzzle just like the Time Travel add-on. By breakable I mean puzzles which are solvable through a ridicoulously stupid solution like letting a box or something fall down on a trigger and solve it. This isn't a shortcut, it's broken. Very poorly testing done.Main game + Back to the shop, really recommend to play it, especially for teenagers and kids. It's so much fun sitting and solving this stuff together with a friend, but new bugs are introduced with this steam release making some parts of it unsolvable. Inacceptable state. Yet, new DLC (read: Cash grab, as it features only low qualitiy puzzles and just ""nice"" assets) appears  and keeps coming and coming and coming without fixing any of these heavy issues this game is being plagued from.

Frustration ends up being so high that this game can't quite let you enjoy all the potential it has.Pros: Interesting set of gadgets to work with Online community for potentially extended play A LOT of levelsCons: Physics mechanics suck No ""retry"" button, forcing you to replay a level from scratch if you missed the golden gear objetive by literally misplacing an object by an inch.

												I had a game way back years ago on my Windows 95 comp, it was called ""The incredible Machine"" (when it was running the game the computer just called it ""TIM"")  it was made by a company called Sierra. Crazy Machines has alot of the same mechanics as TIM, which is why I bought it. Crazy Machines is very lively and full of intrigue to me, I can't help but notice that it is a very precocious game, like it is ahead of its time, but still right where it should be. All-n-all it's very fun to play, I must say.			"

												crazy machines2 is a fun level building game. It has more elements and levels than any other crazy machines game. The only thing it doesn't have like is the ability to set wood on fire like crazy machines elements.  it is a bit complicated so I would suggest that you play the first 10 levels. This game like many  of the other crazy machines games has an in-game editor. like crazy machines elements you have to earn the parts to use in the editor. If you want to have the parts unlocked forever once you start to type in ""gimmeall. once you type that in you should see cheat all part available. To have unlimited uses of parts in the editor type in moreelements with no spaces but you will have to type in this code every time you log in to crazy machines 2. All in all, this is a fun challenging game.			"

												EDIT: You know, nowadays I quite realize that the game is way too literally broken to recommend it up and I should have recommended it down. It's just that I am biased heavily toward this series that I was willing to overlook it. You may want to try some older PsyhX or something. But yea, you probably should avoid this game after all.Crazy Machines 2 is a sequel to Crazy Machine, not counting Crazy Machines 1.5, released in 2008. It's a game of genre of Incredible Machines, where you build a machines out of many details that will accomplish the goals in one way or another. Or more exactly, you feel the needed spaces with limited amount of elements to find one of few correct solution. More of classic puzzle than anything sandboxy you see lately.Game even supported PhysX new-by-then hardware.And now, about how it runs nowadays on Steam.It runs badly!First, many people have trouble at making this game start at all. I didn't had problem with launching it. You should check demo version first somewhere to see if game will run for sure or not. If you will have trouble then try to find and (re)install OpenAL.Then I personally had physics not work in this game. Managed to fix it by reinstalling PsyhX and then rebooting computer. Though I have feeling that rebooting was enough, after all game itself should install PsyhX drivers. Anyway. Try to reboot computer first after installing game.Get demo off Internet and try it first!Once you are past launch troubles (which you may not have), you still have the amazingly screwed physics in game itself, which is quite a really bad thing for physics-based puzzle.The thing is that physics are not reliable. Tweaking some elements may change the resulting behavior of other elements that aren't connected to the one being tweaked in any way. You may be changing gears around in one part of map and it will somehow make baseball miss the bucked while rolling off slope somewhere else, for example. It's quite frustrating when you got solution right, yet it may not work until you play around with objects.That, and the way that physics work in game seemed to slightly change from when it originally came out. What it means is that some solution don't work anymore. Now, it doesn't affect Crazy Machines 2 much, I enjoyed beating it fully. but there is a single puzzle in Bonus Labs, puzzle number 18, where official full (with bonus objectives) solution doesn't work. You can however get to see the full solution that community figured out in a list of high score records, by watching replay, once you rush through puzzle without completing bonus objectives.DLCes seem to have more of broken puzzles, so watch out for those.Puzzle instructions, which funny professor with overgrown moustaches narrates (instead of being annoying by popping in randomly for some always-repeated comment like in the original CM), also have small problems. The on-screen drawings that point out objectives appear much slower than voice reads the text. Even more, I noticed that some of the later puzzles have intros where voice narrations and text have little differences. And there was even a puzzle where text and voice instructions put ""in what order it should be done"" incorrectly, different from on-screen drawings!As you can see, Crazy Machines 2 is full of technical flaws. Which is quite a shame, because it's superb sequel to Crazy Machines.It has a much more ""high-budget"" feel to it than previous title, sporting modern-by-then shiny graphics, support of more complex physics (Like, ropes can be hanged without being connected to anything, useful for just pushing objects.), even 15 themes, with their own decoration and music. Soundtrack is a bit too much of ""stereotypical local"", but got nice pieces, like Caribbean theme that sounds slightly like something from Monkey Island . On bad side it's hard to understand whole puzzle system from the first look, new graphics/style are quite messy, also having useless decorations mixed in.It also introduced new complex systems of gears and laser, making them often main focus of puzzle. There are also robots made of 3 parts and switches on which you can place switch of any given type, like button or timer clock. Instead of puzzles being one-trick physics stuff, you often will have to manipulate whole system of gears, lasers, electricity, switches. Which isn't such bad thing, especially knowing that physics are buggy here.And every puzzle in this sequel concentrates on mostly figuring out where in the system to place each elements. There are almost no puzzles where the only thing you have to do is pixel-perfect placing of elements, unlike original Crazy Machines. I mean, not when you figure out how it should work, but when you are busy tweaking placement, being frustrated with it. I like Crazy Machines 2 approach so much more!Not to mentioning that it saves some work when it comes to precise placement after all by having a minimal step which elements can be moved by, so to say.Game also gives you mandatory and bonus objectives, while also providing with text clues and other hints, giving it less frustrating moments. Unlike Crazy Machines, where you either figure out solution to some-super-tricky puzzles or don't progress at all.Overall, you will get 150 main puzzles to solve, with last 40 of which being hidden until you beat all previous ones properly. There is also 10 tutorial puzzles that you should do. 20 more Bonus puzzles. And 20 more bonus puzzles that were made exclusively for PhysX hardware. No, you can't access those. So no idea what to expect in them.You also can design your own puzzles for your own amusement or to send it to others. Yes, you can download and upload your labs in the game to the server. And editor lets you do quite a lot of things too. Though, for some reason it has some elements locked. The requirements for those is to get some awards in main campaign, by, for example, using fireworks few times. Bad thing is that it doesn't tell you what exactly you are supposed to do to unlock them, from what I know. In all honesty, I didn't try making my own labs or try using others, so I can be wrong.Overall, I can recommend this to only those who are ready to handle technical difficulties and those who loved Incredibly Machines games. It's good sequel and I can overlook all trouble I sometimes had for all fun I had with puzzles that didn't feel unfair.Everybody who doesn't want to bother, well, eh, should avoid this one.Perhaps I should give this game thumbs down, but at core it's real good. I had fun.Now, I also should mention that Back to Shop DLC, that has glitchy store page so you can't review it, is way too bugged. While it's good, few puzzles don't work properly anymore, official solutions will not do. So watch out, if you are planning to get it, then you will have to live with few unbeatable puzzles and not being able to access last 10 puzzles.			"

For me, two dlc don't work and a few other levels are bugged and the devs don't seem to care. But it's still worth the price (i bought the complete pack in discount and played for more than 92 hours with all these crazy machines games)			"

												Crazy Machines 2 is an amplified Physic Puzzle game. Almost every Item introduces it's own weight. Inclouding a connection between Science and Magic. Anything can happen if you fill your rooster with all available DLC. With the current available puzzles, you can have fun for even an entire year.The negative part of the game is that it requires very big performance computers to work properly, because low performance dosen't show up in lag. It changes how the scenery plays itself. Glitches, and even unsolvable puzzles may show up. And you don't have the ability to set up the game for worse cases. There are only a few settings you can set up.In my case, when I got the game, it did not work in any of the computers in my reach. It took 5 entire years for me to finally ""play"" this game. That 5 year was begin by purchasing the game. But when I finally played this... It was an amazing experience. I recommend this for sure!			"

												Finally came back to playing this.  It's a garbage version of the first one :/.  More stuff, less possibilities.  Everything's been place on a noticible 'grid'.  All puzzles have a set solution.  Controls are tedious.  Buggy mess.  Some puzzle's can't be solved, because of a bug with the camshafts and I can't connect two gears if they're the max distance apart when that's how the level starts.			"

												¬¬ . It simply don't works. I've tested it in 3 different systems, but still not working.The problem is probably occurring because of my version of Visual Studio is too recent, soo good luck if you are trying to play this game in a modern system.			"
