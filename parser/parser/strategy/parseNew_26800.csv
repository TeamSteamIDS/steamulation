												Braid is... Not For EveryoneThe time twisting, puzzle platformer is brilliantly made, fantastically designed but a killer on the brain. The introduction to the game drip feeds you the information you are required to complete it, and its all down to you to apply the knowledge you have been given. Now this is where opinions will divide; I enjoyed the challenge and that inspired me to push on. You could argue this game is actually really boring, I would disagree, but essentially it is advanced jumping with time elements. The story is strong, the character is great, albeit eccentrically odd, and the mechanics are near flawless. If you are a naysayer, play this in chunks and it'll win you round. I think compared to other indie titles this game is perfectly priced at £5 - £10. If you don't enjoy the art style, then anything below that and you have got a steal and its worth a shot.

												A damn good game, this one. Back when i was not so much into indie games, i saw ""Indie Game: The Movie"" which drove me to get this game. I did and played it and just loved it. The puzzles were really great and even a bit tough and they kept me thinking about how to get that puzzle piece even when i wasn't playing the game. I literally kept thinking most of the day. No game has ever done that to me before i think. And when i solved the puzzle somehow, i felt this great sense of achievement and it made me so happy. Even made me feel very intelligent :p . I fell in love with this game. Loved the concept, loved the gameplay, loved the puzzles.  The story was a bit confusing for me but i liked it nonetheless. I even kept staring at the screen for a long time to figure out how i can solve the puzzle. And then i discovered ..  stars. Could not figure out all of them, only 2 of em. So i had to see some guides but the effort it took to get the stars made it worth it.  I would rate this game 10/10.			"

												One of the most acclaimed puzzle-platformers, Braid led the first generation of mainstream indie games. Its level and puzzle design are nearly flawless as they instruct the player in each world's time altering mechanics while also providing compelling challenge. Most of Braid can be played non linearly, so if you get stuck you can try another level and maybe later come back with new ideas to the one you left. It's still beatiful though it has aged a bit. I'd appreciate a hint system but I respect Jonathan Blow not wanting to compromise his design vision. The story has multiple layers of meaning though you'll have to finish the game to see the whole picture understand it in restropect.			"

												Sometimes, when watching a film or reading a novel, you feel a burn of emotion deep inside your chest. Something that affects you so profoundly that it moves beyond being just a form of media. It is internalized and remembered forever.Braid is one of those things. But it isn't just an example of art in gaming, it's a game full of pure genius as well.The game, at first, comes off as a platformer. There are relatively little instances of hardcore platforming in the game, and they usually only serve as a medium to allow you to interact with the puzzle that you're dealing with. Make no mistake, this is a puzzle game at heart.The puzzles here are incredibly good, and very well scaled from level to level. The first two levels are relatively easy and will only take you a few minutes, the third is a bit harder, and the last puzzles will make you feel like your brain is deflated. The amount of time that you'll have to put into each puzzle may be debilitating for some, but the sheer joy and pleasure of solving one overcomes any sense of stress that staring at your screen racking your brain may cause. These aren't just run of the mill puzzles, either. There are a number that are, in my mind, some of the best puzzles that I've ever seen in a game.The art direction is beautiful. The backgrounds are watercolor constructed, they're vibrant and bright, and dark and brooding. The soundtrack is perfectly placed and flooded with beautiful violin work. Each are augmented by an incredibly written preface that comes prior to starting each level. The story is written so broadly and so metaphorically that it can literally be translated to represent whatever the player would like it to. The ending represents one of the epic twists in video game history, and does so in game -- a puzzle in itself.I literally cannot think of one thing that I dislike about this game. It could be longer, but length can't really be expected from a game that costs so little.There is so much value stuffed into the 10ish hours that you'll spend playing this game, it's hard to put it into words any other way than just to spout off the cliche of ""buy it and experience it yourself"". It's an experience to be had, and it's one of the most artistically beautiful exhibits in gaming history that is guaranteed to affect you in a most profound way.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Braid Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: Puzzle-Platformer; 2D; Time-Warp My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-6 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Puzzle game aficionados REVIEWBraid is a short and sweet puzzle/platformer with an quasi-innovative time-manipulation aspect.  The ability to rewind time not only allows for intriguing gameplay, but also provides a good way for there to be challenging puzzles without the game becoming unnecessarily frustrating. If you like puzzle/platformers, this should be high on your list of games to try.The game mixes elements of puzzlers and platforming to form its identity. And there is a comfortable familiarity to the game which should feel inviting to most gamers. It starts off mostly focused on thinking-based puzzles and then a little while into the game there does start to be some platforming aspects sprinkled in, where your reaction time and precision abilities will be tested.  But for the most part it's pretty mild and not that hard.  Again, the time-manipulation also helps alleviate some of the difficulty of the platforming sections. It works out so a large majority of people should have an easy time enjoying Braid.And as you progress through the game you will unlock different time-manipulation abilities which will need to be used properly to complete your quest. So the gameplay evolves throughout the campaign, keeping things fresh and keeping your mind active.There isn't much of a story to be mentioned, but the game doesn't really need one. There is a strong influence of old school platformers (i.e.: the early Mario Bros. games). In that vein, there is a basic purpose to your actions, but no need for a sprawling narrative.  Your quest in Braid is to traverse hostile lands to rescue a kidnapped princess, what else do you really need to know. Also, there isn’t that much of an immersive atmosphere either. The ambiance feels very nondescript and purely functional. However, none of this is a bad thing; Braid is simply a game that is focused on gameplay, purposefully minimizing the other distractive aspects.And so I definitely recommend you check out Braid if you’re a fan of the puzzle/platformer genre and are looking for a new game that focuses on gameplay. Also if you are someone who loves a real challenge, the speed-run achievement can give you a nice ""run for your money.”Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Braid is a platforming puzzle game which was released on Xbox Live initially in 2008 before later being ported onto PC in 2009.  You play the character, Tim, as you attempt to rescue the princess from a monster (very cliche!). Game play in Braid looks like a very generic puzzle platformer on face value, however with the addition of the special ability to manipulate time by rewinding and fast forwarding, you can find yourself in some very unique situations.  The other gameplay elements are very much the same though, running, jumping and climbing around a standard platforming environment.  Each level in the game adds a little bit of a change to the time bending ability which keeps things fresh each time you progress.  Braid is a very simple looking game; the graphics are standard two 2D style, however they do have a very pleasing charm to it. The art style within the game is just gorgeous to look at. The art work alone apparently took over a year to produce, and you can really tell a huge amount of heart and effort went into creating it. The plot in Braid is very intriguing indeed. You are certainly in for a few twists and turns and very unpredictable outcomes throughout - I was personally in no way shape or form expecting the end of the game to end up how it did; and that is a nice change from a game since they can sometimes become very predictable. After finishing the game, you are able to find additional text that expand the story even further too. The music used in Braid was selected by the developer himself, from licensed music, this was done to reduce the cost in the development stage. What I really liked about the music is that each tune has a different feel to it when you re-wind time in game; its a really small element, but it makes a huge difference to how you feel when playing. I found Braid to be a difficult game; purely because I am the worst person possible when it comes to 1) Puzzles and 2) Platformers. Put the two together and it's just a mess.  At times I had to resort to a trusty walkthrough to work it out, but for the majority of the time I was able to figure out each level on my own. Puzzle veterans may well find this game's puzzles to be easy, and still struggle on the platforming element to it!Braid took me just over six hour to complete; this was purely a run through the story mode; there are a lot of Jigsaw pieces to find in the game which result in achievements, so will add a couple more hours of gameplay. Some of which are unobtainable at the first time of coming across them, so a little bit of replaying older levels is needed to collect them all. However I personally see no reason to replay the game only for the achievements.  The story and gameplay 100% linear. I had no technical problems whilst playing. Braid can be played at all resolutions up to 4k in windowed mode and full screen. A controller, as always with platformers is highly recommended to play but can also be played with keyboard. To sum up, I am only going to Recommend Braid, simply because the two genres put together are my least favorite of all time, however take that with a pinch of salt because if you really enjoy puzzle/platformers, then this game is certainly for you and you need to pick it up, even at the full price of £6,99 this game is a steal!  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												First off, terrific sound track. If there's a soundtrack version buy it. The art style and animation is great, actually better than great. The story is good but it's kept a bit separate from the game play and you might have a question or two in the end (I think that was on purpose though, to create debate). Most puzzle are solvable with a few tough nuts but the ability to skip puzzles until later is nice. Often something in a later puzzle will give you a flash of realization about an earlier puzzle.Not a particularly long game, unless you like speed runs, but for a few bucks it's worth seeing why there are so many indie puzzle-platformers right now.

												What if you could go back in time and undo a mistake?What if you are the mistake?Braid belongs on a list of top games of all time. It is a work of art.If you have not played Braid yet, I would ask you to stop what you are doing right now and buy it.Being a puzzle platformer, Braid has excellent and unique art, music, concept, and story. The simple platformer type works well on both PC and consoles.My one critique is that the ending is somewhat unfulfiling in that the designer got all artsy-fartsy and left the meaning open to wild interpretation. Either he just didn't have a moral to tell at the end, or he went with the ""bluster them with bulls**t"" strategy, and I'm thinking it was the latter.But, even if you don't care about the background story and getting all deep into the meaning of it all, the puzzles should entertain.

												On the issue of games as art, I think Braid makes a very convincing affirmative case. While it is clearly the singular expression of a theme and voice, this is not to say that the game is not all one would want from a game - immersive, rewarding, inviting, and fun.Braid in my mind is essentially flawless and seamless in every respect - the sound design, the level design, the visuals, the mechanics, they all come together to create a challenging, thought-provoking experience. The player is drawn into a minimal, abstract narrative, invited to make sense of it, and indeed in this mind of exploration and this process of discovery, brought through a procedure of new mechanics, new challenges, all building upon each other systematically. This is the thing that probably most appeals to me about this game: its ability to be both thorough and systematic with the progression of challenges and the introduction of mechanics - and indeed the construction of narrative, emotionality, and theme, mutually interwoven - and simultaneously fluid and impressionistic in terms of visuals and its ability to blur mediums and narrative realities. The means by which the player can explore time are introduced procedurally, but they allow the player to explore the world in a way that alters its structure and flow, indeed these mechanics encourage the player to alter the way they think about that world and its construction. So too is this true of the themes and narrative of the game - introduced piece by piece, but out of order both in terms of time and place. In this sense, I believe Braid is the sum of a reciprocity between systematic and fluid construction and interpretive process - a game about tackling mechanics and proceding through levels, doubling back on old knowledge and synthesizing new solutions, and a narrative about interpreting memories, parsing trauma, constructing ideas and reconstructing ideas. In this all I think stories about exploring time travel to complete levels, wallowing in failed romance, indulging in nostalgia, creating art and destroying art become very similar narrratives - all of this communicated in the language of games, that is mechanics, and the tropic language of games in general, a very fundamental aesthetic of platform gaming and its time tested genre trappings.But fundamentally what motivated me through playing this game was the intrigue of discovering new mechanics and exploring levels, the sense of reward contained within that. And ultimately I believe that is what makes this game so successful, its ability to function on these different levels, and have these different levels be in communication with one another and elevate each other - indeed to bring to attention that process, to weave these threads and braid them into a whole. So, in totality, Braid is just a great game, a great work of art. I would suggest sitting with it, enjoying it, thinking about it, struggling with it.			"

												Its hard to describe this game without overusing the word ""beautiful""; Braid is in my top 10 favourite games of all times and its definitely my favourite indie game.Everything in the game seem to be an artwork: the music, the background, the puzzles, the storyline, sound effects, mechanics... its involving, gets you deep in the story if you try to follow it. Its challenging enough to get you thinking, but once you think, you get it. The puzzles are not long, everything you need to know is *there* (well, except for one single specific puzzle but that ain't a dealbreaker I assure you) and rarely rely on dexterity (unless you're interested in speed runs).The story is fantastic and got me thinking a while, but there is a ""k00l secret ending l33t for science"" which I didn't find cool at all. Basically, the first immediate one is a love story and the second one... its more about work and science (no spoilers shall be given), really, and it ain't all that beautiful. That's my only complaint about the game: the regular ending leaves some things in the air that only make sense in the pr0-tröö-g4m3r secret one, but the regular ending sounded way more appealing to me, and I wish the developer would have exploited more the vanilla one.If you like achievement hunting there isn't much challenge in this one here, except for the speed run achievement, which might need some practice but its not overfrustrating.

												It's mindblowing for a side-scroller. It cames to prove my motto: good graphics don't make good games. Furthermore, don't judge a book by it's cover and the smallest flasks holds the bestest perfumes and all the cliché catchphrases.At first sight, this game seems to be just ""one more of the same"", but if you are the kind of person who gets thrilled by a good story (yes, it's a side-scroller with story), a little plot twist and written narrative elements, jump in. You won't regret it.Besides the story, it has innovative puzzles that you must solve using some ""tools"" like a ""flash forward"" and ""rewind"" features. You could read some books at the final of each stage, knowing more and more about the game's story.In short, it's hard to praise and explain how this game is good without spoil all the fun.			"

												When the great movie critic Roger Ebert said that videogames are not, and will never be art, half the Internet rushed to convince him otherwise. Braid was one of the games they showed him as examples of art in form of videogames. He dismissed it saying he's not ""persuaded that I can learn about my own past by taking back my mistakes in a video game"", and called the story ""prose on the level of a wordy fortune cookie"".There was hardly a worse choice of game to show the movie critic -- not because it's a bad game, but because it relies heavily on hundreds of hours of other games' experience, playing with it, twisting the familiar mechanics, betraying the expectations and subverting the rules. Hours that Ebert obviously never experienced, so the words like ""Your princess is in another castle"" meant nothing for them, and the subversion that came with them (I'm not going to spoil that) never connected to anything.I'm not sure what the game's true story is -- it might be about the atomic bomb, or about a creepy stalker with a crush, or about time travel. What I'm sure is, it's about these hours we've spent playing Mario that suddenly turn inside out, showing that what once used to be a simple kid's fun can work as a mature artistsic medium, telling stories and bringing up emotion without a single line of text.

												Braid is one of the best arguments for video games as an artistic medium. This game is made up of much more than than its pleasantly detailed art style and its perfectly meditative background music with a few clever puzzles thrown in for interest. No, Braid is a game that focuses on exploring a concept, on teaching a truth, through challenges it presents to the player. Each of the game's six worlds begins with a few paragraphs of pure exposition, but the purpose this serves is more to provide context to the questions that follow than as storytelling. With the primer read, the world begins with its unique take on time manipulation - its own 'what if' in the form of puzzles. Solving these puzzles grants the player a piece of a larger picture and, more importantly, a better understanding of the complexities involved in playing a scenario out over and over again until the desired result is achieved. These 'lessons' are confined to their own particular world; the new mechanics don't build on each other, which is in itself another lesson. As incredible as teaching through player experimentation is, what makes Braid truly great is all of that pretension can be skipped by if so desired. The player can run right past any annotations without pause; what remains are puzzles that are just as engaging, art that is just as charming, and music that is just as sublime.			"

It feels great to solve one of the many puzzles but at the same time i feel it tries to be a little bit too clever for its own good at times. Apart from that it is well worth the price i payed for it on sale and its fun to jump into for a little time bending action every now and then. Be warned it will make your head hurt.			"

Sometimes you can clone yourself, sometimes you can slow time down and other times you can make time go in reverse or forward.  This is very well implemented in the puzzle solving portion of this game and this makes it one of the best of its kind.  A memorable game that will go down in history.			"

												Must be tons of reviews/recommendations by now. If you haven't played this game yet I'll write why you may want to consider this, especially if it's sitting in your library. Like a fine bottle of wine, maybe it's time to open it.So many indie games nowadays, but where did all these greenlight games spark from? It may be debatable, I certainly don't think Braid was the origin, but definitely a large contributor to the catalytic process. It was released back in 2008/2009, about 7 years ago.Why didn't I play it sooner? I have a lot of memories of playing 2D platformers back in the early 1990's. A lot of them were very painful, like The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants. Braid is actually a very well designed game. It's not painful to play. There are about 5 main worlds. Each of these worlds have unique mechanics that are activated mainly by rewinding time. So the whole rewinding thing isn't just a blatant rip off from Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time ... which was one of my main concerns, thus delaying Braid, as I had enjoyed PoP very much.What made this game fit all together nicely IMHO is actually the colourful dynamic background art and Irish Folk/Celtic genre of music. But what has made this game legendary to some people? It's the story. Only at the very end there's a twist! When you finish the game, there's a lot of unanswered questions which will get you to go researching online for the interpretation of what had actually happened. In essence the story is one big metaphor. There are also some nifty tricks that can be done to confirm it, if you are one to stray away from linear gameplay.Which brings me to ... well there are some really interesting and nutty people in life. You know the ones that do some really crazy stuff in games because they may be genuinely really interested in it. And John Blow had ingeniously catered for that crowd. I suggest playing through the worlds by yourself figuring out each puzzle. They're doable, trust me ... if I can do it, you can too :) Don't look up some walkthrough. But once your done with the closure of the game ... if you're content with the amount of puzzles you've solved ... feel free to do so.Having said that, I really don't like games where you can't go back and complete some small task or quest without having to replay the entire game again. What's ironic about this is I think this is a feature that stems from classic Japanese adventure video games. Something that Blow and Fish have complained about... Is the game epic? It's definately quite an accomplishment. To many people, I know this game is seen as epic. My personal preference however says it's a good game ... that somehow has become overrated. I can't quite point my finger on it though. I guess for me 2D platformers still have some sort of historical limitation. Like I remember games like Super Mario Bros. 3 when finding secrets like warp whistles ... etc ... that was exciting! Hopping in a boot in Ice World and sliding. Or jumping on a Parabeetle. Those were the moments! And spending late nights with sleepovers at friends places ... leaving the Nintendo on all night but turning the CRT TV off with the pull/push switch. That's a magic that I don't think can be replicated these days even with a game like Braid. Perhaps maybe for a younger generation, but we can't ignore the fact that they also have access to 3D and even VR these days.			"

												I really want you to play this!In fact, I can't be totally objective about it, because this game is one of my absolutely favorite ones, but I'm going to state that this the most well-made game in the whole universe.I mean, not a single component is out or feels weak, everything is how you want and expect it to be, or maybe even beyond your imagination.I'll try to give a clue about what the game is...It's a looking-like-Super Mario Bros.-platformer with a deep thrilling storyline and amazing mind-blowing puzzles that that require various manipulations with time. Our hero is able to turn the time back to the any point after you entered a stage without any limits or restrictions. Basically, you use to switch the time back if you die, so there're no game overs or anything in that kind. You don't have to restart a level when you die, you can just switch back the time to the point you can fix your faults and just move on. But what's more - in this game you use time switches for solving puzzles.The game is separated by worlds and every world has it's unique features, like time-resistant objects; shadows, that repeat your moves, which were previously recorded by you; a ring, that freezes the time in a little range around it and more. All these things will help you to solve the puzzles and save the precious Princess...or not. The difficulty of some puzzles is pretty challenging, it can require some great patience and irregular way of thinking. Also, the difficulty doesn't really change gradually. Every world has some relaxing and insane puzzles, they're just different in the way of solving. So you won't get bored nor annoyed. Every world has it's own atmosphere. Fantastic soundtrack and drawn game art will make you shiver every time you touch this masterpiece. Plus the storyline. Actually, if you play through this game quickly - you might not even notice it, because the whole story is written in the books which you may just skip. But you shouldn't, really. I spent an insane time playing this game before purchasing a Steam copy. Maybe to discover its' secrets, beat all challenges, etc, or maybe just to be in-game, in this gorgeously-made world. But the best thing that I've discovered over time is a plot. It made me look at this game at the absolutely different point of view. I found out that every single world, every single piece of a puzzles that you collect, world's atmosphere and their features - everything is related to the plot, which is rather ambiguous, full of metaphors and sense. I won't pretend to spoil about it, so just try this out yourself, it's an absolutely unique experience in the wold of games, so don't miss it and play this game right now!			"

												I think no words can describe how beautiful this game is. Don't ask, just buy it, now.EDIT: now that I can do actual reviews, I can say more about this game.This is a masterpiece, all elements from this game blend perfectly: story, graphics, soundtrack, gameplay, game design; it doesn't feel at all like a sum of its parts.I would prefer to not spoil to you anything of this game, but let's say it's a 2D puzzle-platform in which you must use time-control to solve puzzles.I suggest you trying the demo if you don't trust my words enough, but believe me, I beaten more than 500 games in my entire life, and this easily fits in my top 5.

												I have played through this game many times.  I've had a number of friends pop round just so I could complete a speed run for them! This game never gets old for me.Braid is a playform game with a heavy puzzle elemenet which for the most part is based on time manipulation.  The puzzles are wll thought out to a point that you may spend a while working them out at first but when you do, it leave you thinking, how did I miss that!  The visuals are beautiful with a stunning soundtrack and deep story.  If you are going to be playing this for the first time, I urge you not to rush and read through the books which present the story to you.  I fear many people miss it as they are acustomed to the story being forced upon you with cutscenes and dialog.For me, this game is in my top ten games of all time.			"

												I guess everything has been said about Braid already. Brilliant puzzle platformer with an emphasis on puzzles. Manipulate time in different ways to collect puzzle pieces and set them together to finish each of the 6 worlds. No real reason not to play this if you like video games.Although perfectly possible with keyboard I'd recommend a controller - especially for the speed run if you want to try that.			"

												I will recommend the game to those that like platformers with jumping through levels and solving minor puzzles. Controls in the game are simple, much like mario the core of the game is running and jumping, but they do throw some time manipulation in. And since you are reversing time you can't die in the game, as you just turn back time.The simple and easy to understand mechanics is the very core of the game, and the story isn't really all that interesting. There is a twist to the classic ""save the princess"" at the end, but other than that the story can pretty much just be ignored. It is about having fun with time and puzzles.The different worlds vary a bit in how you play with time, so there is some variation. The one I found to be the hardest was one where the world moves back and forth as you move. So move left and time reverse and right time goes forward.So yeah. A good experience if you are just in the mood for playing around with a platformer, that doesn't punish you at all for making mistakes.			"

												I see that a lot of people got ""scared of"" by the dificulty, and I don't blame them. On the other hand, I see people overhyping this game, those people I don't understand. The reason people like it, is the story, complemented by great soundtrack, graphics, and a very inovative time mechanic. The reason people don't like it, is the difficulty of the gameplay. My opinion here, is that the gameplay goes too far with being hard, sometimes just being idiotic, and that ruins the experince of the game. Specially if you consider how difficult it is to actually get the ending.  Maybe Braid could be considered art and therefore it needs patience.But I feel it wasn't fine tuned, it needs more patience than it is prepared to ""pay for"".I'm gonna vote negative, because I feel for the time you need to actually get through this game on your own, and get all the endings, you could have enjoyed yourself with something else and get more mental stimulation (if you wish to see it as art), or more enjoyment (if you just want a fun game), either way saving yourself from some rage.

												I wasn't smart enough for this game. At least, that's the conclusion I come to from reading so many glowing reviews and having such an ugly experience trying to play it.Braid has a lovable core time-warp gimmick: if you make a mistake, you can rewind your playthrough of the level as far as you like. It makes the first several levels' platform action-puzzle gameplay forgiving and enjoyable.Then the game starts layering additional gimmicks atop the gimmick. A level where simply moving in a particular direction reverses time for everything but you. A powerup that causes you to clone yourself when rewinding. Areas that trap objects such that they don't get rewound when everything else does.These things sound awesome, and they could have been, if the difficulty curve didn't go stratospheric as soon as they were introduced. I found myself skipping level after level, because the solution was either so opaque and convoluted that I had no idea where to begin, or because I could see the solution, but it required such flawless timing and precision that full play sessions of practice got me no closer to success.Then I learned that in order to finish the game, you must complete every. single. puzzle. Collect every widget in the game, cleverly disguised as bonus challenges. And I was done. Game uninstalled, added to my ""Let's Not"" category.			"

												Braid, developed by Jonathan Blow, fuses elements of platformers and puzzle games alike. It revolutionizes traditional gameplay mechanics, by allowing the player to manipulate time within the world; a mechanic that not only augments the unique narrative structure of Braid, but differentiates the game from other platformers.The player makes their way through the several worlds of Braid by manipulating time in order to collect puzzle pieces. Levels themselves are much like puzzles, as spatial reasoning is required in order to traverse each level and collect the required puzzle pieces to progress. The player is able to reverse time, manipulate key objects that are irreversible, and manipulate time through a time dilation ring. This gameplay mechanic augments the plotline of Braid, due to its unique narrative structure that bears resemblance to other narrative techniques used in media, such as the film Memento. Instead of jumping through (or on) obstacles, Braid’s gameplay encourages the player to think critically, much like other spatial reasoning games such as Portal. Although some of the levels of Braid are difficult to solve, it does not make the game any less accessible. Braid is an exceptionally well done indie platformer, offering a unique experience that is bound to challenge its players. The narrative structure and game mechanics all contribute to the experience. However, the game does not offer much replay value (unless if you wish to complete a speedrun), and the soundtrack could have been an area to where the developer could have produced original content for the game.

TL:DR:It's a great and beautifully designed game. Like me, you've probably been hearing about how great the game is for years: it is. It's one of those great games that make it obvious that games can be ""art"" while still being fun and mechanically sound.It gets the highest recommendation I can give it.VisualsThe art style is unique and cheerful, to the point of providing a striking juxtaposition when tempered with the dark themes presented in the story. Aesthetically, it's beautiful: there is great variety in the environments and depth to the pieces presented within. Regarding the mechanics, the platforming is well serviced by the art, platforms are easily distinguishable and the graphics filters make it evident that you are using your powers and what each power does.The game is not excessively taxing and the engine is implemented competently.AudioI am tempted to buy the soundtrack. The music is simply beautiful and matches the whimsy of the visuals stellarly.The choice of strings is perfectly tailored to the game and the rewind mechanics which carry to the sound as well (note that it can get a bit annoying when you are like a DJ turning the disk back and forth remixing the music, but I have to commend the follow-through on the game's vision).GameplaySimple yet perfectly responsive.The use of graphic and unobtrusive tutorials is one of the aspects that remark the effectiveness of the title, where manages to masterfully skirt the line between game and art resulting in an amazing experience.It's a quality puzzle platformer where your main skill is moving time back or forth and every one of the 6 worlds have new mechanics from the ability to zonally slow time, to having things unaffected by your time powers, to having a double repeat what you've done in the past. All of them are used in the levels, and pushed to the max when searching for the secret stars.There are quite a few puzzles that are mechanically beautiful, for example:  sequentially slowing down cannons with a moving platform or the final puzzle that played forward and back told opposing stories.If anything, I wanted to play a few more puzzles with the system designed; the inclusion of mods satisfied that desire.StoryIt starts in media res, and all allusions to the past are intentionally misty yet interesting.The story seems somber with an overtone of obsession, yet it is open ended and purposefully obscured. My interpretation on the story:Aside from the abusive relationship themes, some key phrases of the Epilogue like ""we have become ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" (or something like that) and what happens with the secret ending to me make it evident that the story addresses the problem of pursuing scientific progress without regarding the consequences and the princess being the atomic bomb.The biggest problem I have with the game is the idiocy of the secret stars required for the secret ending which are never mentioned (even an achievement for it would be enough), and at times require you to wait 2 hours for a cloud to move around the map, not to mention the one which can only be collected if you don't assemble the second puzzle meaning a second playthrough would be required (I hate missable collectibles, and it's especially heinous in a game with level select).Extra Content The game doesn't overstay its welcome with about 4/5 hours of gameplay for your first playthrough.I haven't tried the speed run mode, but I'm not interested in it. But if you are into speed runs, that could be a big time sink.Nonetheless, if like me, you enjoyed the puzzles and want either more of those, or more story, after completing the game, there's about 5 or 6 mods/level packs you can download and try out. Those double the playtime you get from the game.Conclusion  Buy it.  If you don't think $15 for 7-8 hours (with mods) is enough bang for your buck, you can wait for a sale; but, for $10 I don't think you'll be disappointed even if that time/money is your driving parameter when buying games.You have probably heard of the quality of this title for years, I believe that it's deserving of that praise.The game exudes quality in every category, the experience is coherent and stellarly enjoyable.The way its mechanics are integrated into other aspects of the game is masterful.

												This game belongs with Portal and Antichamber on any list of the best puzzle games ever made. All the puzzles involve time manipulation in some way and they are all original ideas you won't have seen before. The last level is one of the most clever I've ever seen and the plot is deep and thought-provoking. It's very hard to find anything to complain about here.			"

												Braid is an interesting platformer which seems to be both homage to and parody of earlier platformers, and adds the extra dimension of being able to manipulate time in several different ways (not just rewind).  The art is pretty and its story is a fairly raw exposure of the thoughts and feelings of the developer as you (and every other person) grapple with both wanting to move forward and turn back the clock in your life and in your relationships. Instead of distracting, this enhances the gameplay and gives you a rare connection with the developer beyond the mechanics of playing the game.			"

												Braid is a time-twisting platformer. But, it's more of a puzzle solver. You play a lil dude who has the ability to stop, speed up, slow down and rewind time to bend the world to it's will.I've heard from a lot of people that they find Braid pretencious. For those people, I'd ask them to complete the game. It is quite complicated at times, but gives you some really quite remarkable closure at the end.One of the criticisms I have for the game is that the story doesn't ""fit"" together until you have fully completed the game. The fault here, though, is that people get so annoyed at the lack of a coherent storyline, confused as to what's going on, that they give up before it's over, and never appreciate the full story. Which is a real shame.If you like puzzle platformers, check this one out. Give it time and complete the game. If you buy it and give up before it's finished, you'll be disappointed. If, however, you finish the game, I think you'll be impressed. I was.-Nilesy			"

												I really tried to like this game and i can see why it's popular but unfortunately i just found i didn't enjoy it. It's a platformer that uses time-manipulation to solve puzzles to collect puzzle pieces. The way this game has built puzzles around time-manipulation is actually quite clever and that added to the ability to rewind time when you die keeps the game flowing nicely. However the difficulty curve is steep and this is where the game may divide people. While i've no problem with a challenge i found myself getting irritated with the puzzles which led to me losing interest in the game altogether.The visual style of the game is quite nice and so is the soundtrack. Even though this game has a story it never really sucked me in and felt a bit irrelevant.While i have chosen No for game recommendation i would recommend looking at gameplay videos to decide whether this game is for you or not. It's not neccesarily a bad game but it just wasn't for me. I'd give it 5.5/10 "

												My wife and son left town for a week to visit relatives.  I took off work to take care of and spend precious time with my 1 and 2 year old daughters.  When they were awake, we strolled around the block, went for car rides, played toys,  When they were alseep...one word...Braid.  Special week.  This game messes with your mind in such a good way.  It's a difficult physical puzzle game played as a platformer.  The story is deeper, albeit slightly hard to follow, than I expected.  I had never rewinded time in a video game before Braid.  The concept is borderline genius, and Jonathan Blow (creator) runs with it with surprising results.I'll recommend this game to gamers who don't get frustrated easily, who like the satisfaction after a difficult puzzle is solved, and who don't mind thinking before acting in a platformer.  If it gets too difficult, there's always the Internet:)			"

												One of the best and innovative Indie games in history, Braid is a puzzle platformer that which is a very unique game. Gameplay: Braid is a basic platformer but it gives you a very unique mechanic which is time travel. Anytime throughout the game you can rewind the game in case if you made a mistake or its required to solve the puzzle. Everything gets rewinded even certain enemies and collectibles. Collectibles are puzzle pieces which are spread throughout each world you will have to collect in order to unlock the next few worlds. Story: I honestly didn't care for the story since the main aspect of this game is the gameplay itself. But from what I can tell is the story is told through books before the start of certain worlds and leaves the story to the player to figure out since it doesn't explain it directly. Therefore the story goes for immersive storytelling which IMO is the best way of storytelling in video games!On your first playthrough you could beat the game in 3 to 5 hours but still leaves you to find all the collectibles you missed or you can do a dedicated speed run mode through certain levels or the entire game; try beating the game under 45 minutes, pretty tough...Conclusion: Braid is a beautifully designed Indie game with a very unique platforming mechanics that if you are a fan of the genre you shouldn't miss out on this.Rating 10/10			"

												A beautiful puzzle platformer, with stunning background art, complex (love?) story and probably the most complete time control system ever, since you can rewind/fast forward the game for as much as you like, up to the start of the level (compared to the limited time rewind of, say, the Prince of Persia games).The difficulty of its levels is perfect to keep your mind exercised: not too easy, not too hard (*I'm looking at you, Super Meat Boy!*) and the game length is normal too.The influences from the Super Mario games are also very obvious.Definitely recommended!

												Braid is the game that deserves to be experienced. I have a good friend who complains that he hates when indie games seem pretenious. This one definitely is, it constantly reminds you that it's that sad vegan girl who loves pretending to know who Arthur Russell and The Dancing Cigarettes are while she eats quiche and carries around a ukelele that she can't play. Yes, this game can really feel that way at times, but you know what? It deserves to present itself that way because it does deserve to be treated differently.The music and art style are all excellent as are the controls, mechanics and controlling time. Even the puzzles can be damn good. Not the puzzle picture you make for each world of course, but figuring out how to get those puzzle pieces in the first place (as well as a certain other collectible). But the biggest draw here is the story. There is what you can gather from the surface (some lovely prose and paintings) but there are more layers to the game. I will leave it up to you to figure everything out.Braid can be just a relaxing platforming breeze of a game, but you really should take a look at the puzzle elements of the game and I mean that on every level. If you want to get the most out of this game, analyze the story and solve the puzzles on your own.  **A fair warning, there is one puzzle that will probably be impossible unless you look it up. Most guides will mention it outright because it is an early missable. Don't  complete World 3's puzzle without looking up the star for it.			"

												Braid is a platformer puzzle game. You play as a man called Tim as he traverses across various worlds to find his 'Princess'. The game uses the concept of bending time to create platforming paths for the players to collect pieces puzzles throughout the different worlds. Each world has a certain theme or a mechanic around which the puzzle is designed. The puzzles are very well made and will surely itch parts of your brain which may have gone untouched for far too long. That is not all what Braid is all about. Underneath this gameplay, Braid tells a story. Players can solve the different worlds and their puzzles in order to piece them together to fit an overall picture of what happened between Tim and the Princess. I don't want to spoil the ending, however I just want to say it will surely turn some heads. Braid is a perfect example on how gameplay can act as a powerful storytelling device which other media simply cannot replicate.			"

												While I realize  am a minority here in not recognizing this game, I believe it is with good reason.  Here are my issue with this game that really ruins it for meIt's too cryptic: To get all the puzzle pieces and even the stars requires you to do very specific things that only somone with a walkthrough would know and I do not state that lightly. Some of these things are virtually impossible to find so you find yourself constantly watching youtube video to figure this stuff out. Otherwise, you are left running through the game which is not very much fun and makes the game way too short. Now I know many games can be cryptic but this one is over the top and the way they do it is not even fun. One level you are supposed to wait 2 hours just so a cloud will appear in a certain part of the map. Does that sound like a fun way to spend 2 hours playing a video game?			"

												Going to try not to reveal too much but this was an interesting game and it's about the Manhattan Project. Though not much of a history buff, I sorta didn't understand the deeper meaning of the story when it tied in with the historical event until I did some internet searches. I was however shocked at the game's final level which revealed alot in the relationship between the characters used to describe metaphors.On another note, I really enjoyed gameplay as it's mostly a puzzle game. It made playing it easy as you can reverse time if you get hit. Also, trying to find different methods to actually collect puzzle pieces (Yes, puzzle pieces, brings me back to Banjo Kazooie days) to complete a Jigsaw puzzle. Also, I can't forget to mention that this game has a beautiful soundtrack!Other than all that, the game kinda reminded me of (I'm sure this is all over the reviews page and a big joke somewhere on the internet) Super Mario. I saw guys that looked like Goombas and die the same way when you jump on their heads, Pirahna Plants coming from pipes. That's two similarities. Leaving out the rest of the baddies and items from the mario series and you got yourself Braid. Oh and King Koopa is not fightable but you see a cool scene on the last level that makes sense.Had fun playing this game and reviewing it!			"

												Be careful playing this game. It creates a localized time dialation that makes time flow faster outside your room. I started playing this game at 5 pm, but just a little while later I checked my watch and realized it was now 9 pm. I find it hard to believe that I lost track of time for four entire hours. I'm pretty sure the way this game screws with time is really to blame.I should probably play some more now. You know, for the sake of scientific curiosity.			"

												Some of the most interesting puzzle game mechanics i've come across. Making you really think about your actions and consequences an then making your head hurt thinking about how these things might work when time goes backward when moving left and forward when right or having a parrellel version of yourself to help. Its a great game to pickup and play and being able to do worlds in any order really helps not getting frustratingly stuck somewhere. Great game!			"

Just wow. this game is unlike any other game that I have played and I strongly recommend getting this game.Some of the puzzles had e scratching my head and sadly I did have to go online for a little bit of help.

												Braid is really tough. The writting and level design are really worth bearing through it though. Itts a puzzle playformer that involves worlds with different rules. Establishing what those rules are is a nightmare by itself. Trying to figure out the solutions and actually pulling those solutions of then become your next hurdles. This game isn't for everyone, but i think everyone should at least experience this level of creativity. At worst case watch a lets play or read a guide if you are stuck. Doing that will probably kill it though.Note - If you are visually impared you can still play this game. The story is told mostly through writting, but it isn't too tiny, and there aren't that many lines to read. At worst case you can screenshot the bits of story. Another difficulty you might come accross involves identifying things that glow in a particular color. This is related to the physics of each world you encounter, so you may need to pay extra attention, especially with yellow glows cos the enemies in the game are mainly that color.			"

												This may be the greatest puzzle platformer ever made. What's so great about it? Firstly, the timetravel-based mechanics make for unconventional and diffult puzzles. Learning to think about yourself in time loops is extremely challenging and rewarding. With each world (or level), the game introduces a new timetravel mechanic that adds another layer of complexity to the puzzles. The puzzles become so hard that at certain points I had headaches and had to stop playing. But that pain is worth the payoff of finally being able to figure out a puzzle after spending an hour steaming at the ears. You feel like a God, until you reach the next puzzle. But the best payoff of all is the twist at the end of the story. The story is primarily told through books read at the beginning of each world. The writing in this game is extremely contemplative and existential, dealing with topics like memories, identity, and the nature of relationships. The writing beautifully weaves into the timetravel mechanics for each world. The design of the mechanics, their ability to be relevant to the story, and their ability to make the game's puzzles more complex at the same time, is the product of genius. The story, like a poem, doesn't explain itself. It leaves itself open to interpretation. The replayability of this game is in the different meanings that can be thought of upon further playthroughs of the game.The music of the game fits the aestitic of the art style and reflects the mood of the story very well. The gravity of the twist near the end of the story is helped by the music. The music plays a role in telling the game's story.In conclusion, this game is the greatest puzzle platformer because it ties the story, gameplay mechanics, and music together SO WELL that I would go back in time to experience the game all over again for the first time (small Braid joke). If you like puzzle platformers and you don't buy this game, WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING?			"

												This game is beautiful and the puzzles are amazingly complex. They oftentimes require a very advanced move that may not even be viewed as possible at first. The art style keeps you going, and the level design makes it so that you can skip the hard puzzles and not get puzzle pieces but it will allow you to move on to the next area easily. This allows a hard puzzle not to ruin the game for you. However, if you're not ready for the challenge then the game may be a frustrating showcase of puzzles you are too unintelligent to solve.			"

												Braid was the first ""big indie"" game that I played. Braid was also the first game for me to really do a double-take on the Indie genre. Played as a 2D side scroller with a Mario-esque set-up (save the princess), it turns convention and expection on its head more than once - cleverness. Many of the puzzles are difficult, but in most cases so cleverly designed that when figured out, you realize how simple they are - cleverness. Braid is a tremendous argument for the awesomeness that the Indie genre can be. A must play for anyone interested in puzzle-platformers.			"

												This is wonderful platform game with a nice plot and a twist with second ending.Only drawback of Braid I can think of is that there is too much text to read in a strange form. I looks all nice that a character comes closer to a book and ""reads"" it. However, in a platform game when you are put in front of 5 books like that beetween levels/chapters is strange. I would like to have the books distributed along the platforms during an actual play. I could also add that collecting STARS in the game really spoiled the fun I had — too freakin difficult; but really, I cannot say it is something bad... just damn challenging! :DBeside that:- extremly playable platform game- the levels are designed nicely; you learn new abilities and possibilities with next levels as it should be- epic story in platform game!? as someone wrote ""mind blowing""- appearance is wonderful and seems fairy tale like- music is gentle and it is nice to have it in the background I remeber when watching Indie game the movie the creator (Jonathan Blow) said he was depressed after the release. Mostly because some early kids' reviews were about the genious physics usage in the game with moving time. I hope he now knows everybody appreciate it for so much more! Here on Steam I've read wonderful reviews! This is one of the games that I will remeber forever!			"

												This isn't a bad game, it suffers from being overly hyped. Braid is very nice to look at, but I wouldn't say that everything is very well executed. The fact that certain mechanics are never given a decent explanation (i.e. what the arbitrary limitations are) makes a lot of this game very frustrating personally. I do like puzzles and games based around them, but there are too many times to me where the solutions have seemed ""fiddly"", for lack of a better word. You may understand the solution perfectly well, but it may be unnecessarily difficult, often due to the awkward platforming elements. All in all I have some enjoyable moments in the game, but I am very glad I got it on sale because this is simply not worth $10. The visuals are extremely polished, the gameplay could have used more work in my opinion. The underlying story is also boring me to tears.			"

												Puzzle platformers tend to be platform games with a few easy puzzles. Braid is a puzzle games with some easy platform elements. The puzzle mechanic is one of the most innovative I have seen. It involves time manipulation and challenges you to think in new ways to predict the consequences of manipulating time in various ways and use this ability to achieve your goals. It starts out easy and the difficulty ramps up at a good pace. Towards the end the game is challenging even for experienced puzzle solvers. The game is also non-linear in that you don't need to solve everything in one part of the game to progress to later parts, if you get stuck on a puzzle you can go somewhere else and come back to tackle that puzzle later.The game has an artistic style that feels completely natural and fits well with the unique style of the gameplay. Graphics and sound contribute further to make the game atmospheric. The story is told in various ways, including texts you can read at the start of each level but also, in a way, through the pictures that you need to assemble to complete a level.All in all this is one of the best puzzle platformers I have played and highly recommended to anyone who likes puzzle games.

The most talked about part of this game is the ability to rewind thus erasing your mistakes.  One could think that if you could erase all your mistakes, the game would be boring.  However, without giving away any spoilers, Braid has a way of making this rewind feature very interesting.  Bonus: the music is peaceful and catchy, and the artwork is very impressive.

It's usually touted as one of the few games that manages to be ""art"" or at least it's managed to be considered art outside of the gaming community, which is apparently what people are really shooting for.But on its own merits, Braid is really a brilliant game.It's a puzzle-platformer where everything is built around time manipulation mechanics including going back in time, stopping time, speeding up time, etc.The story and gameplay though is a deconstruction (there's that art game thing coming in) of traditional video game tropes, specifically the old Mario games.The art and music are beautiful, and there's a lot of subtle hidden themes revealed through writing samples you gain throughout the game.There's far more secrets as well, some are insanely difficult to find. Just search special ending for braid in youtube and you'll be astounded.Overall it's definitely recomended. It's fun to play and explore, although some sections are very difficult.			"

												Wow. I beat the original Super Mario Bros. 1, 2 and 3. And as far as being a side scrolling platformer, I would put this game in the ranks with those. It's not a terribly long game, but the unraveling plot, gameplay, and art direction will blow you away. Hell, even the music is brilliant. It's just one of the finest platformers ever made. And the entire game puts itself together as the plot progresses. The reason you'll hear people talk about Braid is because of the gameplay where you can revers what you did if you made a mistake. And the ending. The gameplay is like most platformers but instead of skipping through the whole level, getting the items found in each level is a necessary in order to get to the last level. Not too difficult to do so.If I didn't have so many games to play, I'd play this over and over, day by day.10/10			"

												If you haven't beaten this yet then I pity you. The story is unique and, at first, seems simple, but gets more complex and intriguing as you go. The gameplay is intricate and unmatchable in both challenge and fun. If you enjoy puzzles and/or platformers, this will become one of your favorite games.And don't worry, there's a happy ending.			"

												Braid is a solid indie title with unique time based mechanics in a puzzle platformer along with great visual and sound design. Immediately upon starting the game, players are shown a rich looking world that resembles a painting. Throughout the game, this painted style along with intricately designed backgrounds looks gorgeous when playing the game along with providing some interesting designs for players to admire. The design manages to be distinct for each game element while looking beautiful for the parts that make up the land of the world. The music matches the refined style of the art with some instrumental pieces that accompany each level. The songs aren't loud in nature, but give a backdrop in each level for players to listen to while solving some of the puzzles. Each song sounds natural with the recorded instruments and still sound nice when applied with some audio effects caused by game events like rewinding time.The story seems at first to be about a man trying to rescue a princess, but the game goes beyond just that simple story. Throughout the game are books in each world that are read and provide deep meanings with symbolism. Thus, this story is taken more figuratively than literally, and can tend to be confusing much like the actual gameplay.The gameplay works as a puzzle platformer with unique time based mechanics. By default, the player can rewind time in each world, but each world has its own special mechanics that also deal with time. The player has to solve puzzles using this time mechanic, often with some precision platforming. Each of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, but the levels are designed such that the player can walk past a puzzle to solve it later. Some of the level designs are repeated in this game, but with new twists to be used with a new time based mechanic. The time based mechanics of Braid are amazing for solving the tricky puzzles while also being cool yet confusing when thinking about how some of the mechanics work. Although some of the puzzles can be a pain to figure out or time well with precise actions, Braid tends to be a short game at 5 hours, and maybe more if players are really stuck on some puzzles.Braid has its strong and unique puzzle gameplay while having good design and a story to think about. While the puzzles may be hard at times and the story a bit strange, this is a great indie title to check out and play for the different things it brings in the game.			"

												""They got this game right, for people who smoke, or people who drink; like if you drink beer and get drunk or you smoke weed and get high; an you just, anything like if you if you just be getting ♥♥♥♥ed up, they got this game right; I don't know; This♥♥♥♥♥♥called Braid."" -Soulja Boy Tell'Em, 2009P.S. ""If Y'all didn't catch that, I just went back in time...""Braid is a simple platforming game worth discovering. The game is set apart by a time-rewinding mechanic that is used ingeniously to an extent matched by few indie games that came after it. A common complaint against indie games is that they're half-baked unfinished games that gatekeepers would have shut down in the past. This is not true at all here, and Braid is on-par with many classic 16-bit platformers. In addition, there's a story, and it's also rather good. If you haven't played Braid, you should.Soulja Boy's real review from 2009 is pretty accurate too, ""if you just be getting ♥♥♥♥ed up"" it's purely enjoyable too. The story is completely ignorable if you just like the puzzles and mind-bending levels. Johnathon Blow understands what few other indie devs do, if your gameplay can't stand on its own feet, no one is going to slog through your game to read your artsy story.In a world where many of those in the so-called ""art games"" subgenre of gaming seem to be trust-funders and upper-middle class twits who think their stories are gravely important to all of humanity, Johnathon Blow has always taken a more restrained approach. There are two chief kinds of ""art games"" in indie gaming, those that are heavy-handed narratives driven by reading, and those that are minimalist and abstract. A key problem with the former is that the projects are often obviously not originally intended to be games. The fact that many of these projects end up being games at all relates to gaming being a more profitable and hip field with less barriers to entry than filmmaking or publishing. This is not true of Braid, and part of what makes it so artful in the first place. Braid is about regret, about mistakes of youth and arrogance, and this is mirrored in the gameplay which is entirely based around rewinding platforming mistakes.Braid has the watercolors and flowers that every indie art game has, but it also has the thing most of them lack, innovative gameplay that ties directly into the themes of the story and raises greater questions in the audience's mind. These are the places where Johnathon Blow and Edmund McMillun shine and lesser indie developers like Fullbright and Phil Fish flounder.You should play this.			"

												I like puzzle games and this one seemed to be interesting also for the time manipulating thing. But the game it's not about real puzzles and the mechanics in not explained step by step, so most of the time you have to guess. Most of the times i knew what to do but often it was frustrating to achieve. So, not fun and a waste of time. I gave up and uninstalled it at the end of the fourth world. Pity, cause i liked it for a while, also for graphics and atmosphere, until got me to frustration. I'm sure some will like the game and may be someday i'll give it another try.Mi piacciono i rompicapo e questo sembrava interessante grazie alla manipolazione del tempo. Peccato che il gioco non tratta veri rompicapo e la meccanica del gioco non viene spiegata nei vari livelli passo dopo passo, quindi spesso di deve indovinare. Da subito si capisce cosa si deve fare ma eseguire cosa si deve fare è spesso frustrante e noioso perchè spesso devi ripetere alcune azioni del gioco. Quindi non è molto divertente e lo trovo una perdita di tempo. L'ho disinstallato arrivato al quarto mondo. Peccato perhè la grafica e l'atmosfera del gioco mi piacevano fino a quando è arrivata la frustarzione. Sono sicuro che a qualcuno possa piacere e puo' darsi che in futuro gli daro' un'altra chance.			"

Product received for free
												Braid is a curious game for a lot of reasons, despite it's impressive art style and legacy it actually isn't as enjoyable as it appears. As the trailer suggests you are capable of turning back time, thus you never officially die. Despite this the leaning curve is quite steep and not always fair.If anyone has heard of the Infamous Goat puzzle in Broken Sword this may make a bit more sense. But basically in the point and click adventure game Broken Sword there is a puzzle that requires quick timing. But you the player have never used it before, so what makes it so difficult is your lack of understanding and knowledge of a gaming mechanic. You are unaware that you are even capable of doing what the game expects you to do.This is how Braid often feels. Although it is a very clever game many of puzzles require you to use your powers in unconventional ways to meet your goal. Although I never cared for tutorials or hand holding, the way it expects you to use your new abilities can often seem ridiculous and are incredibly specific.As an example there's a part in the game that requires you to let an enemy kill you, by doing this you see that when the enemy kills you it jumps back upward as it falls on top of you. Similarly to how Mario would when killing a goomba. But lets say you rewind too fast to realize this is something that can happen or you've never had an enemy kill you from above.Because there's not really an oppuninity in the game dedicated to this very specific mechanic you might not know you're able to do this. Since you don't know all the mechanics the game can feel as if it's cheating you. It's not that you didn't understand the puzzle but rather you didn't understand a mechanic that was never revealed properly in the first place.Braid does this multiple times, which is where I find the most difficulty in the game. As for the story? It's interesting but for lack of better words leaves you feeling empty of confused. Even when you do research into theories or see the ending of the game you just never feel as if you knew the whole experience. And that's not always bad but a lot of games can hold a sense of mystery while satisfying the player. This game just didn't satisfy me with it's conclusion. Furthermore to complete the game in it's entirety you are required to collect stars. Many of which you as the player would never have even known were in the game. The first star in world 2 takes about an hour and a half to collect by standing on top of a cloud.Let that sink in, how is the player expected to wait that long at the beginning of the game? Perhaps later in the game a challenge like that is realistic after the player is aware that there are actual collectables. But for the completing the game it felt unfair. There is a star map at the intro but I was unaware that I could actually collect items for it as well.Furthermore despite how interesting the story is the creator Johnathan Brow is rather pretentious in his attitude towards those theorizing or reviewing his game.If you'd like to play it I'd suggest to avoid reading his lengthy interviews as they just leave a sour taste in your mouth and ruin the experience of a decent game.It's normal for an artist to be protective of his work and to have a specific outlook or belief. Brow often justifies parts of critiques and mistakes as being intentional or experimental. Yet as an artist regardless of if an element is intentional or not that does not make the game improve in quality if it wont translate to the player. A game element needs to make sense not just in the eyes of the creator but the audience. Furthermore the soundtrack is pretty but incredibly repetitive and many levels don't suit the soundtrack. Plus, a world in the game requires you to listen to the majority of it in slow motion or backwards and trust me when I say it gets irritating quickly.The enemies feel uncreative, but I'm sure they serve some purpose in terms of appearance besides being a reference to Mario. Although the sound effects for the rabbits and goomba looking enemies are annoying.So please before purchasing this game for 15 dollars just know that although it isn't a bad game it is overhyped. It might be a enjoyable use of your time but I don't believe it's worth the 15 dollar price tag.			"

												Everyone knows Braid by now, and it still remains one of the most passionately directed artistic visions in gaming around. Wonderful visuals, layers of symbolism, and artsy stuff like that aside, it's also a super challenging game that uses time manipulation in very new and interesting ways beyond the usual. I honestly wasn't sure if I would ever finish it, getting so very stuck at some points as I did, but I'm glad I eventually figured things out. It's as smartly designed as it is beautiful to look at, and should probably go win a bunch more rewards retroactively or something.			"

												Braid has a very simple set of controls and essentially a single gameplay mechanic, but it tweaks that mechanic in different ways through each of the chapters to make each one a fresh challenge. Some of the puzzles require a lot of thought followed by some experimentation to figure out. This makes them much more satisfying to solve than in some platformers where the answer is obvious from the start and the challenge is just in timing. It is graphically and musically enjoyable and is one indie game that I think lives up to the hype. It performed very well on the Mac and took about six hours for me to complete.			"

												The concept of this game is spectacular.  It is extremely simple and yet profoundly complex in its ability to boggle the mind- not just with clever puzzles but with its enigmatic story.  It begins as a simple platform and can just as easily be treated as one.  However, the reward comes only with extreme dedication.The design of the game is simply fantastic.  You travel through mesmirizing daydreams while a deep and meaningful sountrack keeps you company.  What may seem to be a tale of a lost love and lowly regret is much much more.... but only if you put your heart into it.While there has been a vast amount of analysis on this game, this one is perhaps my most favorite.

												This game is thought provoking. Its puzzles are mentally delicious. Its story is kinda loose, but also super intriguing. Its ending left me mindblown at 1am and needing to tell everyone I knew to play this super awesome game. Its graphics are art. Its soundtrack is beautiful and peaceful, which is necessary to counteract the frustrations of puzzles. If the soundtrack was not so calming, things might have been at risk of being broken in frustration.There is a satisfaction that comes with making it through the entire first run-through without looking any puzzles up and being able to say, “I figured it all out. All of it.” Another cool thing is that everything in the game is put there for a purpose. It’s kinda like how in a good piece of literature, every word should fight to be on the page, or else the author is wasting the reader’s time. In this game, nothing is wasted or thoughtlessly placed.Overall, 9.15/10, would recommend to anyone who wants something different and challenging that works the brain muscle more than average. I subtract most of a point because I am still left with too many questions, almost like the game is too metaphoric to get its message across. Also I’m point stingy. It still is satisfying enough and thought provoking not to lose a whole point. Perhaps I just need more time to reflect and replay. I am highly satisfied overall. "

												Braid is one of the first indie games I’ve ever played. It is a very neat game with some really great and innovative mechanics. The visuals and art concepts are also very interesting, as well as the music, cleverly integrated almost as another element of the gameplay. And, indeed, that’s where the strongest point of this game lies: its gameplay. It feels fresh, it’s fun and even though it can be challenging at times, there were no impossible stages. To me Braid felt more like an experience than just a simple game. It was short, but also intense. There were only two times when I just gave up and looked online how to beat that particular stage, but I kind of regret it now. This game is a challenge. Just let yourself be immersed into its mechanics and enjoy the ride. (Using your brain helps too :D)The only negative side of the game is how little the story managed to interest me.

												Braid is one of the first indie games I’ve ever played. It is a very neat game with some really great and innovative mechanics. The visuals and art concepts are also very interesting, as well as the music, cleverly integrated almost as another element of the gameplay. And, indeed, that’s where the strongest point of this game lies: its gameplay. It feels fresh, it’s fun and even though it can be challenging at times, there were no impossible stages. To me Braid felt more like an experience than just a simple game. It was short, but also intense. There were only two times when I just gave up and looked online how to beat that particular stage, but I kind of regret it now. This game is a challenge. Just let yourself be immersed into its mechanics and enjoy the ride. (Using your brain helps too :D)The only negative side of the game is how little the story managed to interest me. I read all the signs containing the story until the very last ones, when I realized I simply didn’t care and just wanted to play. But that’s not a major issue at all. The game is a gem and everyone into the genre  should try it. It takes less than 5 hours to beat, so you probably don’t even have any excuses not to give it a try.

												Everyone knows Braid by now, and it still remains one of the most passionately directed artistic visions in gaming around. Wonderful visuals, layers of symbolism, and artsy stuff like that aside, it's also a super challenging game that uses time manipulation in very new and interesting ways beyond the usual. I honestly wasn't sure if I would ever finish it, getting so very stuck at some points as I did, but I'm glad I eventually figured things out. It's as smartly designed as it is beautiful to look at, and should probably go win a bunch more rewards retroactively or something.			"

												Braid has a very simple set of controls and essentially a single gameplay mechanic, but it tweaks that mechanic in different ways through each of the chapters to make each one a fresh challenge. Some of the puzzles require a lot of thought followed by some experimentation to figure out. This makes them much more satisfying to solve than in some platformers where the answer is obvious from the start and the challenge is just in timing. It is graphically and musically enjoyable and is one indie game that I think lives up to the hype. It performed very well on the Mac and took about six hours for me to complete.			"

												Braid is a nice painted puzzle platformer - maybe one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. You can run through this game within an hour, but then you will miss the best. You have to engage in Braid and you have to engage in each world again and again. It's not only to have a character where you manipulate the time - each world has its own gimmick like controlling your own shadow within the time manipulation.Music, artwork and story are beautiful and unique. The story is poetic and gets deeper when you explore the game as deep as you can - you have to use the game mechanics in every way you can think of and you have to think a lot to solve the puzzles as well as the story.The 'world achievements' are easy to get. The 'story achievements' are much harder, but not impossible. The hardest achievement is to complete a full speed run, beating the challenge time.!!Recommended!!, even if it's not on sale.P.S.: It sometimes feels like an homage to Super Mario, where you also have to rescue the princess and you will meet the carnivorous plant.

												Braid is a nice, short, enjoyable game to put it simply. It's a 2D platforming puzzler set in a gorgeous painterly world with one of the best soundtracks in modern gaming. The gameplay involves manipulating time to solve clever puzzles that earn you jigsaw pieces to a painting that hints at further back-story and helps open the path to the final chapter… which is actually the first chapter in the story. It's refreshingly forgiving in that you can never die and need only rewind time to do something just right; this focuses your attention on trying to complete a challenge rather than needing to re-play entire areas or continuously try to make the same jump over and over again. I deeply appreciate that.The ending sequence to a story that is told through hind-sight and recall is a level of brilliance that made all the time spent playing it worth every second.			"

A platformer which's focuses entirely on manipulation of time for solving puzzles. The story although weird and heavy, is pretty interesting to see, the art is gorgeus and the music doesn't dissapoint. With all that said, this game is more about using your head than platforming skills, so if you aren't into puzzles or like to think about stories, then it will not really get your attention.I thought it was good enough, but not for repeated playthroughs.

												Braid is a time-altering side-scrolling platformer.In a story that seems to mirror that of the Mario series (find a princess), but there's more at work than just that, if you carefully read and think through the story blobs told when you walk over books. Personally, this wasn't really to my tastes.The gameplay in this game is, in my opinion, a much more important aspect than the story, Given that it's a side-scrolling platformer. The aim is not to finish the level quickly, but to get all of the puzzle pieces. The puzzles to do so revolve around the use of time-altering powers. Slowing Time, reversing it etc. And provide some nice tricky challenges and a good feeling of success when you complete them. But you will inevitably do so, as the game doesn't take an extremely long time to complete.This game can be controlled via. Either the keyboard or a controller. I tried using both and they both work well.The graphic stylings of this game are very nice. The art gives a sort of ""painted"" look to the game, and changes as you utilize time travel powers. Despite it being a ""painted"" look, do not think that it will be static sprites. The game looks and feels very fluid.The graphic setting themselves are set on-launch, and cannot be changed in-game. A tad annoying, but once you figure out the best settings for you, you won't need to worry about it.The music is very intriguing. As you utilise time travel powers, the music changes accordingly. Be it moving in reverse, or even in-step with your movement.As I previously mentioned, this game doesn't take  a very long time to just run through each level. Finding every puzzle piece and assembling them takes a bit longer. If you do want to speed-run it, once you complete the game you can select this option from the main menu, which adds an extra level of difficulty.This is a well polished game, and given all the bugs that could occur with the ""time-travel"" mechanic, it had no bugs that I could see.Overall this is a great game to play if you're a fan of side-scrollers, or puzzle games that involve a time travel aspect, which I feel is somewhat hard to come by in a well-made manner.

												Wonderful puzzle platformer. The relation between story and gameplay mechanics in the different chapters is astonishing, and the last level is hands down the most surprising and mindblowing experience I ever had in a video game. Honestly. It may not be all that cinematic or convoluted like in other games that are liked because of this, but for me there was a certain ""immediacy"" in the whole scene that only this game made achieved for me.

												Braid. When you first look at this platform game, you think it's another Super Mario spin off that looks like it was hand painted. That is until you actually play Braid. I was taken away right off the start by the music, which sounded like from India. It really made me feel like I was in another world. Then the game play.  I struggled on certian levels and became frustrated to the point I peeked on Youtube for help. When I saw the solution, I said, ""What the heck? This game is twisted."" Best description of this game is an ""Enjoyable Fever Dream."" This game is beyond Alice in Wonderland. Read the critics reviews and the list is long. The game is that good! If you have read this far and dont have Braid. You will get this game. Not just from my recommendation. But for the fact this classic game should not be passed. A gem of a game :)   "

												There is more to this little platformer than just run jump and get to the end. Wonderful puzzles (some of which makes you think inside the box?), beautiful graphics, but ultimately its the writing that really did it for me - meanings within meanings - its fascinating to see how the writing correlates to what you get to do in the game. Watch for the final level which gives a new meaning to the whole ""rescue the princess"" idea. Its not much of a reflex game, though you do have to get the timing just right on a lot of puzzles, but the fun is in figuring out how to do it.			"

												Braid is unlike any other with a completely ingenius and unique concept and matching mechanics, even nearly 5 years later. The art and the soundtrack is beautiful and almost bittersweet. It is disappointing only in that the designer tried too hard to be ""abstract~"" and left us with an incomprehensible and obtuse story idea that leaves us unfulfilled and wanting and unrewarded for the journey the player has made. However, it is worth the experience for all other aspects and it has certainly left its mark.			"

												Braid is a time-altering side-scrolling platformer.In a story that seems to mirror that of the Mario series (find a princess), but there's more at work than just that, if you carefully read and think through the story blobs told when you walk over books. Personally, this wasn't really to my tastes.The gameplay in this game is, in my opinion, a much more important aspect than the story, Given that it's a side-scrolling platformer. The aim is not to finish the level quickly, but to get all of the puzzle pieces. The puzzles to do so revolve around the use of time-altering powers. Slowing Time, reversing it etc. And provide some nice tricky challenges and a good feeling of success when you complete them. But you will inevitably do so, as the game doesn't take an extremely long time to complete.This game can be controlled via. Either the keyboard or a controller. I tried using both and they both work well.The graphic stylings of this game are very nice. The art gives a sort of ""painted"" look to the game, and changes as you utilize time travel powers. Despite it being a ""painted"" look, do not think that it will be static sprites. The game looks and feels very fluid.The graphic setting themselves are set on-launch, and cannot be changed in-game. A tad annoying, but once you figure out the best settings for you, you won't need to worry about it.The music is very intriguing. As you utilise time travel powers, the music changes accordingly. Be it moving in reverse, or even in-step with your movement.As I previously mentioned, this game doesn't take  a very long time to just run through each level. Finding every puzzle piece and assembling them takes a bit longer. If you do want to speed-run it, once you complete the game you can select this option from the main menu, which adds an extra level of difficulty.This is a well polished game, and given all the bugs that could occur with the ""time-travel"" mechanic, it had no bugs that I could see.Overall this is a great game to play if you're a fan of side-scrollers, or puzzle games that involve a time travel aspect, which I feel is somewhat hard to come by in a well-made manner.

												To be honest, Braid is not for everyone.  It is a side scrolling 2-d action platformer, but you have no guns, and you do not punch♥♥♥♥♥♥to death.  It is however, a highly enjoyable action platformer where hilariously enough, fast forward and rewind are your greatest weapons.  The puzzles are superb, the difficulty is more than satisfactory, and the story telling isn't too bad either.  The graphics are sprite based, so visuals are simplistic in terms of complexity.  However, the artistic style is very nice.  While it's not a technically impressive game visual wise, the art style is what makes it beautiful to look at. If you see it for cheap, I highly reccommend picking it up.  You won't know if you'll like it or not until you actually play it.			"

												Braid is one of those games you have to play once. You may never play it again unless you decide to speedrun it, and that's fine, but you do have to play it once.What sells this game is the gameplay: simple platforming with a time-reversal mechanic that turns the genre on its head. It's more of a puzzle-platformer than anything else, though some of the sections that require you to move quickly are more action-based and they both mesh together quite well. Every world has a different gimmick to it - and I don't use that word negatively. Each new level offers a unique experience and the game teaches you how to use your new powers quickly and without shoving it down your throat. When you know how the rooms are solved, the game goes by very fast, but for a first time player it lasts a good amount of time. The build-up to the final level and the climax of the game are well worth the effort.Story-wise, it's not the best. Most of the plot is conveyed by text boxes that you read before the levels and while they are nice and poetic at times it's not straightforward in the least sense. The rest of the story is told through the levels themselves, and the final level is a shining example of gameplay driving story.Visually, Braid is nice. It's not blow-your-mind amazing but the art design is very smooth and colourful and it fits. The soundtrack to this game is great and the sounds of the world mesh well with it.Overall, Braid is a great game. If you haven't played it yet, do so.			"

												Braid is one of the first indie games I’ve ever played. It is a very neat game with some really great and innovative mechanics. The visuals and art concepts are also very interesting, as well as the music, cleverly integrated almost as another element of the gameplay. And, indeed, that’s where the strongest point of this game lies: its gameplay. It feels fresh, it’s fun and even though it can be challenging at times, there were no impossible stages. To me Braid felt more like an experience than just a simple game. It was short, but also intense. There were only two times when I just gave up and looked online how to beat that particular stage, but I kind of regret it now. This game is a challenge. Just let yourself be immersed into its mechanics and enjoy the ride. (Using your brain helps too :D)The only negative side of the game is how little the story managed to interest me. I read all the signs containing the story until the very last ones, when I realized I simply didn’t care and just wanted to play. But that’s not a major issue at all. The game is a gem and everyone into the genre  should try it. It takes less than 5 hours to beat, so you probably don’t even have any excuses not to give it a try. Oh, and I don’t recommend playing for too long…  After beating it and writing my homework, I was seriously thinking of turning time backwards instead of simply pressing delete. Damn, if only we had a left shift key in real life! :’) "

												One of the most fun game i played in years. Hand drawn graphics are beautiful, the music is amazing and the mecanics...this is not about reflex like every other platformer but more about thinking it through. You basically can't die, just rewind or fast-forward time like a boss. Each world incorporates new mechanics like a clone of yourself and stuff. Some of the puzzles are insanely difficult but so rewarding when accomplished. There are stars to collect but i did't get what was that all about because it doesnt unlock anything except a  constellation at the start of the game. Finishing the game unlocks the speedrun mode, which is pretty hard. And if you want your last achievement you have to complete the game in under 45 minutes...			"

												So what do you get when you combine something only understood by those who analyze Shakespear for hours and time travel? Something like Braid.Braid's best feature is the awesome power of going back in time if you mess something up. What isn't mentioned is what this entitles as well. Going back in time at twice the speed allows you to beat objects unneffected by time travel to their destination, small gold rings create black holes in which time travels at a near stop, and creating copies of yourself by doing something you would do normally and then traveling back in time to do something else. Each world has its own unique time power (even the last) that the game gives only subtle hints about and I went bonkers (in a good way) having to figure that out for myself. That said, the game's short and will probably be finished within three hours if you're looking for all the puzzle pieces. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. A beautiful game to witness and hear, yet still fun to play.			"

												Braid took 6hrs to complete everything, so while this is a short game, it is quite satisfying. The time manipulation puzzles are very rewarding throughout, and are complimented by a nicely written soundtrack and story.			"

												The mechanics are great, going back in time its not just a pretty way of not dying, but a way to solve puzzles in different worlds with different mechanics. There is also a philosophic side: the game is about (among maaany other things) seeing things in perspective, getting to know what you did wrong and changing it... Totally worth it !!			"

												Braid is a great example of the full package. It has a beautiful art style and a breathtaking soundtrack. It has a compelling and thought-provoking story. It has amazing gameplay that demands an in-depth understanding of the game's mechanics and requires you to think critically. AND it's cheap.There is no good reason not to get Braid.			"

												It's rather daunting to speak about a legend like Braid. Many credit it as the reason the indie game Renaissance kicked off in the first place, and whether you believe that's a fair read or overreaching a bit, there's no question that Braid played a formidable role in the advancement of the indie game market, and the role of indie game as ""art film,"" not ""demo album."" Braid succeeded financially and critically. Braid opened people's eyes to the idea of the indie game as a form of expression, and the validity, and necessity, of games that don't follow a formula or sort neatly into a category. To call Braid merely a ""platformer"" is to miss the point entirely.Most of what I'd like to say about Braid falls under the realm of spoilers -- it's a very hard game to talk about, without not only entering spoiler territory, but asserting one's own theories about what happens in it, what the player is seeing, what the events depicted in the game really mean. Braid is a game to be interpreted, to be meditated upon...not a game to be engaged with blind forward momentum. Speedrunning through Braid would be a terrible waste of the experience, at least until the game's events are well known to the player. Let me try to delicately walk the line of preserving Braid's many secrets, while sharing enough of the game to help demonstrate why it shines.From a mechanical perspective, Braid is a sidescrolling platformer. Your protagonist Tim runs, climbs, jumps and falls in a manner immediately familiar to the player. Upon his first death, however, we learn that we have the power to reverse time, and by holding down a key, rewind the game back to the point of decision and try again. We can do this as often as we like, reverse every mistake made, every mistimed jump, every unsuccessful stab at a puzzle, if we wish. Indeed, the game makes clear that this is not only our power as player, but Tim's own power, and that he's done this, over and over, in his own life. The puzzles encountered begin to incorporate Tim's power, requiring one to play with the flow of time to solve them, at this point.The puzzles are clever and fun, and finally figuring them out is quite rewarding, but they are, like the puzzles of Thomas Was Alone, merely a macguffin to draw the player into Tim's world, into his head, and into his way of thinking. The game is a philosophical reflection upon what it means to be Tim, to have this power, and to look at the world the way he does. Braid engaged by its mechanics is a clever and interesting experience, but Braid engaged in the context of its meaning, of what it might be saying ""between the lines"" -- that's what makes it a must-have game. Enter Braid with the idea that the game is just an excuse to have a very interesting conversation with its creator about human agency, mistakes, regret, and the nature of interpersonal relationships. Be ready for the game to throw you some ferocious curveballs, and for you not to be satisfied with its story as a story in itself -- rather, for the story to be a vehicle that brings you to a new vantage point, from which to examine your own ideas of human agency, cause, effect, and meaning.Braid left me with a head full of thoughts about the way memory fails us, and the places in which wishful thinking seeps into the jars of our memories we thought were watertight, and spoils the things we imagined were well-preserved forever. It asks us, at the beginning, to imagine a world in which forgiveness is absolute, where mistakes can be erased, leaving no mark upon the future. Trial with ever-mitigatable, never lasting error sounds lovely...but the game will, eventually, force you to confront the consequences of such a world, and to the temptation to mistake uncomfortable truths and reality for ""mistakes."" Surprising narrative power, for a cartoonish platformer with liberal nods back to the Super Mario Brothers franchise. If you're looking for a clever platform-puzzle game, Braid will fit the bill...but you'll be missing so much of what makes it special to engage it simply as a platform-puzzle game. Braid is a story, an inner journey, into the meaning of human agency, of love, loss, mistakes, lessons learned, and the nature of why time and causality work the way they do, told through a deceptively simple run-and-jump game with unlimited continues. If you're the sort who wants the game to applaud and cheer you for winning, you're exactly the sort of person Braid wants to meet...but you're going to be disappointed, in the end. That's okay. Weather the disappointment. Braid is talking to you; let it speak. Embrace your own discomfort with the things Braid has to say. Listen, and stop rewinding time to see if it'll say what you want to hear. Its message is not a ""mistake"" to be ""fixed.""			"

												Braid. When you first look at this platform game, you think it's another Super Mario spin off that looks like it was hand painted. That is until you actually play Braid. I was taken away right off the start by the music, which sounded like from India. It really made me feel like I was in another world. Then the game play.  I struggled on certian levels and became frustrated to the point I peeked on Youtube for help. When I saw the solution, I said, ""What the heck? This game is twisted."" Best description of this game is an ""Enjoyable Fever Dream."" This game is beyond Alice in Wonderland. Read the critics reviews and the list is long. The game is that good! If you have read this far and dont have Braid. You will get this game. Not just from my recommendation. But for the fact this classic game should not be passed. A gem of a game :)   "

												This is one of those artsy indie games. Also one of the first larger successes in the ""public"" indie scene.The game itself it a platform puzzle game with elements or references from games like Mario and homages to several other ""old school"" NES games.There also is a very interesting mechanic that is important to the core of the gameplay; Rewinding time.This little feature will prove more important than a simple ""save point""-feature in games such as Prince of Persia: SoT. In Braid certain elements are unchained from the time/space continuum - In other words, you can rewind time and unchained elements will stay put, or if you are holding them; Follow you back to where you were.This entire process is used cleverly in the puzzles you are faced with.Apart from the puzzles there is a very neat story tucked into the game(as with most artsy indie titles).Without getting into too much detail on that part; It reminds me of a very well known ""Save the captured Princess"" scenario... With a twist.I'm not going to spoil it and I'll leave it up to you to figure out the rest.It's a short but great game - clocking at around 5-6 hours to beat it.For what it is, it's well worth the time spent.

												Great for people who love puzzles, as each world introduces a different time-altering mechanic of some sort, and the difficulty wasn't too steep. What's funny is, even the story itself is a puzzle; it's thought-provoking. By finishing Braid, you really search within Tim's character, revealing that there is more beyond the damsel-in-distress surface of the game.If you don't care for puzzles and you like platformers, I would still check this game out. The art and music is beautiful, and it's a staple of the indie genre.			"

												Over rated and convoluted.Much of this game's praise seems to stem from is setting and story rather than mechanics, but I found it to be the other way around.Keeping it short...The time-reversal based puzzles were impeccably creative. They were fun, mostly fair challenges to navigate.The story's attempt to be deep ends up being head-scratchingly vague with many nonsequential nuggets of it delivered throughout. Having time manipulation as your game's theme isn't much of an excuse for just mashing a myriad of vagueries together and expecting people to find it deep and brooding (which apparently lots did.)Even after looking up a detailed story/ending synopsis, the ultimate ""true ending"" is hardly tantamount to the work it requires to puzzle it out.I bought this game expecting a short and sweet but heavily impactful emotional trip like the amazing ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"", but was left with just a quaint, fun little indie platformer. Would reccomend if on sale for a buck or three. Excellent soundtrack.			"

The developers really put some thought, love and care into it and the result is a game that makes you think, A LOT! Big ups to the crew at Number None, fantastic puzzle platformer.Oh and the visuals are stunning and the story line is weird but at times can be really thought provoking.Definitely a recommended buy. However picking it up on sale will definitely elllevate the game!			"

												What can I say. This gorgeous game makes use of innovative time-space manipulation mechanics in order to provide fun and challenging puzzles that will test your wits. This game was a great success when it came out and the developer, John Blow, is an amazing designer. If you still haven't played this game, you should definitely consider it! One of the best Indie Games of all time.			"

												Braid is a puzzle-platformer that is actually very challenging which is rather refreshing when not frustrating. I had to consult a guide quite a few times with this game which is ok - too difficult is usually better than too easy. The game has great animations, great music/sounds and an interesting story which makes it one of the better and most iconic indie games.			"

												Great platforming puzzler.Braid is one of a few games that rose during the 'indie craze' next to games like Super meat boy, Bastion and Binding of Issac.Story is deep. I was surprised that a puzzle game could have such a good story. You play as Tim, an individual who is looking for a princess who has unfortunately been captured by a monster. It's not a plot which openly tells you what is going on per se, rather there is quite a bit of ambiguity (especially the ending which is good), which leaves the player to reflect on what is actually going on. Many themes play out in the story including desire, regret and making up for mistakes. Gameplay is great, burrowing elements from Mario. Each stage pits you on one end of the map, trying to reach the end on the other side. Stages are unique, with different puzzles and goals to reach in order to pass, such simply reaching the end, eliminate all foes, using keys to open doors etc. Similar to stars in Mario, each level has a selected amount of puzzle pieces to collect. Each, piece collected helps to complete a picture which provides some incites to the story. There are platforms you can reach by jumping on them. You can also defeat foes by jumping on them and avoid traps by jumping over them. The only enemies are giant head things which walk around and may jump to different platforms (which reminds me of Gumpas). There are also traps such as pitfalls, spikes and canons.  You only have 1 life, so a single collision between a 'Gumpa' or trap will kill you instantly.  Fortunately, death doesn't end the game, instead this is the part where you make the most of your 'Time control' power. Reminiscent of 'POP Sands of time', you have the ability to reverse the flow of time, sending Tim back before his current predicament. Besides using it to save your life you can also use it to solve puzzles, by stopping time to allow  you to think of a plan or moving back objects to obtain items. Some puzzles may leave some guessing and frustrated, however with some patience they can be solved easily (or just use a guide).Soundtrack is amazing. The music is very calm, with sorta 'Irish tune to it', and something you can listen to calm yourself (which especially helps with some of the puzzles). Sound effects are also good. there is no voice acting in the game, with the story told through text.Graphics are excellent. The 2D-art style is vibrant and detailed. It is quite attractive and fits perfectly for the game.Besides the main campaign, there is also 'speed-run' mode which is unlocked  after beating the game. The mode tests how fast you can get through certain stages in the game.If your looking for a good story and don't mind some platforming and puzzles, Braid will show you how brilliance can be formed in a simple indie game.

Braid really encourages you to think very critically and differently than most games. In Braid, you play as a guy who can rewind time! This time travel mechanic introduces you to countless possibilities to problem solve. I highly recommend this game to people who like puzzle games and really want a challenge. I give Braid a 9.2/10.

												Both heartfelt and cerebral, a solid platformer as well as a very sharp and entirely self-aware deconstruction of platforming as a genre. People throw deconstruction around as a cheap buzz word, but here it actually applies. ""Braid"" quite literally and systematically disassembles the most common and basic mechanics of the past 30 years of platformers and both isolates and reassembles them in new ways on a level by level basis--all leading up to its brilliant twist ending which turns the conventional narrative of the genre completely on its head. Plus, it's one of very few games which use ""game mechanics"" and ""gameplay"" as languages and means of expression in their own right. You can learn as much of the philosophical nature of time and paradox just from playing Braid as you could from an entire undergrad course on the topics, not to mention about more ephemeral topics such as the nature of love, obsession, and regret.Pretentious? Maybe. But luckily it's also fun to play as well.			"

												I remember playing this game way back when it was new at a friend's house. I'll never forget the frustration we felt as an entire room full of teenagers struggled to get some of the game's trickier puzzle pieces, or the cheers that went up when a puzzle was finally untangled, or the audible gasps elicited by the game's final level. Part of me was worried that buying the game now, seven years later, and playing it would dull some of those memories. I was worried it wouldn't be as good as I remembered. But to my relief, it's just as difficult and rewarding and strange as I remembered. This game always triggers some weird and almost indescribable emotions from me, and I'm never sure if that's due to the unique score, the hauntingly vague story, my own nostalgia, or a mixture of all three.(dednetni snup llA).emit ruoy sevresed yletinifed diarB neht "",elzzup"" eht no reivaeh esoht yllaicepse ,sremroftalp elzzup fo naf a er'uoy fI			"

												At this point it really isn’t news that if you like indie puzzle games you should play Braid. This game is part of the canon—and for very good reason. Braid is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship.The core engine of Braid is a simple, 2D platformer reminiscent of Mario. (The resemblance to classic Mario is more than passing, and the creators of Braid overtly nod to it at several points.) But to the simple mechanics of jumping and dodging Braid has added a novel element: the ability to reverse time. At the touch of a button you can rewind your performance of a stage to whatever point you like and then begin again from that point.That alone would be novel, but not worth much—just an alternative to replaying levels—but Braid makes this mechanic the central tool in the solution of an array of tricky puzzles. At first your control of time is just a way of undoing mistakes, but it quickly takes on other dimensions as you, for example, discover items which are immune to your powers and so keep moving normally while all else rewinds. Solutions to the problems Braid poses are not usually a matter of muddling through, trying things until something works, but instead involve having some insight about the central mechanic and how it affects your surroundings. Like a good riddle there is a moment of dawning insight and suddenly you see things in a new way.And the surroundings are themselves wonderful. While the mechanics of the game would be worthy regardless (an early version of Braid won a game design award while the graphics were still just place holders) the graphics makes the game into a piece of visual art. Everything in Braid looks hand-made in the best possible sense. The levels have an almost water colored look. And while there are actually fairly few sprites in the game, corresponding to the small number of pieces out of which levels are constructed, the background elements are various and gorgeous. Each group of puzzles has a distinct aesthetic subtly adapted to the content of the gameplay. Beautiful, low key instrumental music compliments all this perfectly. This game is simply pretty, and in a way that makes playing it feel meditative.The story, provided mostly by textual interludes, is rather impressionistic. I found it difficult to make sense of, and in the end not entirely satisfying. But nonetheless thematic elements intertwine with the gameplay. The most obvious example is that you play as a man troubled by regrets, and this theme of regret resonates in the mechanic of undoing actions you have already performed.Braid is a piece of art, pure and simple, but as already mentioned it is also a tightly designed puzzle game. This means some stages are rather challenging, as they should be. However, a nice feature is that the puzzles are not locked into strict sequence. If the needed insight simply will not come in one place then it is open to the player to skip ahead and return for the missing bits much later, lessening the potential frustration that’s part of puzzle games.Braid has taken simple parts, things that have been around since 8-bit consoles, and polished them until they shone. Play it. You’ll be glad you did.			"

												A wonderful, clever game.  It will bend your mind in some new ways.  I am used to most puzzle games requiring you to be observant, and fluent with their tools to figure out 90% of the puzzles.  This is not one of them.  The game centers around a man struggling with regret over some past mistake chasing after a mysterious princess.  However, the man is no ordinary man, he can control time (forwards and backwards).  So unlike many platformer games, death isn't usually the obstacle.  Yes, there are some parts that require good jumping skills, but with the ability to rewind time there is little frustration.  All of the difficulty is in figuring out how to collect all of the puzzle pieces of the paintings.  This is the main objective beside finding the princess.  Many puzzle pieces simply require careful planning and proper use of time control, but some will certainly make you say ""I never thought of that!"" (far more than 10%).  The levels have a painted appearance and are quite gorgeous to look at.  They change up the in-level elements to keep you on your toes, but I did find that there is little environmental shift (at least between the first and second world).  That was the only disappointing element I found (maybe there will be more shift between later worlds?).  Overall, it is a wonderful game and a worthy purchase for anyone who likes puzzle/platforming games.			"

												Well, it's a work of art, and it singlehandedly reinvented the platforming genre. So, there's that. For those of you who read David Hellman's webcomic (A Lesson Is Learned But The Damage Is Irreversible), it will quite likely be an extraordinarily memorable experience.I actually gave up on one frustrating puzzle only to come back over a year later and see the solution immediately. So yes, the puzzles can be quite challenging, but as there's really only one mechanic to play with, you'll get there eventually with enough patience. The payoff for finishing the game is superb (and even better if you don't cheat). Every gamer should play this. Every person should play this. They should teach this game in high school.			"

												Definetly the HARDEST game i've ever play !!""Come On. This will not be as hard as you said.""Maybe yes. Braid introduces itself with simple puzzles that even 5 yo girl can finish those. But, in a mid-game you will experience new conditions that surely cause you to fail at first and want to give up already. These damn 'barriers' sometimes so annoying and you will struggle with them until the end of game.There are many walkthrough videos which uploaded by those smart guys on community hub and you can just follow those instruction to get all the puzzle pieces quite easily. But, will you still getting scared by a horror movie when you're already know when those ghosts will appear? Same goes with BRAID, the real experience come if you try to solve the puzzles by yourself.Other than that, Braid gives some heavenly soothing atmosphere through good music and nice graphic. These things are what i think the best part of this game. There also will be many references of many old popular games you have played before.In my conclusion, this game is not for everyone (as others told it too) but for you who likes puzzles and willing to strrugle with them will find yourself immersed in the game and somehow addicted to it. Giving it 8/10 (because it's hard). "

												Is there anything left to say about Braid that has not already been said a thousand times through the years? It was one of those games that defined the emerging indie scene that proved you don’t need a multinational entertainment company or a suicidal Japanese developing team to produce a great game. All it took was the sacrificial offering of one man and his career. Years later Braid is still one of the defining indie games that anyone interested in modern gaming just has to play. If you had the luck of living under a rock these last years it’s still one of the most climatic endings a 10 hour time investment  can offer. It’s simply put a game for the history books.			"

												Braid is an intriguing game where you use the power to rewind time to solve a variety of platform puzzles. As you progress through the game, you encounter new and different effects that give each level a unique challenge. Although there is some written plot, the game is driven mostly by player action.The biggest turnoff I've found for this game is that it was very poorly ported from console. You *can* use a keyboard, but its very uncomfortable and goes against keyboard control standards. And you can't change them. On top of that, you can't change any video settings, not even to go from fullscreen to windowed mode or the resolution. For my multi-monitor setup, that is annoying and distracting.Overall, I say this game is very much worth playing. However, I strongly advise playing it in its native console form.			"

												Definetly the HARDEST game i've ever play !!""Come On. This will not be as hard as you said.""Maybe yes. Braid introduces itself with simple puzzles that even 5 yo girl can finish those. But, in a mid-game you will experience new conditions that surely cause you to fail at first and want to give up already. These damn 'barriers' sometimes so annoying and you will struggle with them until the end of game.There are many walkthrough videos which uploaded by those smart guys on community hub and you can just follow those instruction to get all the puzzle pieces quite easily. But, will you still getting scared by a horror movie when you're already know when those ghosts will appear? Same goes with BRAID, the real experience come if you try to solve the puzzles by yourself.Other than that, Braid gives some heavenly soothing atmosphere through good music and nice graphic. These things are what i think the best part of this game. There also will be many references of many old popular games you have played before.In my conclusion, this game is not for everyone (as others told it too) but for you who likes puzzles and willing to strrugle with them will find yourself immersed in the game and somehow addicted to it. Giving it 8/10 (because it's hard). "

												Wow, what a game! Everything is so well made and forethought, it looks like a mastermind built it!What i didn't expect was that the idea for gameplay is not just turning back time. Well... that's the main theme, but it covers every aspect and every possible way of doing it so that it doesn't get monotonous and repetitive. I'm also surprised by the fact that it's so damn hard even though there is no penalty!It would be unecessary for me to pinpoint the amazing soundtrack and the poetic storytelling, but, however, i must say this:The game has a deep lesson to teach that many do not see. It's not hard to find, it's not a hidden meaning between the words or something, but usually people are being overwhelmed by its magic, in every way, and the message does not always reach the audience...In the end, it's a MUST and CLASSIC title, especially for casual puzzle lovers! :)			"

Very cool adventure platformer with mind twisting puzzles and temporal mechanics. Really fun, and really frustrating at the same time, pretty engaging story even though it`s all text. Gorgeous art design I love the look of this game.			"

												Braid is a puzzle game that manages to feel like an action/adventure game through the exploration of it's unique time-bending mechanics and intriquing hints at story. It's worth playing just to experience the novelty of a different kind of story, and as technical experiences go this is about as polished as it gets.			"

""Simple, yet overwhelmingly astonishing. This is Braid. ""Braid was told to me by someone in a forum, being an overlooked game and all. So after a year, I finally tried it out when it went sale. And...There's a lot to compliment about Braid, and I'll start with the art style. It is magnificent. Wonderful hand painted-like backgrounds to 2D variations sprites of these hand painted-like objects in the game. Everything good about aesthetics, this game has.Next is the plot. It is a story about a rather looking middle-aged man named Tim, that traverses different worlds from his house to find and rescue a ""Princess"". There are only a few noticeable characters, and, including Tim, are all very odd. The game offers a rather...no...very surreal plot, in a way that not everyone would understand, and probably it's intended best that way, for the people themselves to leave it to their imagination. I would like to talk about the ending, but I'll just spoil you guys. Which I would have to say, one of the most surreal endings I've seen yet.Finally the game's mechanics. It is a puzzle-platformer. 'Nuff said, but is it a good one? Yes, it's VERY GOOD at what it does. The system is so unique, that it contrasts your average platformers, and it provides a unique mechanic in every world. With that, it takes away the ""redundancy"" we see in most platformers. The system's mechanics are divided into two: The Basic Mechanics; and The World's Mechanics. The Basic Mechanics is supposedly Tim's otherworldly powers, which is controlling Time, either reversing it, forwarding it, or stopping it, but Tim goes along with the Time's flow, he does not stop in one point when he controls it, unless he has Time Immunity. The World's Mechanics, is how the World's reacts to everything, including Tim. The variation will differ in every new world. An example would be, that in one world, as Tim moves forward, everything moves forward, but when he moves backwards, everything moves backwards, disregarding him controlling Time to reverse time. As in another world, everything just moves backwards.The game has no deaths. Whenever you die, you'll just be prompt to reverse time, so that you can prevent what killed you in the first place. The puzzles are literally two parts; the platforming puzzle, and the puzzle pieces you actually collect. Does it have hints? No. The introduction to controls are rather a-blurred, that if you don't know how Braid works at first, you'd find that you can control time when you die. It's not a game for casuals...I would think that, but...the game has no deaths, as I've said.The platforming is brutally hard per se, but I'm pretty sure everyone with decent puzzle-platforming skills can manage it. So long they get used to the game's mechanics. Lifespan is more or less 5 hours if you're a decent puzzle-platform gamer. As you would see in my game time, that will include the time I had breaks, like alt-tabs. But that excludes(for now) the ""Hidden"" stuff, that you people would know later on.Overall, it truly is a magnificent game. Probably as people say, it is an overlooked game amongst others, but I would greatly recommend this to everyone who enjoys puzzles and platforming. Verdict: 10/10			"

If you can get it on sale, check it out!Braid is good, but I feel like the game is a little bit overhyped. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of platformers to begin with, but this game does bring something new to the table. The levels are interesting, for sure - lots of time-and-space based puzzles, which I thought was a neat take on platforming. It's a little like Prince of Persia and Mario had a lovechild.Braid's worth giving a shot, but I'd wait to pick it up on a sale. The play time feels just about right, but I doubt whether I'd feel the same way if I had paid full price.			"

												Braid is a courageous endeavor, seeking to redefine not only the puzzle genre but the platforming one as well. And while it does well to both improve and reinvent those genre's it still falls just a little short of the target.Braid time control mechanic is quite ingenious although it has since been topped by other games, the main problem with this incarnation of it being that it encourages nothing not replays. To complete Braid, and in particular to complete the achievements, Braid forces you to play the same 5 second tidbits of game over and over again until you get it just right. And repetition is never an entertaining game mechanic.The visual style and music is quite interesting but nothing out of this world and the storyline, if you can call it that, is pretentious and not that well written.Braid is a good little game, it just isn't quite as good as all the hype built up around it. It's fun enough just don't expect it to produce any revelations about the world of gaming.			"

												Belated review. Braid is one of the coolest games you will ever play. The mind-warping, time-bending 2D platforming puzzle goodness ranks right up there with the best of 'em. It is just one of those games that can't be missed. The only thing I didn't care for all that much was the somewhat pretentious ""story"" that meanders behind the scenes throughout the game. It didn't really add or detract from the experience, it just felt like that author was trying too hard to be ""deep"" or something (just my personal feeling). That aside, I can't find one negative thing to say about Braid. Give it a try. I guarantee you have never, and may never, play any other game like it. It's a really well designed and sometimes challenging game with great puzzles and original gameplay mechanics that will stick with you for a long time.			"

												Braid is a simple puzzle platformer, or at least at the first glance. Gameplay is incredibly smooth and well done along with all the time tricks you get to experience throug the levels. You'll love the relaxing ""classical"" music and overall soft and chill appeal in whole design.The trick is the first glance of simplicity wears off quite fast and you are going to get stuck. Often. Braid is by far the hardest puzzle game I've ever played. This is truly going to test how patient and clever you are. You are going to be frustrated at times, but at the same time each puzzle is going to give you a great feeling of accomplishment if you are patient enough to solve it on your own. None of the puzzles are dumb or repetitive and each brings a new pattern to uncover and understand.About the story - I must say I enjoyed the sentimental style and slow uncovering of it, but most of the time I was quite confused and had no idea what it was all about. Well, I definitely experienced better storytelling in games, but this game won my gaming soul just by its crisp gameplay.			"

												One of the most bester puzzle games. The puzzles are very well-designed and the difficulty scales up reasonably so that while it is challenging, it isn't impossible. Figure the puzzles out yourself. It is very satisfying.The story is short but adequate, though the symbolism is kind of lame.The only gripe I have is that it is much too short. You could probably finish the game in a few hours on your first try, though you may get stuck for hours on some later puzzles. Also, one of the ""hidden"" achievements of getting the stars and the ""alternate ending"" is likely impossible without viewing a walkthrough because some stars are hidden in the middle of nowhere (i.e., one star takes almost two hours to get).

Pros:[/b]Amazing artistic direction; classical soundtrack; variety in puzzle mechanics; fantastic final level.Cons:[/b]Ambiguous story completely separated from the gameplay won't suit everyone; music may get repetitive; hidden secrets are barely hinted.My veridict:[/b]Braid's perhaps pretentious delivery of its plot will not suit those who prefer a more direct approach, but it's a must play for those who enjoy puzzle platforming.Full review:[/b]Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, (Acts 3:19 NIV)Setting religious matters aside, it is safe to say that every human being has at some point in his or her life repented for an action of theirs.""What would have come to me had I done the opposite?""""If only I could turn back time.""These are common sentences from those wishing to repeat past events in hopes of a better outcome. Sadly to them, they are still unable to do so, but not Tim, the protagonist in Braid, Jonathan Blow's puzzle platformer. At a certain point in his life, Tim lost someone very dear to him and thus he enters a quest for finding that someone, whom we only know as ""the Princess"". In his attempt to correct apparently permanent mistakes, Tim is able to rewind time, never having to suffer the consequences of a wrong decision. With this in mind, can Tim really lose anything in this journey?The protagonist's travels are set in different worlds, divided in different levels, and the goal is quite simple: use Tim's abilities to solve platforming puzzles, collect every puzzle piece (literally) and reach the end of the level. At the beginning of each world, before entering any level, the player is presented with short books, explaining Tim's past and his relationship with the Princess. The plot, completely separated from the gameplay, is delivered in such an ambiguous manner that the player is mostly left with questions, pressing on hoping for an answer, but the princess always seems to be in another castle, as we are often told. Who is the princess?Time manipulation, often accompanied by platforming, is the gameplay's bread and butter, each world introducing and/or replacing new time mechanics, resulting in a great variety of puzzles. Braid isn't a game that gets easier as you grow accustomed to each ability, because you'll soon abandon it and be forced to completely readapt your thought process. The level ""Fickle Companion"" is a prime example of how becoming used on certain mechanics will stop you on your tracks until you begin to think again. It's a challenging game, but not in a way that will force you to abandon it. As you find a solution you'll notice how deceptibly simple it actually was. The superposition of platforming and time manipulation is so organic that it results in the most dinamically entertaining puzzles, while those who are solely time manipulation usually require more abstract thinking, usually being the most difficult.Most of Braid's $200,000 budget went to the game's artwork, developed by David Hellman. Every level has a lush pallet of colours and painted backgrounds, akin of an oil paiting. A forest in a yellowish tint, a cloudy blue sky, a city at sunset (or is it burning?) are a few examples of Hellman's glourious results. Would the game have delivered the same experience had the developer not invested in this artistic direction? We'll never know, because we lack Tim's abilities.The music throughout the game is mostly delivered by Jami Sieber and Shira Kammen, resulting in a classical touch, which actually influenced the above mentioned artwork and actually help setting the game's mood. The prime examples are Kammen's ""Downstream"", which is an adaptation of Luar Na Lubre's ""O son do ar"" (Galician: The sound of air) and Sieber's ""Undercurrent"". The former is commonly used earlier in the game, when the story is at its gentlest, while the latter, much darker, is reserved for latter moments, namely the final levels. There is, however, little variety of music, which may tire those who are searching for an expansive soundtrack.Despite its flaws in storytelling and an ending, which despite being amazing, leaves lots of questions unanswered, Braid is an important piece in the most recent rise of independent gaming popularity. Its sometimes challenging puzzles will quench the thirst of those looking for a challenge of the minds, but will not appeal to those who prefer more action in their games. Will Tim ever find the princess? It's up to the player to find out. "

												Everybody makes mistakes. After all to err is human, but what if we revisit our past, fix the problems we create and come out the better for them? This is the crux of Braid, a game that at it's core, is about someone who has done something very bad and is now doing everything in their power to wind back the clock and make amends. Eloquently penned and highly symbolic it tells a story with a deliberate purpose, the details of which have been picked and scrutinized over. It's meant to be open ended, to inspire discussion, and ultimately to make you sit and ponder the outcome, which speaking purely from my own perspective caught me entirely off guard and was cause enough for me to pause and step away from it to contemplate what it all meant.Built around the narrative (or perhaps the other way around) are the puzzles which again deal with the manipulation of time. At first it's simply a way out of the inevitable mishaps you get into, but as you progress they evolve into much more elaborate and inventive conundrums, continually changing up the rules while keeping the framework intact. Again and again I was astounded by the simple elegant way everything fit together, much like the jigsaw pieces you collect, each part feeling necessary and fleshed out. This goes a long way in keeping the puzzles challenging and absorbing, and although it is a short experience developer Jonathan Blow makes smart use of his time and doesn't waste yours with filler or sections that fall flat from poor execution.The rich pastel backdrops that blend effortlessly with the stunningly animated sprites, create a scene that looks like a watercolor painting in motion. It's absolutely beautiful and perfectly matches the tone of the narrative, further complemented by the soundtrack which flows alongside it in time, seemingly telling its own story in the process. It's an artistic masterpiece that captivated and enchanted me the moment I laid eyes upon it, and the organic pacing kept me wholly engrossed throughout.If you only play one puzzle-platformer in your time, Braid would be very close to the top of my list. It personifies the genre better than almost anything that came before it or after, and did so before the genre was anywhere near as prolific as it is today. If for some reason the story doesn't grab you the brilliant puzzle designs will, and those that look deeper be duly rewarded with what has been placed beneath the surface. I savored my time with it and am now, like our protagonist, wishing I could go back and relive it over again.			"

												Braid was floating around Steam for quite some time before I gave it a second look. I had heard many great things about Braid and knew there were some great reviews for it. Still, I wasn't as attracted to the game as I had hoped to be. Eventually it went on sale, and I thought, ""Why not?"" That weekend, I gave Braid a try; it blew me away.Presentation: 9/10The game starts off with a simple notion and subtly nudges you along, presenting you with simple concepts and well-written segments at the beginning of each world. The exquisite literature within these ""books"" help lay the foundation and reason for your journey, and as you progress through the game, you'll continuously find yourself connecting to our hero and his ambitions and goals.Graphics: 9/10Simple, yet elegant, the artstyle brings about a strong aura of innocence to accompany the story and its protagonist. The amount of detail put into the game's artistic world is stunning, and you'll often find yourself pausing for several seconds to admire its beauty. The artwork resembles that of some paintings and really gives you the feel of a game crafted with love.Sound: 9/10The music is calm and wants to lull you into its world. Soothing and conveyance of innocence in Braid, the soundtrack meshes well with the artistic representation of the game.Gameplay: 8.5/10Thought provoking at times, the puzzles were never made to be impossible and required a little perserverence and patience to complete. The basic concepts shown in the beginning of each world quickly expands and tests your intelligence with different situations that require some ""out-of-the-box"" thinking. As if that weren't enough, there's even an option to complete a speed-run of the game.Overall: 9/10I wholeheartedly agree that this gem deserves more attention. A short and powerful game that throws simple concepts with increasingly challenging puzzles, coupled with an innocent story yearning for companionship and great music: a game that no one should pass if given the opportunity.

												One of my all time favourite games.Braid tells a nice sad story. Its a perfect blend of story telling and puzzle platform action.The game itself reminds me of Super Mario with the monsters a bit like goomba troopers but with afro hair cuts. The puzzles will have you scratching your head while you figure out the different ways to complete them. Its broken up nicely into several different worlds and each world has its feature. See this is the interesting thing about Braid. Its the ability to go back in time. You can rewind and take yourself back in time and do it again if you screwed up. They work it nicely into the puzzles also with you having to rewind time as certain aspects in a level are sometimes not affected by the rewind. Sometimes this is a key to open a door or its a cannon or even a monster.There is a lot of replayability to Braid. Once you complete the game normally you then have the challenges. Once you've done the challenge you have the ultimate time challenge... complete the whole game in one sitting in a time limit and the time limit leaves very little room for error. Which in itself can be a bit frustrating when you reach the last level and screw something up on the last part of the game.I couldn't recommend this game more. buy it.... NOW!			"

But then I started to submerge into it while me and my frieds were playing it and I started to realise how deep this game is. It loves to play hide and seek, loves dualities and metaphores. Nothing is as it seems at first glance...*Minor spoiler ahead*The 'home page' isnt a home page but a world of its own, the relationship with a princess isn't real, but it's rather a reflection of the protagonists conciousness, the world, the princess aren't real either they are metaphors for lost innocence that can never be retrieved no matter how hard we push... even the music composer hides her identity under a musculine name... It's hard to say more withou spoiling it for you, so if you like check the hidden meaning on the internet. But once you realise it you will never look at the game the same way. It's very dark even thoug it's trying to hide it behind its chlildish lookShould I recommend it ?Definitelly yes! Its a great game, very inventive in many ways, even without caring about the background story. It plays nice, has an interesting game mechanics never seen elsewhere and a very, very dark atmosphere once you understand it... For me this represents everything that I expect from a game. "

												Braid is a 2-D puzzle platform game where time control is the key game mechanic. There are a few places where quick reflexes are required, but for the most part solving the puzzles just requires figuring out the right sequence of actions. Most of the puzzles are intuitive yet difficult and require a lot of thought to solve. A few puzzles were so difficult that I had to consult a video walkthrough. The goal of the game is to collect puzzle pieces, and then assemble the puzzle on a canvas. The puzzles are artsy-fartsty paintings which are pretty decent, and it is trivial yet fun to put the puzzle together. There are also books in the game that contain pieces of a story. Just like the paintings, the developer is trying to get artsy-fartsy with this story as well. For me the story was too disjointed and ""out there"" for me, but this does not really detract from the game. The art and music for the game are very good. I played this game with a game controller on my PC, it is probably a bit harder to play in on a keyboard. Overall it is an excellent game that I can strongly recommend. If you like this game, you might like these 2-d puzzle games: Limbo, Vessel, The Swapper. You might also try 3-d puzzle games Portal, Portal 2, and Antichamber.			"

												You've probably heard it all before, but here goes:One of the most immersive experiences one can have. The fact that the story isn't just laid out for you to read trough and must actually put tought into it, coupled with the fact that the gameplay elements themselves are an important part of it can cause a much higher sense of accomplishment and even trigger some fairly strong feelings.The graphics and estethics are amazing. The assets were litterally painted and digitized, and it shows - almost everything looks gorgeous. There's really little to say about it, and screenshots don't do it justice, just see it for yourself.The music fits right in. Very atmospheric, yet still at times very melodic. A better soundtrack could not be wished for.The puzzles are varied and interesting, often times quite difficult to figure out, even. And that's just the basic ones - there are hidden puzzles within puzzles that unlock something special, and those are _really_ mindbending sometimes. Each ""world"" comes with it's own set of rules and capabilities, and most of them are quite amazing.I, personally, have only two complaints about it: 1) the bunny-cat-flower things are make way too high-pitched noises, and 2) at some points there are doors (completely indistinguishable from regular ones) that break your key and don't open. That's just a cheap shot.Other than that, I can't fault almost anything about it.Go get it, and enjoy it - almost guaranteed you will.			"

												Braid was floating around Steam for quite some time before I gave it a second look. I had heard many great things about Braid and knew there were some great reviews for it. Still, I wasn't as attracted to the game as I had hoped to be. Eventually it went on sale, and I thought, ""Why not?"" That weekend, I gave Braid a try; it blew me away.Presentation: 9/10The game starts off with a simple notion and subtly nudges you along, presenting you with simple concepts and well-written segments at the beginning of each world. The exquisite literature within these ""books"" help lay the foundation and reason for your journey, and as you progress through the game, you'll continuously find yourself connecting to our hero and his ambitions and goals.Graphics: 9/10Simple, yet elegant, the artstyle brings about a strong aura of innocence to accompany the story and its protagonist. The amount of detail put into the game's artistic world is stunning, and you'll often find yourself pausing for several seconds to admire its beauty. The artwork resembles that of some paintings and really gives you the feel of a game crafted with love.Sound: 9/10The music is calm and wants to lull you into its world. Soothing and conveyance of innocence in Braid, the soundtrack meshes well with the artistic representation of the game.Gameplay: 8.5/10Thought provoking at times, the puzzles were never made to be impossible and required a little perserverence and patience to complete. The basic concepts shown in the beginning of each world quickly expands and tests your intelligence with different situations that require some ""out-of-the-box"" thinking. As if that weren't enough, there's even an option to complete a speed-run of the game.Overall: 9/10I wholeheartedly agree that this gem deserves more attention. A short and powerful game that throws simple concepts with increasingly challenging puzzles, coupled with an innocent story yearning for companionship and great music: a game that no one should pass if given the opportunity.

												The platforming and puzzle mechanics of this game are pretty much perfect, and it actually has an interesting story, albeit metaphorical and ambiguous. Controlling time (among other interesting things) has never been done so right. The puzzles are challenging and brilliant, and the graphics are beautiful. It's like playing a moving painting. It's all pretty mind-blowing and masterfully-executed. This is a game I can recommend to pretty much anybody. Go play it for yourself.			"

												The story is pretentious, the writing is wordy, but this doesn't matter. The puzzles here are brilliant. Time manipulation puzzles are old hat now but this game does them very well. It's hard to say why in this space but the puzzles are made in the way portals are, starting simple but progressing to fiendish. The watercolour graphics are pretty, but the soundtrack isn't very good.			"

												Simple 2D platformer, Super Mario inspired. Extremely good music, very relaxing stuff. The story is a lot of TL;DR walls of text at the start of each level, but even ignoring that you'll still get something out of it by the end. It has a lot of interesting ideas going on and it changes pace very quickly so that nothing drags on or gets too old/easy. 11 of the 12 achievements are simply beat the game, the time run is really damn hard though.For what this game aims to be, 9.25/10.

												Purchased at $5People really blew this one out of proportion. Way too much attention was paid to the nonsense texts that you can read, and not enough attention on the actual gameplay. Yes, it's basically Mario with time control, and its quite fun while it lasts. I got stuck for a few minutes here and there, resorted to a guide twice. I felt like the game could have been much more creative in the level design and lengthier, but for what it is, you cant go wrong with $5 or less. Could have used Steam Workshop support for new levels.			"

												I barely wish for a game to have thumb that is neither up or down but just kinda ""meh"". Right there in the middle. On the other side I do not like it to have a ""meh"" opinion. DAMN YOU BRAID! :DNow, I know this game has been praised all up and down for being amazing, and it is. Except for the times when it is not. To me, the most interesting parts about Braid are the art style and the core gameplay mechanic. While I can't do anything but praise the style of the game as well I will do so. Be praised Art Style! Your rock!The core mechanic, however, is a double edged sword. It basically is all about turning back and replaying time. You can do so manually at all times or sometimes you'll have a special time mechanic on your hands:In example, when your movement is queued to the entire game world. Walking forward will move you and the time, standing still will freeze it and walking backwards will rewind it. There are quite a few different time mechanics within Braid, but since I'm not all that evil I won't do spoilers here.Oh yeah you can walk and jump here. That's like the platforming part. It's solid but nothing special without the time travel thingy.While this makes for an amazingly fresh gameplay experience, some of the puzzles tied to it are ridiculous. You'll spend hours upon hours to solve a single game screen just to get frustrated as hell, turning to a youtube guide if your computer can still play videos after you've tossed it through your entire apartement, out the window and ran it over with a truck. Twice. Some of the puzzles later on even require the usage of tricks never hinted at, let alone explained wich just seems cheep.There may be the 1% of players who will dedicate their live to solving those puzzles without a guide but there's a 1% of people who try to invent time travel itself in the real world as well without much success. So yeah. Another interesting thing are the collectables. You can run through almost the entire game, skipping all puzzles. Now it won't do you and good and you'll be done with the Braid within 15 minutes. So don't do it. Embrace the rage! By collecting certain things you'll uncover other certain things wich will uncover 6 very certain things and the games ending. Wich in itself is a thing. So ya. Getting those collectables is the goal of the game.There are a few more things I wanna praise here to look in the mirror tomorrow morning, hating myself for being mainstream or something.Yet another great apsect this game does have for it is the music. it's great. I do have the feeling that it is intendet to calm you while the hate about not solving puzzles inside you does grow to an infinite amount of pure rage. Just like the visual part of the game it feels ""real"". As in, all hand made. A warm piano accompanied by a soothing Cello charm your ears while you are afraid of blowing up the house on the other side of the street if your speakers fail to work all of a sudden. Or if you use the time mechanic (wich you have to) for it will rewind the soundtrack as well wich sounds god awful. So basically, the music makes you afraid of solving the game... Soundtrack, you've nailed it! Except for the fact that you make me staring at the screen not doing much at all cause I am afraid of rewinding you.The story is surprisingly deep for a puzzle platformer. Not deep in the sense of an epic story that will unfold before you but deep as in you'll find yourself thinking about it... in fact, Braid is kinda vague on the story thing with a bunch of diaries as your only lore. But those diaries are, in fact, very well written and thought worthy... You'll (or can... there are those people) squeeze your thoughts in a philosophical attempt, triggered by those diaries in the game... with about 30% of your brain cells while the other 70% will be occupied crafting a pipe bomb you'll stick into your computer, watching it blow up in satisfaction about the running gamescreen fading to black while you'll get caught into the explosion. Story, you are awesome! Kind of.... Kant would like it I suppose.... or Tolstoi. Maybe...(Dat ending though.... 12/10)There are more likable aspects about this game (like dropping huge objects on people and jumping on heads) wich do result in the same awesome but not awesome part of the game. In the end, it is indeed a great game wich you should buy but it also sucks♥♥♥♥♥for it will ruin your day whenever you start it. Wich probably means you shouldn't buy it.So buy it! Or not! I dunno. You'll have to answer yourself a simple question: Is the massive frustration worth the whole lot of joy you'll get from this game? I do not regret buying it at all but damn! This new computer was expensive!Yet again... dat ending though! 13/10!(if there are any typos I DON'T CARE CAUSE I'M RAGING!)Oh did I meantion the ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to beat speed mode? I didn't? Shame on me!			"

												A lot of hipsters will tell you this is undeniably one of the most deeply thought out games ever made. Most hardcore gamers will tell you it's a bunch of crap disguising itself to be deeper than it is. There's a line out there somewhere. As someone who's into walking simulator's and artsy ♥♥♥♥ing games, I'm probably not gonna win many fans with this review. The truth is, this is a pretty good puzzle platformer, gameplay wise. And to be honest, not a lot of artsy games are very good at being games. The game that this was inspired by from the 70's, Trinity, was a deeply moving text adventure about time and the bomb, and the gameplay on that do not translate well, so it is actually better than it's inspiration in terms of, you know, being a game The puzzles range from slightly challenging to slightly difficult, and you'll feel pretty clever solving them. That said, fickle companion is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and don't kick yourself for using a guide on a particular puzzle, some are very challenging. I am not great at puzzles and will admit I looked up two or three, just to see if I was on the right track.  As for the atomic bomb allegory, eh that's for you to decide. It could be a tale representing regret, but really, if you feel like there's some deeper meaning you're not getting, don't freak out, very few people actually think they have a grasp on the theme, and none of them can agree. If nothing else just know there's regret and no going back, possibly an atomic bomb, but definitely fun puzzles and beautiful music.			"

												Bullet points:Very prettyHas pleasant musicCreative puzzles/mechanicsChallenging without being frustrating (mostly)Full ending is ridiculously hard to getObnoxiously beats you over the head with metaphorsBraid is a very clever little puzzle game with gentle, pleasant music.  It's not super difficult but it's not exactly easy, either - it falls into a nice ""kind of challenging but not frustrating"" place - that is, unless you want to unlock the true ending.  Moving through the levels and collecting the puzzle pieces is a fun affair, but the 8 special puzzles for unlocking the alternate ending range from fun to ""the developer is giving me a giant middle finger and I don't know what I did to deserve this.""  I have been told that the sadistic difficulty/tedium of some of the special puzzles is a metaphor.Your character, a cute little guy in a suit coat named Tim, starts off with the ability to stop, rewind, or fast-forward time, which he retains throughout the game.  At first this is mostly used to rewind mistakes, but as you progress you'll find several other uses for it.  As you enter each new area you will be given small pieces of writing about moments of Tim's life.  The little vignettes are nicely written and interesting to read.  They are mostly unrelated to the actual story, but they tell us about Tim's character and set an appropriate tone for each setting with hints at that level's special ability.  Each area also has a simple jigsaw puzzle to collect and assemble.  The images in the puzzles are unrelated to the story.  I have been told that the images in the puzzles are metaphors.The overall story is...  About 95% of the time it seems to be a spoof of the original Mario games taken to a strange extreme: Tim is an eccentric dude with an obsessive personality, and he is totally fixated on finding a princess.  In the last area or two it then beats you over the head while screaming ""It was a metaphor!!""  Frankly it's a bit obnoxious.  If you have the patience to collect all of the extra objects for the true ending, the game will explain the metaphor in detail (but it's easy to figure out even with the ending that doesn't explicitly come out and say it).To summarize:  This is a fun puzzle-platformer with an eye-rollingly pretentious story.  Metaphors.  Metaphors.  Metaphors.			"

												The puzzles and time mechanics are okay, but the story/narrative they try to push is kind of weak. The game feels unfinished in some areas, and unless you dig through the game's files and get 100%, you won't understand it. In the end, it feels like the gameplay is more of a device to deliver the story (or rather, the small increments and quotes littered about), instead of the story being a delivery system for the gameplay. It's hard to explain, and harder to recommend.			"

												Braid , indie game puzzle platform genre has ingenious combination between background and gameplay mechanics of the game , causing players to experience an unforgettable feeling . Braid forcing players to face with a broken love and give them a special ability - an ability that anyone who has ever walked to the end of the affair are longing to get - which is the ability to turn back and finding time to time things started to go wrong. Many people believe that Braid is a game too "" fancy "" , but it is hard to deny that a beautiful scene , a story back in time , and a romantic storyline together perfect for creating a game can give players recall the best moments and the worst in love. In my individual review, Braid is a perfect puzzle platform game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game because of other people praising it. I thought this game would be fun with the time manipulation concepts but I am finding all of it confusing and tedious, making it really hard to enjoy the game. I feel like the mechanics are just throwing themselves all at once at me and the developer is just expecting the player to know what to do instinctively. When I do get something working, often I feel it was just through dumb luck more so than analyzing the situation and executing to see if my strategy would work. This could have been avoided if the concepts were introduced better and how to take advantage of each one.I also feel that the game is cheating me, like I obtain a key and then I lose it if I backtrack (not rewind). I do realize that a green ""aura"" object or enemy is immune to time manipution, but other things, such as moving right makes enemies ""play forward"" while moving left makes enemies ""play backwards"", isn't clearly marked. I think that particular key is that kind of object but I just gave up after not understanding why I was losing the key.For some reason, the game likes to shift between 30 and 60FPS. This isn't frame skipping. This is kind of annoying because the game started out slow and then suddenly became faster and then become slow again. I don't understand why.I do applaud the developers for trying to do something ambitious but I don't think it was designed well in execution. It might be an indie game and not a AAA game, but that doesn't automatically mean good. The art style and music playback of rewinding, fast-forwarding, and slow-motion distortion are interesting to see and hear come from a game, but that's all I can really say is good about it. The rest is just meh to me. I don't think this game was meant for me. I'm glad I gave it a try though. At least I know it's not for me.			"

												It feels insufficient to give only a thumbs up. This game - if given space and time for thought, is one of the more rewarding platformers to emerge from the new Indie era. Dozens of games have been trying to achieve this meshing of subtle emotional storytelling, unique design, beautiful art direction, and fantastic score. Almost none have even come close. If you are frustrated by difficulty, this may not be for you, but beyond that narrow caveat - this is really a game for everyone.			"

												I had mixed feelings going into this game, but trust me, if you stick with it, your reward  will be immense. The art is beautiful, the music lovely, the gameplay fresh and never frustrating, with some of the best puzzles I've ever seen. As tempting as it may be, do NOT use a guide on any of it! It will seem impossible at times, but it is very possible to reach 100% completion, and the satisfaction of solving the problems this game tasks you with is unlike anything I've felt from a game in a long time. If you haven't played Braid, well, there's no time like the present!			"

												I totally expected to like this game.  I loved Limbo so thought this might be similarly enjoyable, especially considering great reviews for this puzzle/platformer.  Bottom line: I did not enjoy the puzzle experience at all, and the controls and level design were more frustrating than fun to play.  I don't know, there's so many good reviews I thought for sure I'd find something to like, but ... nope.  Some reviews mention needing to use mechanics you don't know you have sometimes, so maybe that's part of it.  I don't know.  Played about 50 minutes and stopped to reread some reviews thinking maybe I'd misunderstood.  Sadly, am requesting a refund.  ;-(   This thumbs down is unexpected - a high profile ""miss"" for me that I was confident I'd enjoy.			"

												This game was a massive dissapointement for me. The storyline was not very interesting for me and Tim is not really a protagonist I ended up caring about. They are many reusage of the same levels, and yes playing it every time with different powers does make the reusage intriguing, but considering the length of the game (Which is pretty short) it just feel lazy. This game uses very basic puzzle mechanics and isn't frankly as different as people say. Sure, the graphics are gorgeous and the world is interesting, but in the end these aspects get overshadowed quickly by sloppy storytelling, unoriginal level design, a soundtrack that was good at first but that got quickly on my nerves. I'd give it a 5/10			"

												This is a fun side-scroller game with an artistic touch.  The environments look like paintings and the character you play looks like a hero you'd see from the old school Mario games.  Actually the gameplay is very much like the old Mario Bros. games.  But, instead of just trying to make it to the end of the level, each level has puzzle pieces you have to collect.  After you've found them all they make a painting.  But it's not as simple as just grabbing the puzzle pieces and exiting the level.  These worlds become more like a puzzle.  The good thing is, you can't really die or screw up too bad.  That's because you can literally rewind your gameplay!  If an enemy hits you just rewind and try again.  The challenges get harder because some worlds react to your movement and some items have magic and can't be changed with the rewind feature.  This game has great artwork, music and a nostalgic feel.  If you like side-scroller puzzle games you'll love this.			"

												It's strange because in theory this is exactly my type of game, but I just wasn't feeling it. I found it far too difficult, to the point where it was so difficult it just wasn't fun at all. Most of the puzzle solutions felt like exploits rather than solutions. Which I think I'd be OK with if the game wasn't real-time with penalty for failure. All of the different time-based gameplay mechanics were interesting and playing around with their implementations was pretty cool, and the puzzles were extremely well-designed - this game is a classic example of introducing some reasonably simple mechanic and then wringing every last gameplay idea out of it just like Nintendo is pretty good at. Only problem is that it just wasn't actually fun.I thought the graphics were... bad (I've never seen something that looked like it was drawn in MS Paint AND looked horribly blurry before), and the music was annoying (not the fault of the music per se but just the fact that it's bound to be annoying when you're constantly rewinding it, pausing it, speeding it up, slowing it down...). The ""story"" was unintelligible garbage like Hotline Miami - there's metaphorical and then there's just noise.I suppose if you come at this game with the idea that the only thing you want is a sequence of increasingly difficult real-time puzzles, and you're happy that the game will give you absolutely nothing except those puzzles, and you don't already have a headache, you could enjoy it just fine. But silly me, I tried to pay attention to the story, I expected low-stress areas between high-stress areas, I expected the game to explain its mechanics to me (don't need to explain everything, but the arbitrary/esoteric corner cases of the less obvious abilities, that are necessary for progression? yes), and I already had a headache when I started.

												It's very hard to tell someone how amazing this game is without spoiling parts of it. The puzzles are splendidly designed, testing your wit, memory and reflexes.This is by no means an easy game. There are times where you will want to give up or look up walkthroughs. Don't. The minute you figure out and say ""Oh yeah!"" is the best feeling ever, and this game gives it to you in bundles. For €8.99 this is a steal. This is worth so much more. No puzzle game (with the exception of Fez) has given me the same sense of wonder and awe of the beautiful world on my screen. ""Beautiful, entertaining, and inspiring"" is the best way to sum up this game. Do yourself a favour and buy it. Now. Play it til your fingers bleed from trying to solve puzzles, because it's worth it in the end.			"

												Years late, I finally experience Braid.The art direction, sound direction, music, and gameplay concept are all completley superb. There is nothing quite like Braid, and it certainly inspired many other games to try and tackle the really unique ways it convoluted Time.However, I found Braid to be incredibly confusing and difficult. It made me feel like a simpleton most of the time, with solutions to puzzles feeling more like abusing the mechanics than using the mechanics in a natural fasion. Furthermore, the diffiuclty curve never felt like a curve, but more a square-wave function.After consulting a Steam guide many times, I was finally able to finish the game. Having robbed myself of the satisfaction of actually figuring out the game, it felt a bit flat. Despite my issues with it, the game stands out as a great technical and aesthetic achievement.Well worth it, especially if you've a mind for puzzles like this.			"

												Such a beautiful game and also so clever. I haven't finished yet, but one of the many great things about Braid is that it gives you some freedom to explore and see the world(s) before knuckling down and solving puzzles.And the puzzles are often a complete delight. There's a huge amount of satisfaction to be had from suddenly realising how to reach that previously unobtainable key or picture piece. And hey, if your platforming skills aren't quite up to getting there on the first try, you can always rewind time to do it again...The game teaches you about the gameplay mechanics in marvellously inventive ways that make you want to discover the next trick.  And then, when you pull yourself back from what you're doing for a moment, you'll be reminded again that the whole thing looks and sounds gorgeous.			"

												With all the artistic praise Braid has received, I came in expecting nothing less than literary perfection. To my disappointment, the dialogue in this game is some of the cheesiest I've ever read from anywhere. I may not be able to do better, but if you're going to make this a story oriented platformer, at least try to make sound less like a fifth grader's attempt at writing a mystery novel.With that said, Braid is a great game. It's music suits the atmosphere very well as do the visuals. But those details pale in comparison to gameplay. At heart, Braid is a puzzle game, despite its platforming setup. A good majority of the puzzles require players to use time manipulation, with solutions that are both frustrating and clever.No doubt there will be times you'll be stuck. My best advice is to never use a walkthrough because solving each puzzle will make you feel immensely rewarded. Instead, if you must, look for hints online (I admittedly did so a few times!), not answers.Grade: B+			"

												Braid is…A stunning painterly adventure through a platformed word and the history of a relationship.From the starting sequence, I was in love, it started so simply control was instinctual move and jump, got it! I was engaged, the emotion you can feel in it narrative, is real. This game served as an emotional outlet for its creator and that element of Braid makes it feel very sacred. That is where my love affair with Braid begins and ends.Braid loses me when the time control function comes into play. I have gotten no introduction to this mechanic. it is just all the sudden mandatory to move forward. This now feels like the first REAL OKG review. This mechanic and the way it controls both on screen and on the controller have ended my experience with this game.Here is what this actually looks like, I am sorry I don't have a stream, that is coming soon. Play along with me though.Camera fades from black and iris open to a wide angle shot. Liz is sitting facing her monitor, controller in hands, grin on face and feet at the ready under her chair.The soft hum of in-game music can be heard in contrast to the clicking of nails against a plastic controller. Full attention is focused on the monitor that glows before her. As you watch Tim, the on-screen avatar bounce around platforms and off enemy heads you can see Liz hold her breath and her mouth tense just a little each time she presses the jump button to send Tim soaring.She is still progressing but the grin has faded and her shoulders have rolled forward . Then she gets here, this screen shows the end of this game for our Okayest Gamer, Liz Cooper.So what does OKG say?So after experiencing my masochistic attempts at progress in this game, what do you think I am going to say here? If you are an OKG like me, there is a chance this mechanic might catch you up too, but maybe not. I would try a friend's copy before buying to see if you are all clear, or maybe just add to Steam Wishlist and get when on deep discount during a sale.If you do not have OKG tendencies, then you are a lucky devil and in for a wonderful experience. I have watched  youtube playthroughs of more successful players, and it is a fantastic game with such emotionally strong narrative. Settle in for a great game and some life lessons on the side.			"

												Braid is a sure bet for the artsy-fartsy folk or any fan of puzzles.  With artwork by David Hellman of 'A Lesson Is Learned But the Damage Is Irreversible' fame, the surreal environments alone are an enchanting experience while the story underneath it all unfolds. Frustrating at times but ultimately satisfying, this game is well worth the small price.			"

												This game was exactly what I hoped it would be. A well designed puzzle-platformer with time mechanics. The game isn't very long, but it is definitely a case of quality over quantity. There are a few levels that get repeated, but I think it is done in a very interesting way; it doesn't feel like filler.There is a deeper meaning to this game if you choose to look for it. But it's main strength is the quality of the puzzles. Some of them are ingenious, and most of them have very simple yet abstract solutions. One of the most satisfying puzzle games I have played in a long while.			"

												Brilliant except for the unneccesary and utter rubbish epilogue.  The game should have ended at a blank screen when [SPOILER DELETED].  The puzzles were frustrating though, play it with a cheat guide if you hate platform puzzles as much as I do, just try to avoid spoilers because this is a game that isn't even worth playing if it's spoilered.

												Amazing game play mechanics, seriously challenging puzzles and an incredibly deep story with beautiful art. Manipulating time has never been so fun! You traverse through each of the five worlds, collecting puzzle pieces that are very difficult to get. Once I started playing, I couldn't stop. After completing the game, try the speed challenges to really test your skills. It took me an agonizing (but oh so enjoyable) 6 hours to play through the entire game without any breaks and help. Now I'm ready to beat the entire game+collecting all puzzle pieces in under 45min for the speed challenge achievement. Old school gamers will enjoy the Mario references too :)Overall, a great game with great storytelling! You must add this to your game collection!			"

												An inventive & unique action puzzle game that revolves around the manipulation of time to solve various puzzles, with an interesting & thought provoking storyline that has hidden dark layers & undertones beneath the colorful semi-cartoony graphics. Progressing through the game & solving the variety of diverse puzzles is certainly brain-teasing, & while some may leave you totally stumped at times, Braid is the type of game where as you are running around experimenting the answer will hit you all of a sudden & keeps you coming back for more. You can't die in Braid, but don't let that fool you into thinking this game is somehow lacking in difficulty. It's definitely quite challenging & just when you think you have solved it all there are secrets hidden throughout the game. While the game is not that long the experience will certainly leave its mark upon you. Thanks to Braid I now pay a lot more attention to indie games because there are some real gems out there. Also can't wait for ""The Witness"", the follow-up to this from lead developer Jonathan Blow.			"

												Amazing and inspiring little game! Maybe not the longest one out there. The story is a little confusing just like the whole game that seems so mysterious. Awesome puzzles that don't have to be solved in order. Each of them is small and focuses mainly on one smart idea. They're constructed in a way that requires quite a bit of effort to figure out, but if you keep messing with it, you should be able to come up with the solution on your own eventually. Managing to solve a puzzle gives amazing satisfaction and makes you feel really smart. Try it! I love it. :)			"

												It's amazing. If you like puzzle games, you will love this. It's unique, and fun, and challenging. You'll feel similar to the way you do when you can't beat a level for Super Meat Boy, although at least in SMB you know what you have to do. ;)			"

												A truly inspiring game that does more than just tell a story. Every object, item, and action in the game has a deeper meaning to it than what it actually is.Here's an example (not in the game, just made up): A ball being thrown causes an explosion. This could relate to my childhood where my dad threw a ball at me and it flew me out of where I was. Almost like an explosion.			"

												Very cool platformer, which gives you one essential ability - to turn back time. This coupled with different game mechanics in each stage always brings new challenges, some of them quite difficult. The gameplay is quite short, but very enjoyable. If you wish for more, each level (and the game as whole) has time challenge to beat, but that requires a lot of patience and repetition :)			"

												At first glance it may look like a hipster version of Mario { something it's not shy about hinting at itself } but at it's core Braid is more of a puzzle game with a platformer interface. It is at times very challenging and fighting the urge to do a search on youtube for the way to clear an area could be tough for many people. Visually it has a timless art style which keeps it seperate from the graphic spec' fights of contempory titles and as a 2D game it is not overly taxing on the machine it is played on. The Story, though hidden in a way, is actually quite deep & somber but i'll not spoil it. The length of the game is on the short side but for most people the puzzels will slow them down enough to get a good few gaming sessions out of it.Gameplay wise, it is inventive and surprisingly intuitive. There is little need for any tutorial beyond trying out the variations on the mechanics each world brings. The real downside is probably the replayabillity once you have collected all of the puzzle-pieces. Speed players may go back to try and beat their time but beyond that not much would bring the player back post completion. While most games out there lately seem to be either clones of other games or made to be easy to beat, this is refreshingly challenging. It looks good and it plays well. If you like platformers and puzzels, get it.			"

It took me quite a while to get the hang of it. The game plays perfectly with the mechanics it provides. I was repeatedly surprised by the amazing puzzles it has. Then i could not stop to play it till i finished it.Collecting all the puzzle pieces might not be an easy task but when you succeed, man you feel good.Can only recommend this game, just give it a bit time if you do not like it from the beginning, you will like it at last!

												A unique puzzle game that is one of it's kind. The storyline has very profound meaning behind it.The mechanics and the world kinda remind you of Super Mario Bros, except you manipulate the flow of time instead of shooting fireballs. You literally cannot die as you can always rewind your action. You timing doesn't really matter in this game... Well it does to some extent, but if you made a mistake just rewind it back!Unfortunately this game is kinda short. About 3 hours to complete the story. But It takes more time and dedication to complete all the speed run (which can be quite frustating).Overall, if you are a fan of puzzle game, then you cannot pass on Braid.			"

												Awesome. It's a quick play, taking about 4 hours to beat if you're not getting secret stars or doing speed runs. The gimmick here is that in each world, time flows differently: sometimes it's normal, sometimes it moves as you move, sometimes you have a time-slowing ring, etc. It's pretty hard, despite the fact that you can reverse time to correct your mistakes. Good luck, and remember: run away if you see any flowers. Where there are flowers, there are killer bunnies (I'm not kidding).			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Braid is an instant indie classic developed by Jonathan Blow. This is truly a wonderful platform game with a nice plot and a twist with the endingIt is an extremely playable platform game and the levels are designed nicely. You will learn new abilities and possibilities with other levels, the story is wonderful and well written. The appearance from the game's background to its graphics are wonderful and seems fairytale like and the music is gentle and it is nice to have it in the background I remeber when watching Indie Game: The Movie (which I highly reecommend watching if you love indie games) and the creator said he was depressed after the release of Braid. Mostly because some early kids' reviews were about the genious physics usage in the game with moving time. I hope he now knows everybody appreciate it for so much more!Braid is and will always be an instant indie classic, and anyone who is anyone should buy this game and give it a try at least. This is one of the few games that I will remember for a while! RECOMMENDED :)  "

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Braid is an instant indie classic developed by Jonathan Blow. This is truly a wonderful platform game with a nice plot and a twist with the endingIt is an extremely playable platform game and the levels are designed nicely. You will learn new abilities and possibilities with other levels, the story is wonderful and well written. The appearance from the game's background to its graphics are wonderful and seems fairytale like and the music is gentle and it is nice to have it in the background I remeber when watching Indie Game: The Movie (which I highly reecommend watching if you love indie games) and the creator said he was depressed after the release of Braid. Mostly because some early kids' reviews were about the genious physics usage in the game with moving time. I hope he now knows everybody appreciate it for so much more!Braid is and will always be an instant indie classic, and anyone who is anyone should buy this game and give it a try at least. This is one of the few games that I will remember for a while! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Awesome. It's a quick play, taking about 4 hours to beat if you're not getting secret stars or doing speed runs. The gimmick here is that in each world, time flows differently: sometimes it's normal, sometimes it moves as you move, sometimes you have a time-slowing ring, etc. It's pretty hard, despite the fact that you can reverse time to correct your mistakes. Good luck, and remember: run away if you see any flowers. Where there are flowers, there are killer bunnies (I'm not kidding).			"

												I wanted to like Braid. It's a game that begs to be liked: beautiful, painting-like art, soothing soundtrack, and ingeniously crafted puzzles. It has a complex, well-written storyline that requires a series of intelligent inferences to follow, as well as a whole horde of subtext and interpretation articles written by people far more intelligent than me. It's an intimidating game, too: a game that birthed an entire genre and has become a sort of initiation into indie gaming for many players out there. It's one of those games that, when you're having a conversation about small developer teams and the rise in indie gaming, you just can't ignore.A lot of people make the mistake of equating an industry changing game with a good game, and while Braid is, in truth, a work of art, I struggle to qualify it at as a truly enjoyable experience as a game. The mechanics of Braid revolve around the idea of time-manipulation as a core gameplay element. When your character moves forward, time moves forward. If your character moves backwards, time moves backward. But what starts as a relatively simple and unique method of creative puzzle solving turns into something grotesquely twisted and almost indecipherably complicated. Hard puzzles in a game should never be a bad thing, but puzzles that are so far out of the realm of my thinking that they become nigh unsolvable aren't fun, they're incredibly off-putting.On top of the intensely challenging puzzle-solving aspect of Braid, the game also identifies as a platformer that often tests the reflexes and timing of the player holding the controller. As the game progresses the player must become more and more precise with their control of the main character. Unfortunately, this, in combination with the difficult puzzles, made for a game that I could only play half of—any of the puzzles that weren't too farfetched for me to understand were instead doubly frustrating because they required a precision and sense of timing that my fumbling hands just couldn't seem to fathom.Altogether, Braid's the kind of game whose phenomenal story is somewhat ruined by its gameplay for me. It's the sort of game that I would rather watch someone play through on YouTube and then read about it on the wiki afterwards than sit down with the controller myself. It's a summary game—the kind of thing that when you step back and look at it as a whole, it's a wonderfully enlightening experience, but that experience is drowned out by an incredibly steep learning curve and absurdly convoluted puzzle solutions. Playing Braid is an uphill climb and while the view at the top of that mountain is pretty great, it's not quite worth the struggle to get to it in the first place.			"

												I watched Indie Game: The Movie and bought this game on sale. After about 4 hours, I did everything except for the speedruns, which I decided weren’t worth my time.The story just seems all over the place, I know it's supposed to be out of order, but what order is it supposed to be in exactly? Reading through the texts, almost nothing seemed to be part of some cohesive story line and nothing was even enjoyable to read. What a terrible epilogue. Far before the end of the game, I had lost all interest in the story, which comes off as pretentious.Puzzle difficulty increases almost exponentially, which would be fine if there was more instruction on your new powers than just ""The Pit"" levels at the beginning of each world, especially with the ring.The art is also very off-putting to me. The main character, Tim, has this unsettling stare up into the sky, like he’s looking at nothing and his expressions consist of a creepy toothless smile and what looks like a frown maybe? One of the puzzles has the gall to make use of the jigsaw puzzle pieces scattered throughout the game, as if the bland looking platforms are distinct somehow.Most of the music was good, at least the first time I heard it. In world 4, since your movements change time, each level is really only about 8-20 seconds of real music and you get to hear it all distorted and weird for like 30 minutes as you struggle through the puzzles.This game was enjoyable for about 45 minutes and I don’t recommend buying it at full price under any circumstance.Edit: I have since read the Wikipedia article about this game and it just about validates every single problem I had with this game. Blow basically says outright that the story is whatever you thought it was (in my case it was trash). Blow was so pretentious about his game that he didn't think anyone was smart enough to make a soundtrack for it. And again, Tim looks like Chucky.I have also realized that this game is, in fact, not at all as intelligent as it is made out to be. Just because you can't understand something, doesn't make it smart, it doesn't make it a masterpiece. If you want to ponder and reflect on a story, read a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book, don't play this game.			"

												It's indie. The most indie. It's respectable, sure. But was it really worth my time? Eh.Standard puzzle game with platforming elements. Braid is charming in its aesthetic; that's for sure. Classical music plays as you traverse levels filled watercolored backdrops. It has the presentation down, yeah, but its a shame that the rest of the game really doesn't hold up to my standards.A puzzle game lives or dies on its difficulty curve. If puzzles are set up logically, with difficulty that builds over time, then that's standard. However, Braid introduces new mechanics, and then immediately expects you apply these mechanics in extraordinary ways. The game will typically give you one dead simple level, and then dump you into a level where you need to apply something uncommonly or use a trick to get through. No thanks. And while I'm ragging on level design, something feels off about this. Levels are usually longer affairs, with several different separate puzzle compartments. This feeling is exacerbated the longer the game goes on. Really, the idea of having levels as a sort of divider seems more natural and cohesive to me. If puzzles have nothing to do with eachother except that the same mechanics are being used, then why shove them on the same map? I'm not entirely sure what the intent was.I'll be more blunt, Braid is a time waster. Every puzzle in Braid could probably be solved by anyone if they were given enough time to mess around with it. The amount of time you need to waste to get through would vary though. I simply don't have the patience to just waste time until I somehow solve the puzzle. Trying things until you have the solution is not logical. There is no process, the way I see it. There are just some things the game expects you to know. In a game like Dark Souls, that might be passable, but this has no excuses. If a puzzle game doesn't lay itself out in a logical way, there isn't any way to complete it without a walkthrough, or an excess of time to burn. That's a no-no.I guess I'm more lukewarm on this because I've played more interesting puzzle games that feel like less of a waste. The aesthetic is nice, but can we really justify the puzzles when flash games have been around for so much longer? I guess that's my biggest complaint. This entire thing feels like a flash game I had to pay money for. It's older, sure. But like I said, that doesn't hold water when older games did the genre more justice. The Prince of Persia time mechanics are cool and all, but they don't exactly hold the game up on their own. Later mechanics feel even worse when they begin piling on top of eachother. Unless you got the time to burn, you'll probably end up looking up a walkthrough.Speaking of wasting time, I'll mention the books in the clouds. There's several in every room before the start of each world. I felt robbed, because functionally, these books are worthless. Sure, they provide some color to the game, but anyone who's beaten the game will agree that they're really pointless fluff; akin to books found in the Elder Scrolls games. I'd recommend just ignoring them entirely or just being savvy of intentional misdirection by the game developer. Thanks.What else is there to say. Fairly standard puzzling, with a neat little aesthetic. It's ok for what it's worth, sure. I wouldn't exactly call it time well spent. That ending really sealed the deal for me. Instead of making the twist too obvious, Braid decides to lead you on, and then completely switches on you last level. And all this to one of the most played out twists in the book. There are better puzzle games. "

												I love puzzle games, but this one has some problems. If you love puzzles, you'll like this game, but be prepared to rage quit.Pros: The game and music is beautiful. The story is also pretty good.Cons: The game treats the story as an easter egg. The story is pretentious. You are not always told the rules of each world and are left to figure it out; this would be fine if the puzzles didn't require perfect timing for nearly everything. They aren't so much puzzles as they are timing tedious ♥♥♥♥♥. You don't really get to enjoy the music because of the rewinding time aspect.			"

												What a mess. If you're going to rip off a game, I guess Mario is a great choice, because he's old as heck and he's Italian so he probably can't sue you in America, but wow, this game fails on every level. The graphics? Apparently they ran out of money after paying for all the concept art, so they just stuck that in and called it a day. The music? Zero autotune, zero electronic effects, zero ANYTHING that would indicate that they did anything other than grab a bunch of instruments and go to town. The gameplay itself? MASSIVE BUGS. I'm talking about TIME GOING BACKWARDS OR STOPPING and all sorts of ridiculous stuff that should never have made it past QA. Honestly this is so buggy that finishing each level is like a puzzle because you have to figure out some clever way past all the game-breaking bugs. This has a really great story, but I would stick with Mario instead.			"

												Braid was one of the first pretentious indie art games of which we have so many tedious examples nowadays.  It is also a very good game.  Great sountrack and art style, and very fun gameplay that's fairly varied (though the first half is better).  HOWEVER the story is told entirely through mostly meaningless sort of pretentious walls of text at the beginnings of levels, which kind of sucks.  So yeah, except for a fairly brilliant ending sequence I'm not crazy about the story (though the text helps set the atmosphere of the levels, it doesn't go a good job of actually getting anything across), but Braid is worth getting soley for the excellent gameplay.

												I am still not sure I understand all the mechanics to moving back and forth in time and so on but this is a beautiful but mind bending / making you go insane game rolled into one.   In regards to controls many times I end up button mashing but it isn't a bad control scheme.  It is just a way different type of game with a different control scheme.  Now just because I can't get it all down in terms of controls it doesn't mean you can't.  In terms of the sound track it is pretty good but has annoyed me at times.  In regards to the story I can tell you it seems to be about a relationship between your character and maybe his wife or girlfriend.  It says you are rescuing an abducted princess but I think this is all in your character's mind.  Graphically I think it has some charm to it but if it wasn't for the good game play I think most would regard this as a pretty poor looking game in some ways.  Oh and as for what I said earlier in my review that this is a beauiful game I was not talking about the graphics but about the good it does for your mind.  This game really has you thinking.  I highly recommend this game but you must decide on the price tag that is right for you to buy it.  I won't put a monetary value on this.			"

												Braid is good, but it's not for everybody.I'd first like to say that the game mechanics and oft spoken of time manipulation are unique. The game does well at creating some difficult puzzles which will test a persons mental prowess. I also think that the soundtrack is excellent and that it provided some great background noise which helps to soothe you as you try to figure out the puzzles which are presented.  However, I think that the storyline is very dissatisfying and the reward that you get for finishing the puzzles is likewise a let down. I didn't find the gameplay or the story addicting enough to play it for more than an hour at a time. I thought that the overall look of the game was childish, which can be ok, but in this case rather annoyed me. The ambiguity of the storyline prevented me from feeling any attachment to the protagonist and the damsel in distress doesn't make an appearance until the end of the game. Essentially, the action of the story was never present during gameplay. There were obvious allusions to such gaming classics as Mario and Donkey Kong, but the game is not as nearly as addicting or as fun as those games are. In the end, I expected more from braid. The game was short and although I enjoyed the soundtrack and found the mechanics innovative, that's all there was that impressed me. I recommend it for it's interesting mechanics and soundtrack even though it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.			"

												It might say I have next to no time in this game, but that's not true. I've played about 10 hours of it in offline mode; I wound up getting about 2/3 of the way through the game.This game is probably one of the most overhyped ever. It has some unique selling points, though. The art style is good, the story is really cool, and the central power is really awesome. Time control is a really unique power that many games haven't managed to implement well. For a while, braid implements it well--sometimes. Most of the puzzles don't really revolve around you using time reversal as a way to solve puzzles, but just trigger certain things once per level in very specifc circumstances. You're mostly walking around for the whole game.However, every new stage in braid is based around a new ""version"" of this time control mechanic. This means that the original mechanic doesn't get to grow and be explored in new ways. Let's compare Braid with Portal: in portal, you start off simple, just moving yourself and objects around. Then it gets complicated; you add in turrets, lasers, light bridges, and then movement gels. Every time a mechanic is introduced it _builds_ on the previous ones you've learned and takes the central power in a new direction.In braid, the first power you have is the power to reverse time. This is explored for a bit, then you move on to other worlds. Here's some sample powers: one world has you move around, then ""send"" a shadow copy of yourself that follows the steps you just took that you have to interact with to solve puzzles. Another has the world run like a music box, where time moves forward as you move right and backward as you walk left. Do these sound related to the first mechanic you learned? Because they're not at all. What's the point of learning the core puzzle mechanic if you're going to drop it in the next world? The game could basically be described as a collection of 6 time-based different puzzle minigames, but not as a puzzle game that follows a good, challenging progression.			"

												Тим — абсолютный эгоцентрик, запертый в себе, неспособный на сопереживание или отождествление себя с другими, на любовь, дружбу, влечение или нежность. Он является абсолютно изолированной единицей, неспособной на взаимоотношения с кем-либо. Его реакции направлены внутрь, они не относятся к мыслительным процессам; его разум — просто инструмент для обслуживания собственных страстей и потребностей; он не способен к полету мысли, обмену идеями; он не соотносит себя ни с чем, кроме собственных физических ощущений. Он — полумертвая, ни на что не реагирующая масса, неспособная давать или получать удовольствие или счастье; соответственно, он, в лучшем случае, абсолютно скучное явление, безобидное пятно, поскольку только те, кто способны воспринимать и принимать других, обладают очарованием. Он застрял на полпути в сумеречной зоне между человеком и обезьяной, но гораздо хуже обезьян, поскольку, в отличие от них, способен испытывать множество негативных чувств — ненависть, ревность, позор, отвращение, вину, стыд, сомнение; более того, он осознает, что он такое, и чего ему недостает.Обуреваемый чувством вины, страхами, стыдом и неуверенностью, обладая, если удается, едва заметными физическими ощущениями, Тим, тем не менее, полностью захвачен желанием ебаться; он переплывет море соплей, перейдет вброд глубокую лужу блевотины величиной в милю, если будет думать, что там его ждет любезная «киска». Он выебет женщину, которую презирает, любую беззубую ведьму, и даже заплатит за это. Почему? Снятие физического напряжения — это не ответ, поскольку для него достаточно мастурбации. Нельзя объяснить это и удовлетворением самолюбия, иначе он не ебал бы детей и трупы.Абсолютно эгоистичный, не способный реагировать, сочувствовать, отождествлять себя с другими, наполненный до краев необъятной, всепроникающей, всепоглощающей сексуальностью, он физически пассивен. Он ненавидит свою пассивность, поэтому считает, что она свойственна женщинам, а мужчины — активны, а затем пытается доказывать, что он существует («доказывать, что он — Мужчина»). Главный его способ доказать это — ебля.			"

												Braid is probably the best Mario adaptation to the indie scene I have ever seen. This game follows the original format of Mario where you go through different maps jumping through obstacles to eventually reach a castle, only to realize the princess is on a different map. The one thing that makes braid a much more brilliant game is because of its time manipulation mechanics and integrated puzzles within the game. The environment is the puzzle and your skills with time manipulation will ultimately determine whether or not you can beat the puzzle to advance on to the next map. The game feels surreal with bright poppy colors, and the music is soothing and relaxing. The story is very deep and meaningful for a 2d plat former game. An obvious must buy for the indie enthusiast out there.			"

												From the many positive reviews of this game, I was expecting a great puzzle game that used the ability to go back in time as its main puzzle-solving technique. And this game did it pretty well. The main problem I have with the game is that you can pass levels without having to solve the puzzle. It is nice to let players continue the game if they can't solve hard puzzles, but if you can go through most of the levels without trying to solve the puzzles, the game isn't very fun.So although the game did a good job of utilizing a unique power as the tool of the game, I didn't enjoy playing it.

Doing many of them felt like a chore. It wasn't fun. And a game ought to be fun.It might be a good experience for someone who's not played many indie games but as you can tell by my review, I just found the whole thing very lacking in its execution.The visuals are nice, the music forgettable.The ability to play around with time is a neat idea though.

												If I should rate that game it would be somewhere between 2/10 and 3/10. The music is good and I like the way it deals with reverse time, but thats all. The story is bad, it made me hate the main character, mainly because its just exaggerated and made that character seem to be an idiot.  It's way to easy to figure out the solution of the puzzles, but often to hard to do them. Its frustrating to know what to do, but always failing to land on that exact spot or to jump down from that stupid ladder at the very right moment. I would have liked it more the other way around: difficult puzzles, but less need for that annoying exact timing.			"

												A rather banal platformer with poor controls that tries to compensate for it with the mildly unique ""reverse time"" mechanic. A neat idea, but the game is ultimately just dull. You spend your time messing around redoing things over and over to try and do the perfect sequence to get another puzzle piece, which you then literally need to use to assemble a puzzle in a very clunky interface. Ultimately, it just isn’t much fun, it gets quickly boring when you have to continue to retry your bounce off one of the enemies just the right way to reach your goal because the controls are poor.

												This game deserves none of the praise its been given. The narrative is displayed terribly, the level and enemy design is derivative and music is nothing to write home about. To me this game is the videogame equivalent of Duchamp's submission of the urinal as a piece of art back in 1917. But unlike the urinal and Duchamp's this work right here isn't designed to insult and challenge anyone to rethink current trends. It is just a mediocre work pretending to be something great which it isn't in any manner whatsoever, but enough people bought into it to allow that to happen but I guess that is what makes it more similar to modern art than anything else.

The two things that are hard - get all puzzle pieces and the hidden world (which is frustratingly difficult). The time gimmick is really cool and well executed in the game. Overall gameplay mechanics are basic for a platformer - jumping, running.The overall plot is symbolic/cryptic not bad. The graphic style is nice. The small puzzle assemblies are simple but refreshing.Mario is the clear reference to this game but it is not even close as good as Mario.I got it for 1$/€ which is good price tag for this game and fully recommandable.

												I can't really recommend Braid.While it is a great achievement for a single indy developer, the game itself can be extremely frustrating. Not just because the initially nonsensical logic-bending puzzles are difficult (and they are difficult) and not just because the solutions have to be executed with such a high degree of precision that it leads to a lot of frustrating trial and error (and there is a lot of frustrating trial and error), but because the game seems to go out of its way to trip the player up at every possible opportunity, up to and including inatentive blindness kills worthy of the kill-screens of even the most change-hungry arcade cabinets.Yes it has the rewind dynamic, key to it's design, but rather than being an interesting addition it just seems to serve to prevent the game from being just totally impossible to tollerate, and just barely at that, because,  unfortunately, it's inclusion and implementation just doesn't seem enough to justify all of the cheap deaths that seem to be set up at every turn as though intended really just to frustrate.Basically in addition to the core design, Braid also seems to be designed to trip the player up whenever  and wherever possible, essentially putting a pie in the player's face at nearly every step, almost like practical jokes the player should be in on but unfortunately it's one of those things that's not really that funny when it's happening to you.  Braid consistently frustrates; if it had a muted trumpet ""waa waa waa waa"" everytime it trips the player up with a pie in the face or a slap accross the cheek with with a wet fish no one would recommend anything but uninstalling this game and never touching it again.Braid is a remarkable achievement for a single indy developer, but ultimately, on some level, it really can just feel, at best, like a chore and at worst like some bizarre form of mental abuse, and as a result, does begin to grate, and ultimately to become just kind of repellent. Braid ultimately has effectively conditioned me out of actually wanting to play it, which is a shame because I enjoy puzzle games and I quite like its aesthetic. I'd recommend just enjoying what you can of the demo, up to the point that it starts to irritate; unless you're some kind of sado-masochist (and I guess ""to each his own"") I don't recommend playing beyond that point.As with many of the other people who've posted their thoughts about Braid, I have to say...I wanted to like Braid...?

												Art serves as a literal backdrop to this creative, original and charming puzzle-platformer that challenges the player to think far beyond button mashing to solve its increasingly complex riddles.  A jigsaw puzzle serves as a reward for each 'world' successfully navigated and fits itself nicely inside a thoughtful story of regret and the desire for a second chance.			"

												An innovative and fun game that has gaping flaws in it.#1: Difficulty, there were some challanges and then there were some that needed a youtube guide, the game needs some sort of hint system.#2: Puzzle pieces: These should have been a bonus and the levels should have been harder to get to the end of without the colletion of them, some levels were a straight shot to the next level with the pieces in puzzles around you. It was too easy to get through without the pieces and too hard with the pieces.#3: Post game There are 8 stars you need to collect in order to get the second ending. There almost no way someone would just stumble upon a star or know how to get one without looking it up, I bet there are people who went through the whole game and never came back to it completley unaware of these stars. Some require waiting 2 hours others require you to have not completed the game yet. What's that, you have? Only option is to reset all of your effort if you want it. Had it not been for the stars I probably wouldn't have left a negative review but it was so glaringly obvious there was a better ending and I wanted to see it, but I already beat the game so I just looked it up.

												Just another platform/puzzle game. Mediocre. Not sure why everyone busted their load over it.It looks ok if you like that style, which I do not. The music is not memorable. The physics and loose controls are annoying. Half the puzzles are actually logic puzzles and interesting, while the rest are just 'do <x> at the right time'. The enemies are just mario enemies restyled.the only unique thing about it is I don't think anyone really used time in a puzzle game before, so that was interesting. the story was sooooooo pretentious. Reading his bloody diaries actually put a bad taste in my mouth. I swear I could *hear* the creator saying 'I'm so clever'. Tl;dr just because it has a super secret meaning doesn't make it good			"

												The best part about this game is the presentation.  The graphics and music are beutiful and relaxing.  The idea of reversing time is interesting, but I feel they could have done more with it.  The game's also very short, you could 100% it in about 5 hours if you know what you're doing.  Overall, puzzle lovers may enjoy this, but it didn't really do anything for me.  If you want to buy this game, wait until it's on sale, because $15 is WAY too much.			"

												This game is really cleverly done, and I love the time bending element involved, but I really do not like the character or his story. For me a really important element to a well made game is the story behind it, and if I can't connect to it then it's hard to truly enjoy the game. The story is essentially about a guy who regrets being a bad husband and wishes he could turn back time. If you think you could connect to this story, then consider buying the game, otherwise there's better stuff out there. If I could turn back time would I still buy this game? Probably not. Probably not.			"

												A nonsensical plot atop a mind-bending puzzle game. I won't describe the plot anymore than saying it does not make any sense and when you think you've got a handle on it, it quickly flies away.As for the gameplay, its pretty damn fun if you're into this kind of puzzle game. By that I mean really hard ones with no hint system whatsoever. You can rewind time, and must use this skill and some platforming to collect jigsaw puzzle pieces. This isn't strictly necessary but, given the terrible storytelling, the puzzles are the only fun this game offers. Oh and the game often adds very interesting wrinkles to this time mechanic. The design is fantastic. But this is also an extremely hard game. There is no smooth difficulty curve. I tried to get each puzzle piece myself and only looked up a solution after reaching peak frustration. I was able to get the majority of them myself, and more than a few times found the solution to be something I never would have thought of.I'm happy to have played Braid, mainly because I wanted to see why critics love it so much. But while the gameplay was definitely novel and very clever, the difficulty felt like poor design to me. (Full disclosure, I'm NOT a fan of very hard games.) And I HATE the story. So I'm glad I got t for cheap in a humble bundle.			"

												Play Length: Less than an hour.  This is just my impression of the game, so you should take it with a bunch of salt.Positives: I generally like the graphics.  The painterly style is kind of nice to look at.  The concept of the puzzle design being about turning back time seems intriguing.Negatives: As far as the gameplay goes, I just couldn't wrap my head around many of the puzzles.  Many of them seemed like I needed to come back later, because I was missing some ability, but I wasn't quite sure.  Unfortunately, I can't comment on the puzzle design with much authority because I just didn't want to play the game very long.What I can say for sure is that this game was off putting for me.  I'll try to put my finger on that... mainly, it's the soundtrack.  I hated it.  Soundtrack is very important to me, especially for a platformer of this style.  But this game's soundtrack is all wrong.  As music, it is nice enough, but as a soundtrack it just doesn't fit what is happening on screen.  It's non congruent.  It's also not particularly good soundtrack music as none of it is very memorable.  It basically sounds like someone just grabbed some random music off their ipod and just through it in background while I played.  I think this non congruency might be why some people accuse this game of pretentious-ness.  To be ""pretentious"" literally means to put on a pretense of something you're not, and the soundtrack alone sounds like it's screaming at the player ""this game is very serious and important!"" while not at all trying to fit what was happening on screen.  The very definition of pretentiousness.From what I've heard, this pretentiousness also extends to the story, but unfortunately I can't comment on that.  What I can say is, besides the soundtrack, there was just something about this game that really put me off.  Maybe it was the overall feeling of the game, that feeling that all of the components aren't meshing well together.Overall: I'll be the first to admit that this not a great review.  What a review is supposed to do is inform about a game, and I don't know enough about it to provide much useful information.  If I worked for a gaming publication, I wouldn't publish this.  But you know, I'm just a guy who tried the game, and this is my personal impression of that game.  For me personally, the first hour of playing this game was enough to put me off from wanting to play any more.  Feel free to take that for what you think it's worth.About my rating system: I have two things I rate on.  Overall score, and soundtrack.  Personally, I feel like game soundtracks are tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a vital factor in getting me into the game.  For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and equal importance.  The meaning of each number are as follows:0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: MasterpieceBraid's score:Game Rating: 4 (Mediocre)Soundtrack Rating: 1 (Awful)			"

												This game is quite boring for being a 2D platformer. Only 10 minutes into the game I felt it was enough, but persisted in hope of change. After 20 minutes more I gave up.Game play is simply not fun, themechanics are too simple. The story is lacking depth that engages the player (well, at least me).The graphics are ""artsy"" in such way if it would be painted on a canvas, but on the screen it feels dull and smudgy. Sound is decent but too basic, it fails to create an atmosphere.Finally the options menu is very basic and a bit boring.			"

												Generally this game is fine. Only one DEVASTATING problem: it's too hard. Puzzle games like this should have a good amount of training. You train players until they fully catch one idea of puzzle solving, and only then can you put them into a real puzzle. However this game lacks training - there's hardly any training at all, it just throws you into a brain-killing puzzle and then nothing. As a result, most of the puzzles seem impossible to me, and I've lost all interest in this game.+ beautiful graphic and music+ flawless time reversing+ moving story (from what I've seen so far)- not enough training5 out of 10, unsatisfying.

												I believe this game to be extremely over-hyped. I bought it on sale for about $4 and wish i could get my money back. The controls are rough and the plot is almost non-existant. I managed to play it for about  1/2 hour before i couldnt force myself to play any more. It was a good theory, but they failed in making it (virtual) reality. The only good thing i have to say for this game is that it looks amazing. Now if only they had put some of the effort they put into the looks into the rest of the game, maybe it wouldn't be so terrible.			"

												Beautiful game with a charming (albiet mildly incoherent) story. Controls are solid and I appreciate the fact that nothing is explained, instead of the player must figure it out. It's too bad then that the game suffers from such poor design a times. Puzzles can be broken, making the unsolvable and needing a restart. Some puzzles are timed, miss the timing and again, a restart is required as rewinding won't fix it. There is no quick way to do this however, one must either go back to a door and then back to the puzzle, or exit the world, reinter it, and select the level. For a game that requries such trial and error one would assume the game designer would have made this more easily done.Additionally, this game requires 100% completion. You have 5 worlds to start out with, and to get to the next world you must complete every single level before, getting all puzzle pieces is the only way to actually beat the game. Most games that require progression in earlier levels to reach the final destination settle for an amount close to 100%, but not quite. Of course, it wouldn't be as much of an issue if the game didn't suffer from the restart issue described earlier. Sadly this just made the game a chore to play, which isn't much of a game at all at that point.			"

												I personally disliked this game. I picked it up because it was cheap, and because I'd heard good things about the time-warping mechanics.It wasn't a bad game, but to me it was supremely boring in both story and design. Borderline frustrating. The difficulty curve is more of a zig-zag than a curve, one moment you're cursing the developers for their feindish ways and the next you're bored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ going through the most childishly easy levels you've ever seen.I know there will be people out there who like depressing stories and inconsistant challenges - well, you will probably get more enjoyment out of this than I did.

												Braid is a puzzle-platformer, drawn in a painterly style, where you can manipulate the flow of time in strange and unusual ways. From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more. Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.			"

												I find the time travel mechanic pretty unique, but the game overuses it. I found that all the puzzles were challenging, for me anyway. One of my problems with this game is for those people who aren't really into it for the collecting can sometimes just simply walk right to the exit. I found this games puzzles interesting and creative, using the time travel really well. But some of these are nearly impossible and the fact that i could just walk right past it was really annoying. Take world 2. The ... hedgehogs, I guess, were getting fired out of the cannon and you had to time it perfectley to make it across the gap. I ended up just walking right past it after trying MANY times to make it. And the no dying? Breaks alot of gaming rules. Dying is part of how gaming works. And besides, it's not like it helps you. It takes you back to exactly where you are and for most of it all it helps you with is knowing that you were off by a few seconds. Pretty useless. The game fails to tell you anything about what things do and how they work. I had to figure out how to go back in time which i caught on to at the start of the second world. The story was pretty dull and boring so i really didn't pay attention to the text. The game isn't exciting. The music is bland, the puzzles can be repetitive, the story is boring, the game is confusing, and it's just not that fun.They even started reusing puzzles! I swear, the first world has a parkour to the end level. 2 worlds later, they have the exact same level, but you have to kill all the monsters on your way. Again, the game overuses the time travel. Need to revive, time travel. Kill a boss, time travel. Timed something wrong, time travel. Do anything wrong whatsoever, you guessed it. TIME TRAVEL! To sum it up, this game is probably the worst I currently have on Steam. It's just different for me cause i'm used to sidescrollers to having killing things, platforming, and making to the end of the stage. Not going back in time to solve problems, having optional puzzles on the way, and taking a nice lovely stroll through a bland field and occasionally jumping over a hedgehog. This game gets a 2 out of 5.			"

A poster child for ""games as art"" by many folks, Braid takes you into a world where you cannot lose at all, with a really bad story that pretends to be deep, and then one time Soulja Boy made fun of it and then Johnathan Blow cried about it in that terrible Indie Game movie documentary or something. If you are planning on buying Braid for the $9.99 price tag being offered, you should just take that same $9.99 and buy a real video game or paint thinner to drink.D- would not wish this ""game"" on my worst enemy.

Both the artstyle and the audio are tedious and you'd rather put on something rather than listen to the most grating loop of violin ever composed.Plot is bad.

												Braid... another award winning turd. This game is Everything that every other puzzle platformer isnt. The soudtrack is a dull, plodding, violin based piece garunteed to put even the loudest of colicky babies to sleep. The gameplay is as slow as the soundtrack. The time reversing mechanic is a joke, as no matter what happens you just reverse time to fix it. You died? No problems! Just hold the time reverse button, no matter how long your body has been laying on the bottom of the screen. seriously. you get hit and fall to the bottom of the screen. make it there and all it does is prompt you to hit the time reversal button. there is really no way to ""lose"" at all, you just play until you get bored.If you're looking for a challenge, or even a fun game, Look elsewhere.

												I'm just putting negative to counteract the massive unnecessary praise. This game is pretty much pretentious Super Mario Bros. without a time limit. The story, which I had thought was a highlight going into the game, is literally just poorly written flavor text that flashes on the screen before you enter a world, that you couldn't care less about if you tried. The watercolor art and the classical music playing during the levels really showcase the pretentiousness of the devs. Finally, in my opinion, while some of the mechanics were entertaining at first, many of the puzzles are poorly designed and frustrating, even with the somewhat unique time reversal mechanic. Something is wrong in any puzzle game when I am unable to beat a level simply because a mechanic wasn't introduced properly. Yes, of course I believe puzzles should be challenging, but in a much more genuine way. I never had to use the internet for Portal or Portal 2 even for the challenge maps, and yet I always eventually found the solutions out after taking plenty of time scanning my surroundings. With Braid, I had to use the internet on more than three of the puzzles and each time I felt completely ripped off.The bottom line is that Braid just isn't very much fun. If I play it for a while, it sort of grows on me, but once I quit, I can't force myself to go back and play it. It also makes me angry that Jonathan Blow has the audacity to go on record and criticize other, far greater video games than his own, the least of which being Bioshock Infinite. For as many problems as Bioshock Infinite had, it's still a far more entertaining game than Braid.			"

												Braid is a traditional 2D side scrolling platform game that feels very familiar. You enter different levels, hop on most enemies to defeat them, find keys, open doors and climb ladders. It feels very familiar. There is a jump button, up lets you go in doors or climb ladders, and a button for the big twist.The big twist is time manipulation, you can reverse time or fast forward it once you have rewound it. This way, when you die, you rewind time to when you didn't die. You rewind time to help you solve puzzles too.Such as, you will get a key, open a door and find another door, well you can rewind time to where you still had the key. When time is restarted, you will have the key, but the first door will be open. A lot of puzzles are like that in the game, whether its dropping 5 ceiling fixtures onto a boss's head when you need to rewind time to reset the fixtures or grabbing a key in a pit and rewinding time to when you didn't fall in the pit (but still keep the key).The game feels mellow and has a unique art style that makes it feel like a story book. There are things before the levels that you can walk by and read the rich back story to the game.While it is amazingly good, challenging and thought provoking. It feels like other free games found on the Internet. This game is just the best of them all, its a nice change of pace from everything that is 3D in the world.To be honest this game is more challenging than fun. It is a side scrolling platform puzzle game. Like Mario.... but with a tragic story. Like an unhappy Mario game based on puzzles that require you to rewind time, speed it up, slow it down. All that fun stuff. The only catch is that the difficulty curve goes up a giant hill. It is not fun and it gets challenging too quickly all while keeping a sad tone and a painted art style. Skip this game and forget how many people love it because its one of the first indie games to get praise. Go pick up something fun instead.			"

												As other negative reviews have stated, I found Braid to be a bit pretentious. Just because a game seems deep or philosophical does not automatically mean it's a shining paragon of gaming artistry. The games time reverse gimmick is pretty neat at first, but the schtick wears off pretty quickly as the ""puzzle"" difficulty ratchets up extremely fast. I thought Braid's artwork was really nice to look at although the main character looked a bit to me like a shrunken down Junior Gorg from Fragil Rock outfitted in a schoolboy uniform. The soundtrack was also a bit off-putting for me, much like the time reverse aspect, the music was nice at first, but I soon found myself turning my speakers off while playing. Finally, the play through time. The one saving grace I found didn't have anything to do with the game at all, it's the fact that I bought Braid during a Steam sale for about 75% off. I finished the game in about 5 hours and would have felt terrible paying full price.			"

												As with many Indie games, I find Braid is the type which requires you to fail in order to see the path you must take.  You can either opt to sit at a puzzle for what seems like an inordinate amount of time, mentally going through what course of action you'd take (which is difficult, as with the bidirectional nature of time flow in the game) or you can ""do as you go"", which ultimately ends up in repeated failures in a short amount of time (one of THE worst peeves I have).I don't have much time with Braid, but that's simply because I could not tolerate that game mechanic being the crux of the game's success in my eyes.

												The words pretentious and boring come to mind first and for most. I was really looking forward to this title because I, like many gamers, feel like videogames are an unexplored medium with possibilities for being high art.This game doesn't prove that point nor does it further it's cause.The story was clumsy, the message the creator meant to deliver was uninteresting and yawn inducing, the game play was repetitive and unenjoyable, and the puzzles were uninspired.I'm sure the creator of this game tried very, very hard and was very skilled. It's a shame that he utterly lacks talent.			"

												Pure hype.  Just an obnoxiously convoluted puzzle game.  And I love puzzle games, but come on.  This has a lot of those obnoxious point-and-click tropes, where they have ""cleverly"" (read ""annoyingly"" to anyone whose confidence in their own intelligence doesn't need to be reinforced by figuring out infuriatingly contrived puzzles) hidden things that seem like part of the backdrop, and make them necessary elements of gameplay.  There is also no instruction to guide you, and tell you things such as ""the further you drop onto an enemy, the further you bounce back up"", which is QUENTESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE for completing THE FIRST DAMN WORLD.  And while I understand that at least SOME people enjoy the point and click elements, because it makes them feel smart when they find them, I don't think anyone enjoys sitting around for two hours, trying to desperately realize things such as the long drop onto an enemy = high bounce.  That should be part of the game's nonexistent tutorial.Anyone who calls this ""fun"" probably just needs to see a shrink about their confidence in their own intelligence.  I can't possibly see why anyone would put up with the level of shenanigans this game brings, unless they DESPERATELY, PAINFULLY needed to feel better about how smart they were.Meanwhile, me and my friends, most of whom consider themselves intellectuals, found this game to be very dull and trite.  For all the internet hype around this game, nobody I personally know enjoyed it.  Just goes to show you, you buy enough good reviews from the right people, or get the right person as your fanboy, and you can have just all kinds of undeserved money and praise.			"

												Braid is an ugly, pretentious thing. As a game, it's a VERY standard (and probably sub-standard, given its length) platformer/puzzle game with some time gimmicks. The puzzles themselves mostly aren't very difficult, with more issues arising from implementing your solution rather than thinking it up due to the way it controls. If Braid were just about this, it'd be pretty okay for, say, an internet flash game. Graphically, the game is... not nearly as good as it is hyped up to be. Eye-wateringly bright colour palettes (world 3 is especially bad about this) and largely boring environments mark this as ugly and forgettable. Musically, for my taste nothing really stood out at all. Writing this after having just beaten the game, I'm already having trouble remembering most of the pieces.Where the game really starts to stink is its story, which is 90% delivered to you in horrible prose dumps. The writing in these is absolutely excruciating and later often only tangentially related to the levels you experience afterward. Video game 'academics' have stated that this game manages to meld story and gameplay: I fail to see it. At any rate, the provision of story via a gigantic ugly text dump at the beginning of a world is a major design disaster and, for me, a sign of the game being supremely self-conscious about presenting itself as an intellectual experience (it fails).Please, video games, stop trying to be 'art'.

To top that, it's pretty challenging, because you need to solve a lot of puzzles that reward you with puzzle pieces which you need for unlocking the final chapter, so don't think you can just run through every level.

												I have tried playing this game quite a number of times, but each time I end up quitting because of several reasons.- I despise the art style. This is purely a preference, but it drives me crazy. I also don't like the main character guy. I just don't.- I don't understand why there are enemies at all in the game. You literally can't lose no matter how many times you die, so why bother putting annoying enemies that add nothing to the game? I don't get it.- I have gotten stuck in spots where there is an enemy on top of a ladder, and it is the only way to move forward. The only way out is to quit the level.- I found the level selection area to be confusing and have no idea how it works at all.- The puzzle pieces don't add anything to the game. If I wanted to solve a very simple puzzle, I would get one of my little sister's.- A lot of the puzzles aren't solved by clever thinking, but instead by randomly moving backward and forward in time repeatedly until you get the timing exactly perfect to make a jump. This may be fun for some people, but i would prefer something more clever.			"

												Wouldn’t it be awesome if you had the power to cheat death and manipulate time to undo or redo your consequences? Braid offers just that with beautiful paint drawn visuals where you can manipulate the flow of time. At first you might say that the game feels a little like Super Mario but it is not. Each world has its own puzzle strategy on how you manipulate time because they’re all different from each other. The selection of music soundtrack that is used in this game is just brilliant. If you like platformer puzzle adventure game with an interesting plot story twist that will have you say “Holy crap! I didn’t see that coming!” then, you should really give Braid a shot.			"

First things first: The game mechanics are phenomenal, giving new time-travelling challenges and ways of solving puzzles that I never thought I’d see in a game. If you are looking for a heavy brain workout, look no further. This experience will stay with me for the longest time for sure (so much so that I unwittingly tried to rewind time in other games as well. *disappointed much* Which threw me back to a post-Life-is-Strange era). Even though this game has earned a huge thumbs up for me, it definitely has some drawbacks.Downsides: - The not-so-precise jumping controls and the timing of some puzzles can be a real pain. Sometimes you have a puzzle figured out pretty quickly… in theory. But you spend the next 10 minutes rewinding and dying, rewinding and dying like a maniac, getting a tiny bit more frustrated every single time. - I had heard great things about ‘the twist’ of the story. Well, after finishing the game and finding said twist I had to look up the meaning of it all. There can be many interpretations. - No explanations of the mechanics in all the worlds. This can be interpreted as a positive challenge however.Conclusion:Even though you can die hundreds of times in the game (and at the same time the game won’t ever let you really die), and some levels can be a drag, the good things most certainly outweigh the bad. The groundbreaking mechanics were all I needed to stamp this game as a massive success and I’m happy I took the gamble of checking it out. Le spoilers:Parts that I LOVED:  Creating a shadow version of myself, strangely giving some puzzles a co-op vibe :D Parts that I HATED:  Those green sparking little brown furball basterds stealing your keys. Or when you have to guide them to safety like a couple of suicidal ‘special’ lemmings. Or the key that just keeps escaping... if you’ve played the game you know the one. "

												I hate this game. I played all the way through it, just to realize that if you don't do something (wait 8 hours for a certain event) in the very beginning of the game, you don't get the right ending, nor the final achievement. If I could, I would return this game. I hate the fact that it's in my library.			"

												Just finished this.MIND=BLOWN.Don't look up spoilers.Besides that it's a platformer where you can rewind time. Mostly. There are a couple other neat things, too, all centered on time manipulation.Seriously, don't look up spoilers. My mind was so blown at the end in a good way.Heartily reccomended.And don't look up spoilers.			"

												A beautiful, deep, and intriguing game.  Simple mechanics are used throughout the game to solve increasingly difficult puzzles in a gorgeous landscape, all while delivering a cryptic, and ultimately thought-provoking story.  Who says a simple platforming puzzle game can't have a mind-blowing story?			"

												Wouldn’t it be awesome if you had the power to cheat death and manipulate time to undo or redo your consequences? Braid offers just that with beautiful paint drawn visuals where you can manipulate the flow of time. At first you might say that the game feels a little like Super Mario but it is not. Each world has its own puzzle strategy on how you manipulate time because they’re all different from each other. The selection of music soundtrack that is used in this game is just brilliant. If you like platformer puzzle adventure game with an interesting plot story twist that will have you say “Holy crap! I didn’t see that coming!” then, you should really give Braid a shot.			"

												Much deeper than initially meets the eye, especially if you have the patience to complete the game. The story is purposefully fragmented and vague but alludes to something else entirely if you are willing to delve into it. The puzzles are mostly well thought out and never felt too difficult, although if you are a completionist there is a whole additional layer.			"

It's a game I could show to academics, fathers, artists, teenagers, and they could all appreciate something in it. I respect it so much that this review was written to help the ""Positive"" percentage up to 95%, at which Steam will call the reception ""Overwhelmingly positive"". Because if any game deserves that, it's Braid... and a few others too.			"

												This game, to put it simply, caught my full attention the moment I started it and would not let me put it down until I reached the end. While it looks like a simple platformer with a few twists, Braid is truly a work of art with a powerful, riveting story that left me speechless accompanied by one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard for a game of this genre. If you're the sort who enjoys games crafted around a deep, hidden, purposely ambiguous meaning, then Braid is for you. I recommend it completely and fully.			"

The story is only hinted at and it's left up to you to decide how much you want to explore it and also how you interpret it. Braid is a beautiful game that is definitely worth playing.			"

												Gameplay 5/5: A Mario-inspired puzzle platformer with a rewind mechanic that changes enough from world to world to stay fresh, but always remains intuitive.  Creative puzzle design makes the most of the game mechanics to require both clever thinking and precision maneuvering.Art 2/2: Beautifully designed worlds, backgrounds with multiple layers of depth, and a score of gorgeous Celtic folk string compositions that distort along with time make this game atmospherically engaging as its gameplay.Story 1.25/2: The elements of the story are creative, but are divulged in an overwrought and cryptic manner that is more pretentious than poetic.Technical Support .25/1: Game is forced in 1280x720 fullscreen mode.  Supports XBox 360 controllers and keyboard, but   no support for other controllers or rebinding keys.  The keyboard controls also lose the unique buttons for using doors or the magic ring, making any workaround with Joy2Key or Xpadder imperfect.Total 8.5/10: Minor problems can't detract from what is one of the most beautiful indie games to date.  Highly recommended.			"

												A game with a somewhat confusing storyline and interesting puzzles. The levels are really well made and the gameplay is varied, allowing the player to rewind your actions and manipulate time to achieve incredible and really fun results.That said, it's a game to very pacient players who really like to think. Some puzzles are incredbly complicated, specially if you want to get all the collectables (it gives you a different ending). The stars are painful to get and you don't even know that there are stars to collect to begin with unless you're really, REALLY creative (or read a walkthrough, as I did). I don't have this pacience; I had to watch videos to be able to finish it. But if you're a puzzle fan, this game definitively deserves a shot.			"

												""Super mario meets Doctor who""This is my initial thought when I start to play this game. Braid is a platformer like many games, but with a gentle touch on the shift key you reverse the flow of time. This enables some really nifty features which is foundation for some really tough puzzles.  And I mean tough, becuse you can probably fix the tardis if you can solve them straight away. The game is divided into six worlds where each one adds a new mechanic to keep the gameplay refreshing.   Visually, it's like playing an oil painting. It's colorful and clear. Level parts and vackground mix together in a beautiful result.The soundtrack is brilliant. A calming crossover between folk and classical that sets your brain to a mysterious thinking mode.Epic and soothing, the music is also intgrated in the gameplay in a really smart way (time goes backwards, music plays backwards). So the verdict. Should you buy this? Well, the game is not perfect. Being somewhat short (playthrough around two to three hours) and having a limited replay value is some major setbacks but the good sides greatly makes up for the less perfect sides. Hey, if you want a great puzzle game that really tests your thinking, get this (or atleast consider buying it).    "

												This game is amazing it has those mind challenging puzzles that make you think. It is a creative game with nice graphics. Low end computers can play it so  that helps alot for those players who can only play platform games or have bad graphics cards. Has an amazing story line and good game play 10/10.			"

												I don't know where I saw this game but I must say, this is simply addicting. I was lucky to find this on sale for about 2.80 and it is WELL worth the price. You play as this man named Tim who has the ability to turn back time. It's a simple platformer but, with this mechanic, allows for easily fixed mistakes and interesting puzzles, untilizing this feature to the best of their abilities. Pick this up if you're a fan of puzzles or platformers, this little indie game is a must!			"

												I bought this game thinking that it would be a ""artsy"" platformer with some puzzles and time travel.It's a bit different than what I thought it would be like. For one, it's pretty much all about the puzzles, period.  Second, the time travel mechanic actually has a few limitations that are often enforced by the levels, so you'll often have to figure out how to beat the puzzle in the way the designer intended you to.  Few are the times where you can solve it in your own way.That said I'm still recommending it, because the puzzles become quite devious, yet fun to solve in the later stages.			"

												A beautiful game with a fun time-manipulation system. The game doesn't explain some of the more complex mechanics (holding shift to control the speed, for example), but is fairly easy to pick up. Tries a little too hard to be 'artsy', but succeeds in being enjoyable when it's not being frustrating. Isn't the indie-game second coming many people make it out to be, but I liked it. Reminded me of a prettier Seiklus, which is a good thing.			"

												Just like eurogamer said, it's a beautiful game. The soundtrack is amazing and I wish that I got that as well in the Humble Indie bundle. But don't let the pretty artwork, amazing music, and clever puzzles fool you: this game is hard. Often you have to come back to levels you simply can't get the puzzle pieces too and trying to make heads or tails of the story is near impossible unless you look into it more online. Not saying the story isn't interesting, it is, it's just...confusing at first.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The art, the music, and especially the narrative. In 2007 when Braid was first released on the Xbox store, it gained mass popularity, and I never really understood why, until now, after seeing the fantastic ending. Before seeing the ending, I thought it was okay, but not deserving the popularity it had. But the ending is a massive twist, and presented amazingly well. I won't spoil it, I urge you to play this game and see it for yourself. It is definitely worth finishing one of the most difficult puzzle games I have ever played for this ending. It's a great end to all the effort put in. Really.The game's controls were very creative, I loved being able to manipulate time. The controls (forgetting about the epic twist at the end) brought a lovely fresh of breath air to the cliche story of 'catch a princess'.The game is a puzzle-platformer, and it's puzzles were good. Extremely good. Each puzzle took me quite a while to finally solve, and they were each very clever. The layout of the levels makes it seem like they are easy to solve, but in reality, each level takes about 30+ minutes to solve each. Each world brought new game mechanics, and taught each mechanic very subtlely, and not in your face. Some of the puzzles were re used, but the change in game mechanics changed the re used levels almost completely. For example, there was a world 3 level used in world 6, but because of the different game mechanics, it was much, much harder to solve in world 6. Some people dislike the re-use of levels, but I, personally, liked it. I think it's cool to see how different game mechanics work on the same levels. Also, the reused levels were used as mechanic tutorials, making the player think ""Ahh! Well I've done this before, so I can do it again easily"", before realising that they can't solve the puzzle the same way due to different mechanics. As I said before, very clever.The games graphics and sound track were utterly beautiful. I love the comic book style the game has, it looks amazing. The classic music style matches the theme of the game perfectly. However, I would have prefered a couple visuals to go along with the storybook narration. I think the lack of visuals whilst being given a narrative is a turn-off for some people, myself included. This is a shame, since the story is sensational. I give this game a 8/10, missing two marks solely because of the lack of visuals during narration. Easily reccommended.			"

It has an inner logic which is apparent only if you ask the right questions. Even if you don't, the experience seems balanced and meaningful.

												What can I say about Braid! The only word I can think of, is amazing. Braid is a work of art, in terms of audio/visuals and story and level design. This game is truly the best Indy title in my opinion. You play as Tim, the main character trying to rescue his princess. To do so, you must collect puzzle pieces, which are scattered throughout the levels. Each level is a puzzle to solve, some are very easy in the early levels, and as you progress, elements are introduced that make it harder, such as controlling time, world objects, and whatnot. The audio is the best part aside from the visuals and story. The music is just so well done, audio effects are cute too. The visuals look like hand painted water color images, and animation is top notch. The developers really put their time and energy into making this game. There are many hidden things to discover, and to fully beat the game, will take some time because of the one element you collect (stars) can be SO HARD you might need a guide. I love this game, it is well worth the money and I keep playing it over and over. With speed runs, and pieces to collect, beautiful story and visuals and audio, Braid will captivate you.			"

												I remember looking this game up before buying it. The game, and seemingly its developer, takes itself way too seriously. The game, as well as its advertising, seemed to be full of the worst kind of indie pretension: the one that judges everything else to be crap, and seems to pass judgement on those who complacently consume said mediocrity. Braid touted itself as an experience in a league entirely of its own, that the big bad AAA titles could not touch.And, wouldn't you know it, as much as I hate to admit it, they were absolutely 100% right. Braid is in a league of its own. It makes almost every other puzzle game in existence seem cheap, insipid, repetitive, uninspired. I think it's most incredible feat is that, while it is far from easy by any means, it is neither complex nor is it frustrating. I've never seen another puzzle game achieve this most delicate of balances.Every puzzle is delightfully simple, requiring you to discover some novel new use of the mechanics you've learned so far. You are not expected to pick apart intricate constructions, and spam a few techniques you've applied dozens of times already until the solution falls out. No, for practically every puzzle in Braid, you will do something new, something you haven't yet considered. And when the solution does fall out, it's often beautiful, and you will feel AMAZING.Speaking of beauty, the whole game is extraordinarily beautiful. The music, the art, the story, the puzzles: all of them are exquisite. Looking at screenshots does not do the game's artwork justice, as the backgrounds shift and breathe in a most serene yet breathtaking manner.Basically, this game ends whatever remnants of the ""Are video games art?"" discussion. In every conceivable way, this game is a master-class in game design. Highly recommended.			"

												Braid, my favorite puzzler-platformer, and the game I think of when I try to remember how I stumbled upon Steam in the first place. [No... I didn't actually play it on steam, to be honest, I was in college and torrented the game(most likely illegally) and have since purchased it because it think it was worth way more to me than most of the crap titles I buy on here because of their low prices or the fact that they're in a humble bundle.]That was pointless info... anyway, the story is one of love and loss and time travel and although it lacks realism in its time traveling logic, it does so purposefully. It's fun without worrying so much about overbearing details in the storyline, perhaps because of the dreamlike tone of the game, and the art style choices for the rewind and overlapping abilities. Its extremely fun, I mean I beat the game 100% without even having the incentive of steam achievements, and I am tempted to play through again because of how easily the game coaxes the player from the opening scene to the end (and vice versa heheh) without feeling any lag or down points where one might think ""Eh, now's a good stopping point, i'll play it later.""Easily, this game was worth $10 to me, and although I hate absolution in practice, I have to give this game a 10/10. You could sit here and poke holes in it all day and none of your complaints would lower my experience with the game, i'm giving it a perfect score because there's nothing more or less I wanted out of it. Awesome story, awesome gameplay, awesome length, and awesome overall tone/experience.Overall: 10/10			"

The puzzles may be a bit challenging if you don't play puzzle games like me but 80% of them you should be able to figure out with no problems.

												On the surface, Braid is a simple puzzle platformer. The gameplay, at its most basic level, consists of jumping on platforms and collecting puzzle pieces before moving to the next world. A couple of things set Braid apart and make it a fantastic experience. The first is the visuals. Everything in Braid is hand drawn, and it's quite a pleasure to progress through the game and see the different landscapes. Second; the puzzles. The puzzles in the latter stages of the game are, to say the least, mind-bending. You will have difficulty getting through Braid without a walkthrough for at least a couple of levels. Braid is best played in short burts; play for too long and the harder puzzles get frustrating. The puzzles themselves are brilliantly designed and are very satisfying to solve. The main gimmick of Braid is the ability to manipulate (reverse) time. It adds another dimension to puzzle solving and forces you to think about puzzles in abstract ways. Truthfully, Braid isn't for everyone, but it offers a unique gameplay experience for the puzzler fan.			"

												The game is just like PVR like the author said in Indie Game: The Movie, that's one of the reason I liked the game, also you can have multiple ways to get the puzzle pieces. But the main reason why I'm very enjoy of this game is because of the music, and if you turn the time backward you'll listen them in special way. This is just, awesome. 9/10			"

												Braid its a game with a nice story that makes you think about yourself, there are themes like Sorrow, Regret, Forgiveness and Force of will. The bad part about it's story in my point, is the endding that's almost impossible for you to understand if you don't read about it online. The gameplay part it surpriseling fun, the backward rewind mechanic that changes in every level (that helps making the game change since there aren't many enemies you change the way you interact with time) makes the game both challenging and fun. The art in it it's quite beautiful also, the soundtrack is kind of nice, i don't like much the desing of the enemies, but overall it's  good game worth buying.			"

												Braid most certainly is an interesting game, but an artsy fartsy one at that. While I personally don't think the music and story are as gripping as others think, the gameplay sells it. Admittely it has a lot of flaws with hints, as in it gives none. Stuck on a way to get a piece? To bad, try harder. Other than some confusing points, Braid is a clever game but by what standards is a matter of perception. If your a fan of puzzles, braid would certainly be for you. If your not? Wait for a sale.

												Braid is a brilliant and innovative 2D puzzle platformer.The main character has the power to rewind time and this is used in novel ways in almost all the puzzles. Additionally, each world has a unique mechanic that alters the gameplay in one way or another.The puzzles themselves are typically quite clever and well-designed. The first few worlds are reasonably easy, but the difficulty ramps up pretty quickly and by the end of the game you are facing puzzles that feel nearly impossible until you figure them out.The hand-drawn art is gorgeous and the beautiful soundtrack is a great fit for the game too. The only thing I didn't particularly like was the rather pretentious story.Overall Braid is one of the best puzzle games ever made and easy to recommend to any fans of the genre. However, the game does have some rather difficult puzzles, so if you are not very good at puzzle solving Braid can get rather tedious and frustrating.I did get stuck on a couple of puzzles for a while, but in general the difficulty level was pretty much spot on for me.The good:- Innovative time manipulation mechanics- Clever and well-designed puzzles- Gorgeous hand-drawn art- Nice soundtrack- Good level of challengeThe bad:- Pretentious story and writing			"

												Braid is a puzzle platformer.You play as Tim, a guy attempting to rescue his princess from a monster. You explore 6 worlds, each with several levels filled with puzzles. You solve puzzles using a time manipulation mechanics, which are enhanced the further you go in the game. Levels also feature hidden collectibles which unlock more of the story.The puzzles are clever and really engaging. It is so fulfilling when you finally figure out what it is you need to do. I think that the puzzles are made to be engaging but not so obscure that you will never work out the answer without help...although that is my opinion.The levels themselves look so beautiful and gorgeous...I have actually spent time just waltzing through the levels alone and admiring the art and music.The game seems to draw on many aspects of gaming and comes into its own when you look at the game and its plot from a philosophical standpoint. It really makes you think and encourages you to do so.Replayability is limited though...even with the beautiful art and music. Once you complete the levels, find the hidden collctibles and see the ending, there isn't much to keep doing. The time trials extend replayability slightly, but not everyone likes time trials.Despite this, I still think this is a game worth getting and playing for any gamer.			"

												This game has a lot going for it-- a deep story, pretty graphics, some of the best music, and great gameplay.The story is not at all forced. There are several books lined up at the start of each world, and you can just run right past them without even reading them if you like. However, if you go deeper, you discover just how thorough the story is. Check the internet if you can't figure it out, because I don't want to spoil it. It'll blow your mind.The game allows you to rewind time, so even if you fall to your death, you can undo it. It allows you to mess up and know you messed up, but then it doesn't take away the last five minutes of your life by making you redo the level and re-obtain what you got. That's a daring move, but it works for a game like this.Braid is an experience. There are few games that aren't just fun but also artistic and mind-blowing. Braid is the few.			"

												A short classic indie side-scroller platform/puzzle game. I typically find side-scrollers too strenous, but this one really hit the correct balance of challenge and forgiveness. The story is nice enough, but I really enjoyed the puzzle aspect more which relies on playing with the passage of time. Even after completing the main storyline you can go back and collect puzzle pieces to open up and understand more of the plot - though be advised that it was designed to be an open ended device so don't expect resolution. I would NOT recommend this game if: 1) An open-ended/interpretative story/ending is frustrating to you. 2) You are looking for a hardcore/bulletstorm-type of side-scroller.			"

												[10/10]Braid is a puzzle-platformer with a great story. The puzzles are unique, combining platforming with the ability to rewind, making puzzles difficult, but not unfair. The art style is some of the best I've ever seen in a video game. Its story is something that can only be eperienced through playing it for yourself.			"

												An old Cherokee sits down with his grandson to ruminate on life. THe young boy looks up from his smartphone and says, ""Grandpa, there are two metaphors for modern humanity's virtualization, one is as follows:--------AN old projectionist was talking with a protege, watching the film tick past the lamp during a late screening.""In your mind there are two reels. The first is a film of pleasure, love and grace.  THe other is the sadness and loss in the world. Both are fighting to be digitized before they fall apart. """" But sir, which one gets saved?""""The one you feed.""--------The other goes like this:--------A young startup CEO talks with his mentor venture capitalist over coffee .""There are two social networks at war within the human body"", says the mentor, ""the nervous system which makes you fear people , and the reproductive system that makes you do them. Life is the app that reads the updates.""""But sir, then what are we?""""THe feed who won.""--------The old Cherokee turns to his grandson, "" But child, which is best?""""The one you read.""			"

												Braid is a fun adventure/puzzle game that while you play you collect puzzle pieces that reveal the story. Over time it slowly gets harder for you to wrap your brain around the puzzles(and story) and might leave you clueless at some stages.Gameplay wise it's clever and the watercolor based art is nice. In the game you scroll back and forth in time to pull levers and collect keys that let you collect puzzle pieces and piece them together to reveal past memories.Cons:Art assets heavily inspired by MarioPros:Unique puzzle MechanicsWatercolor looks nice.

												While pretentious at times, Braid still has what any great puzzle-platformer should have; a unique concept, built upon with new mechanics in each stage that give you new challenges that make you think hard and satisfy you greatly when you finally figure them out. In addition, it's a beautiful game, with gorgeous art, an excellent soundtrack, and, despite it's pretentiousness, a really thought-provoking and engaging story, particularly during the final level. An excellent game that everyone should experience.Score: 8.5/10			"

												The game is very well made and will challenge you to think differently about how you play a platformer and about how you think of time. The art style is this games stongest element. Every single frame is pretty enough to hang on a wall. You will have fun playing this game and its so beautiful that your eyes will bleed rain bows.The ""story"" however is another matter. Many of the other reviews talk about how deep the story is, im wondering what story that is because i didn't really notice much of a story at all. Other than a general sense of guilt and how nice it would be to undo mistake the narrative doesn't really give you much. MAny critics have praised how many interpritations there are to the narrative, real watercooler type discussions, but i cant help bu feel that the only reason this game has so many interpritations is because the game never tells you what its about, you need to fill in the very large story blanks with your own imaginaiton and interpritaiton.

												I'm very late to the party when it comes to reviewing Braid, but nonetheless, here we go.Braid is a very interesting puzzle/platformer, in which you can control the flow of time. This means that you can change if you're going forwards or backwards on the stage with the flow of time itself. I'm not too good at explaining it, but this is something you'll be able to experience by playing the game. The controls are simple: Left, Right, Space (Jump) and Shift (time control). Because the controls are simple, a lot of work has been put into the puzzles and the levels, which were a pleasure to play through.In terms of art style, Braid feels very hand drawn, but professionally so, and is total eye-candy (probably why I died a few times to the enemies). As for the soundtrack, it's ear-candy. Basically, this game is candy, which you can't eat, otherwise you'd break your laptop or computer.Figuring out the puzzles can be a little challenging at first, and admittedly I got frustrated at them, so maybe an option for hints would have been nice, but I understand why this wasn't included. I can't really say too much else about the game to be honest (at least not without spoiling it) so I'll leave it there.Braid gets a 9/10 from me, and if you haven't already, play this game.			"

												A simple platformer that quickly un-simplifies itself. You control Tim and you run and jump through beutiful 2D levels. What seperates this from other platformers is the time mechanics. Every level has a different time related power you must utilize to pass. One level whas you rewinding time, one has time moving forward or backwards depending on what direction you're running. A thinker's game, and one with a grand plo hidden within for those who read into every metaphor. It is proven this game causes your IQ to raise by 800 points. So yeah.			"

												Irrespective of what your preconceived notions are of Braid, it is one of the best puzzle adventures you will ever play. The mind melting puzzles are very challenging at times, and keep you constantly changing the way you approach them.  The diverse puzzles are filet mignon, and the gorgeous environments and sweeping score are the fine wine. The backgrounds pulse and shimmer as if they were alive, and it is all underscored by relaxing violin pieces. But all this wasn't what impressed me the most, no. What really made me fall in love with this game is the incredibly thought provoking storyline. What if all you fought and strived for was turned against you? What would you do and how would you feel? The story of Tim trying to save the princess is a metaphor for something much, much deeper. When I finished the final puzzle and saw the ending it blew me away. Simply amazing. This is not an action game, so if you're looking to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up this isn't for you. I've gushed enough! 10/10			"

												So, the way I found out about this game is that a hipster friend of mine got very very drunk a couple of years back and told me I just HAD to download this on PSN. I never took him for the gamer type, and to humor his drunk opinion I figured why not. I wasn't disappointed.Now here's the thing. This game isn't challenging. At all. It's pretty reasonable to be able to see all of the content on your first play through. There are some pretty clever spots that might stick folks for a little bit, but this game is in no way difficult.This is a beauty to see though. The story and the art direction are what make this game worth having in your collection. The game play is puzzle Mario-ish at best, but the attention to detail is what will stick with you after playing this.If you're looking for something calm and purposeful inbetween alien/zombie gore fests, this could be right up your alley. I would say that the story is something better appreicated by some one with some years on them. Probably 25 plus. It's not inappropriate for a younger audience, it's just the kind of plot that is more impactful if the player has had a good number of experiences in life.			"

												Braid is a great game for the money. Braid contains a different variety of challenging puzzles which can make your brain melt, the game contains time elements so you can go back to the past and do something different to what you did previously which adds so many more elements to the game. Braid's graphics are retro, but in a good way giving it a Mario like feel. The only issue I have with Braid is that it's very easy to just run through the game without solving the puzzles which are the most difficult and gives you far less motivation to complete them when you know that you can just skip them.If you enjoy puzzles and want to try something different from the usual, Braid just may be the game for you.

												On the surface, Braid is a simple puzzle platformer. The gameplay, at its most basic level, consists of jumping on platforms and collecting puzzle pieces before moving to the next world. A couple of things set Braid apart and make it a fantastic experience. The first is the visuals. Everything in Braid is hand drawn, and it's quite a pleasure to progress through the game and see the different landscapes. Second; the puzzles. The puzzles in the latter stages of the game are, to say the least, mind-bending. You will have difficulty getting through Braid without a walkthrough for at least a couple of levels. Braid is best played in short burts; play for too long and the harder puzzles get frustrating. The puzzles themselves are brilliantly designed and are very satisfying to solve. The main gimmick of Braid is the ability to manipulate (reverse) time. It adds another dimension to puzzle solving and forces you to think about puzzles in abstract ways. Truthfully, Braid isn't for everyone, but it offers a unique gameplay experience for the puzzler fan.			"

												Braid is a perfect example of how to take something good and make it better. The classic platformer has been around since before Super Mario Bros., and Number None has made their own wonderfully puzzling take on the genre. Braid will make you think in ways you would never expect. In each section of the game you play with time as you platform, and in each section there is a new obstacle/method to master. The story is intruiging as it is mysterious, the gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and the mechanics are mind-bending in the best way possible. Braid is a new take on an old classic and it deserves its spot as a treasure amidst Indie games. It may not provide the same experience that a AAA title may be able to achieve, but it more than makes up for any lack of fancy graphics and massive world with its creativity and uniqueness. Try out Braid if you want a challenge, just make sure you prepare to be surprised.			"

While the game's writing can at times come off as pretentious, none of it is enough to take away from the fastinating puzzles or beautiful animation.

												This is one of the most complex yet seemingly simple platforming puzzle games I've ever played. The non-linear gameplay mechanics are rather unique, and made this experience one to remember. On the surface, 'Braid' seems like a relatively straight forward Mario knock-off with an art house vibe, but as you delve further into this brilliant game, the vibrant visuals and moving music convey an emotional theme with deeper meaning than you initially realize. There is a story at work, told in interactive metaphor, but you have to play it for yourself to fully understand.			"

												Pretty incredible experience packed into a compact game. The focus, and the reward, is how the story itself is told simultaneously by reading through pages on-screen as well as discovering time-bending gameplay mechanics. You might think ""Oh I've played with rewind features in Prince of Persia"", but Braid is at its best when you as the user step back and wonder what it really means to rewind time. Are all thing turned back perfectly, giving you a second chance, or maybe somethings are outside of your control. Perhaps a mere shadow of yourself survives, or are you the shadow of a now future self? Maybe you shouldn't have tried messing with time in the first place.9/10			"

												Starting positively, there's nice music and really creative art. Also, the integration of puzzles, mechanic, and storytelling are really novel.All that said, gameplay boils down to the ""guess what the developer was thinking"" kind of puzzle that can only be beaten by either looking up the solution or experimenting wildly until something clicks - neither of which is a puzzle game that I enjoy. Moreover, the ""rewind"" mechanic gets really annoying really quickly - especially given that it's a ""feature"" and fundamental to solving so many of these utterly counter-intuitive puzzles.If you like the ""guess until you give up or stumble onto a solution"" kind of game, enjoy. Otherwise, look elsewhere.			"

												As far as puzzle platformers go this game is very competent if a little frustrating at times but in a good way.  Me, I love lateral thinking problems, riddles, and puzzles so I couldn't wait to try it; plus the artsy style of the game was a refreshing world to be in for a while.  However, the music and sound will become annoying over time and combined with the annoying enemies WILL produce headaches.  So, just turn on your MP3 player and you're good to go.  If you want something to tie you over until Portal 2 then check it out.  It's been a while since anything has made me think this hard to the point that my brain actually felt tired by the end of the day.  I really enjoyed it, but I'm the kind of person who thinks sitting on my bed on a Friday night brainstorming ideas for puzzles and traps for a D&D dungeon is a wild Friday night.

												This is the definitive puzzle game of the modern times. At the same time nostalgic and something you've never played before. The best thing about Braid is that it actually changes the way you think as the game progresses. Bit by bit the tweaking of time and the problems that come with it start to feel more and more intuitive and you get many moments where you get this strong sense of ""heureka, I got it!"". Very enjoyable and rewarding experience. In this sense Braid reminds me a lot of Portal series which I can also recommend. If you are into logic puzzles and are not afraid of challenges, you should give Braid a chance. Most likely you won't be disappointed.			"

												Braid its a game with a nice story that makes you think about yourself, there are themes like Sorrow, Regret, Forgiveness and Force of will. The bad part about it's story in my point, is the endding that's almost impossible for you to understand if you don't read about it online. The gameplay part it surpriseling fun, the backward rewind mechanic that changes in every level (that helps making the game change since there aren't many enemies you change the way you interact with time) makes the game both challenging and fun. The art in it it's quite beautiful also, the soundtrack is kind of nice, i don't like much the desing of the enemies, but overall it's  good game worth buying.			"

												Braid is an astonishing love letter to the medium of videogames.  It simultaneously resituates the Mario-style 2D platformer and challenges genre conventions with contemporary takes of common tropes like ""dying"" and ""lives"" and so on.The art is gorgeous and vibrant, and the occasional personal background touch or oddly out-of-place applique lend an air of legitimacy to the title, preventing it from being a by-the-numbers tileset of levels.  The music is pulled from varying classically-trained artists and perfectly juxtaposes the peaceful, but engaging gameplay.At its heart, the puzzle-platforming is brought to perfection, with mechanics that are devious as well as delightful.  You will use your brain.  You will hurt your brain.  And at the end of it all, you'll walk away from an adventure that will leave you in awe.			"

I was surprised at how polished this game looks and plays. This is an excellent example as to how an indie game should be and there have been many since that have followed this example. I love platformer's that introduce environment altering elements that allow for a huge variety of puzzles rather then it just being another run and jump platformer. The puzzles in this game are so complicated it makes my brain hurt! I admit I became stuck and have not yet gone back to this game to try again.			"

												Braid is a great puzzle game which makes you change your style after every world you complete. Although Mario-like in design with the use of similar AI, jumping on heads to kill and the infamous (princess in a different castle) line being re-used; it feels like a completely unique and separate game.  The reverse time feature in the game is the best asset/game function featured in the release which can equally save you time or hinder your progress. Either way this homage to a classic is nothing sort of beautiful, unique and relaxing. 8.5/10			"

												For a tenner on Steam, I downloaded Braid and set about discovering the most challenging platform game I’ve come across so far.  Despite no puzzle piece eluding me for more than a few hours, I call it the most challenging because, not only is the process of completing it a good challenge, but the story itself is mostly abstract.  Until we reach what seems to be the end, at least.  That feeling of revelation is rare – I’d recommend it to anyone.  The gameplay will twist your mind in places and if you hunt the stars without assistance, you'll feel like a king.  If you like movies that challenge you, and want something a bit different, get this.			"

It's not too long, it can be frustratingly difficult, but it's a puzzle game, you don't want easy.The time manipulation mechanics in this game are superbly thought out and put to good use. It's rare to see a game develop a relatively original concept, stretch it to its limits, and build a game around it so beautifully. Add to that a soundtrack that is delightful and fresh, a rather bizarre storyline (which, to be honest, is not the driver in the game), and you have a good few hours of fun and enjoyment.

												Braid is an incredibly hyped game, and one of the few that I think really deserves it. This game was revolutionary in its time.Braid is a basic puzzle/platformer with an interesting philosophy: instead of punishing players for making mistakes, reward them for the lessons they learn. You get a variety of time-based powers, the most basic of which is to reverse time, allowing you to undo any bad move. But, this concept is explored very creatively. In one world, time is reversed by moving left and moves forward when you move right. In another, you can slow time down, but only for certain parts of the screen.Some of the puzzles are very hard. I remember using a walkthrough for one or two of them.Braid's story is an interesting metaphor that is delivered very well. It starts with a Mario-esque story, but the metaphor's depth is revealed by the end. The art and music are lovely.Absolutely worth it for $10.			"

It involves time manipulation and challenges you to think in new ways to predict the consequences of manipulating time in various ways and use this ability to achieve your goals. It starts out easy and the difficulty ramps up at a good pace. Towards the end the game is challenging even for experienced puzzle solvers. The game is also non-linear in that you don't need to solve everything in one part of the game to progress to later parts, if you get stuck on a puzzle you can go somewhere else and come back to tackle that puzzle later.The game has an artistic style that feels completely natural and fits well with the unique style of the gameplay. Graphics and sound contribute further to make the game atmospheric. The story is told in various ways, including texts you can read at the start of each level but also, in a way, through the pictures that you need to assemble to complete a level.All in all this is the best puzzle platformer I have played (unless you count Portal as a 3D puzzle platformer) and highly recommended to anyone who likes puzzle games.

It makes Portal seem like a walk in the park. Its similer to Anitchamber but is more difficult. You truely have ot think outside of the box to solve the later puzzles. If you are into puzzle games or platformers you will love this game. 11/10 would buy again.			"

												Braid is.. well. It's hard to describe. Mechanics wise, it's a simple platformer with an interesting gimmick. You can rewind time. The game takes place across six worlds, each with its own additional time manipulating mechanic. Some of the levels can get pretty tough, and I ended up resorting to a walkthrough to solve at least two of the levels (I'm not proud). Braid's a neat little game with a really cool soundtrack, but much of Braid is best explained through experience. Try it out. You might like it. The game took me about 5 hours to complete, and offered a good amount of content for the price. Overall, I'd give it a 8/10.(Note: I got the game on sale for about $1.50. I wouldn't pay more than three bucks for this, but I'm cheap. Get it on a sale. You'll like it.)			"

												Braid is my gold standard for puzzle design in video games. It introduces a simple concept - most of the puzzles in Braid revolve around time manipulation. You have control of a character and also control over of the flow of time in that character's world. It throws a few puzzles at you that require understanding of these concepts. It starts simple and then elaborates. Each stage tests your understanding of the previous stage's mechanics and also adds in a new layer of complexity. As an avid gamer, as a programmer, and especially as a fan of puzzle games, I'm usually able to learn and understand game systems very quickly. In most puzzle games, it's usually fairly easy for me to figure out where the game wants me to go, what it wants me to do and how I'm supposed to do it. There were a few puzzles in Braid where I just stared at the TV screen for minutes, just trying to comprehend the complex game systems that were being layered to create Braid's sublime puzzles. Braid's puzzles are completely mind bending, but in the best way. It feels great when a solution clicks and you finally figure out what you're supposed to do. And it boggles my mind even more to think how the developer came up with these puzzles.Braid's levels are divided up into 5 short worlds. Each world introduces and elaborates on a new puzzle solving mechanic. For instance the first world, which is labeled world 2 for some reason, simply introduces character movement and the rewind time mechanic. You can move left and right on a 2d plane and jump just like a platformer. Then it teaches you that you can rewind time to undo your actions Prince of Persia style. This can of course be used to cheat death and undo platforming mistakes you make. You'll need to collect all of the puzzle pieces in each world to unlock final world in Braid. Puzzle pieces are always obviously placed, but difficult to obtain. They are frequently placed behind locked doors or put up high in the air and its up to the player to figure out how to obtain them, which requires a good understanding of the game's time mechanics. A heads up though - the first world is home to my least favorite puzzle in the game. Anyone who has played Braid before knows the one I'm talking about. The solution is kind of ridiculous and out of place with the rest of Braid's excellent puzzle design. You're not wrong for looking up the solution for how to get all of the first world's puzzle pieces.The second world introduces objects that have a green glow on their outline. With these objects, their physical position and movement is completely unaffected by the flow of time. This concept can be trickier than you would think. In the third world, the flow of time is directly tied to your character's physical position. As you move forward, time advances. As you walk backward, time rewinds. This idea is then combined with the second world's mechanics to create some really mind bending puzzles. The fourth and fifth worlds are similar, both introducing new mechanics and combining them with concepts from previous worlds. The fifth world especially is home to some really excellent and difficult problems.Where Braid falters a bit is with its story. It's presented by reading short bits of text that are found before each level. The narrative feels very abstract and artsy. There's not a clear sense of who the main character is or what he's struggling with. There's something about the main character and a princess he's in love with or used to be in love with or something, I don't know. It's so unclear and ""open to interpretation"". I still can't decide if the ending to this game makes any sense or not. I kind of don't think it does. It feels like the developer may have had some message or theme he wanted to communicate to the player, but Braid failed to connect with me on a narrative level.Overall though, Braid is a good demonstration of excellent game and puzzle design. Aside from that one stupid puzzle in the first world, I've never been so impressed by creative ideas mixed with well thought out design. It's a bit short and the story is kind of nonsense, but Braid more than makes up for that with its sublime puzzles. If you like these types of problem solving games, Braid is absolutely a must play. The Witness, Jonathan Blow's next game, should be out in the coming months. It's definitely my most anticipated game of 2014 and I'm hopeful it'll be as well made as Braid. Expect a post on it later this year.For more video game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												On the surface, Braid is a simple puzzle platformer. The gameplay, at its most basic level, consists of jumping on platforms and collecting puzzle pieces before moving to the next world. A couple of things set Braid apart and make it a fantastic experience. The first is the visuals. Everything in Braid is hand drawn, and it's quite a pleasure to progress through the game and see the different landscapes. Second; the puzzles. The puzzles in the latter stages of the game are, to say the least, mind-bending. You will have difficulty getting through Braid without a walkthrough for at least a couple of levels. Braid is best played in short burts; play for too long and the harder puzzles get frustrating. The puzzles themselves are brilliantly designed and are very satisfying to solve. The main gimmick of Braid is the ability to manipulate (reverse) time. It adds another dimension to puzzle solving and forces you to think about puzzles in abstract ways. Truthfully, Braid isn't for everyone, but it offers a unique gameplay experience for the puzzler fan.			"

												Braid is a perfect example of how to take something good and make it better. The classic platformer has been around since before Super Mario Bros., and Number None has made their own wonderfully puzzling take on the genre. Braid will make you think in ways you would never expect. In each section of the game you play with time as you platform, and in each section there is a new obstacle/method to master. The story is intruiging as it is mysterious, the gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and the mechanics are mind-bending in the best way possible. Braid is a new take on an old classic and it deserves its spot as a treasure amidst Indie games. It may not provide the same experience that a AAA title may be able to achieve, but it more than makes up for any lack of fancy graphics and massive world with its creativity and uniqueness. Try out Braid if you want a challenge, just make sure you prepare to be surprised.			"

												As far as puzzle platformers go this game is very competent if a little frustrating at times but in a good way.  Me, I love lateral thinking problems, riddles, and puzzles so I couldn't wait to try it; plus the artsy style of the game was a refreshing world to be in for a while.  However, the music and sound will become annoying over time and combined with the annoying enemies WILL produce headaches.  So, just turn on your MP3 player and you're good to go.  If you want something to tie you over until Portal 2 then check it out.  It's been a while since anything has made me think this hard to the point that my brain actually felt tired by the end of the day.  I really enjoyed it, but I'm the kind of person who thinks sitting on my bed on a Friday night brainstorming ideas for puzzles and traps for a D&D dungeon is a wild Friday night.  For hardcore puzzle gamers only.			"

												Foi o primeiro indie game que joguei e realemente foi o jogo que me fez começar a apreciar ""o mundo dos indie games"". Uma mistura de filosofias com quebra-cabeças e uma mecânica impecável que brinca com o tempo. Vale a pena fechar o game sem dar aquelas espiada nas soluções no youtube, hehe.			"

												Starting positively, there's nice music and really creative art. Also, the integration of puzzles, mechanic, and storytelling are really novel.All that said, gameplay boils down to the ""guess what the developer was thinking"" kind of puzzle that can only be beaten by either looking up the solution or experimenting wildly until something clicks - neither of which is a puzzle game that I enjoy. Moreover, the ""rewind"" mechanic gets really annoying really quickly - especially given that it's a ""feature"" and fundamental to solving so many of these utterly counter-intuitive puzzles.If you like the ""guess until you give up or stumble onto a solution"" kind of game, enjoy. Otherwise, look elsewhere.			"

												A game like no other, Braid is by far the most brilliantly crafted video game I've ever played. This game defines the puzzle-platform genre. It is a masterpiece. In my opinion, it does everything a video game should do: It causes you to think in a unique way. It challenges your mind without frustrating you too much. It combines beautiful art and design with distinctive gameplay to give you a breath-taking experience--Braid is a journey I won't soon forget.			"

												Braid is a good game. Mechanics and story work together give an interesting experience for the player. When people say Braid is a good example of game design they usually talk about the hand painted sprites, which is completely missing the point.I find the story itself less interesting than most people. It's not very open to interpretation, you either get what he really meant to say or you're left with something that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.The puzzles are hard! Don't get me wrong, I love a puzzle game with a good challenge. I'm used to play puzzle games that I can solve with my eyes closed, but Braid occasionally gives you puzzles with questionable solutions, that exploit mechanics you didn't know were there and thing like that.So this is a must play, in my opinion. Play it! PLAY IT! But don't hesitate to look up the solution if you're stuck, as it might be one of those puzzles that you look and say ""this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! how was I supposed yo know you can do that?"" and are not worth your time :P			"

												If Braid is in your backlog and you're looking for something to do on Saturday afternoon, give it a playthrough.  It will only take a few hours and you won't regret a moment of it.+ Gameplay - Interesting mechanics executed well.  The game just feels good to play.  I enjoyed it so much that I played through the game a few times so that I could earn the Speed Run achievement.+ Art - Crisp sprites and nice backgrounds.  Fun sound effects.  This 6 year old game feels like it could have been released today.+ Music - A calming soundtrack that doesn't get old or annoying as you figure out each level.  The music follows the same timeline as your character (e.g. turn back time and the music plays backwards; speed up time and the music speeds up) which is a great touch that helps with immersion.  The string-heavy soundtrack lends itself well to such temporal manipulations.+ Level design - Every level feels fresh and interesting.  Some levels are repeated across worlds, but adapated slightly to the unique mechanic of each world.  You might get frustrated once or twice, but every puzzle has a clean and fair solution.+ Length - Braid feels like the perfect length.  It took me about four hours to complete the first time around and I was satisfied by the depth to which the various mechanics were explored.  It's a nice, bite-sized game.~ Story - Told through a few short bits of text, the story is not at the forefront of this game.  There is likely symbolism that ties the mechanics of the game to the story, but it isn't really made obvious to the player. "

												To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: For the most part this review is going to be something of a retrospective,  as most anyone reading this will already know what Braid's gameplay entails. If you don't, however, here's a brief explanation: this game is a puzzle-platformer in which you can reverse time, and use various gimmicks in tandem with the time control in order to solve puzzles. Your controls are (on the 360 controller) analog stick/D-Pad to move, A to Jump, X to reverse time, and that's pretty much it until World 6 in which they add another gimmick.Now for the retrospective: this is one of the many games that I never actually got around to playing when it was new, so I'm able to go into the game without any presumptions of the quality of the game. Basically, this review is for those who are wondering how well the game holds up to this day. I can confidently say that, given the deluge of puzzle platformers spurred on by games like this, that this game holds up quite well. There weren't really any dumb puzzles that required an obscene amount of platforming precision, the difficulty curve of the puzzles was good enough to make the solution not always obvious, but never so obscure that it gets frustrating, and the puzzle pieces within the stages were all pretty fun to get. One thing that may be a bit bothersome is that the game does expect you to find out the mechanics of the gimmicks for yourself, which I know is annoying for some people playing the game (for example, you can boost enemies upwards by jumping into them from beneath, but the game never tells you about this and it is required for 100%), but I never had too much of an issue with it.To be honest, the most disappointing thing about this game is its length: the game only took me three and a half hours to beat, and that was all in one sitting. I would have liked to have seen a level editor for this game, as I think there is quite a lot of room for elements of the various gimmicks to be explored. However, at the very least the game doesn't overstay its welcome, and after beating it I do feel somewhat satisfied with my time. For me, this wasn't exactly a puzzle game that blew my socks off, but it is a fun, simple, relaxing puzzle platformer, and for some that's all you really want. 8/10.Story: It's difficult to talk about this game's story, because there both is and isn't a story. There is a story in that there is a semi-coherent chain of events that you as  the protagonist go through, but at the same time there isn't, as there really is no conclusive ending. I will say that the last level of the game does serve as a surprisingly effective setpiece with which the game ends on, albeit not necessarily an ending. Still though, given the vague allusions throughout the game, the final level does come as something of a twist, and a fairly good one at that. There are various interpretations on the Internet for the actual circumstances of the plot, but going off of just what's in here, I'll give the game a 8/10 for a good, although short story.Graphics: I'll just get the technical stuff out of the way: if your computer doesn't run this game, I feel bad for you because you may actually be using my old garbage Dell Dimension E310 that could hardly run XP with an anti-virus installed. I'd recommend that when the game launches you change the screen size to your resolution, as leaving it on Auto puts it to 1280x720. Anyways, all that aside, the game is simply gorgeous. The environments never stop being beautiful, the sprites are very well animated, and there's just a lot of detail here. Excellent quality through and through on the graphics front. 5/5.Sound: The OST is very much inspired by classical music of the 16th/17th century, so if you're really into that sorta thing then you'll have a great time with the soundtrack. For me, the soundtrack provided a nice backdrop to the game itself, but I do find myself having a bit of a tough time remembering any of the songs from the game, even after having just played it. This may just be a thing with me, but nothing on the OST really stood out to me. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to talk about here. 3/5.Overall scores are: 8/8/5/3; cumulative score of 8.0/10. I'd say that this game still holds up quite well to this day; however, I don't necessarily think it's as amazing as some people are making it out to be. Then again, I may be an uncultured pleb or something i dunno			"

The controls are solid, the puzzles are excellent, and gameplay is almost perfectly balanced in every way. The only thing that could make this better is a custom level editor. 10/10 "

												Ever heard any of your hardcore-gamer friends talk about the creativity and weirdness of Indie games, how they're a bastion of gaming?  Ever heard them talk about the diamonds in the rough, the hidden gems on steam that make one have hope for the future of gaming amongst the midst of awful DLC practices and DRM problems?Braid is the game they're talking about.

												An ABSOLUTE masterpiece. This is a puzzle platformer with incredible artwork, a delightful soundtrack, and an amazing storyline. The puzzles are perfectly put together and are VERY well done and creative, I can't even begin to imagine how someone would come up with most of these puzzles. Throughout the game you're given different powers, whether they can slow down time in a specific region, or rewind the world, they are given to you at perfect points throughout your adventure to keep you interested, and are incorporated into each puzzle professionally. Braid was an absolute delight to play through, and there's no reason why it should ever not be recommended: I honestly cannot find any flaws in it's design. People that rate Braid bad probably aren't that good at puzzle games or got fed up with it. I know there were a few points where I felt like giving up because some puzzles aren't obvious in the slightest, but when comparing Braid to other games of the puzzle platformer genre, it is clearly the king. The storyline is told by text for the most part, and a few cinematic-like scenes. The ending is breathtaking, and I HIGHLY recommend Braid above even most triple-A production quality games. The sincerity and heart put into Braid is incredible, and you can feel it radiating with every step you take. I can't recommend Braid highly enough, I think it's an experience any gamer should partake in. The asking price of $9.99 is very fair, as Braid is lovingly crafted and has a very good playtime given it's genre. I don't give out many near-10's. Only about five so far and I've played hundreds of games. Braid deserves this score, as it's flawless and is up there in my top 10 games of all time, as well as being near the pinnacle of my favorite gaming experiences.9.8/10			"

												One of my favorite puzzle platformers. Very clever use of time. Levels are grouped together and each group of levels will introduce a new mechanic. Some levels require a lot of thinking. One of the few puzzler-based games that I would return to every few months to see if I could finally figure out levels I was stuck on. Perhaps the not very interesting story is a benefit as I am not tempted to search the Internet for solutions to challenging levels in order to progress the story. Clearing tough levels is very satisfying.When new mechanics are introduced, the game does a good job increasing the difficulty level to level, easing you along until you come across a brain teaser.

												Braid ReviewBraid is the story of a guy named Tim. That is as much as I can remember from the story, seeing it had very little to do with the game.GAMEPLAY- As Tim you have the power to run, jump, climb, and control time. If you couldn’t tell the game heavily focuses on time control aspect. This sounds like a good mechanic for a game. In this case, the time puzzles come off are more annoying than they are fun. You can also rewind time faster and completely stop time, which you learn if you rewind enough. The pictures in the first level to show you how everything works and you eventually learn about time rewind power, once you die. Rewinding saves time for the gamer as opposed to going to a game over sign. Each world has its own mechanic, which is fun. The game lacks any connection to the story, because the story is told through reading books, you know that thing you wanted to do when playing a video game. Throughout the whole game there is only one battle, the battle is fun, but there is only one of them. I know that this game is mellower than others and I’m fine with mellow, but there should at least be one battle for each world. Lastly, the puzzle pieces are more important than they seem to be. They are look as if they were any other extra collectable in a platformer. You can still continue to the next world even if you do not collect all the pieces. Then after you complete world 6 you climb up the ladder only to find out you need the pieces. You may think “well maybe you get something or learn something to help you get the pieces”. Nope, you can every piece in a playthrough of a world. If you want to make the pieces seem more important, don’t let the player enter a new world without all the pieces.ATMOSPHERE- Music is good, the bunny sounds like a cat, but I didn’t play this game because of the realism, so sure why not. Graphics are amazing just due to the textures alone, though the colors are also well doneSTORY- There was a princess and she got kidnapped, Tim wants to rescue her. Not the most compelling plot in the world but it is what it is. There is more to the story but there was a lot of optional reading that I just didn’t care for. So good news is I cannot possibly spoil this game. I wasn’t confused about what was going on either, not until a dinosaur came out of castle at the end of the world, and said “Your princess is in another castle”. If I remember correctly from the story, a monster took the princess, and a dinosaur could be considered a monster. What he says is exactly what somebody who captured the princess would said, so in the end it was the dinosaur. Then again I didn’t play the last level, because I didn’t care to get all the pieces. CONCLUSION- In the end, this game could have been better if they added a few things. More battles, make the pieces more important, and make the story feel more important. If you want a platformer play Battleblock Theater or Super Meat Boy. If you want a puzzler play The Bridge. If you want a game about a guy named Tim, play Skyrim and call your guy Tim. This game feels like biting into a sandwich with nothing but lettuce. "

You will be obsessed like me as you play into the later stages.It really requires you to employ your brain and innovation to solve all the puzzle so it is the game for you if you like challenges.

												This game masterfully exemplifies the phrase, ""the journey is the destination."" Each puzzle is more diverse and mind-bending than the last, so the solution is never immediately obvious. Every set of levels features its own element of gameplay unique to it, which is what makes every puzzle unique. You'll feel stupid, yet enlightened once you've pieced the puzzle together. It runs a bit short, but that doesn't mean every one of those hours won't be worth your time. Also, the soundtrack is probably one of the best I've heard in a game to date.TL;DR, if you're a fan of puzzlers, buy this game now. While brief, it's certainly worth the price for what it provides.			"

												Braid is an excellently crafted puzzle platformer, with fantastic gameplay mechanics in an absolutely beautiful hand-painted world. Within this setting, a love story emerges slowly, and then completely turned on its head. The gameplay of Braid is centered around reversing time to return objects or yourself to a previous position. This mechanic is expanded upon in multiple changing iterations between the worlds. This mechanic is also utilized to partial tell the game's story, which is mostly told though cryptic stories and allegories within books before starting worlds. Story is very cryptic throughout most of the game, slowly being revealed through reading the books, telling a tale of unrequited love. Story should be experienced first hand, so I won't go into it any further here. If you like introspective analysis of self, that is very metaphorical and philosophical, I would highly recommend it.Braid - 9 out of 10A fantastic puzzle platformer with a story that might not be for everyone, but is set in a handpainted world that is utterly beautific and euphoric.

												Absolutely brilliant puzzle game.I stopped several times just to contemplate how on earth someone could come up with such ingenious puzzles.Time travel has never been so satisfying.The graphics are great, I really like the painted style.Same with the music, except the music isn't painted.The controls are nice and precise.Resist the temptation to look up the puzzles you can't solve, just skip them and come back later. That feeling when you finally solve the last puzzle and complete the game is very, VERY rewarding!My only complaint is that I can't travel back in time myself, and experience this masterpiece again.

												Braid is a physics based puzzle platformer created by undeniable genius indie developer Jonathan Blow. In different levels, particular laws of physics are exhibited, making the player rethink realityIs this game worth my time and money?Braid is the best 2D puzzle game I have ever played. That includes everything that could reasonably fall under the category ""puzzle."" I'm not just talking about video games, I mean everything in existence. This journey will push your brain past were it has been evolutionarily programmed to go. When you first pick it up, you will be surprised at how easy it is to learn.However, beginning to understand the more complex inner-workings of gameplay will abruptly force you to rethink this initial evaluation. This game is extraordinarily hard, but every drop of time invested will repay you in the form of intellectual conquest. Combine that with the fact that Braid is on Steam for a measly $9.99, including a free demo, and I would have to give this one a solid 10/10 for overall value. This score does not come easy, but I would recommend Braid to everyone I ever met ever.GenreBraid is a puzzle platformer, but it goes way beyond the call of duty. Jonathan Blow's intimate understanding of physics makes itself abundantly apparent within the first couple stages. At first glance, it looks like any other platforming game. Once you start to play it though, you will soon realize that it takes this genre to a previously unfathomable level.Gameplay aspects like time-dilation, parallel time dimensions, and other physics manipulations make it almost a crime to lump this game in with a previously mundane genre. Many puzzle games have strived to achieve this level of excellence since Braid launched. We should thank Blow for pushing the boundaries of this variety of game.ControlsOn the surface, this game plays just like any other 2D platformer. You push right to walk/run, you hit a button to jump. It takes a literally negligible amount of time to learn how to control your new protagonist, Tim. The controls are exceptionally smooth. I experienced no issues with glitching or otherwise controlling the character.Anyway, that's how the basic controls go, but that's where the similarities end. Soon after beginning the game, you are given a new action button, this one is capable of reversing time, and it is a chief aspect of gameplay, but more on that in the appropriate section.GameplayYou are kind of just thrown into gameplay. There's no tutorial or anything like that, but you don't really need it. Jon Blow gives you everything you need to know to beat the game through intuitive exploration. What very shortly becomes clear is that you are supposed to be collecting those tantalizing puzzle piece looking things. These pieces are only accessible by completing different perplexing aspects of the level.There are going to be moving platforms and enemies that stand in your way, but the real hurdle is your own cognitive process. Once you collect a bunch of these puzzle pieces, you realize that you can put them together. The collectibles gained while completing puzzles are yet another puzzle, and a literal one. Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ genius.If you die, you can just rewind time. This becomes a much more important mechanic when the game introduces new physical properties and manipulations. These changes to your physical realm become increasingly difficult to rationalize. In one level, time is directly dependent your character's position on the x-axis. This effects everything in the game. If you stand still, so does time. If you walk backwards, time moves backwards. It is awesomely disorienting.At a certain point, you are introduced to what I can only interpret as a visible parallel time dimension. Any platforms, enemies, or puzzle pieces that exist within this dimension are not subject to any of the temporal manipulations that are occurring in the dimension you are in. These objects exist within the same spatial dimensions as you, evidenced by the fact that you can physically interact with them. Further in the game, you are allowed to record multiple versions of your character in order to work collaboratively with yourself. It is a fantastically psychoactive experience.StoryTo disclose too much about the storyline of Braid would be a gigantic spoiler, and I'm not going to do that. I will say this, when you finish the game, everything you thought you knew about the story is shattered. Hopefully this isn't too much of a divulgence. During the first playthrough, all you really know is that you are in this castle looking thing, and there are doors that lead to fantastic worlds that challenge the ability to augment your thinking. There are references to a princess, you are apparently trying to reach her. She is, predictably, typically in another castle.There's no real incentive to complete these puzzles other than your own intellectual drive, and some ambiguous text on these stone tablets about the princess and some haunting subjectively idealistic philosophy. Everyone seems to interpret these passages differently, which might be Blow's goal. It might be that there is a definitive interpretation and he just wanted to be playfully esoteric. Making things weirder, there is this underlying format of unwavering rationalism and calculation in the actual mechanics of the game. Perhaps he is juxtaposing these two realms, the true answer is beyond me, and he's not saying.ReplayabilityAs I previously alluded, when you replay the game, and I suggest you do at least once, you will understand a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ more about what is actually happening. You don't have to clear your save file and reset everything, all of the levels are repayable at any time. Just run through them again from beginning to end. The only bummer is that, in all likelihood, you will remember how to solve a good portion of the puzzles. The upside is that you can skip most of the regions that you already solved, since the puzzle piece will be in your inventory and not on the level.You'll still have plenty of challenging puzzling to do since you probably missed a decent portion of them in the first playthrough. You will probably be able to find previously unfathomable solutions because of things you learned later in the game. This will give you something meaningful to strive for when you play through the levels again. There are many other hidden aspects of the game that you only realize after dedicating a considerable amount of time to the game, but I'm not going to spoil it for you. This makes the game engaging for many hours to come. Seriously, 10/10.			"

I felt like some levels were very challenging and I spent a lot of time staring at the screen. The answers were fairly obvious after I went back through the chambers once or twice (the solution just pops out).  I really enjoyed the challenge.

												Written after 100% Braid CompletionBraid is a facinating game. The story is a complex, multi-layered beast that prompts a lot of thought after the game is done. It is a little too evasive for my liking; it's never clear exactly what the developer is trying to say beyond 'I can write a complex, multi-layered beast of a plot'.The gameplay is very fun and requires as much, if not more thought than the story. The speed run is a fantastic achievement, if only because you have to re-evaluate all your techniques for solving puzzles. It isn't good enough to just get the puzzle pieces, you need to work out the most efficient ways of doing so.Highly recommended.			"

												Braid was a unique twist for me, in a world where I thought I had seen every style of platformer.Braid plays in a similar vein to late-game Toki Tori levels; your character has some control over time as its primary action, but I would say Braid takes the time manipulation to a stronger level.The main theme outside of time manipulation is the puzzles; each room of the house contains space for a puzzle whose pieces you are collecting as you play. After each 'world' is completed, you put together the simple puzzle, and move on to the next world. As you progress, books on podiums prior to entering the world tell parts of your story.Time manipulation plays a large role in the game, and becomes crucial as you get closer and closer to the end. It was a new playstyle for me, but definitely fun to work with to solve some of the puzzles. I think the puzzles, in addition to the story, were well-crafted. I initially ignored parts of the story, but it does end up being pretty good.If you like puzzle/platformers, you'll like Braid.			"

												If you're into platformers, then this is definitely one to try out. The difference between this and most though, is that you can manipulate time in this one. If you've ever had moments before when you're like ""man I wish I could undo that move,"" then you're in luck. The whole concept of the game is literally learning from your own mistakes. If you want to undo a move that landed you into an enemy or got you killed in a boss battle, you can. For some puzzles, you even need to use the time manipulation mechanic. All I can say now is to try it and see what I mean.			"

												This is easily one of the most creative and original games that I've ever played.  I loved the soundtrack. Jonathan Blow's decision to license the music--music written by composers for the sake of the art, not because they needed another track for a level--was excellent. The writing and story were superb! I can't say strongly enough how much I enjoyed the story (though to get the full story, you have to get the stars and getting the stars without looking up how is near impossible). The game mechanics were fun, consistent, and well thought out.The puzzle design is by far the stand out feature here. Of course there's the ""respect for the player's time"" and ""no filler"" points that they make (and fulfill), but for me the excellence of the puzzle design is that each puzzle has a definite, ""low impedance"" answer (or answers, could be more than one, but each of them definite as I'll explain). Each solution is singular within the mechanics of the game, without introducing artificial limitations that contradict the rest of the game. There's no randomly twiddling with stuff until you slip past. While some games have some puzzles with no clear reason why the solution works, in Braid, discovering ""why"" the solution works comes first, and is the only real requirement to solving the puzzles.If you've never played Braid, I envy the experience you have waiting.

												Braid is an example of minimalism in game design. Each level has a different twist to it, all based on time manipulation, none long enough to be tedious. One sample twist: the ability to rewind time at will, which mans that jumps which would be absurdly difficult in a 'real' platformer become an interesting puzzle to solve. And that's a meta-twist: The game is not one that needs reflexes to solve. If you ever find yourself thinking ""I'm just not fast enough/skilled enough"" you need to take a step back and think rather than react.Speaking of thinking, the story line is thought-provoking. If you are the type that likes a backstory that hinted at rather than spelled out, Braid will give you ample fodder to ponder and/or discuss. Braid was one of the forerunners of what is now the Indie revolution. Its fame is deserved.			"

												Braid is a good game. Mechanics and story work together give an interesting experience for the player. When people say Braid is a good example of game design they usually talk about the hand painted sprites, which is completely missing the point.I find the story itself less interesting than most people. It's not very open to interpretation, you either get what he really meant to say or you're left with something that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.The puzzles are hard! Don't get me wrong, I love a puzzle game with a good challenge. I'm used to play puzzle games that I can solve with my eyes closed, but Braid occasionally gives you puzzles with questionable solutions, that exploit mechanics you didn't know were there and thing like that.So this is a must play, in my opinion. Play it! PLAY IT! But don't hesitate to look up the solution if you're stuck, as it might be one of those puzzles that you look and say ""this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! how was I supposed yo know you can do that?"" and are not worth your time :P			"

												If you're looking for a very unique, addictive, and challenging puzzler, look no further. The difficulty is quite high as some of the temporal mechanics can be tricky to deal with, like when moving right in space moves time forward and moving left moves time backward. It's a lot of fun to mess with time! The story is very confusing until you get near the end of the game, but that's part of the consequences of the order of events not progressing temporally as one would expect.			"

												Braid is a puzzle game with some platformer elements. The puzzles are fun, well varied and only rarely frustrating. They mostly focus on manipulating time, one way or another, in order to collect jigsaw puzzle pieces. After collecting all the pieces and assembling a puzzle for every world in the game the player gains access to the last level and a bizarre ending. The game handles well, has beautiful visuals and an fitting soundtrack. It is a little on the short side but even so I would strongly recommended it.			"

I love platformer's that introduce environment altering elements that allow for a huge variety of puzzles rather then it just being another run and jump platformer.

It's extreme puzzle design was of something I have never seen before and I hope I encounter more amazing titles like this one. The visual artwork make the game asthetically amazing while the beautiful and ambient soundtrack never got stale. On top of all that, the allegorical story of the man named Tim is one that was written beautifully and was an amazing change of pace from many cliche narratives seen now. Ultimately, I would give this game a 10/10, as it exemplifies everything that a puzzle game, and many video games should be: beautiful, original, creative, and fun.			"

												Puzzle platformers tend to be platform games with a few easy puzzles. Braid is a puzzle games with some easy platform elements. The puzzle mechanic is one of the most innovative I have seen. It involves time manipulation and challenges you to think in new ways to predict the consequences of manipulating time in various ways and use this ability to achieve your goals. It starts out easy and the difficulty ramps up at a good pace. Towards the end the game is challenging even for experienced puzzle solvers. The game is also non-linear in that you don't need to solve everything in one part of the game to progress to later parts, if you get stuck on a puzzle you can go somewhere else and come back to tackle that puzzle later.The game has an artistic style that feels completely natural and fits well with the unique style of the gameplay. Graphics and sound contribute further to make the game atmospheric. The story is told in various ways, including texts you can read at the start of each level but also, in a way, through the pictures that you need to assemble to complete a level.All in all this is the best puzzle platformer I have played (unless you count Portal as a 3D puzzle platformer) and highly recommended to anyone who likes puzzle games.

First things first: The game mechanics are phenomenal, giving new time-travelling challenges and ways of solving puzzles that I never thought I’d see in a game. If you are looking for a heavy brain workout, look no further. This experience will stay with me for the longest time for sure (so much so that I unwittingly tried to rewind time in other games as well. *disappointed much* Which threw me back to a post-Life-is-Strange era). Even though this game has earned a huge thumbs up for me, it definitely has some drawbacks.Downsides: - The not-so-precise jumping controls and the timing of some puzzles can be a real pain. Sometimes you have a puzzle figured out pretty quickly… in theory. But you spend the next 10 minutes rewinding and dying, rewinding and dying like a maniac, getting a tiny bit more frustrated every single time. - I had heard great things about ‘the twist’ of the story. Well, after finishing the game and finding said twist I had to look up the meaning of it all. There can be many interpretations. - No explanations of the mechanics in all the worlds. This can be interpreted as a positive challenge however.Conclusion:Even though you can die hundreds of times in the game (and at the same time the game won’t ever let you really die), and some levels can be a drag, the good things most certainly outweigh the bad. The groundbreaking mechanics were all I needed to stamp this game as a massive success and I’m happy I took the gamble of checking it out. Le spoilers:Parts that I LOVED:  Creating a shadow version of myself, strangely giving some puzzles a co-op vibe :D Parts that I HATED:  Those green sparking little brown furball basterds stealing your keys. Or when you have to guide them to safety like a couple of suicidal ‘special’ lemmings. Or the key that just keeps escaping... if you’ve played the game you know the one. "

												Never have I felt so proud of myself to complete such a difficult, mind bending game. Out of all the puzzles, I only had resort to the Wiki for hints on two solutions in a couple levels.

Ripping my hair out trying to figure this game out wasn't fun, but the satisfaction on completing it is phenomenal.  "

												This is one of my favorite puzzle games I have ever played. The gameplay mechanics are so unique with rewinding time, and other twists thrown in. I really enjoyed every puzzle in this game. The only downside is that it was too short. More puzzles could have been made, but the game is still great and a masterpiece!I feel like the replay value for the game isn't as good as pother games, because once you know how to beat a puzzle you aren't likely to forget, unless it has been a long time. For 10$ the game is too short, only took me around 4 hours to beat, but it really has some of the most fun puzzles I have played. Fo any puzzle game lovers it's a must play game.			"

												Braid is a physics based puzzle platformer created by undeniable genius indie developer Jonathan Blow. In different levels, particular laws of physics are exhibited, making the player rethink realityIs this game worth my time and money?Braid is the best 2D puzzle game I have ever played. That includes everything that could reasonably fall under the category ""puzzle."" I'm not just talking about video games, I mean everything in existence. This journey will push your brain past were it has been evolutionarily programmed to go. When you first pick it up, you will be surprised at how easy it is to learn.However, beginning to understand the more complex inner-workings of gameplay will abruptly force you to rethink this initial evaluation. This game is extraordinarily hard, but every drop of time invested will repay you in the form of intellectual conquest. Combine that with the fact that Braid is on Steam for a measly $9.99, including a free demo, and I would have to give this one a solid 10/10 for overall value. This score does not come easy, but I would recommend Braid to everyone I ever met ever.GenreBraid is a puzzle platformer, but it goes way beyond the call of duty. Jonathan Blow's intimate understanding of physics makes itself abundantly apparent within the first couple stages. At first glance, it looks like any other platforming game. Once you start to play it though, you will soon realize that it takes this genre to a previously unfathomable level.Gameplay aspects like time-dilation, parallel time dimensions, and other physics manipulations make it almost a crime to lump this game in with a previously mundane genre. Many puzzle games have strived to achieve this level of excellence since Braid launched. We should thank Blow for pushing the boundaries of this variety of game.ControlsOn the surface, this game plays just like any other 2D platformer. You push right to walk/run, you hit a button to jump. It takes a literally negligible amount of time to learn how to control your new protagonist, Tim. The controls are exceptionally smooth. I experienced no issues with glitching or otherwise controlling the character.Anyway, that's how the basic controls go, but that's where the similarities end. Soon after beginning the game, you are given a new action button, this one is capable of reversing time, and it is a chief aspect of gameplay, but more on that in the appropriate section.GameplayYou are kind of just thrown into gameplay. There's no tutorial or anything like that, but you don't really need it. Jon Blow gives you everything you need to know to beat the game through intuitive exploration. What very shortly becomes clear is that you are supposed to be collecting those tantalizing puzzle piece looking things. These pieces are only accessible by completing different perplexing aspects of the level.There are going to be moving platforms and enemies that stand in your way, but the real hurdle is your own cognitive process. Once you collect a bunch of these puzzle pieces, you realize that you can put them together. The collectibles gained while completing puzzles are yet another puzzle, and a literal one. Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ genius.If you die, you can just rewind time. This becomes a much more important mechanic when the game introduces new physical properties and manipulations. These changes to your physical realm become increasingly difficult to rationalize. In one level, time is directly dependent your character's position on the x-axis. This effects everything in the game. If you stand still, so does time. If you walk backwards, time moves backwards. It is awesomely disorienting.At a certain point, you are introduced to what I can only interpret as a visible parallel time dimension. Any platforms, enemies, or puzzle pieces that exist within this dimension are not subject to any of the temporal manipulations that are occurring in the dimension you are in. These objects exist within the same spatial dimensions as you, evidenced by the fact that you can physically interact with them. Further in the game, you are allowed to record multiple versions of your character in order to work collaboratively with yourself. It is a fantastically psychoactive experience.StoryTo disclose too much about the storyline of Braid would be a gigantic spoiler, and I'm not going to do that. I will say this, when you finish the game, everything you thought you knew about the story is shattered. Hopefully this isn't too much of a divulgence. During the first playthrough, all you really know is that you are in this castle looking thing, and there are doors that lead to fantastic worlds that challenge the ability to augment your thinking. There are references to a princess, you are apparently trying to reach her. She is, predictably, typically in another castle.There's no real incentive to complete these puzzles other than your own intellectual drive, and some ambiguous text on these stone tablets about the princess and some haunting subjectively idealistic philosophy. Everyone seems to interpret these passages differently, which might be Blow's goal. It might be that there is a definitive interpretation and he just wanted to be playfully esoteric. Making things weirder, there is this underlying format of unwavering rationalism and calculation in the actual mechanics of the game. Perhaps he is juxtaposing these two realms, the true answer is beyond me, and he's not saying.ReplayabilityAs I previously alluded, when you replay the game, and I suggest you do at least once, you will understand a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ more about what is actually happening. You don't have to clear your save file and reset everything, all of the levels are repayable at any time. Just run through them again from beginning to end. The only bummer is that, in all likelihood, you will remember how to solve a good portion of the puzzles. The upside is that you can skip most of the regions that you already solved, since the puzzle piece will be in your inventory and not on the level.You'll still have plenty of challenging puzzling to do since you probably missed a decent portion of them in the first playthrough. You will probably be able to find previously unfathomable solutions because of things you learned later in the game. This will give you something meaningful to strive for when you play through the levels again. There are many other hidden aspects of the game that you only realize after dedicating a considerable amount of time to the game, but I'm not going to spoil it for you. This makes the game engaging for many hours to come. Seriously, 10/10.			"

												Braid is a refreshing independant release, cleverly mixing puzzle and platform games. Using time-travel based mechanisms, the player has to make his way through very short levels, where he will encounter goons and bosses to kill, and enigmas to solve in order to get some mysterious puzzle pieces. One of the most interesting aspect of the gameplay is that the ""rules"" of time-travel evolve, and change in each chapters, forcing the player to adapt permanently.Aside from the fact that mixing time-travel with a Supermario-like adventure is sometime quite surprising, as it breaks a few common rules of platform games, Braid is a very aesthetically pleasing game. The soundtrack, using classical instruments, is beautiful, and the painting-style animation is superb. The icing on the cake is that Braid also contains a original and deep story, told in a very unusual way.One of its only drawbacks is that the lifespan is quite short (it takes an average person about 6 hours to complete the game). But given its low price, and the fact that the player will go for it again, just to enjoy the unique atmopshere, or to try to figure out the part of the plot he missed, that lifespan is satisfactory.

												The music is beautiful, and the story is deeper than you might expect. I really enjoy the rewind feature; I haven't seen anything like it in other games, but its importance to solving the puzzles in this game is really just lovely.			"

												Painterly styled game with unique rewind time gameplay mechanics and clever puzzles.Took a little bit for me to understand the gameplay mechanic but once I got past that it was great.The storey was a bit heady for me so even if you don't understand you will still have a great time.Well worth your money.

												The music. Just play it for the music and the art style.Actually, the game mechanics are also really well done. It is enjoyable. And requires you think. Like... Really think.The whole time control mechanism means you technically can't die... Although if you get in a tough spot, you may just want to restart the level. (Rewinding through the whole thing just to get to the beginning can be a little... Dizzying, to say the least.Like puzzles? Buy it. Like platforming? Buy it. Pretty much give it a whirl if you are at all interested. But if you are not serious about difficult brain puzzlers... Get it during a Steam sale. Otherwise, give it a go.			"

												Braid is a masterfully crafted game.  Any review will support that.  It's only downside is its length, but despite that, still worth playing.  If you missed out on this, you've missed out on one of the most thoughtful platformers ever made.			"

												I was resistant to play Braid at first, just because I have some pretty AAA games to play instead. One day, i gave it a try and started playing... man.... I was speechless and impressed by its unique design, unique gameplay, unique story and unique puzzles. This game is so beautiful in so many ways that I started crying...Braid is an UNIQUE Masterpiece and have a great heart. I still dind't talk about the flow of time manipulation to solve puzzles. IT'S FANTASTIC. If you could go back in time and stop yourself from buying this game, you won't do it, believe me!Buy it, you won't regret.			"

												The game is very well made and will challenge you to think differently about how you play a platformer and about how you think of time. The art style is this games stongest element. Every single frame is pretty enough to hang on a wall. You will have fun playing this game and its so beautiful that your eyes will bleed rain bows.The ""story"" however is another matter. Many of the other reviews talk about how deep the story is, im wondering what story that is because i didn't really notice much of a story at all. Other than a general sense of guilt and how nice it would be to undo mistake the narrative doesn't really give you much. MAny critics have praised how many interpritations there are to the narrative, real watercooler type discussions, but i cant help bu feel that the only reason this game has so many interpritations is because the game never tells you what its about, you need to fill in the very large story blanks with your own imaginaiton and interpritaiton.

												Absolutely incredible game. I found it through the soundtrack actually, which is one of the best ever written for a video game, especially for an indie game. The gameplay is very innovative and challenging, but completing it is a great sense of satisfaction. The art is beautiful as well. Highly recommend it! Support the developers of beautiful games like this.			"

												Braid is a deceptively simple and hauntingly beautiful game. It is a good game, that is not up for debate.That said, wait until it is on sale unless you really love puzzle games. If you do, you'll be rewarded with simple, yet devilishly clever puzzles (even if some are annoyingly vague).If not, you might feel it falls a bit short of expectations due to the overhype around it.

												Braid is.. well. It's hard to describe. Mechanics wise, it's a simple platformer with an interesting gimmick. You can rewind time. The game takes place across six worlds, each with its own additional time manipulating mechanic. Some of the levels can get pretty tough, and I ended up resorting to a walkthrough to solve at least two of the levels (I'm not proud). Braid's a neat little game with a really cool soundtrack, but much of Braid is best explained through experience. Try it out. You might like it. The game took me about 5 hours to complete, and offered a good amount of content for the price. Overall, I'd give it a 8/10.(Note: I got the game on sale for about $1.50. I wouldn't pay more than three bucks for this, but I'm cheap. Get it on a sale. You'll like it.)			"

												You are Tim. Tim has made a mistake. Now he must find the princess. You will track the princess across six worlds, each with its own mind-bending gameplay rules. You will manipluate time just by walking. You will cheat certain death. You will pull out every hair on your head. And in the end, it will be more than worth it. Braid is a landmark game, something we will be talking about decades from now as a perfect example of the synthesis of amazing gameplay and thought-provoking story.			"
