												A gem that is underrated.The theme of the game is great.The variety of the maps is awesome and the maps are great.The graphics are awesome for a game of that time.You can play on skirmish.There's three factions and lot of units to use.The game is really great, I would suggest to anyone that like RTS, strategy, modern era war and action games.8/10			"

												OVERALL: Great game 9/10Joint Task Force is a really great modern ""realistic"" RTS game. Its not as advanced as recent RTS games like ""Men of War"", where you need to master a ton of keys. JTF is mostly played with just the mouse.Instead, JTF is a LOT of fun to play. A mission is usually comprised of multiple objectives, so when you finish one objective, the map size increases and you are given another objective. This works very well.The graphics are very nice considering the game is from 2006.The sound is good also, with a lot of funny comments from your troops.The military tech in the game is all modern, which I find super cool. I have played a lot of WW2 RTS and its great to have a go at modern military gear also.There is only one thing more fun than playing this game in single player, and thats CO-OP! You can play all the missions in the single player campaign with up to 2 player CO-OP on LAN. This is so much fun.So all in all, I highly recommend this game for a very fun modern military SP / CO-OP RTS experience. I am just sad that this game was never followed up upon by the developers.PS: This games requires LEGACY Nvidia PhysX drivers to run. You can find them here: http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-driver.html "
