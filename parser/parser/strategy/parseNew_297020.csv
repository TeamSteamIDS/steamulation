												As others have said, this game feels and plays like a cheap, uninspired flash game. I really don't understand why it has 75% positive reviews; gameplay gets stale by the third level, art is awkward and tacky, main character is the embodiment of stinky Texan redneck stereotypes... I've put 3.3 hours into it, completed 100%, achievements included. Got it for free and I tell you I'd be angry if I had paid for it. Avoid.			"

												The Culling Of The Cows is a 2D Shooter with a Side Scrolling Combat, As an old farmer, you must protect your barn from Zombie Cows and whatever that tries to pass through you. as your partner you've got a badass gun that you can upgrade the power over time, some awesome special supports also a Supply pack to give you a hand to defeat those Zombies Cows and a badass Nazi Ufo.Pros:+Very Fun and addictive game+Nice visual graphic+Simple Controls+Nice Combat System+Challenging Game+EnjoyableCons:- HitBox is kinda messed up I'd say- The game is kinda short- only few achievements, (Would be fantastic if this game had some more achievements, just to increase the challenge)- No Co-op (A Multi-Player mode would make it really Fun to play with friends )- High Price (I'd recommend buy this game with +85% OFF)I had this game for free and i really appreciate it and i would recommend buy this one in a steam sale when you can get a +85% OFF it would be a fair enough price !!!  I wouldn't recommend for my indian friends, that could be offensive or something :(  "

""Mad Zombi Cow Hunter"" The Culling Of The Cows is a 2D Sidescroll Shooter in the weird world of zombi farming. You are a farmer with a shotgun in your hand and must protect your barn from incoming waves of zombi cows. In each wave another type of obscure zombi creature joins the hordes. There are a bunch of cliches dealing of a typical redneck life and leading towards the grand finale: Fight against a Nazi UFO.The gameplay is quite challing, yes, but it turns out in higher levels even more repetitive and boring. Although there is a mass of funny elements to discover, nothing remains as necessary remindable. Like a chopper support, nukes or a barn sentry. Wow how interesting.The biggest lack are the uncomfortable controls like reloading each shell for one key hit or to aim precisely in the isometric playfield. Also some bugs are still included in this game.So I can just recommend it to players of brute and unstrategical shooters.			"

The graphics were not the best, the movement was clumsy, and the game it self didn't seem all that great.  If it's free to you, go ahead and try it, but I wouldn't suggest spending money on it.			"

The Culling of the Cows is an absurdist gag game that, while it may provide you with all the rampant bovine slaughter you could ever dream of, is as of now not at all worth the price paid for it.As a lone farmer stranded in rural 'Murica, you must overcome the armies of mutant cows, deranged hippies and obese gothic women that a Nazi UFO sends your way. By reading the previous sentence, it should be quite clear that this game is not taking itself too seriously. However, there is a clear difference between random humor with a purpose and random just for random's sake; this game strictly falls into the latter. Culling is basing its appeal entirely on the fact that the player gets to shoot cows...a lot. All of the other plot points mentioned in the beginning of this paragraph receive no explanation besides a single introduction screen per plot point, and are otherwise meant to serve as comedic masks for generic enemy types.The game's fundamentals are disappointingly lacking. Gameplay is divided into levels that contain encounters in either standard ""Waves"" format, a variation of Waves that is only one large wave, or a last-stand turret mode called ""Onslaught"". The majority of the game's levels occur in the Waves format, with varying numbers and types of enemies and waves for each level. This variety does little to put off the repetition that sets in after a few rounds of slaughtering the same few animals and zombies over and over. The Waves format does allow for some character customization in weapon upgrades, but after a certain amount of experimentation I discovered an order of upgrades that, with moderate skill, could win all the levels. Some incentive in the level design to switch up gameplay styles would have gone a long way. The other gameplay mode, Onslaught, produces some of the most frustrating levels in the game due to sketchy hit detection, though it often provides a refreshing and enjoyable break from the Waves levels as well.Various other parts of the game fail to stand out. The soundtrack isn't memorable and the art style has this feel to it that so many indie games seem to have, which at worst could be descibed as ""one step above MS Paint"". Largely, the game isn't bad-looking; it just has a habit of piling hundreds of multicolored cow corpses on the screen at once, which grates on the senses and leaves a lasting impact after seeing it over and over. Some parts of the game seem to be implemented strangely: controller support, despite being labelled as both ""partial"" and ""full"", relegates movement solely to the D-Pad, which is an odd choice. Culling's achievements are also strange: there are only five, four can be attained by the third level (two are bugged to only work with the keyboard) and the fifth is for beating the game. More achievements could help boost replayability, a facet which is important in this game considering it can be finished in just over three hours. Though most levels contain medals to earn for winning under certain conditions, the game doesn't offer rewards for earning the medals, which makes them largely meaningless. Perhaps tying some customization unlocks to medals would solve this issue?Though this game faces significant issues, I must give praise to the spirit of the developers. They've implemented some features like an internal cheat console, the achievements and trading cards by popular demand. Additionally, their desire to not make this game be simply a joke shows throughout the game. The farmer's voiceover has some genuinely unique and funny lines interspersed throughout the game, which work because the lines are not beaten to death in every level. As long as the developers stand by the good-hearted cow hate that is the root of this game, there's hope that this could turn into an indie cult classic in the future.This game has set off on a mission: to spread the need to shoot cows whenever, wherever. It tries to achieve its goals through a game that has significant flaws. Should the developers focus on the problems that plague the core elements of the game, then this title will definitely deserve a second look. As of now, however, there is no way anyone would feel satisfied paying full price for this game. Save up for a sale, perhaps gift this to a friend in jest. Just...beware the cows. The Culling of the Cows gets a D.			"

												I got this title for free during a big giveaway. Still, I did not enjoy it. It's a simplistic, protect your house from the cows game, one which is actually fun at the beggining, but as you progress through The Culling of the Cows' levels - gameplay gets boring and rather repetitive. So, in a final veredict, I do not recommend this title, as this game should simply be free-to-play or cheaper than it is, because spending 11 euros on it is a waste of money.			"

												It seems like despite the indie retro-craze that's been going strong for the past few years, many of them, while awesome, fail to capture that old school 90s insanity that I find myself aching for when playing a classic on an emulator just doesn't hit the spot. This baby doesn't disappoint - especially if you can grab it during a Steam Sale like I just did. The atmosphere, humor, sound and feel of the action all come together to form a pretty hilarious and addictive package of nonsensical carnage. If you dug games like Zombies Ate my Neighbors and Smash TV, pick this one up. It doesn't have the exploration they did, but the feel is right at home.			"

												-TERRIBLE HITBOXESWatch as your bullets pass straight through their legs.-ABYSMAL IN GAME CHALLENGESCan you imagine a game where our hero never got any upgrades? Imagine how boring megaman would've been if you never got a single upgrade. Some might disagree, but IMO why can't you have challenges that let you utilize the game's mechanics/upgrades. It's why time attack is such a popular challenge; Not ""beat the level without using X""-UINo tooltip info when you click/hover over an available assist, upgrade, or enemy within a given level. That goes for in battle and on the world map.-NO STORY ARCHthe game trailer does a better job of telling a story-only 5 achievementsGreat for people looking to add a perfect game to their steam collection.

												I bought this in a bundle, for what amounts to about 40c ...  I enjoyed the other Decaying Logic (DL) titles (Pixel Puzzles) so I was interested to try.  I knew it was short, and I think DL realizes that and doesnt let this game take itself too seriously as a result.  about 3 hours in, I am at the last level and I had to stop and take a break.  Too frustrating.Again DL to the rescue for people interested in playing different ways, as they offer the console codes here on steam and apparently that wont affect your achievement progress.Default mode is really tough, and if you try for three badges each level it is even harder.  These challenges are broken up by a handful of carnage levels that you basically spray the undead for a bit...  Like their zombie pixel puzzler almost, but doesnt require 90 minutes at a sitting...I got my 40 cents worth, and more.  I'd pay a couple of dollars for it.  Don't recommend it at retail or much of 1.99.  Find a bundle and get a good value.6/10			"

GameplayI didn't expect so good level from so simple game. All you have to do is to protect your ""base"", because ""zombie-cows"" are trying to get it. Only one weapon - shotgun. 4 kinds of bullets to it and4 upgrades like: reloading speed, double shooting by 1 click and 2 more. Only 2 bosses, but 1 of them is expecting using some tactic to beat not just shooting and moving around. There are levels to play with mini-gun. There are also support things: mini-gun, saw and 2 more.Pros & ConsPros 4 good upgrades & 4 good kind of shots Expecting-tactic bosses (at least 1st one) Many kinds of enemies Support thingsCons Only 1 weapon 2 bosses onlyI really liked this game, even more...

TL;DR review at the bottom!The Culling of the Cows is a wave/horde zombie shooter with no content at all. There are 2 ""gamemodes"" you either control a guy running up-down and left-right while shooting, upgrading your weapon, or bring in assist abilities, or its a simple turret shooter. Number of maps: 1. Yes, only 1 map for a zombie defense game. The only difference between the levels are the assist abilities which. There are around 10 types of enemies, most of them basicly the same: cow, a bit faster cow, a bit tougher cow, ect. Controls are clunky. In the main gamemode you can't aim, you have to move your character in the line where you want to shoot. The hitbox are buggy as hell, bullets often go through the target without damaging them. Finishing the game takes around 2 hours, highly repetitive and there is no co-op. The game also highly overpriced (there are much better flash games in this genre for free). If you'd like to buy a zombie defense game which is cheaper, simple but has co-op and runs on a microwave go with the Yet Another Zombie Defense. It's only 2€ and essentially has the same, but cheaper and has coop (also frequently updated).TL;DR:Just don't buy this.It's boring, has zero content, repetitive.			"

												The Culling Of The Cows is a side-scrolling shooter. You are Sammy, a farmer, and you have to defend your properties with your shotgun against waves and waves of cows, zombies and undead cows.There are lots of levels in this game. The classic type of level involves defending your farm against successive waves of ennemies. You will also play some levels where there is only one wave, but a big one ! Not to forget the last kind of level, which is a level where you are in your farmhouse, shooting ennemies from the window with infinite ammos !For the first two types of levels, you can :- Upgrade your ammos. 4 different types of ammos are available : the normal ones, the ""spreading"" ones, the ""piercing"" ones and the ""explosives"" one. You just have to buy the type of ammos, then you have access to an infinite amount of them.- Upgrade your weapon. The first option is to increase the amount of ammos you have in your shotgun. The second one is to increase the number of bullets you put in your weapon each time you reload it (the most useful to my mind). The third one allows you to decrease the delay between each of your shot. The last one gives you an horizontal red line to make it easier to aim.- Use Assists. These are special powers that will greatly help you. You can have access up to 4 of them, depending on the level. They can be used freely, you will just have to wait a little bit between each use. For instance, you can spawn an helicopter that will destroy ennemies with a machine-gun, or ignite a fire that will burn any ennemies that will walk (or at least try) through it.- Use Supplies. Just using a specific key, you can spawn supplies which will grant you money or a bonus for a short period of time (invicibility, infinite ammos, speed increase, time slowed down, ...).For each of these levels, you can get 3 ""medals"" (it looks like achievements for each level, but they are only in-game, not Steam). To unlock that, you will have to complete a level without upgrading your ammos, upgrading your weapon, using Assists ... You do not need to unlock all three of them at the same time, you can focus on a specific one and complete the level again focusing on an other one.Regarding the ennemies, you will encounter different kinds of them : standard cow, charging cow, very big cow, explosive cow, standard zombie, pretty-hard-to-kill zombie, etc ... Also, beware the crows falling from the sky, they are indicated with a blue beam, so that you have time to avoid them ! And, of course, there is a final stage with a final boss, which is not that difficult to defeat.In the end, The Culling Of The Cows is a fine game, I had a lot of fun playing it even though it is kind of repetitive after the first levels and the gameplay is mainly based on ""when to reload your weapon"". It took me ~5-6 hours to get all of the medals and defeat the final boss. This will unlock all of the Steam achievements. The soundtrack fits well with the game and the graphics are fine. I played with a gamepad, I think it is much more enjoyable than using a keyboard.More content would be great because, once you have killed the final boss + got all of the medals, there is nothing more you can do. And, for more than 10€, it seems expensive to have only a 6 hours-game. I would recommend to buy this game during sales or try to get it in a bundle, but do not spend the full amount for it :-)			"

												A simplistic little survival game, where you are armed with a Shotgun and must survive waves of zombie cows. Gun Mods and power ups are available, as you progress level through level; However, the cows also progress from a standard zombie cow to a charging green bull. This gives the game a level of difficulty, necessary to make it a fun challenge and keep you wanting to play more. The graphics are low quality, but that is all part of the simplistic fun of the game. I had a lot of fun with it and would give it a thumbs up, if for nothing else then it is good for a laugh when you get gored by a zombie cow.			"

												If you like killing cows with different weapons, while protecting your farm and trying not getting killed, well thats the game for you. Personally i think this game needs work, its framerates are low, as a player your character feels slow, and the shooting needs a bit update so you cannot miss some really easy shots. 6/10			"

												The Culling of Cows is a rather amusing tower defense game that puts a bit more action into the genre. Moving the main character and personally putting down the undead makes the game stand out among the crowd. However, a poor presentation combined with an overall lack of content makes this a hard game to recommend.Game: 5.5/10Graphic: 6.5/10100% Achievement : Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard			"

 The Culling of the Cows ReviewSo one day, I visited a site that I love to go on for game info, RPS. I saw an advert for a free copy of ""Culling of the Cows,"" so I figured I would give it a try. And I am very glad that I did. Part 1:  Storyline and Gameplay In COTC, you are a farmer who encounters everything from zombie cows to Nazi UFOs on his farm. It is your job to shoot the oncoming cattle and other enemies before they can enter your barn. There is a plethora of upgrades for your weapons, barn, and even ""God Abilities."" It could be considered a sidescroller (but with no scrolling), but this game will appeal to both arcade gamers and retro shoot-em-up gamers alike.As for the length of the game, COTC has an adequate number of ""missions"" which provide for plenty of hours of fun gameplay. And if you ever, for some odd reason, get bored of destroying zombie cows with a barn-mounted machine gun, there are cheat codes to get you to the final mission and other such objectives. Part 2: Graphics?  There isn't too much to say about the graphics here. The game could have done well as a pixel graphic game, but I believe that the developers made the right decision sticking with non-pixelated cows. You get an arcade feel from the graphics while still being able to make out sharp lines and appropriate detail. Part 3: Is it fun?  Of course it's fun! This game is unlike any other arcade-zombie-tower defense game you've played before! Imagine Farming Simulator, but instead of growing crops, you shoot cows, and instead of upgrading your equipment, you upgrade your explosive-bullet extended mag infinite ammo no reload shotgun! This is a game that you can definitely lose track of time while playing and get caught up in the hilarity and epicness of the goals. Value As I said before, I got this game as part of a special promotion, however, I would gladly have bought this game. It's well worth the money (At time of writing: $1.94, 85% off)! Let's put it this way - you can get a pack of gum or two which might last just a few days, or you can get COTC and have dozens of fun hours of gameplay! The only thing is that I feel like $12.99 is a little bit much to ask for regular price, I would wait for it to go on sale. Definitely a game that you can casually pick up right where you left off, even if it's been a week or two. Would recommend.  Aspect Rating   Gameplay 9   Graphics 8   Enjoyability 10   Value 7  Final Points on the Game This game is a definite buy, whether it's 2 bucks or 10. You'll have a great time playing it, and best of all, it has zombies with  no early access ! What's not to love about that!Be sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did! Thanks for reading!			"

												The Culling Of The Cows is a lane defense game.The review will be presented in a simplistic ""Pros/Neutral/Cons"" format.Pros:* Given away on some free giveaways, so keep an eye out for that.* Simplistic graphics, can be run on anything.* Cow corpses stay there until the end of the mission. (Trust me, it's quite good)* 4 of the 5 achievements can be obtained in the first 30-45 minutes.* No need to focus on the game.* Skills and upgrades.Neutral:* Hard to tell the live cows from the dead ones later on... (Technically realism?).Cons:* Last achievement can be obtained in the end of the game, probably about 6-8 hours in the game.* The difficulty curve is just too harsh.* The hitboxes are a bit screwy, I'd suggest shooting slightly above the cow to hit. Overall:5/10 (Barely recommended)If I had to pay for this, it'd be 3.5/10			"

If it's free to you, go ahead and try it, but I wouldn't suggest spending money on it... :DIdk why it has mostly positive reviews on steam.. maybe due to cards and achievement... :/			"

												The game itself is not bad (which is why I want steam to put review that are neutral) and can be quite fun for some people who are into these kind of games, and unlike some other pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥that they're on steam this one is very functional and can have some charm in the jokes.However, I choose to put a not recommended mainly because of the price and what it offers. Since it's way to expensive IMO and it's better to get it on a sale.GameplayIt plays as your average defence flash game where you defend your barn from zombie cows, and you can upgrade your bullets or gun. The game just gets a little difficult if you're trying to get the achievements (which serve no purpose at all since you don't get better stuff from them), but ignoring them the game is very easy.It has about around 40+ levels so it should give some time to beat them all.StoryThe theme of the game alredy says that it doesn't take itself seriously, so the story means jack♥♥♥♥♥♥GraphicsThey are pretty decent and serve their purpose, it does show that the developer put effort in making the graphics so kudos for that.MusicThey serve their purpose and a lot of songs will be repeated in the game. But that won't make any of them memorable at all. Since they sound generic and not something that will leave you an impact like other games.OverrallIt's a nice decent game, but again not worth the original price, very forgettable and you'll probably never going to play it again unless you're really into playing these games.You're better off using that money elsewhere.

THE CULLING OF THE COWSREVIEWThe Culling of the Cows in a sidescroller game, in the old style that you control a old farmer with a shotgun. You can buy upgrades for your gun like special ammo. You have special assists too like Heli Support and even a Nuke. Zombie Outebreak has begun and you have to survive. Zombie Cows are everywhere and this is your objective. Kill everything in this old style fun sidescroller. There are many types of enemies including some fun ones, and there are three types of levels in the 39 that you have to play to go to the EPIC and difficulty final boss The game is pretty difficulty at all too. It`s fun, but you get bored quickly. By luck, the game end quickly too.+Fun Old-Style Sidecroller+Variety of Scenarios, Enemies and Assists+Epic final boss+Cool cartoon graphics-Becomes boring-Very short (4 hours or less to complete)-VERY expensive if you are buying-Poor soundtrackThe Culling of the Cows is a fun game for a little diversion, but is overpriced and boring 6/10 "

												* Game Key Obtained from a GiveawayIf anything this game is going to be a hit and miss affair with you, as it did with me. The game is essentially a defence title, with an assortment of monsters rushing into the barn, and as the farmer it is your job to prevent the said monstrosities from getting in. If you fail a certain number of times, the stage is over and you have to restart again.To mix up the formula some monsters act a little different to one another, along with varying amounts of hit points. To aid the chaotic game play, players can also summon a few tactical skills on the field, along with some limited and temporary upgrades to the shotgun.Repeat the same formula with increasing difficulties for dozens of stages and you get the general idea of how this goes. Every rarely you’ll get to fight a boss or two, but they’re way too simple to pose a challenge.The art style is hand drawn and mostly consistent, like the game play that may not strike everyone’s fancy either, but it sat well enough for me. The biggest problem I had with the game was that it lacked a sense of progression, you’ll upgrade your weapon level after level, but they never stick. There is also little point to divert from the main path and complete every stage, since there is nothing to unlock or to accomplish.For the low price though, I would recommend it for a decent distraction.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: The Culling Of The Cows 

			Views: 214		

			The Culling of The Cows is a Lane defense against the deadliest zombies known to man, the dreaded cow. Available Here: Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/297020/ Decaying Logic:...		

The Culling of The Cows is a lane defense zombie shoot-em-up festival.  You play as a farmer defending his barn from ever increasing waves of zombies and zombie cows. There is a large variety of what enemies you face as well as various weapons and defense assists that keep the gameplay feeling fresh.One positive addition to the game is the special achievements, which adds to the ways you can enjoy the game.  The interface is simplistic, as is the gameplay. That being said, it is high paced with a feeling of momentum, and a great threat level. If you find it too easy, there are achievements that add a new layer. It can be repetitive, and I would have liked to see a lot more maps.  The weight of your weapon has impact, and it's satisfying to see your enemies explode.This game is enjoyable, but has a feeling of 'the same'.  It is a casual game, but it does what it needs to do very well.  I never felt like my time was wasted, or that I wasn't being respected by the game.  If this game looks enjoyable to you, I can easily recommend it.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												   The Culling of the Cows stands between Plants Versus Zombies (Or old farmer vs zombie cows -- and possibly nazi aliens) and a sidescrolling shooter.   This is made by Decaying Logic, the same developers that brought us Radical Roach, which I reviewed a while ago (and was not impressed at all).   While I believe this is definitely an improvement over Radical Roach, many of the same flaws and design choices are present in this game, just to a lesser extent.    As usual, I'll start with presentation.   Not unlike their previous game, the Artstyle is probably one of the defining points. While it feels like flash, the animations are pretty good, although a bit too limited (there is only one animation for each enemy, it seems, as well as the carcass sprite, which makes the field end up looking a bit too monotonous).    The interface templates don't really seem to fit the theme, but it's not too bad. Other visuals effects are also subpar, against the cartoony style they were mostly going for.   There are a few different areas that slightly change the look of the map, but don't be fooled, as the map doesn't change at all, except for the visuals.   One problem I've had with it, is that the dead bodies cover up the screen by the end of the levels, to the point that you can't see new enemies arrive very clearly. That should definitely be changed. Other than that, it's fine.   The Music is also very similar to Radical Roach. It's not awful, and it has some good moments, but it's very repetitive, and doesn't loop very well, which is unfortunate. It's upbeat, and a mixture between some rock/metal and electronic music which goes for the more arcade vibe than atmosphere. There are some old sci-fi melodies though, which is a nice addition.    One improvement that I want to stress is that the music no longer restarts whenever you fail a level! It's a weird aspect to consider, but I think it's very important. It didn't happen in RR, and it was really annoying to listen the song start over and over again. Now, it doesn't happen, and it's a subtle but important improvement, in my opinion!   So, let's talk about the Mechanics.   As I said, it's has a bit of PvZ in it. Essentially, you have a large lane to defend agains the zombies. There are no specific lanes as in PvZ, you can freely walk around, and so can the enemies. You have a shotgun, different ammo types, upgrades, and assists. You'll also, periodically, be able to call for a crate with a random power-up.   Your job is to stop zombies from entering the barn, and also avoid being killed by them (if they hit you). Pretty straightforward.   You have a world map with the levels spread around (unlocking more as you go) with a couple of spreading paths, somewhat like One Finger Death Punch, only much smaller. These levels include a few different modes. There's Waves, in which, well, you fight waves of enemies, and there's a limit number of zombies that can enter the barn; Kill 'Em All, in which there's only one long wave and you can't let any zombie pass; Onslaught, in whichsome zombies can go through, but you have a machine gun (or a bazooka in one level) and shoot from the top of the barn, not worrying about dodging. And then, there's a couple of Boss levels.   The first two play essentially the same, with the exception that you can a few seconds to ""rest"" between waves. It had very, very little to the overall experience, but hey.   There's a significant number of different enemies, although a bunch of them are just faster or healthier versions of the previous. Still, it keeps the game interesting when starting out, since you need to change up your play a bit. Later on, new enemies stop coming, and every level becomes waay too similar (which is a feat in a 3 hour game).   There are also 3 badges to unlock in most levels -- these make the game harder, but they're barely there to reward you. There are some not to let any zombies pass, or not to miss any shot, but the others are simply about not upgrading your weapon, not using assists, etc. These do NOT make the game more fun at all. On the contrary, you're just shooting yourselves on the foot by limiting variety. It would certainly add challenge, but it's not very interesting challenge, in my opinion. But they're all optional, so it's fine. If you're into that, it exists. Overall, I'd say rethink your design on that.   Weapon upgrades are only on a level to level basis, and not persistent. You can increase the number of bullets, the number of bullets you reload at a time, add a laser to increase accuracy, or do something else that I'm not entirely sure of. I assumed it's reload speed.    Regarding ammo, you have Spread Shot, Explosive Shot, and Penetrating Shot. These do not stack, much to my disappointment. It could be really fun to have Spread Explosive Shots and just explode everything! But no... there are no synergies. If you purchase both, they'll alternate between them, from what I could tell.   Assists go from a chainsaw in the barn entrance to an AirStrike, or an Auto Machine Gun, for a few seconds. There are more to these, and they have a cooldown associated. I didn't use any of them, most of the time, because they weren't needed, nor particularly fun to use. You just press the button, and have the game made easier... But it's good that it's there, there's certainly room for different playstyles! Maybe you'd prefer not to upgrade your weapon as much, and focus on ""traps"", that's totally fine!   Ammo and Upgrades in-game cost money. And here's the big issue I have with it: You start each level with a certain amount. Then, by calling the random power-up, there's a chance you'll get a bit more, but it's generally not significant. So, you'll mostly upgrade your weapon at the start of the level, and then play with that. It's not dynamic at all, as every level played out pretty much the same to me. Sure, I could have forced myself to use different ""loadouts"", but the one I had worked for me, and the enemies didn't really require different tactics to be beaten. It would have been better to gain money over time, having waves get progressively more difficult, scaling with the upgrades you were able to buy!   Pacing is pretty much unexistant, unfortunately.   Well, maybe I'm being a bit too negative. The fact of the matter is that the game didn't do anything interesting to me. However, it was still somewhat fun for a bit. The kind of mindless fun you need to just pass time. You'll fight dozens of enemies per level, making each field become just a bunch of bloody cows on the ground. It's dumb, but it's somewhat enjoyable. Just not very interesting... Take One Finger Death Punch, for instance. That game is totally mindless fun! But it's far more interesting. First, it's very rhythmical, and you need to be in the ""zone"" to identify which enemies require which clicks to perfectly complete a level. And there are many different weapon that actually *feel* different, and make you look like a badass, cutting everyone up. I realize that these are two different games, but they both go for a similar feeling, that's why I'm bringing it up.   One aspect I enjoyed quite a lot was the last Boss. That was a pretty fun fight. Even though it had no upgrades or anything, the 3 phases complemented each other pretty well, and while challenging, it didn't feel frustrating to me. It should have had a few more boss fights, would definitely make the game more interesting.That's enough rambling. For the price, I can't recommend it at all. But if this seems appealing to you, give it a shot if the price drops. While I've beaten it in 3 hours, you can get a bit more out of it, if you go for the badges. And the developers seem to update the game from time to time, so it may get better. Overall, not awful, but not particularly good either.			"

												The Culling of the Cow is a TD game, and one that has us placed in a man v.s zombie scenario. At a first glance, it doesn’t seem too special until you realize that instead of undead humans we are battling … cows! (Moo.)I see this as a different and humorous concept. The design and art fits your usual arcade game with some blocky animations and linear movements. The effects are there and done appropriately, such as the blood. I’m satisfied that this has not been overdone, as many Zombie shooter tends to exaggerate the bloodletting. Though the amount of dead cows that build up after each wave is another story.The gameplay has a progress system where with every waves completed, brings us to a new and more difficult setting. New cows will be introduced. Item drops, assists and upgrades exist too. The overall difficulty of the game isn’t too harsh though, and there will be an eventually pattern you will find to completing each wave: whether it’s your movement or pattern of shooting, to the number of cows that will spawn.The life points and no. of cows that spawn are shown on the top of the screen during each wave, which are helpful.The BGM is full of energy, being mainly music of an electric guitar. The sound effects are there, when you shoot or hit a target. There is also a voice announcement for every wave completed and starting. All these comments pretty much wraps up my review for the game, and I do recommend others to try it out as well!			"

												ok.. i give this game a score of 51 out of 100. It's just good enough for me to give it a thumbs up instead of down. The concept is interesting. Graphic is basic. Music is ok. Level is moderately hard. My only problem is the game is way to repetitive. I was planning to play a full 3 hours and complete this game but just past the first hour i am getting really sleepy playing this even though i need to pay attention to stay alive and kill cows. I believe the level amount should be cut to around half or one third with each level have different insteresting to unlock.Such as level 1 unlock explosive ammo. level 2 unlock cartage size. level 3 unlock famrer speed. each level you still have to pay to buy ablility everything but with more ability each level it give people more interest to try it out.I seee promise in this game consider the buget but it could have been improved much more.psst... just killed the UFO. the boss fight is pretty good wish there are more than 2 boss though.

												Redneck Sammy's farm is being invaded by nasty critters. You will need to massacre wave after wave of uglies. Other than your boomstick and some upgrades, you can call in assistance (machine guns, attack choppers, bombs, ...). The game is fairly easy and progresses quickly as more difficult opponents are put against you. However things get boring quickly as you will be doing the same thing over and over again: surviving waves of opponents thrown at you. This would have been a fairly enjoyable experience if it not were for the non reconfigurable qwerty keyboard controls. On an azerty keyboard this adds a lot of complexity and frustration.Score: 3/10Pro:+ carnage!Contra:- can't configure keyboard controls			"

												What i like about this1) Easy steam achievement (doable in 2 hours)2) There's steam cards3) There's cheat console (not like there's any need to use it, its really easy to clear everystage)What I dislike about this1) seems too oldschool2) You are just an old man defending your farm and u end up going to different area and kill the ufo?3) Dislike the endingIn summary, do not buy the game at full price.... (or half price) (i got mine for free)			"

												The game is alright, nor is it horrible, nor is it unplayable. The game follows a farmer who tries to protect his barn/farm from the diseased alien cows and human zombies. The game is like a tower defense game, where you play the farmer shooting your way through hordes of cows, with a little variety here and there. The concept is okay but can get a little repetitious at certain parts.			"

												Finally! A really GOOD and FUN  free  game. I did not pay money for it but even if I did I wouldn't regret. This is an arcade shooter/tower def. game where you play as an old farmer who must cleanse the area from evil zombie cows. Hilarious, isn't it?  The Culling Of The Cows   has got:  great humor  strategic gameplay - you must not allow mobs to enter the cowshed and you can use different assists such as helicopter and wall of fire. Also you can upgrade your 12gauge shotgun  nice music  even voice acting!  great variety of enemies - from martyr cow to fat woman who eats bullets  trading cards!Maybe it is somewhat too expensive and short but when the price drops it's OK.

There's a cheat which unlocks all levels and doesn't effect the achievements, so it's possible to get 100% on this game VERY easily... if you don't mind a little cheating that is. If you would like some 2D zombie bovine action then I would recommend that you wait until this title is on offer (no matter how specifically this game meets your needs), as £8.99 is a bit steep for what you get. 5.5/10			"

												If you're vegan or vegetarian, I do not recommend this game for you. If you're an animal rights activist and are against harming cows, do not play this. If you are any of the above and you decide to play it, don't have a cow about it in the reviews section.Okay for real though...I found this game rather amusing. I haven't played much of it but I did get a few little laughs out of it. It's not much of a challenging game but it is a game that let's you kill small amounts of time (and savage cows).I see that it is currently on sale for $1.29 USD - I think that's a fair price. The asking price of $12.99 is a bit far for a game as simple as this one. I got this in a deal so I was pretty lucky. There simply can be no discussion about how 'good' the greaphics are etc, As this just feels like a mobile game. It's been done before (not sure with savage cows...) so it lacks a little creativity but I do like the farmer v cows aspect.I can see this being a great game for the younger audience though, and that is why I am recommending it. It's fairly easy to grasp and it can entertain for a little bit. I assume kids will love it and play it for hours on end. Kudos to the developer, I appreciate your hard work. Hope you had fun making it :)			"

												Good enough game for cheap. There are only one or two levels where the game feels a bit unfair, but the rest of the time, special abilities significantly manage the huge waves that can happen later on. Doing this without abilities would probably push more levels to an unfair category, but I only played for achievements. Worth a couple of hours of fun.			"

												At the beginning ou get the game because you only see 5 achivements, right? Easy game. But then, as you play you figure out it's very difficult to get the last achivement because some levels are so damn hard you just wanna rage quit when you are at the final wave and a cow somehow kills you, but you dont do that! You play it again, thats how much you start liking the game.I recommend this game because it's funny killing cows and will make you go through different phases ( rage -> stupid -> enjoyment ).			"

												The Culling Of The Cows is a short game, in which you play as a farmer during a zombie apocalypse, only that, instead of human zombies (well, there are some of them), there are cow zombies. Armed only with a shotgun, you must defend your barn from these zombies.Even though you have a single weapon through most of the game (the aforementioned shotgun), there's two extra weapons that appear in specific levels: a machine gun, and a rocket launcher. Even then, the shotgun can use four different types of ammo, and there's several upgrades for it, that make it even better at killing stuff. You can also get supply drops (like extra cash for upgrading your weapon, invincibility, etc), and use different abilities to kill the zombies, like providing your barn with a machine gun, or a saw, sending a nuke, etc.Even though the idea of shooting cows might sound dull at first, there's a good variety of enemies: different types of cows (even cows strapped with TNT, helpful for blowing up nearby cows!), and, as already mentioned, a few human enemies. There's also crows falling from the sky.As far as gameplay goes, all the levels consist of you defending your barn against waves of enemies (or against a single, large wave), with a few changes: in most of the levels, you're in front of your barn, and the cows can kill you, while in a few ""Onslaught"" levels, you shoot the cows from the safety of your barn's second floor.Nice game, once you get the hang of it. I recommend it.			"

												A very simplistic side-scrolling survival game. It's really fun and perfect for when you want to kill some time. Some of the levels can be more than challenging but you have the choice to let God assist you in different ways; also, there are cheat codes provided by the game developers, if that's something you're into ;)The achievements are fairly easy to achieve, although to get the very last one you need to complete the whole game.According to me, it's not worth 11€ (current price), so I advise you to get it during a sale!Rednecks > cows			"

												Apparently I got this for free at some point along the way, or maybe as part of a humble bundle or similar. I like the part where they don't claim the farmer suffers from mental illness and uses it as an excuse for violent behaviour </sarcasm> (despite the fact that people with mental illnesses are more likely to be *victims* of violence, than perpetrators.)Maybe it has good gameplay. Maybe the steam trading cards will be worth installing this thing and running in the background for a couple hours. But this is not the sort of game I would want to buy, and I cannot in good conscience recommend it in any way whatsoever. (Edit: Turns out I need to have run it for at least 5mins to post a review. So...)- Arrow keys (up, down, etc) don't work on main menu screen. Had to rely on controller/mouse to go down to the options screen.- On a fresh install 'Continue' is what you have to click in order to begin, rather than 'New Game'. A minor annoyance, but a very simple thing that should have been in the game.- Tutorial failed to inform me that I could shoot backwards, and skips forward to the next tip if you accidentally press A rather than showing the hint text first, even if you've never run the game before. Got insta-killed three times trying to do the first level because I was attempting to move back far enough to protect the barn from cows that managed to run past me, and found out accidentally when trying to select a different action bar option.- Spelling error on the text for the very first level after the tutorial. ""Surly"" this could have been fixed before release, or in any of the 3 updates during the year and a half since it appeared on Steam.This could have been a good game, and there's potential there... but a little bit of quality control goes a long way, and is something this game is lacking.

""GET OUT OF MY DAMN FARM!""I don't really think that after all those long reviews I did, I'll be able to write that much about The Culling of The Cows.From the creator of Pixel Puzzles, you might already know  that what you get will most probably be some kind of dead filled game with that typical old school feeling. I don't even want to call this tribute to the games that used to look like this because I feel like it's not, but what I want to call it is most probably the ""tribute"" to those B type movies from 80s about american farms, dead cows, UFOs and denim workpants with flannel shirt. That might sound stupid as hell, but I bet you saw at least one like that. And I didn't mean The X-Files. What to say about gameplay? Nothing much to be honest - 40 levels and 95% of them repetetive with no actual ""progress"" but well, you can't even be expecting that much out of arcade shooter game that requires 4 buttons to play. Different ammo types and power ups was at least those elements that freshened up the overall levels and gameplay, because kinds of animals you was facing didn't do it. Music was not good at all but you gotta hear it.  5 Achievements and Steam Trading Cards - minimum that could be done so no bonus points.Price tag is really not very-well choosen. 11€ is too much and even if it was half of that, it would be too much.Yes, I am putting thumbs up for it and it's just because there is no neutral option and it's either UP or DOWN and if you play this game as a product to get angry really fast and bored really fast that's UP, but if you want something out of that then it's THUMBS DOWN.Bonus Point: NAZI UFORating: 5/10 "

Well, I can't really say I enjoyed all 19 hours of this strangely addicting, but rage inducing game, but the majority of those hours were spent grinding 41 levels, countless stages, suicide cows, and other strange, killable... things... Overall it took 19 hours of blood, ( I actually cut my hand punching a wall in pure hatred of this game ) sweat and tears, which also almost happened, to complete 41 game levels, earning all 87 gold metals for the majority of those 41 levels and all 5 achievements. Decent game, simple, left to right shooter, easy to get to grips with, the only downfall is that the shooting isnt always too accurate, which is where the frustrations come into it. 7/10			"

 TLDR: ONLY BUY THIS ON SALE  Who knew killing cow's could be so deeply satisfying? Or so intensely frustrating? At it's core this game is a shooting gallery, but instead of shooting smiling yellow ducks, you're faced with angry rampaging zomby-cows. It's easy to get the hang of but as the difficulty starts to ramp up, so do the games flaws. Each level adds a new and tougher type of cow, as well as a new ""Divine Intervention"" ability. It is beyond annoying to reach the end of the level only to be gored by a green bull streaking across the screen. This is largely due to the poor movement controls, which are painfully unresponsive and make aiming tough. It is undeniably satisfying to litter the farmyard with cow corpses, but it's simply not worth a whole $12 (I got it from a giveaway some time ago, so I really shouldn't complain)  I would recommend this game only if you can find it under $2  "

												Side-scrolling barn defense game. Farmer Sammy has to defend his farm against hordes/herds of the undead with his handy dandy shotgun. The game can get difficult but it starts to feel repetitive afterwhile, but thats what always happens in tower defense games. Controls are easy to use, I just wish Sammy had assault rifles. Anyways thumbs up for getting this game free.			"

It's a pretty short game, you'll easily play through it all in a couple of hours and it doesn't require much thought. But it's a nice and fun gameplay and in an arcade style setting. I wouldn't buy it all full price though due to it's low content, but if you get the chance to pick it up chep or in a bundle then I'd say go for it. :)			"

YouTube™ Video: Old people are the greatest 

			Views: 15,088		

			It's true.		

(In case the video gets taken down:  Old people are the GREATEST!  They're full of wisdom and experience!)Also, old people are filled with Christianity, schizophrenia, and bad-assitude...with a shotgun!   This quest will last you about 2-3 hours.  About 5 hours if you choose to accomplish every challenge there is.  This creepy defense-based game is guarenteed to grant you quite a bit of fun.  :)Gameplay-wise, it's very similar to Get Off My Lawn...only with differences like ""Enemies hitting you results in instant death"", ""Assists from God"", ""Gun upgrades"" (Both games have ammo upgrades), and it's a side-scroller.   Personally, I found this game to be easier than Get Off My Lawn.Pros:Badass chiptune music as you blast away at the undead hordeSilly one-linersA fair variety of undead enemies to slaughterCasual with senseless violence.  Great for your down-time.Cons:Yet another zombie game (if this doesn't bother you, disregard)Replayability is a tad limited.If references to God bother you or if you're a vegetarian, you might wanna avoid this title.If you're interested in this title, I recommend waiting for a price-drop or a giveaway.  $13 is honestly too high of a price for this particular title.THANK YOU, PCGAMER!!!

												For a silly shooter defense type game where you defend your farm from cows and what not... I'd say this is a game worth playing.Many things were enjoyable such as the following:Positives:♦ Almost Each level is unique ♦ Every level you beat unlocks new enemies ♦ Every level you beat unlocks new support items♦ Unique way to upgrade weapons♦ Breaks between waves♦ Random Events in the form of a deployable Crate♦ Hilarious story and voice overs♦ Achievements for playing the game basicallyNow don't get me wrong there are many positives, but still not every game is perfect and this one has the following negative points:Negatives:♦ Accuracy of the shots are slightly off♦ Cheats which can be used to get the achievements♦ Waves per level are way too long♦ Can get repetitive quite quickly♦ Little overpriced as I got mine in a bundle and Indiegala gave it away freeImprovements:♦ Fix the Accuracy♦ Make Cheats only usable once finished the game♦ Lower Waves per round (So it feels less repetitive)Overall, in my opinion, the game is hillarious, fun and worth playing despite the accuracy of shots being slightly off and the slight repetitiveness. Though if you don't use cheats, enjoy easy to get achievements and love a laugh whilst playing a video game, then I highly recommend this for you.Overall, I'd rate this 3.5/5!PS: If you try and get all the stars for every level in the game, you'll be there for a while making this game have very godo replay value!

												This would be an amusing game, but it suffers from two problems. 1) The controls feel clumsy. Every time you fire a round you have to hit R to reload. 2) Objects all appear flat but the game is essentially 2.5D. This makes it difficult to figure out if you're shooting at something or shooting past it. These things are not game challenges as much as annoyances, so I'm afraid I have to give this one the thumbs down.			"

												Very enjoyable little defence game.You play as the stereotypical hillbilly southern redneck wielding a pump action shotgun shooting down zombie(cow)s to protect your barn.The game offers various upgrades of your shotgun and relies heavy on luck of a cooldown based drop.I enjoyed the music a lot, also the original artstyle and funny voice acting, too bad it is somewhat short.

And it doesn't matter as it's boring anyway. 10 minutes was more than enough for me.I expected light entertainment - but not as light as the cheapest flash games (which is, by the way, an offence against flash games).As such, this game would be expensive even if it was free.

Only fun u can get is kill stuff.It feels like just flash game quality, those u can just play on your browser.The game is not hard (for me), as u can see in my game record, I used only 4.3 hours.Will I replay it?Nope. At least not in a long long time.3/10 I will only recommend this game (In sale) to those who really want to spend their extra bucks.			"

												So, it's a game if you want to have fun for a while, but it's very repititive.You kill cows, spend money upgrading weapon and bullets on each level, new opponents are unlocked as you advance in levels, but it's always the same.Beated the game in 3.6 hours. Something you could play on the browser.Got it for free. Wouldn't spend 11€ to have it... not even 1€. "

												Not really a complete game as such, but more or less a suprisingly good one that also happens to include some pretty f****d up cows, crazy farmers and horribly voice acted god.Now I have to admit, the voice acting as stated before is horrible. But I think of it still as quite a humorous game and it adds up to how much I like it. The upgrades aren't really original same as abilities but still has some potential... if the devs decide to carry the game on.Pros- Pretty stupid, the story and the overall design.- Horribly voice acted, which I think is a good thing.- It's fun, as a 5 minute timewaster and nothing more. Expect this to be played for at most 3 hours and then left in your steam library and with the cobwebs growing...Cons- Fairly limited gameplay, gets repetitive.- Not completely original, the upgrades, the style of side scrolling defense and the overall feel, makes me wish this was free as a flash game.- Not entirely worth $13 USD, but if you have some money lying around when this is on sale. $3.79 (75% off) is quite the interesting deal.

												Great concept, god awful gameBasically a flash game with terrrible unforgiving hit detection. Problems start as soon as level 2 where I could have the farmer's shotgun shoved straight into one of the faster cow's nostrils and still miss and die. Aggrivating.also tower defense? WTF! Where?Even at 85% off I feel ripped off.			"

												It's a game about quick reaction, perfect execution and good split second decisions. In the zombie apocalypse, you play a farmer who protects his shed from zombie cows.It's essentially a wave defense game where you have 1 HP and have to juggle upgrades, cooldowns, ammo etc.The execution of the game is shabby but not crappy.Still I'd rather be playing something like OFDP than this.

												Great game 10/10 would play again IGNThe graphics are just insane to be honest couldn't ask for more.Context of the game is on point and the cows scare the crap out of you if you look at them dodgy.The 'cows' are going mad and you need to put a stop to it. I would recommend this game to everyone out there looking for a new game to love and cherish.This is a new development in technology and I feel that they should maybe take it up a notch and add a virtual reality feature.Thanks again for the good memories, love your game <3 "

												It's an ""okay"" game but more of a timewaster really, if you want something to play when you're bored just get this during a sale instead because I'm telling you that it's price tag isn't really that justified, it's not worth 5 or more dollars, more like a dollar fifty. It's a simple tower deffense from hordes of cow zombies and that's pretty much it. It has around 6 achievements and becomes stale quite quickly. Either way, I'm not one to recommend it. After only a few hours, if not any, I uninstalled the game. I got the game on a giveaway so it doesn't really matter to me.			"

												Homemade spghetti sauceServes: 8-10Prep time:  15 mins Cook time:  3 hours Total time:  3 hours 15 minsIngredients:3-4 cans of Crushed Tomatoes (either regular or with basil, oregano and garlic) 28 oz. sized cans OR 12-15 fresh tomatoes (peeled, chopped and blended in a food processor)4 cloves of garlicA bunch of dried basil (probably 3-5 Tbsp)A bunch of black pepper ( probably 1 - 2 tsp)1 TBSP of Sugar (optional)2 TSBP olive oil⅓ cup of grated Parmesan or Romano CheeseMinced Green Peppers (optional)Instrucktions:1.Heat the olive oil in a 5+ qt. pot over medium heat, and add the chopped or pressed garlic.Heat for one to two minutes, making sure not to burn the garlic, then add all the tomatoes, black pepper, basil and sugar. Stirring often, bring to a low boil.Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2-3 hours stirring often.For the first half of the simmer time, do so with the pot uncovered, then cover.Add the cheese, stir in and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or so.This will make the equivalent to 4-5 jars of sauce, and the cost is probably about half (and it tastes way better).- See more at: http://www.iamthatlady.com/frugal-pasta-sauce-recipe-using-hunts-crushed-tomatoes/#sthash.GRoGbHuL.dpuf "

												The Culling Of The Cows appears to be riddled with problems. The gameplay itself is repetative, with level after level of Cow Culling as one would expect from the title. Basics of the game include upgrading your weapon so as to blast the oncoming waves of cows, hippies and fat goth chicks. You would think that the gun upgrades would keep the game fresh for a little longer, but every level the upgrades are reset, and thus you just find yourself picking your favourite upgrades at the start of each level time and time again. Honestly this game is not worth the money they are asking. I got it with a 75% discount coupon, and even then I am wondering whether what I have recieved is worth it. If you purchase this game, get it for the cards (which is why I orginaly purchased it), and not for the gameplay, but it is quite a steap price merely for cards.			"

												Yeah ok this is bad. I mean I paid under $2 and I am actually a littled peeved because this should totally just be a free flash game. $12.99?? Are you kidding me? Graphics are meh, sound is bad (voices must have been recorded on a laptop or similiar), and music is really generic. I was hoping for a dumbed down version of PvZ, but nope, nothing even remotely close. Sloppy controls and an non-intuitive interface result in mostly frustrating gameplay. Even when it is not frustrating, it is boring. I played it with a controller BTW. Nothing fun at all here for me.			"

The Last Stand is a free Flash game, and it's much better than this, because it avoided Cows' glaring design flaws.The biggest problem is that you can't aim your shotgun freely - it's always pointed straight across the screen, like in an old arcade game. Even though you are clearly firing a spread of pellets from your shotgun, you have to be very careful that you're not too high or too low to hit the stampeding cow (all of which KILL YOU IN ONE HIT). Again, I'm used to this kind of system from old arcade games, but it feels unfair in this game, especially given the way that cows will run in fast at a diagonal. There's actually a laser sight upgrade for your shotgun, but it doesn't help much.Your shotgun has a high ammo capacity (especially if you upgrade it) but you have to reload each shell manually by pressing R. (This is more annoying than it sounds).You have sentry guns and such that you can activate to kill some cows for you, but you have to activate most of them at just the right time, which is not really practical with the standard mouse+keyboard controls....What's that you say? You'll just use a controller with a nice, convenient button for each trap? Nope, sorry, but controller support is AWFUL. You can only move around with the directional pad (the sticks do nothing!), and there are no dedicated buttons for the traps and upgrades. (The game actually tells you ""Controllers are for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" when you select it in the options menu. That's the quite the excuse for terrible support...)Also, the levels end up covered in so many cow corpses that it becomes difficult to tell which still need shooting (some of the basic enemies stop moving for a second or two, which ends up faking you out) and of course having to climb over dozens of their fallen cow-sisters doesn't slow them down at all.

You can only move around with the directional pad (the sticks do nothing!), and there are no dedicated buttons for the traps and upgrades. (The game actually tells you ""Controllers are for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" when you select it in the options menu. That's the quite the excuse for terrible support...)Also, the levels end up covered in so many cow corpses that it becomes difficult to tell which still need shooting (some of the basic enemies stop moving for a second or two, which ends up faking you out) and of course having to climb over dozens of their fallen cow-sisters doesn't slow them down at all.

												Repetitive, short, and far too easy.  The mechanics basically boil down to a unidirectional horde-mode shooter with Zero enemy intelligence and Zero chance for player creativity.  The ""Assists"" are so overpowered such that it would be foolish not to use them at each and every chance, and the ""Upgrades"" are so unbalanced that it would be foolish to not buy the scattershot at the soonest possible instance.  Not to mention the pre-school level shooting mechanics.  For a ""shooter"", you might expect a fair modicum of skill necessary, but nope, you shoot in a straight line, can't aim, can't angle your shot, just from left to right in a 180 Degree line rendering the whole use of the mouse completely unneccessary other than for the sole purpose of having the ""fire"" button.This would've been fine as a browser game, however, somehow it made its way to steam with an outrageous $13 price tag.  FREE is the only price I can recommend for a game like this.			"

												Whack undead cows. Whack some more. That's it.The Culling of the Cows it's built around a couple simple notions: shooting things up is fun, and nobody wants to be eaten by undead cows. The game is interesting for a while, but that fades away sooner than later, thus the thumbs down. Keep in mind that the price you pay for it is a big factor: if you get it cheap, the relation cost-value can make the purchase worthy.Credit is due to the developers for trying hard to keep this game interesting for its duration, adding elements and in-game mechanics aimed at keep things interesting, but it wasn't enough to do the trick. Again, if you are not a thirty-year older that has seen a fair share of this kind of games, your opinion may be different.			"

												Just doesn't do it for me.  There is potential but not enough to keep me curious.   No Full Controller support is a let down.  Some things a person just likes doing a certain way and I like using my thumb on the stick for moving around and not the pad.  Controller should be redefineable and its not...  Yet.  Come on guys, and add some shock vibration for those with controllers that support it.  Just adds so much more to a shooter.  Also I see someone posted in the forums back in July that there was a freezing issue.  I have had a freezing issue every time I exit and have to Ctrl Alt Del to close the program.  What a drag considering its now Sept and the programmers still havent addressed the freezing issue.  For now those are the 2 things that leave me with no need to play any more.  Bummer because I would have liked to say I have changed my mind now that I have control and the game exits gracefully...			"

												So, here I go. Everyone likes a good tower defense game and what better to have than zombies in it. Not just any zombie, but cows... freaking COWS! The game is pretty straight forward. You move and shoot. And shoot like your life depended on it. As a matter of fact, it does. You get your various ammo upgrades and some other upgrades to help you manage those incoming zekes. But, heres the best part. You get assists, ranging from 1 to 4, based on which stage you are on. You just shoot, reload and shoot some more.So, I highly recommend that you buy this game(wait for the sale though). And you kill some zombies and the odd badger or two. Goodluck.			"

												It's surprisingly fun, Culling of the Cows. Barn on the left, Zombies come from the right, kill them before they get to the barn. Survive multiple waves to beat the level, but be careful, since if the Zombies touch/hit you, you will die instantly. To compare it to another game, its a lot like the ""The Last Stand"" Flash game, and I'm talking about the first 'The Last Stand'. Also one of the more difficult parts about shooting is that you can only shoot strait ahead of your character, as in you can't use the mouse to angle his gun to the upper/lower rows.Other than the basic shooting, with your Shotgun, there are 4 other aspects in fighting. Ammo - There are 4 ammo types: Normal, Buckshot, Piercing, and Explosive. You need to pay for these. Supply Drop - When you press the Supply Drop button, a crate will fall from the air, a delivery strait from God(seriously). It can contain various temporary powerups like 10 second invincibility, Unlimited Ammo(10sec), or even basic Cash Drops. When a Drop is called, the ability is placed on cooldown, and can be pressed again when it goes off the cooldown. This is free to use. Assists - This is where God himself, I'm serious here, helps you out. Like placing a giant saw in front of your barn door to kill advancing zombies, or a turret that randomly shoots, or a wall of fire in the middle of the screen. They are brief, like 10 seconds or something, and go on a cooldown after used, but they're useful. These are Free to use. Upgrades - These are 4 simple upgrades for your Shotgun, they are: Clip Size, Reload Speed, Shoot Speed, and a Laser Pointer. You need to pay for these.Each level you start out with a certain amount of cash. These can be used on the Ammo or Upgrades. You can get more cash from Supply Drops. The higher the level, the more you start with. And for the record, Ammo and Upgrades to not transfer to other levels.I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed The Last Stand, or anyone who likes this type of game.			"

												There is something infinitely rewarding about slaughtering so many zombie cows that you can't see the ground texture anymore. COTC is simple and harkens to the classic flash game setup, but one thing that most can't deny is that it's downright polished, and lovingly polished at that. You have a shotgun. God supports you with farming equiptment and artillery strikes. There is a nazi UFO flying around. There are cows. Zombie cows. There are also some normal zombies sometimes. No one cares about those. You shoot them til they're all dead, as of God's urging. This is all you need to know, and honestly, it's not for everyone. The insanely cheap pricetag demands some respect, and there is a surprising amount of content to be had, with a wide variety of levels and challenges, on top of some badge challenges that, while have no incentive, are a fun thing to try and aim for. There are multiple shell types, and each are fun to mess around with, but the buck shot is usually your best bet. You get the point.The artstyle is absolutely lovely, and the voicework, while obnoxious after a point, is surprisingly competant and hammy.There is an ending, and an overall plot, which has a kind of sweet if you can get past the final boss (it's a doozy, trust me), but for basic stupid arcade slaughter, you'll absolutely get your money's worth. Not for everyone, and arguably not worth the full price.Definitely looking forward to whatever the developers do that isn't a bunch of jigsaw puzzles.  "

												Game has some quirky humor here and there to help rile things up a bit. I also like the overall art style and atmosphere. Neither of these help to save the gameplay though which I found very redundant and at times overly difficult. The main reason I wouldn't recommend this game though is simply because of the small and incosistent hit point of the shotgun. I often miss shots that I feel I should've gotten from this and this gives away the fact that this an indie game. I don't know if this was on purpose to make the game more difficult or this is something that resulted in amateur programming but for me this was a gamebreaker. It's a shame too as I felt the game would've been really fun if it wasn't for the shooting hit points.			"

												The Culling of the Cows is... well bland.I’m not sure exactly what the genre would be called; you are an old farmer with a shot gun taking out mutant/zombie cows before they can reach the barn behind you. It’s the kind of goofy flash game you would see on Newgrounds back in the day, but not one you would ever be expected to pay for. The movement is a little stiff and the shots don’t actually seem to register correctly about 1/3 of the time, which is exacerbated by the flat south park-esque characters giving you no good indication of depth down range. I played it for around 20 or 30 minutes and was quite bored, then booted it back up when I noticed an announcement on the Library page: Cheat Codes Added. Generally cheat codes end up ruining the fun of a game, but in a game like this maybe skipping to the excitement would keep me engaged for at least a while longer. I activated God Mode, unlocked all the upgrades, and added an MG nest to the top of the barn; awesome right? Except it wasn’t. There wasn’t any big spectacle, the MG was anemic at best, and God Mode only lasted roughly 15 seconds.I don’t know if I’m missing something or if there are some shady things going on because the overall consensus is Very Positive at the time of writing this. I got this as a free key from some bundle website a while back and I almost regret having it in my library. It functions enough to be acceptable on a flash game website but I’ll be hiding it in my Steam library and never touching it again.			"

Only five achievements, all are very easy to obtain.

												 As many of us are aware, the ""indie developer"" scene is exploding as of late when it comes to game creation. With so many independent companies trying to stake their claim in the gaming world, it's tough to keep track of games that are truly worthy of attention, versus those that are... well... just white noise. Among these developers is a company by the name of Decaying Logic, and they have created a unique take on the sidescrolling shooter with ""Culling of the Cows.""     ""Culling of the Cows"" is game that is based around, you guessed, killing hordes of livestock that seem to have been infected or otherwise possessed by some strange force. Rather than feeding on hay or grass like their ""more alive"" brethren, the cattle of CotC prefer the taste of meat. Thankfully though, ""God"" and his newly appointed tool of destruction, Sammy, have something else in mind: to eliminate the existence of these flesh-craving, ravenous bovine zombie hordes. The entire game revolves entirely around this idea and it is very well executed in doing so.     Through each level, the player is given the option to choose between several different types of ammo that range from the typical 12 gauge buckshot, all the way up to exploding rounds. These ammo types can be purchased with the in-game credits that are given to Sammy at the beginning of each level. Not only does Sammy old boy get credits at the start of each stage, but he also has the chance to earn more by supply drops. Supply drops give the player a random chance to get certain temporary upgrades, such as the aforementioned credits as well as ammo reloads or speed boosts just to name a few. On top of these supply drops (if the level permits) Sammy can call upon God to rain down various ""miracles"" which, in all honesty, is pretty much a full military arsenal to rain down death upon the infected livestock. The fun doesn't stop there though!     Aside from all of the neat little upgrades and quirky buffs given to the player, there is also quite the selection of enemies. Some easy to kill like the typical black cow, while others... well... they need a little more ""convincing"" in order to admit defeat at the hands of our hillbilly protagonist. The levels are numerous and the entertainment value can be described as somewhat worthy. At times, the game will seem to get redundant, but it's definitely a must-have if you are in the mood for getting your hands dirty with a little mindless arcade ""shoot to kill"" action.     As far as true replay value goes, there might be some to be considered. Given the short nature of the game, speed runs can most definitely be considered. Or... if you wanna try your hand at a perfect run on every level, that is most certainly an option as well!   Overall, Culling of the Cows makes its unique mark on the Indie Dev world and although it is rather short in gameplay length, the features that are included make it well worth the price. Whether you are looking for a time killer, or wanting a new ""speed run"" challenge to compete with friends with, or even just looking for a good challenge to achieve that perfect score, CotC definitely delivers.For more information on Culling of the Cows, or to download the game for yourself, please visit:http://decayinglogic.com/the-culling-of-the-cows/Be sure to check out my other content!YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qABlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/Tumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/Follow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming			"

												Neat little survival game, kind of like The Last Stand, some may know it. You have a base, which is a barn, obviously, and you got to keep the undead cows away from your barn using your shotgun. You can upgrade it with money you get at the beginning of each level, but it isn't much, and gaining extra dosh in a level is rather RNG based, so you got to make those upgrades count.Anyways, you can also buy other ammo types, use assists that may help you out in a pinch, ask for a supply drop which gives money or a powerup.There are quite few game modes, not just the usual survive-for-x-waves. After completing a level you unlock the next one(s) and play those! You'll start getting more money to upgrade your weapon, but new cow types are also introduced so the game wouldn't get boring and it works. There are fast cows, exploding cows, drunk cows etc…All in all an amazing game. I mean, instead of zombies you have cows!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												This is a typical wave based 2D shoot em up. It has a funny little gimmic which is basically a nazi ufo turns the cows into zombies. So it's not that serious.  Graphics:  The art style is okay, nothing special. Looks like a flash game. Sound:  The enemies have good sounds (except that annoying crow) just like the weapons. I think the voice over work is rly cheesy sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. The music is repetitive as hell you won't stand it longer than like 2,3 levels. The problem is basically there is a 30 sec loop and nothing else except for the menu music.  Gameplay:  You have to shoot down cows and other enemies in front of you. There are many types of enemies like super fast cow, tank cow, a crazy cow that comes at you in a crisscross and many more. So the enemy variety is good. But the algorithm is easy: Is this guy ahead of the others? -> shoot OR is this guy faster than the others? -> shoot that first.There are game modes like simple turret sectons, boss fights, 1 big wave, normal wave. You can upgrade your shotgun in the previous 2. There are ammo types like birdshot, buckshot, slug... each is different but I think the buckshot is your bread and butter because it shoots in a cone. And the awkward hit detection (or the sense of position I'm not sure) is really annoying and it puts you out of the mood. You can also upgrade your ammo capacity, reload speed, fire rate, and you can attach a laser pointer on your shotgun. These upgrades can be obtained by your starter and drop money. You can also call for a care packege which contains money or powerups like unlimited ammo, unlimited health, slomo... for a limited time. But I walked through them almost every time because of the awkward sense of position.You can also call aids like air strike, napalm barrels, nuke and other over the top stuff. The game gets really repetitive after 30-60 minutes. There is only one level type (The Farm) but it indicates like there will be other themes but no... just the farm.  Replayability:  There are achievements per stage but you mustn't use the upgrade system or the aid system to earn these which defeats the only good thing in the game. Overall:   Pros:   Setting Nice upgrade system and air support bonuses Gore Trading Cards Casual fun time for a few hours  Cons:   Only 1 weapon (except for the turret segments) Annoying hit detection and sense of position Music is bad and repetitive Lack of variety in levels Questionable game design The Extras menu leads you to nowhere... HIgh price! Verdict:  It's not worth 11 euros for sure. If you want some mindless fun for a few hours then buy it on a sale. I had some fun but I had many many frustrated moments as well. It's an average game at best. Won't kill you but won't save you. My recomendation is neutral but the actual price lowers it a little bit. Oh and if you want to play it the ""fun"" way it lasts 2 hours.			"

												First let me say that although I recommend this game, it is solely because of the good gameplay. I was able to get this game for free and I enjoy it. Would I pay 13 bucks for a game like this? Absolutely not. This game is some old school flash game fun. You're a farmer killing zombie cows and hippies with shotguns while yelling random things about Alex Jones and such. You have ammo and weapon upgrades along with support each level in the form of sentry guns and stealth bombers. It's pretty much your average tower defense shooter. All in all it provided me with a good afternoon's worth of entertainment. I enjoyed it, but the price is way too steep. I would only pay 5 dollars tops for a game of this caliber. If you are going to purchase it, then you should wait until a steam sale lowers the price or something, because 13 dollars is a crime for the amount of content you're getting with this game.			"

												Repetitive, uninspired, shoot the waves until they're done, then do it again. Fun for about three levels, then you're doing the same thing over, and over, and over again, until you get to the end. On the plus side, the five achievements can be gotten just by playing normally through the entire game, which should take seven hours or less. So there's that.			"

I don't think many people share my taste in games. I showed this to my brother and he thought it was the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game he'd ever seen. The game mechanics are simple. You are in a 2.5 dimension map shooting cows. You get one shoted by the cows so timing is pretty important.I don't think many people will enjoy this game.			"

												If you can get this game for free or with a huge discount - then you can go and grab it. Otherwise it's way too expensive for what's inside of it technically and content-wise. Had fun for some hours just because of the game setting and that that the game is (feels?) as a TD'ish game and I absolutely love TD games.- The hitboxes seem to be a bit off (so does the airdrops) - you have to get used to them and that doesn't really happen in one wave/round.- Levels are more or less repetitive: once you discover that ""6"" + ""z"" + ""x"" maxed out = ezbash, you don't have much of a thrill to play, since you don't have to aim with it accurately anymore.- Variety of ... cows (among them also fat goth chicks) and hippies/basballers is poor - you get to meet most of them in first levels already.- Not much of an explanations on what does each upgrade exactly do (or did I missed that part out?).- It's definitely not worth 10,99€ price- No replay value whatsoever- Sounds and music gets annoying at times+ Although it has it's (plenty of) minuses, it's still fun (for no reason) to mow down everyone's hated cow-zombies+ Simplicity of the game mechanics makes it easy to finish (not really rapidly growing difficulty until last boss) in less than 4 hours+ Somewhat nice visuals (although, as already mentioned in other reviews - looks more as a flash game)+ Last bossTL;DR75% off, fix hitboxes and I'd recommend it.

												So after the 2nd try, i don't know HOW, i manage to give the game a last try.and i kinda like it.3 things the game needs improving.1) MORE ACHIEVEMENT PLEASE!!!!!! so much potencial to make like +/- 30+ achievements, check the discussions areas and vote for more achievements.2) Workshop, a good game is done WHEN players get to add mods, skins, weapons, etc etc. If the game is ment to be played by the consumer, the consumer HAS to be a part of the development, we can add new and creative ideas to the game making it more appealling.3) more low resolution options, i play 1024x400 or so and it hurts my FPS's adding a res of 800x400 / 640x480 WOULD help me out, cuz my graphic card is 256mb on laptop (main gamming pc).rather then that it's kinda fun =3			"

												 As many of us are aware, the ""indie developer"" scene is exploding as of late when it comes to game creation. With so many independent companies trying to stake their claim in the gaming world, it's tough to keep track of games that are truly worthy of attention, versus those that are... well... just white noise. Among these developers is a company by the name of Decaying Logic, and they have created a unique take on the sidescrolling shooter with ""Culling of the Cows.""     ""Culling of the Cows"" is game that is based around, you guessed, killing hordes of livestock that seem to have been infected or otherwise possessed by some strange force. Rather than feeding on hay or grass like their ""more alive"" brethren, the cattle of CotC prefer the taste of meat. Thankfully though, ""God"" and his newly appointed tool of destruction, Sammy, have something else in mind: to eliminate the existence of these flesh-craving, ravenous bovine zombie hordes. The entire game revolves entirely around this idea and it is very well executed in doing so.     Through each level, the player is given the option to choose between several different types of ammo that range from the typical 12 gauge buckshot, all the way up to exploding rounds. These ammo types can be purchased with the in-game credits that are given to Sammy at the beginning of each level. Not only does Sammy old boy get credits at the start of each stage, but he also has the chance to earn more by supply drops. Supply drops give the player a random chance to get certain temporary upgrades, such as the aforementioned credits as well as ammo reloads or speed boosts just to name a few. On top of these supply drops (if the level permits) Sammy can call upon God to rain down various ""miracles"" which, in all honesty, is pretty much a full military arsenal to rain down death upon the infected livestock. The fun doesn't stop there though!     Aside from all of the neat little upgrades and quirky buffs given to the player, there is also quite the selection of enemies. Some easy to kill like the typical black cow, while others... well... they need a little more ""convincing"" in order to admit defeat at the hands of our hillbilly protagonist. The levels are numerous and the entertainment value can be described as somewhat worthy. At times, the game will seem to get redundant, but it's definitely a must-have if you are in the mood for getting your hands dirty with a little mindless arcade ""shoot to kill"" action.     As far as true replay value goes, there might be some to be considered. Given the short nature of the game, speed runs can most definitely be considered. Or... if you wanna try your hand at a perfect run on every level, that is most certainly an option as well!   Overall, Culling of the Cows makes its unique mark on the Indie Dev world and although it is rather short in gameplay length, the features that are included make it well worth the price. Whether you are looking for a time killer, or wanting a new ""speed run"" challenge to compete with friends with, or even just looking for a good challenge to achieve that perfect score, CotC definitely delivers.For more information on Culling of the Cows, or to download the game for yourself, please visit:http://decayinglogic.com/the-culling-of-the-cows/Be sure to check out my other content!YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qABlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/Tumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/Follow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming			"

												It's surprisingly fun, Culling of the Cows. Barn on the left, Zombies come from the right, kill them before they get to the barn. Survive multiple waves to beat the level, but be careful, since if the Zombies touch/hit you, you will die instantly. To compare it to another game, its a lot like the ""The Last Stand"" Flash game, and I'm talking about the first 'The Last Stand'. Also one of the more difficult parts about shooting is that you can only shoot strait ahead of your character, as in you can't use the mouse to angle his gun to the upper/lower rows.Other than the basic shooting, with your Shotgun, there are 4 other aspects in fighting. Ammo - There are 4 ammo types: Normal, Buckshot, Piercing, and Explosive. You need to pay for these. Supply Drop - When you press the Supply Drop button, a crate will fall from the air, a delivery strait from God(seriously). It can contain various temporary powerups like 10 second invincibility, Unlimited Ammo(10sec), or even basic Cash Drops. When a Drop is called, the ability is placed on cooldown, and can be pressed again when it goes off the cooldown. This is free to use. Assists - This is where God himself, I'm serious here, helps you out. Like placing a giant saw in front of your barn door to kill advancing zombies, or a turret that randomly shoots, or a wall of fire in the middle of the screen. They are brief, like 10 seconds or something, and go on a cooldown after used, but they're useful. These are Free to use. Upgrades - These are 4 simple upgrades for your Shotgun, they are: Clip Size, Reload Speed, Shoot Speed, and a Laser Pointer. You need to pay for these.Each level you start out with a certain amount of cash. These can be used on the Ammo or Upgrades. You can get more cash from Supply Drops. The higher the level, the more you start with. And for the record, Ammo and Upgrades to not transfer to other levels.I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed The Last Stand, or anyone who likes this type of game.			"

												I got this through a giveaway, absolutely not worth the asking price of $13/€11, or even half of that, due to being very short and easy. This could easily have been a free flash game on Newgrounds and probably would have been a few years ago.That said, the game is a lot of fun for what it lasts (about 2 hours). Anyone who loved Plants VS Zombies will feel right at home with the general atmosphere and charm that pervade it.The game could have definitely used a little more playtesting; not because it's broken or anything, but because of how easily exploitable it is: the spread gun (activated by pressing 6 on the keyboard) is incredibly overpowered, and will easily dispatch hordes upon hordes of enemies without any difficulty, completely eliminating the need for accuracy. Couple that with readily accessible upgrades for larger magazine, faster reloading and fire rate, and you will soon put up a barrage of fire that won't let anything through.Also overpowered are the special ""killstreaks"", like sentry guns and helicopters, which are fine per se, but have cooldowns that are way too short, making them easy to spam, especially when you get four slots of them.Extra challenge is available under the form of medals for each level, daring you to play without upgrading your gun or using any special ability, although as far as I could see, the game doesn't seem to offer any reward for completing them.Definitely get this while it's free or when on sale for under 2 bucks for an evening of quality uncomplicated entertainment, just do not fork out the absurd $13 asking price which, in the end, is the only major flaw of this cool little game.

												Oh god, people spent $12.99 on a crappy mobile port? Good thing I got this for free. If you're into ridiculously overpriced mobile ports with an eighth-grade humor level (the promise of Nazi spaceships isn't really filling me with much confidence), this is the game for you. Otherwise, the rest of the store is over that way.			"

												Crappy hit detection kills this game, there is simply no depth of field telling me where I can hit enemies, a simple shadow effect on the ground could have done the game wonders.On the other hand, the whole 'Standard Issue' challenge that I've yet to see give any reward other then the challenge continues to frustrate me to no end, and otherwise makes all the creative upgrades of the game fly out the window when I'm forced to use the basic shotty on every level or feel like I'm not playing the game to my best.I wish I could like this game, but it's rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I have to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over not hitting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cow with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun thanks to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ depth perception....♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Ugly artstyle and graphics, monotonous gameplay that becomes repetitious and stale rather quickly, with a difficulty curve that makes it a chore to restart if you die. The only sense of progression is ""Hey I beat a stage, let's go to the next of 40""; upgrades are tied to individual stages so knowing you'll always start at base settings each stage is disheartening. A disappointment that reminded me why I abandoned it the last time I played Sammy's sad adventure.			"

												I like the artstyle a lot, seems to be handdrawn which is cool.The  game itself is really fun, although I'm having a problem getting some of the level achievements, 2nd map I missed no shots but still got a failure on that one but no biggie.The music really fits the atmosphere of hellish cows trying to  take over your barn, made my head nod.Else I didn't have any problems gameplay wise, you'd think it would be hard to line up the shots but it's actually pretty precise, you can even shoot behind you in case you missed a cow.This game isn't easy but it's challenging enough to not be unfair, plus you get sentries and all that good stuff.Definitely going to play this in the future, it's a nice little casual game, too good to just be on a website so I understand it's offered as a full game.Not bad!

 The Culling Of The Cows   Pros :  Nice graphics. Some fun humor. A reasonable variety of enemies.  Cons :  Very, very repetitive. You will be frustated a times,because you die if an enemy hits you (you have only 1 chance and if you die you will repeate the level from the begging). Levels are too long. Some hitboxes are glitched. Only 3 gamemodes. "

												One of the worst games I've ever played. I can't remember how much money I must have spent on it, but even if you get it for free it's absolutely not worth it.Controls are rubbish, they cannot be changed.Item upgrades have no description anywhere, so you just have to guess.The hit detection is worse than the Holocaust.You can have power-ups or credits dropped from the sky but, again, nobody tells you that this function exists, or what each one does.There are cheat codes but they must be entered while you're fighting. You die before you can finish typing.The content is tiny, very badly done.The voice acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. And I'm not comparing it to AAA games. No. I mean this is terrible, beyond comparison. If a deaf person heard this game after getting their hearing back, they'd kill the surgeon.The music lasts 20 seconds and loops infintely, burning your brains out.There are only 5 achievements and they only require you to press a button. Stupider than Jayden Smith.It is a very poor copy of Plants vs Zombies, where you have to protect your farm (instead of house) from zombie cows AND normal zombies. But instead of having a strategy you have to remember what 12 different keys do, but also pay attention to how much money you have, otherwise you cannot press them. Plus, some have cooldowns! All of this while you're moving around the map with WASD.Oh, by the way, you have to reload constantly, but reloading takes LONGER than enemies to kill you. And this is not explained anywhere, either.It seems it's going to be a joke about rednecks, but it feels like it was made by rednecks instead.It's not even bloody enough. It feels worse than those flash games from 1997 which took 10 hours to load and then had less features than Pong. Worse than those PowerPoint chain emails they send you, which after 10 minutes of loading and scrolling through endless mail addresses, are not even funny.At first I thought I should be supportive of an indie game. Maybe they haven't got a clue how to make a game, or they just don't have the team. But I've seen Audiosurf come out of ONE person's work. And it's brilliant. You can't get more indie than Grezzo 2, and it's hilarious. If you want badly-done-on-purpose, there is Goat Simulator. Even Garry's Mod. This is just vomitive. Especially when you consider it's 9 pounds. 9 POUNDS! Which is around 13-15 dollars. For this!!And no. I don't write reviews lightly. I usually play for at least 20 hours before thinking I can give my opinion (feel free to check my other reviews). But honestly, after 5 minutes, there is nothing else to be seen.I just spent the following 40 minutes trying to get the last achievement.I'm really sorry, but for the first time ever, I'm going to award a game a negative score. -1/10 Run. Far.			"

												I got this game for free some time ago, and I have to admit that it is some of the most fun I've had in quite some time. The game is farily straightforward... survive waves of zombies (mainly cows) and complete the game. While playing, you do get all sorts of abilities and upgrades that you can make use of. The only negative critic that I have towards this game is that it's incredibly easy and can be completed in under two hours. In that sense I don't think paying $12.99 is quite worth it, also since at this stage there are only five achievements who are also very easy to accomplish. Other than that, this game is really fun to play, and I would definitely recommend anyone giving it a shot, especially if you can get the game for free :)			"

												The Culling of the Cows is... well bland.I’m not sure exactly what the genre would be called; you are an old farmer with a shot gun taking out mutant/zombie cows before they can reach the barn behind you. It’s the kind of goofy flash game you would see on Newgrounds back in the day, but not one you would ever be expected to pay for. The movement is a little stiff and the shots don’t actually seem to register correctly about 1/3 of the time, which is exacerbated by the flat south park-esque characters giving you no good indication of depth down range. I played it for around 20 or 30 minutes and was quite bored, then booted it back up when I noticed an announcement on the Library page: Cheat Codes Added. Generally cheat codes end up ruining the fun of a game, but in a game like this maybe skipping to the excitement would keep me engaged for at least a while longer. I activated God Mode, unlocked all the upgrades, and added an MG nest to the top of the barn; awesome right? Except it wasn’t. There wasn’t any big spectacle, the MG was anemic at best, and God Mode only lasted roughly 15 seconds.I don’t know if I’m missing something or if there are some shady things going on because the overall consensus is Very Positive at the time of writing this. I got this as a free key from some bundle website a while back and I almost regret having it in my library. It functions enough to be acceptable on a flash game website but I’ll be hiding it in my Steam library and never touching it again.			"

												There is something infinitely rewarding about slaughtering so many zombie cows that you can't see the ground texture anymore. COTC is simple and harkens to the classic flash game setup, but one thing that most can't deny is that it's downright polished, and lovingly polished at that. You have a shotgun. God supports you with farming equiptment and artillery strikes. There is a nazi UFO flying around. There are cows. Zombie cows. There are also some normal zombies sometimes. No one cares about those. You shoot them til they're all dead, as of God's urging. This is all you need to know, and honestly, it's not for everyone. The insanely cheap pricetag demands some respect, and there is a surprising amount of content to be had, with a wide variety of levels and challenges, on top of some badge challenges that, while have no incentive, are a fun thing to try and aim for. There are multiple shell types, and each are fun to mess around with, but the buck shot is usually your best bet. You get the point.The artstyle is absolutely lovely, and the voicework, while obnoxious after a point, is surprisingly competant and hammy.There is an ending, and an overall plot, which has a kind of sweet if you can get past the final boss (it's a doozy, trust me), but for basic stupid arcade slaughter, you'll absolutely get your money's worth. Not for everyone, and arguably not worth the full price.Definitely looking forward to whatever the developers do that isn't a bunch of jigsaw puzzles.  "

Introduction:  The Culling Of The Cows is a game very similar to what you would find on a free flash game website. It is a game in which you, playing as a farmer armed with a gun and various ""assists"", must fend off waves of enemies by moving up and down the screen, shooting in the proper ""lane"" the enemies are approaching from. While the game offered some mindless fun, I cannot fully recommend it as it does not do anything innovative to the genre, especially a genre that is overloaded with many other games (that are, not to mention, free).Gameplay:  As previously mentioned, many users of flash game websites will immediately find something familiar in the gameplay. Moving up and down the screen, you must kill the approaching enemies, which happen to be mostly cows, before they reach you or the barn behind you.Each level of the game gives you a number of credits to spend for that level specifically, with more credits being available through supply drops that can be used periodically during the level. These credits can be used to change the type of gun you are using as well as upgrade your gun. You start each level with a standard rifle that only fires in a straight line. You can purchase a shotgun, which fires bullets spread over several ""lanes"", another rifle which fires penetrating bullets, and a rifle which fires explosive bullets. For upgrades, you can improve the size of your clip, how many bullets you reload at a time, and how many bullets you fire at once. You also have the option of purchasing a laser sight for your gun. All of these upgrades are applied, even if you switch weapon types.While there are choices in weapon types and upgrades, realistically, there is not much of a choice. The credits given to you for a level - including supply drops - was never really enough to purchase multiple weapon types after purchasing the - almost required - upgrades. The shotgun is quite plainly the best weapon in the game with little point of using anything else; the ability to attack multiple lanes at once is extremely invaluable and many of the enemies that take more than one bullet to kill are all killed by one shotgun attack anyway. The only upgrades that are needed are clip size upgrades and how many bullets are reloaded at once. The laser sight is essentially useless once the player gets used to the game, and increasing the number of bullets fired at a time does not really affect anything even if not using the shotgun.An important aspect of this genre of game is the enemy types. While there is enemy variety, your gameplay style does not need to change as a result to this. It would have been interesting if a different gun type was needed for certain enemies; however, this is not the case here. Every enemy approaches in a straight line apart from one and, as mentioned before, a shotgun will kill every enemy in one hit regardless. While the game does promote ""strategic value"", it quickly becomes mindless, especially as the waves get longer and longer.Besides your gun, you also have access to assists. These assists are provided free of credits and gated only by a cooldown, with different ones being provided for each level. Nearly every assist is simply a screen clear, in a ""get out of jail free"" way. I personally felt this made the game far too easy, and only used them on a handful of occasions. To put it in comparison, the later levels give you five different assists to use, each with their own cooldown. With each of these assists clearing the screen on their own...it is highly overpowered, to the point where the player no longer needs to fire their weapon at all.Most of the levels of the game follow this format. There are ""Onslaught"" levels, which places the player in a barn and gives them infinite ammo and ""Kill 'Em All"" levels, which have one big wave opposed to several small waves. There are two boss levels, which play very similarly to the standard levels.Art & Graphics:  Shown by the screenshots, the game looks very similar to a flash game. The graphics are a bit more polished, however it is nothing special. As the playing field gets completely covered with the bodies of the zombies, it becomes more and more difficult to appreciate the graphics that do exist.Sound:  There is only one music track in the game from what I heard, and it repeats very quickly. The death sound for each enemy is always the same - the black cows always make the same sound, the green cows always make the same sound, etc. With the sheer number of enemies later on, the game quickly becomes a mess of these sounds. Even on a very low volume, I was still annoyed by this mess of sound.Replay Value:  The game took nearly three hours to complete all 40 levels. As part of a free update, each level has three ""challenges"" to complete which are revealed upon beating the level the first time. These challenges include letting no zombie into the barn behind you, not upgrading your weapon, not using assists, and not missing a shot. There are Steam achievements for the game; however these are all earned by naturally completing the game.Prismatic Complaints:  There is an ""Extras"" option on the menu that does not work. The player must press the reload button for every time they wish to reload. While most of the enemies in the game are cows, there are four non-cow enemies, slightly ruining the theme of the game.Closing:  While I do find the idea of zombie cows amusing, and the death animations for the player had me laughing, I cannot recommend this game when there are many other games that do it better while also being free.

												The hitbox on this game is god awful, which is sad seeing as how simple this game is. Also, this game is NOT worth 13 dollars. You can play flash games just as sophisticated as this for free in a million different places on the internet. I recommend you stay away from this one.			"

												The Culling of the Cows is kind of like a tower defense game, but not really. It's more like hoard mode or arena mode in various games. Basically, you are a farmer, and you shoot zombie cows. You have to manually reload, so you have to take that into consideration as you shoot. It's interesting, but it's just wave after wave of enemies with no real point but to kill more. The visual style is pixelate and 2D, so it's often hard to judge where the bullets will go. Also, it gets kind of boring and repetative after awhile. It's kind of fun though.			"

												Neat little survival game, kind of like The Last Stand, some may know it. You have a base, which is a barn, obviously, and you got to keep the undead cows away from your barn using your shotgun. You can upgrade it with money you get at the beginning of each level, but it isn't much, and gaining extra dosh in a level is rather RNG based, so you got to make those upgrades count.Anyways, you can also buy other ammo types, use assists that may help you out in a pinch, ask for a supply drop which gives money or a powerup.There are quite few game modes, not just the usual survive-for-x-waves. After completing a level you unlock the next one(s) and play those! You'll start getting more money to upgrade your weapon, but new cow types are also introduced so the game wouldn't get boring and it works. There are fast cows, exploding cows, drunk cows etc…All in all an amazing game. I mean, instead of zombies you have cows!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												 As many of us are aware, the ""indie developer"" scene is exploding as of late when it comes to game creation. With so many independent companies trying to stake their claim in the gaming world, it's tough to keep track of games that are truly worthy of attention, versus those that are... well... just white noise. Among these developers is a company by the name of Decaying Logic, and they have created a unique take on the sidescrolling shooter with ""Culling of the Cows.""     ""Culling of the Cows"" is game that is based around, you guessed, killing hordes of livestock that seem to have been infected or otherwise possessed by some strange force. Rather than feeding on hay or grass like their ""more alive"" brethren, the cattle of CotC prefer the taste of meat. Thankfully though, ""God"" and his newly appointed tool of destruction, Sammy, have something else in mind: to eliminate the existence of these flesh-craving, ravenous bovine zombie hordes. The entire game revolves entirely around this idea and it is very well executed in doing so.     Through each level, the player is given the option to choose between several different types of ammo that range from the typical 12 gauge buckshot, all the way up to exploding rounds. These ammo types can be purchased with the in-game credits that are given to Sammy at the beginning of each level. Not only does Sammy old boy get credits at the start of each stage, but he also has the chance to earn more by supply drops. Supply drops give the player a random chance to get certain temporary upgrades, such as the aforementioned credits as well as ammo reloads or speed boosts just to name a few. On top of these supply drops (if the level permits) Sammy can call upon God to rain down various ""miracles"" which, in all honesty, is pretty much a full military arsenal to rain down death upon the infected livestock. The fun doesn't stop there though!     Aside from all of the neat little upgrades and quirky buffs given to the player, there is also quite the selection of enemies. Some easy to kill like the typical black cow, while others... well... they need a little more ""convincing"" in order to admit defeat at the hands of our hillbilly protagonist. The levels are numerous and the entertainment value can be described as somewhat worthy. At times, the game will seem to get redundant, but it's definitely a must-have if you are in the mood for getting your hands dirty with a little mindless arcade ""shoot to kill"" action.     As far as true replay value goes, there might be some to be considered. Given the short nature of the game, speed runs can most definitely be considered. Or... if you wanna try your hand at a perfect run on every level, that is most certainly an option as well!   Overall, Culling of the Cows makes its unique mark on the Indie Dev world and although it is rather short in gameplay length, the features that are included make it well worth the price. Whether you are looking for a time killer, or wanting a new ""speed run"" challenge to compete with friends with, or even just looking for a good challenge to achieve that perfect score, CotC definitely delivers.For more information on Culling of the Cows, or to download the game for yourself, please visit:http://decayinglogic.com/the-culling-of-the-cows/Be sure to check out my other content!YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qABlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/Tumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/Follow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming			"

												Game has some quirky humor here and there to help rile things up a bit. I also like the overall art style and atmosphere. Neither of these help to save the gameplay though which I found very redundant and at times overly difficult. The main reason I wouldn't recommend this game though is simply because of the small and incosistent hit point of the shotgun. I often miss shots that I feel I should've gotten from this and this gives away the fact that this an indie game. I don't know if this was on purpose to make the game more difficult or this is something that resulted in amateur programming but for me this was a gamebreaker. It's a shame too as I felt the game would've been really fun if it wasn't for the shooting hit points.			"

												Got the game for freeSold the cards for $.17???ProfitI really did not like the game, its so basic and unpolished that I would not have been surprised to see it on newgrounds. I only played for maybe half an hour, after that I let it idle so that I could get the cards. Apart from my problems with the game itself, there are also:NO rebindable controlsNO selectable resolutionNO use of the mouse in game; you could have allowed us to click on upgrades, instead of using the number keys.This just screams ""first time game-maker,"" and if that is the case, keep going buddy! Keep improving and eventually, if you put enough time and effort into it, you will have something that people will want to play and support! It aint this game, though.The voice acting was surprisingly good, though.			"

												I got this game in a random key giveaway... twice! I'll have to concur that this is some Flash-quality game with its defense-based gameplay concept, which I am being reminded of some other zombie survival games you could play on a browser. As much as that brief description gives away, it's a pretty decent game that should justify for some good rating. However, the game mode variations like wave levels, rampage and onslaught don't do well enough to redeem the monotony of shooting down enemies coming from the right and I find myself yearning to get the game beat so I could move on. Fortunately, though, its short length seems justified for its limited variety of content.Speaking of contents, the gun upgrades and assists from lord above allowed me to have some fun nailing down hordes of zombies; which feature primarily cows (duh), hippies and, overweight goth girls (whose special move is funnily bizarre). The gun upgrades can be bought with credits, where your wealth depends on the level's setting and dropped supplies you get. The variety isn't much, but well enough for you to try out which fits best for certain situations. The upgrades and assists can make you OP at most in regular levels with these features, but that is the reason why the game have badges to encourage you to abstain for a more challenging gameplay experience.The soundtrack is nicely varied, which during level playthrough is appropriately pumping for the mood of shooting battleground but none too intrusive nor repetitive enough to an annoyance. I can hear some elements of bluegrass, rock and electronics being mixed in.As for the sound effects, they are relatively lo-fi but mesh well with the cartoon environment. The one-line dialogues add up to the humor, setting a lighter mood on the zombie apocalypse environment, which I find welcome enough.It's a decent game, all in all, though still simplistic gameplay-wise and lacking in variation. It might be fun for some people, although I can't recommend this game enough. The 10,99€/$ price on Steam is quite excessive for the game's content and short length, so I would rather recommend you wait for sale or, like me, get it for cheap somewhere else.			"

												The game is simple, and rather crazy.  It is also a lot of fun.  You play an old, schizophrenic farmer during a zombie apocalypse, which spreads to both cows and hippies, and you have to hold them off with nothing but your old shotgun.  And maybe some help from above.  And a barn door that turns into a chainsaw.  And so on. The game is not worth $13 though.			"

												Culling of the Cows is a 2D defense game where you defend your farm from ravenous zombie cows and what nots. It has a large map, achievements and cards. Those usually come as a positive. I got the game for free so I'm pretty satisfied. All around it's quite a solid game, however I entirely disagree with the price tag as it should be lower. >I'd give it a 7.5/10>Pros: Solid gameplay, many levels, cards and easy achievements, some sort of minigame levels so it's not the usual defense type, hand drawn(?) graphics, gets challenging.>Cons: Gets a bit boring, reset after death so you start again at wave 1 of the level you're doing, price tag.ProTip: When starting a level instantly buy your upgrades and try to get a 3$ bonus from the Care Package. Try to go with 1 level in your Z, 2 in your X, 1 in your C and finally get buckshots. Keep restarting until you get a +3$ and you're on for an easy game. Try focusing your earning on the X and Z first.			"

												 As many of us are aware, the ""indie developer"" scene is exploding as of late when it comes to game creation. With so many independent companies trying to stake their claim in the gaming world, it's tough to keep track of games that are truly worthy of attention, versus those that are... well... just white noise. Among these developers is a company by the name of Decaying Logic, and they have created a unique take on the sidescrolling shooter with ""Culling of the Cows.""     ""Culling of the Cows"" is game that is based around, you guessed, killing hordes of livestock that seem to have been infected or otherwise possessed by some strange force. Rather than feeding on hay or grass like their ""more alive"" brethren, the cattle of CotC prefer the taste of meat. Thankfully though, ""God"" and his newly appointed tool of destruction, Sammy, have something else in mind: to eliminate the existence of these flesh-craving, ravenous bovine zombie hordes. The entire game revolves entirely around this idea and it is very well executed in doing so.     Through each level, the player is given the option to choose between several different types of ammo that range from the typical 12 gauge buckshot, all the way up to exploding rounds. These ammo types can be purchased with the in-game credits that are given to Sammy at the beginning of each level. Not only does Sammy old boy get credits at the start of each stage, but he also has the chance to earn more by supply drops. Supply drops give the player a random chance to get certain temporary upgrades, such as the aforementioned credits as well as ammo reloads or speed boosts just to name a few. On top of these supply drops (if the level permits) Sammy can call upon God to rain down various ""miracles"" which, in all honesty, is pretty much a full military arsenal to rain down death upon the infected livestock. The fun doesn't stop there though!     Aside from all of the neat little upgrades and quirky buffs given to the player, there is also quite the selection of enemies. Some easy to kill like the typical black cow, while others... well... they need a little more ""convincing"" in order to admit defeat at the hands of our hillbilly protagonist. The levels are numerous and the entertainment value can be described as somewhat worthy. At times, the game will seem to get redundant, but it's definitely a must-have if you are in the mood for getting your hands dirty with a little mindless arcade ""shoot to kill"" action.     As far as true replay value goes, there might be some to be considered. Given the short nature of the game, speed runs can most definitely be considered. Or... if you wanna try your hand at a perfect run on every level, that is most certainly an option as well!   Overall, Culling of the Cows makes its unique mark on the Indie Dev world and although it is rather short in gameplay length, the features that are included make it well worth the price. Whether you are looking for a time killer, or wanting a new ""speed run"" challenge to compete with friends with, or even just looking for a good challenge to achieve that perfect score, CotC definitely delivers.For more information on Culling of the Cows, or to download the game for yourself, please visit:http://decayinglogic.com/the-culling-of-the-cows/Be sure to check out my other content!YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qABlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/Tumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/Follow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming			"

												Neat little survival game, kind of like The Last Stand, some may know it. You have a base, which is a barn, obviously, and you got to keep the undead cows away from your barn using your shotgun. You can upgrade it with money you get at the beginning of each level, but it isn't much, and gaining extra dosh in a level is rather RNG based, so you got to make those upgrades count.Anyways, you can also buy other ammo types, use assists that may help you out in a pinch, ask for a supply drop which gives money or a powerup.There are quite few game modes, not just the usual survive-for-x-waves. After completing a level you unlock the next one(s) and play those! You'll start getting more money to upgrade your weapon, but new cow types are also introduced so the game wouldn't get boring and it works. There are fast cows, exploding cows, drunk cows etc…All in all an amazing game. I mean, instead of zombies you have cows!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Way too expensive for what is just a flash sidescroller. Got it for free, but really not worth playing.That said, I did finish it, even though it wasn't really enjoyable. The controls are lazy, there are glitches in the game, some levels are particularly poorly designed. The sound effects, music, and voice commentary are annoying, and you have to disable them every time you open the game.			"

												Concept is nice, but it's just unplayable.CONS : Controls are the worst ever, even controller controls suck monkey balls.If you get hit once, you are dead. You got to restart at the beginning of the level, not even at the start of your wave.The whole game is based on shooting cows in different lanes, but the 3D is so bad you often don't even see in what lane the cow is. And the cows at the bottom run up a little, even more confusing.PRO'S: Concept is fun, but yeah...2/10 "

												Culling of the Cows is a classic base defense shooter upgrade game. However, it really falls short of what one would expect of this type of game. -The game has an alright theme which gets a little cliche with the Nazi part and the hands of God.-The music has little variety in music which gets old quickly.- The game is far too easy. The enemies don't vary too much and some of the enemies seem pointless or almost to help the player. There is not too much balance and one ammo type is incredibly OP compared to other ones and some of the upgrades are really almost useless. The actives are very very overpowered with a short cooldown. -There are three level types aside from the two boss fights and some seem to just drag on.-There are three medals to each of the levels, but as there are no achievements or rewards that help your gameplay outside of these there's little to no incentive to getting these.TL:DR - This game is a poor base defense shooter with little variety. There are many of these flash online that are much better. With the exception of maybe the steam cards and an easy perfect game (With a bit of time dragging through it) I would not reccomend paying a cent on this game.			"

												It is a fun game. Only issue I have is that it is hard to line up a shot. There were plenty of times that I would shoot at a cow, it would miss, but the cow would still impale me. If the cow was in line with me to impale me, then my shot should not have missed.Maybe add a reticle? Or laser sight? Or just fix this graphically so it makes sense. Something needs to change.			"

												This game is nuts. Zombie cows, gore, a honey badger, hippies, shotgun shooting gun, and zombie cows man. If for some reason the video they put up on the Steam page isnt enough, try some real time gameplay I recorded:


YouTube™ Video: HONEY BADGER ATTACKS! - Cullow of the Cows 2 - BrokenMonkey 

			Views: 46		

			Honey Badger attacks my farm. Honey Badger don't care. Honey Badger gonna get a face full of lead.		

My only complaints come in for the aiming. It's not perfect and it certainly feels that way when you're trying to align your shots in the path of a enemy. There are shots that miss that I could have sworn would get me a kill. Other than that, the game is so much damn fun. Great 2D shooter that keeps the action coming. Not sure if casual is the term to use for a game like this as it actually gets pretty intense at times.			"

												Although I do love this game and enjoy it, I am not recommending it due to some issues that make it not worth the price of $13. Here are the issues:Repetitiveness:Obviously in any tower-defense type of game you are going to see some repetitiveness involving the levels that you play. However, I feel that this game does an okay job when it comes to level variety. There are 3 types of levels that you can play,  but they are all basically the same type of level just with a minor change that doesn't make it stand out to the others.Lag:Although I do not usually write about lagging issues in a review due to me playing on a laptop and it usually being on my side of the experience, there is a major issue that needs to fixed ASAP. This has to do with the dead bodies left on the screen. If you notice in any other tower-defense game such as Plants Vs. Zombies for example, the bodies always disappear after a short while of sitting on the ground. This game does not do that, and I found that as I progress on through the waves of enemies, their bodies stay laying on the ground and actually cause the game to slow down and lag making it nearly impossible to successfully complete the level. So is the game fun? Yes. I enjoy this game very much cause it does a great job at being a game that is challenging while still being fun. Is it worth $13? As it stands, no. The only reason I got this game was through a key giveaway for the game and I of course enjoy free games. I was shocked however to see that the price of this game to be $13 when stopping by to write a review. The game needs a lot of work before it would be worth that price, but if you don't mind it go ahead and buy it however I will not recommend this game for these reasons.			"

												If you can get this game for free or with a huge discount - then you can go and grab it. Otherwise it's way too expensive for what's inside of it technically and content-wise. Had fun for some hours just because of the game setting and that that the game is (feels?) as a TD'ish game and I absolutely love TD games.- The hitboxes seem to be a bit off (so does the airdrops) - you have to get used to them and that doesn't really happen in one wave/round.- Levels are more or less repetitive: once you discover that ""6"" + ""z"" + ""x"" maxed out = ezbash, you don't have much of a thrill to play, since you don't have to aim with it accurately anymore.- Variety of ... cows (among them also fat goth chicks) and hippies/basballers is poor - you get to meet most of them in first levels already.- Not much of an explanations on what does each upgrade exactly do (or did I missed that part out?).- It's definitely not worth 10,99€ price- No replay value whatsoever- Sounds and music gets annoying at times+ Although it has it's (plenty of) minuses, it's still fun (for no reason) to mow down everyone's hated cow-zombies+ Simplicity of the game mechanics makes it easy to finish (not really rapidly growing difficulty until last boss) in less than 4 hours+ Somewhat nice visuals (although, as already mentioned in other reviews - looks more as a flash game)+ Last bossTL;DR75% off, fix hitboxes and I'd recommend it.

												Culling of the Cows is a lot like liquorice: you either love it or hate it.The game is a very simple, 2d classic arcade kind of game. The day I got it, me and my friend spent quite a while chilling and playing it, all the while laughing our heads off over the hilarious mistakes we made and the little funny things in the game and of course the absurdity of the concept of the game. This is a good thing mind you!!Overall, I believe the game could use more dialogue, more plot would be an interesting addition that I wouldn't mind and it would be absolutely great if I could change the control mapping on the controller; as they aren't easy to use for the later levels at all. I would also recommend a multiplayer for this game, so something like an endless mode where you get highscores and can compete locally or online. "

												Culling of the Cows is a lot like liquorice: you either love it or hate it.The game is a very simple, 2d classic arcade kind of game. The day I got it, me and my friend spent quite a while chilling and playing it, all the while laughing our heads off over the hilarious mistakes we made and the little funny things in the game and of course the absurdity of the concept of the game. This is a good thing mind you!!Overall, I believe the game could use more dialogue, more plot would be an interesting addition that I wouldn't mind and it would be absolutely great if I could change the control mapping on the controller; as they aren't easy to use for the later levels at all. I would also recommend a multiplayer for this game, so something like an endless mode where you get highscores and can compete locally or online. "

												Culling of the Cows is a 2D defense game where you defend your farm from ravenous zombie cows and what nots. It has a large map, achievements and cards. Those usually come as a positive. I got the game for free so I'm pretty satisfied. All around it's quite a solid game, however I entirely disagree with the price tag as it should be lower. >I'd give it a 7.5/10>Pros: Solid gameplay, many levels, cards and easy achievements, some sort of minigame levels so it's not the usual defense type, hand drawn(?) graphics, gets challenging.>Cons: Gets a bit boring, reset after death so you start again at wave 1 of the level you're doing, price tag.ProTip: When starting a level instantly buy your upgrades and try to get a 3$ bonus from the Care Package. Try to go with 1 level in your Z, 2 in your X, 1 in your C and finally get buckshots. Keep restarting until you get a +3$ and you're on for an easy game. Try focusing your earning on the X and Z first.			"

												This game represents an interesting idea executed very poorly.No permanent upgrades, few upgrades and enemy variety, few levels, unmemorable soundtrack.The enemies don't disappear after being killed. It is ok when you are dealing with 20 or 30 of them, but on later stages, and mainly on the granade launcher one, this is an absurd hindrance, smaller enemies will hide behind the corpses of bigger enemies and you won't see them until it is too late.This game is ok for 15 minutes, and then it just isn't anymore. You will get 4 of the achievements in 15 minutes and then have to make your way through to the last stage to get the last one and it sincerely isn't really worth it.			"

												One of the worst games I've ever played. I can't remember how much money I must have spent on it, but even if you get it for free it's absolutely not worth it.Controls are rubbish, they cannot be changed.Item upgrades have no description anywhere, so you just have to guess.The hit detection is worse than the Holocaust.You can have power-ups or credits dropped from the sky but, again, nobody tells you that this function exists, or what each one does.There are cheat codes but they must be entered while you're fighting. You die before you can finish typing.The content is tiny, very badly done.The voice acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. And I'm not comparing it to AAA games. No. I mean this is terrible, beyond comparison. If a deaf person heard this game after getting their hearing back, they'd kill the surgeon.The music lasts 20 seconds and loops infintely, burning your brains out.There are only 5 achievements and they only require you to press a button. Stupider than Jayden Smith.It is a very poor copy of Plants vs Zombies, where you have to protect your farm (instead of house) from zombie cows AND normal zombies. But instead of having a strategy you have to remember what 12 different keys do, but also pay attention to how much money you have, otherwise you cannot press them. Plus, some have cooldowns! All of this while you're moving around the map with WASD.Oh, by the way, you have to reload constantly, but reloading takes LONGER than enemies to kill you. And this is not explained anywhere, either.It seems it's going to be a joke about rednecks, but it feels like it was made by rednecks instead.It's not even bloody enough. It feels worse than those flash games from 1997 which took 10 hours to load and then had less features than Pong. Worse than those PowerPoint chain emails they send you, which after 10 minutes of loading and scrolling through endless mail addresses, are not even funny.At first I thought I should be supportive of an indie game. Maybe they haven't got a clue how to make a game, or they just don't have the team. But I've seen Audiosurf come out of ONE person's work. And it's brilliant. You can't get more indie than Grezzo 2, and it's hilarious. If you want badly-done-on-purpose, there is Goat Simulator. Even Garry's Mod. This is just vomitive. Especially when you consider it's 9 pounds. 9 POUNDS! Which is around 13-15 dollars. For this!!And no. I don't write reviews lightly. I usually play for at least 20 hours before thinking I can give my opinion (feel free to check my other reviews). But honestly, after 5 minutes, there is nothing else to be seen.I just spent the following 40 minutes trying to get the last achievement.I'm really sorry, but for the first time ever, I'm going to award a game a negative score. -1/10 Run. Far.			"

												What a waste of time..I've got this game as part of a 10 key bundle, and this was my ""premium"" game (price wise).This game is an utter joke.At first I liked the music - A bit 16bit'ish with some nice distortion.It quickly irked me once I realised the distorted sounds where allover the place.And once you get further into the game, the charm of the sad and ugly graphics quickly turns for the worse.The more enemies you kill, the more garbage fills your screen.No explanation of the different ammo types or upgrades, and the stupid assist constantly changes slots. Also, it never mentions that your own ""assist"" can kill you >.<At least you're able to mute the game, make it windowed and idle while doing other stuff (= getting the 5 free cards).If you got this game as I did (i.e: No refund option) and you want the stupid free cards (and easy 100% achievement) follow the neat guides.One, by the developer, tells you how to open the cheat menu (I could NOT figure out how to do it) but also list all the cheats.One opens up all the worlds - BOOM. Go to last level, use the guide which tells you how to skip the first two sectors and BOOM! Achievement done in less hours than I have spent.*sigh* I can't believe it took me 3hours of grinding before I finally ""cheated"" and went looking at the guides.Save yourselves some time, and just blatantly ""cheat"" through the achievements.Very bad game.Very bad price tag.I sincerly hope you didn't buy this game by your own choice.Having a boner and no arms > This game.

												Eventhough I got it for free and I shouldnt really complain, this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥ing garbage.So, I got this for free through the Indiegala monthly free game, and I played it the second I downloaded it. The screenshots show a variety of enemies and powers. However, theres almost no way you can make it there without throwing up.First of all, the hitboxes are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ and in a game where hitboxes are necessary to any degree of success makes it barely unplayable. What makes it worse is that the side bosses that require consistent hits will rip you apart almost everytime.Secondly, its so godamn repetitive, the starting enemies for the first 10 or so levels have little to no variety, some run faster, some explode, its generally uncreative stuff. The carcasses of these zombified cows only make it worse, they only dull down the otherwise decent backround artwork.Lastly, theres barely any variety in weaponry. Sure theres different types of ammo, but its still essentially a shotgun, that shoots inconsistent pellets that barely spread. So, the pros come as follows, the backround art is relatively decent, and the variety of types of defence spices the game a bit, however the uncreativity in the enemy variety just nullifies it.So, do I recommend this game? If you can deal with♥♥♥♥♥♥hitboxes, and you can get used to the repetitiveness, then sure, but I couldnt even finish more than 10 levels.			"

 The Culling Of The Cows   Pros :  Nice graphics. Some fun humor. A reasonable variety of enemies.  Cons :  Very, very repetitive. You will be frustated a times,because you die if an enemy hits you (you have only 1 chance and if you die you will repeate the level from the begging). Levels are too long. Some hitboxes are glitched. Only 3 gamemodes. "

												TL;DR: Simple fast-paced, albeit short, wave defender. I'd advice to get it on discount.In Culling of the Cows you slaughter hundreds of cows, a couple of badgers and also some hipsters. All of them are zombies though. There's a reason for that revealed at the end but it's totally ridiculous like the whole idea itself. For whatever reason you don't want the monsters in your barn. You got to go through the farm utterly destroying all the undead bovine life forms with your trusty shotgun and (!) the muda♥♥♥♥ing airforces.Perhaps surprisingly, this is rather fun and enjoyable. Voice acting is horrible though but for that matter the game lasts only couple of hours even if you try to ace everything.Every level you begin with a shotgun shooting slugs. God promises to sell you better weapons and help along the way because he's a such good guy. He also sends you money to pay for all the stuff. Then you proceed to kill all the enemies rampaging towards you. You got to reload manually so proceed with care and precision. This can be annoying as the hitboxes are quite small. This also makes the spread-out ammo upgrade super useful.Frankly, you can only shoot forward and you're slow at walking, so sometimes you can't prevent a cow from passing or indeed killing you. This is where assists come in: you can call up airforces, bombings, sentry guns, fire walls, all kinds of overpowered defenses that will mostly take care of your job for you, with brief cooldowns in between. Still it often takes another try to ace any level, especially since that means you can't buy some overpowered weapons.It wouldn't stay fresh for long but fortunately it's also quite short, the 40 levels taking only some 2-3 hours to ace. However, the short length is also a curse: it's not really worth the full price. However, at a decent discount or in a bundle, go for it.			"

												One of the worst games I've ever played. I can't remember how much money I must have spent on it, but even if you get it for free it's absolutely not worth it.Controls are rubbish, they cannot be changed.Item upgrades have no description anywhere, so you just have to guess.The hit detection is worse than the Holocaust.You can have power-ups or credits dropped from the sky but, again, nobody tells you that this function exists, or what each one does.There are cheat codes but they must be entered while you're fighting. You die before you can finish typing.The content is tiny, very badly done.The voice acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. And I'm not comparing it to AAA games. No. I mean this is terrible, beyond comparison. If a deaf person heard this game after getting their hearing back, they'd kill the surgeon.The music lasts 20 seconds and loops infintely, burning your brains out.There are only 5 achievements and they only require you to press a button. Stupider than Jayden Smith.It is a very poor copy of Plants vs Zombies, where you have to protect your farm (instead of house) from zombie cows AND normal zombies. But instead of having a strategy you have to remember what 12 different keys do, but also pay attention to how much money you have, otherwise you cannot press them. Plus, some have cooldowns! All of this while you're moving around the map with WASD.Oh, by the way, you have to reload constantly, but reloading takes LONGER than enemies to kill you. And this is not explained anywhere, either.It seems it's going to be a joke about rednecks, but it feels like it was made by rednecks instead.It's not even bloody enough. It feels worse than those flash games from 1997 which took 10 hours to load and then had less features than Pong. Worse than those PowerPoint chain emails they send you, which after 10 minutes of loading and scrolling through endless mail addresses, are not even funny.At first I thought I should be supportive of an indie game. Maybe they haven't got a clue how to make a game, or they just don't have the team. But I've seen Audiosurf come out of ONE person's work. And it's brilliant. You can't get more indie than Grezzo 2, and it's hilarious. If you want badly-done-on-purpose, there is Goat Simulator. Even Garry's Mod. This is just vomitive. Especially when you consider it's 9 pounds. 9 POUNDS! Which is around 13-15 dollars. For this!!And no. I don't write reviews lightly. I usually play for at least 20 hours before thinking I can give my opinion (feel free to check my other reviews). But honestly, after 5 minutes, there is nothing else to be seen.I just spent the following 40 minutes trying to get the last achievement.I'm really sorry, but for the first time ever, I'm going to award a game a negative score. -1/10 Run. Far.			"

												This game represents an interesting idea executed very poorly.No permanent upgrades, few upgrades and enemy variety, few levels, unmemorable soundtrack.The enemies don't disappear after being killed. It is ok when you are dealing with 20 or 30 of them, but on later stages, and mainly on the granade launcher one, this is an absurd hindrance, smaller enemies will hide behind the corpses of bigger enemies and you won't see them until it is too late.This game is ok for 15 minutes, and then it just isn't anymore. You will get 4 of the achievements in 15 minutes and then have to make your way through to the last stage to get the last one and it sincerely isn't really worth it.			"

That moment is the only reason I picked this up at all (well that and it was pretty heavily discounted at the time). Is it worth it? -  For $13?  Heh, GOD no.  But if you find it on a decent sale, go ahead. P.S.Achievement hunters will probably like the easy 100% as wellYa'll have fun!			"

The Culling Of The Cows is a 2D Shooter.“Hilarious in its purest essence” NerdMaldito Yes, it's hilarious. You start the game as an old farmer trying to protect your barn with a shotgun. Then you fight some waves of cows.. Zombie Cows! They will try to pass through you and you must shot them down so they can't enter the barn. In each level, the difficulty increases until the very end when the Nazi UFO comes to beat you.Pros:- Funny game - Easy to understand - Challenging (to get all the achievements)Cons:- The price makes no sense- The game is short- A co-op would be fun			"

												Ugly artstyle and graphics, monotonous gameplay that becomes repetitious and stale rather quickly, with a difficulty curve that makes it a chore to restart if you die. The only sense of progression is ""Hey I beat a stage, let's go to the next of 40""; upgrades are tied to individual stages so knowing you'll always start at base settings each stage is disheartening. A disappointment that reminded me why I abandoned it the last time I played Sammy's sad adventure.			"

												I got this game in a €1 10game pack on♥♥♥♥♥during a sale. that is a fair price €0.10 I wouldnt pay anymore for it. how decent it may be I do feel like this game belongs somewhere on the internet as a free browser game. this game is better suited as a joke game gift (maybe if it was on sale). I just don't like games like this.			"

The Culling Of The Cows is a 2D Shooter.“Hilarious in its purest essence” NerdMaldito Yes, it's hilarious. You start the game as an old farmer trying to protect your barn with a shotgun. Then you fight some waves of cows.. Zombie Cows! They will try to pass through you and you must shot them down so they can't enter the barn. In each level, the difficulty increases until the very end when the Nazi UFO comes to beat you.Pros:- Funny game - Easy to understand - Challenging (to get all the achievements)Cons:- The price makes no sense- The game is short- A co-op would be fun			"

												They really don't hide much from you, a red neck farmer killing zombie cows...with nazi spacecraft thrown in for good flavor.It's absurd and strange, a kind of stupid fun that won't keep you around very long but fufills the 'What the hell is this?' moment we all have sometime.  That moment is the only reason I picked this up at all (well that and it was pretty heavily discounted at the time). Is it worth it? -  For $13?  Heh, GOD no.  But if you find it on a decent sale, go ahead. P.S.Achievement hunters will probably like the easy 100% as wellYa'll have fun!			"

												The whole concept is pretty good. Graphics, animations, sounds - decent for an indie game. But the controls are very clunky.Is it worth it for 11€? Certainly and absolutely not! Better grab it in some kind of a cheap bundle or on a massive discount. "
