												Cubetractor is an action strategy puzzle game where, you guessed it, you have a lot of interactions with cubes. The game was released in May 2013 and a lot of people will probably have this game already due to it featuring quite often in bundles over the past couple of years. The game play looks very simple from the screenshots on the store, but there is actually quite a bit of depth to this little title. You are in control of a little robot who can move cubes around the map using his tractor beam, these cubes can either be used to out right destroy enemies, combined to create turrets or barriers and even be used to cause harm to yourself if you aren’t careful.  The blocks will continue to move in the direction you pulled them until they come into contact with something, so you have to be really tacticful with how you interact with them sometimes. If they don’t hit anything, they will tend to respawn after a few seconds in their original spot.  The game play is really pusating and enjoyable, some very fast paced action can be seen throughout your play though of this game. The art style is really pleasantly presented. The 8bit theme is pulled off very well, along with some really nicely done animations and lovely sound effects. There isn’t any spoken dialogue, simply because it isn’t needed. Cubetractor surprisingly has a very interesting story line. The robot you play as is trying to escape to freedom, you do this over the course of completing your exams for robot school? I would strongly recommend people read the dialogue between the main characters in the game as there are some great lines to be seen. Silly enough, the robots who built you failed to think about putting some sort of self-destruct feature in your build, so they are forced to sit back and hope you fail your exams and destroy yourself. The game is difficult to say the least, once you complete the tutorial you are pretty much thrown in at the deep end. I might add that the tutorial is done very well and explains the mechanics of the game to a level which allows you to keep up with the early levels but also doesn’t hold your hand throughout.  Once you get past the first 10 or 15 levels, a lot of the game play is luck based and how quick you are on your feet with the amount of bullets flying around your screen from enemy turrets and mobs. I have been playing the game for about three hours now and have just finished the game. There is a side of me that thinks I will want to jump into the game at some point to maybe work on a few achievements given how easy the game play is to just pick up and play as well. I would personally say Cubetractor is a neat little indie title that could quite easily find a place in most people’s library. I would definitely say it is worth the £6,99 price tag, but you can quite easily pick this up on sale for much lower on other sites.

												This is a great game.I love the pixelated art and the simple gameplay.You play as a robot and your job is to pull cubes.As the game progress you can combine cubes to make a cannon, wall, power plant, etc...This game is quite hard too. You need to consider where you build your things to maximize your your power.To get perfect score (4 stars) you have to finish the level flawlessly (collect all the batteries, finish below the time limit and taken no damage at all).

												If you're willing to dig into mechanics that'll make you count distance and learn the timing on when to fling what where, this is a fun game where you're dodging and combining objects to make protection/offense against the environment to solve puzzles and survive. It's also exceedingly cutesy.If you're not, though, you'll probably get tired of this a few stages in like I did. Doesn't make it a bad game, just makes it not my cup of tea.Other cool facts: game has a ranking system which is pretty good and also doesn't expect you to get ALL THE STARS every time - the highest rank can be earned from minute one of the game, but clearly is designed for a replay once you've gotten good at it (they require obscenely tight timing + offing all enemies and collecting their batteries + never taking a hit). So that's cool.			"

												No this is not a tower defense game. This is an action puzzle game with a bullet-hell twist based on getting quick times, collecting all the pickups, and not getting hit.There aren't many levels overall 12 main levels with some sidequests[HLTB says 4 hours for campaign], and there are tutorial levels mixed in.The graphics and soundfx fit very well together and emulate a 16 bit title well. I honestly wasn't paying attention to the music, the gameplay is hectic and it took most of efforts to dodge bullets.I've had a lot of fun playing and I'll go back to finish the campaign. Getting 4/4stars on each level seems incredibly hard and I only managed to perfect the first level so far. I decided to write this because the helpful reviews filter was just awful for this game.I think anyone who enjoys top down action,  action/strategy or dodgy-shooter type games will like this game.

Cute and clever little strategy gameCubetractor is a strange and unique game where you play as Endroi, a robotic drone who seems to take strange delight in completing puzzles and frustrating the plans of his creators in a comically overblown fashion. Practically, the game is quite simple. You move your robot around the board and use the space bar to attract blocks toward your position. Once in motion, the blocks continue until they strike something causing damage, merge with another moving block to form a tower, or leave the screen. Cubes can be pulled only once (they will regenerate after a few seconds) and only in straight lines. The game is all about creating towers and striking enemies with moving cubes as you progress down the path toward freedom. The greatest advantage of this game is the story, you should read the entire contents during the game. On the other hand. the retro graphics of Cubetractor and the accompanying music start to bore very easily, although when it comes to music then you can always turn your own one. Worth buying during sales.			"

												Cubetractor is like a game of tug of war where the opposing team is throwing rocks at you. Except the rocks are lasers and nobody actually remembered to bring a rope.Though it borrows some tower defense staples, Cubetractor is primarily a puzzle game about pulling blocks around and making them bump into one another. The trick however isn’t so much in the actual pulling of blocks but in the timing and placement of them, each combination of two blocks producing a tower which is then used to destroy the pesky enemy towers that have been shooting you the whole time.It sounds easy on paper, but Cubetractor is exceedingly good at taking its minimalistic design and turning it against you in ways that at times wager on the downright sadistic. More often than not though this only makes solving a level that much more satisfying, and because Cubetractor was built with symmetry of capability in mind it rarely feels as if you’re outmatched by your opponent. They just got there first (and probably cheated).I also found it hard not to enjoy my time with Cubetractor because the game itself is so enthusiastic. Sure, your little blue robot might be enacting a destructive rampage disguised as a particularly explosive form of self-education, but they’re so doggone happy about it who has the heart to stop them? There is an absurdist charm to Cubetractor that is often hard to pin down, but it’s pervasive joy had me continuing to come back for more even as I was cursing the seeming impossibility of a given level.The only time Cubetractor falls apart is when its puzzles begin to turn into a monotonous war of attrition, requiring you to brute force your way through enemies rather than defeat them strategically. This mostly happens in the later levels of the game, but it’s a sharp and dramatic decline in the overall quality of level designs that is even more unfortunate given how the game up to that point seemed so conscious of avoiding tedium.Troublesome (and it should be said, optional) levels aside however, Cubetractor is a delight to unravel. It cleverly combines elements of more genres than are worth mentioning into a game that feels surprisingly fresh for all its recognizable parts. I was left feeling just slightly unsatisfied with the abruptness of the ending, but if it’s any indication of things to come, this isn’t the last we’ll see of the little robot that could [blow stuff up] and that’s not a bad thing by any means.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

Little on the short side even with all the sidequests, but I'm not sure that's necessarily a bad thing, better than just keeping on getting harder until people quit in frustration, and if you still want a challenge you can go for the 'master' rating on every level!

												I haven't seen a good 2D game in a long time (just to clarify undertale was released on november if anyone is gonna be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at me), in fact I haven't seen in a long time a game that actually runs at my pc!Cubetractor is a 2D puzzle game where you put your timing, agility and multi-task skills to the test.The game is really great, it got a decent art style and decent soundtrack. Can't argue with thatI don't know what else to say, so let's get to the pros and cons.Pros:-Achievements-Leaderboards (I haven't still seen any...)-Challenging just about right-Extraordinary Optimization:Given that my pc is a stupid piece of crap who can't even run a game called ""Missing Translation"" (check if you will) at stable 60fps, this game surprised me. If you check the specs they demand actually nothing, and it's true! I never had any problems with lag or sound lag, stable framerate and stuff. So if you have a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥computer like me and wanna spend the time not awaiting for the game to go back at 15 fps (after it dropped to 5), this piece of gem is for you!-Designed for hardcore and casual gamers:The game got these little extra tasks you can do if you want on the levels, which are not required to complete but mainly aimed to the hardcore community (or the achievement hunters, like me) to do it. They're super tough.-Decent artwork and soundtrack (given that this game was released on 2013 you can't compare to something like hyper light drifter....)Neutral:-Meh price, I'll get to that in a moment-The challenges for the achievement hunters are REALLY tough!!Cons:-Overprice:The game was featured on a load of bundles over the years, and on april 2016 it was been mass given away by indiegala. We can call the game dead, but it's kind of overpriced given that a lot of people got it for free and some bought it along with other games for only 1 dolar. Common, do some research and you might end up saving a hell of a lot if you plan on buying this game. Or wait for a sale (lol lazyass)-No trading cards for a game that has been mass given away ( :steamfacepalm: )-No workshop support for a game that would perfectly fitOverall, it's a really good game and you should definitely check if you're into 2D puzzles.

												Cubetractor a game where you have to ... yea you guessed it, to attract cubes to mix and match, and from that build new structures. Still a rather interesting concept.Graphics - Plain and simple, but it is rather appeling to look at, a great looking game. 7/10Music - Goes well with the game. 8/10Cinematics - NoneStory - Presented by various levels, some do continue the main story others don't (Think of them like side quests). But those so called unneded levels are there to teach you new stuff and if you do them, you get their achievment (for all the achievment hunters out there). 8/10Content - A lot. The aforementioned levels really do make this game come alive, where with every level you are presented with a new block type or a new enemy type. 8/10Controls - Rather confusing, but that quickly is fixed by playing a little and getting used to them. 7/10Gameplay - Smooth and responsive, everything is at a constant framerate (never experienced a spike or something) a solid performance overall. 9/10A unique puzzle game, never did it became way too hard or too simple, okay it did became hard at one time (Im bad). Overall a very solid game. Final Score: 7.8/10			"

												A cute little game which has you pulling blocks to build towers to defeat other towers..It's very basic...more basic than free flash games...or iOS games...Definitely not worth a purchase...at the very most you'll spend about 1 hour on this game, and then discover how little it has to offer. Keep in mind, this is not ""Tower Defense"" , this is a very basic puzzle game which focusing on dodging bullets, and timing actions perfectly to build the correct setup to complete each level.To get a basic idea... you are a robot which has no abilities besides movement, and the ability to pull blocks across the map. There will be enemies on the level which you have to destroy. You can pull blocks over your enemies, or you can pull two blocks together to create a turret. While this is happening you will have to dodge bullets and avoid being taken out yourself. That is basically the entire game.			"

Some levels left me screaming at my screen as I tried it for the hundredth time over. Also, if you are a completionist like me, good luck getting those achievements.-Some bug where game will crash for no reason sometimesThis is a fun little game, but it is painstakingly difficult.

												Do not read into the tower defense part. This is strictly a puzzle/action game. You also are locked into using your keyboard for movement and using your abilities. Perhaps there is controller support, but definitely no mouse. You use arrow keys for movement, z and x for activation.All you do is pull blocks to solve levels through either moving blocks into enemies, or combining them to make your turrets/towers. THAT is your tower defense part of the game, but it's honestly not enough like an actual tower defense game to deserve that comparison.I personally wasn't that taken by the game, but I can see where others might have an amusing time with it. Only certain puzzle games work for me, and this isn't one of them. It also requires a bit too much in the way of perfect timing, and quick reflexes, in a bothersome control scheme, from what I would think most puzzle buffs would prefer.			"

												The combination of a slight delay needed for every input, the coordination required for building, and the fact that you take damage from everything including the blocks you use to build stuff results in an extremely frustrating underlying experience. To make matters worse, you are stopped dead anytime you take damage, and this on top of the slight delay built into the game creates a very odd start-stop style that makes coordination even more annoying and frustrating then it might've been otherwise.Stay away unless, well, you've seen gameplay and thought ""I must play that"" on sight.

When push comes to shove it's time for Cubetractor to pull ahead.  This puzzle game asks the player to navigate one screen puzzle rooms by pulling different types of blocks.  A single block can crush or damage an enemy but when two blocks are pulled together the create a structure.  Proper use of turrets, barriers, generators and more will give even the best puzzlers a solid challenge.The pull controls are a little finicky which can be frustrating when blocks combine out of position and the player has to wait to try again.  Also this puzzle game requires a lot of twice movement to dodge enemies and their projectiles while puzzling out the solution.			"

												It's pretty fun i say.Disagree, you might...But, Cubetractor is pretty much a retro-ish game with happy music and the gameplay is about pulling cubes together to create towers that shoot cubes, barries and all kinds of fun stuff.The game gets harder as more enemies pop up during your adventure.There is side levels aswell, that are more like challenge levels.Keep in mind, i have not completed the game fully, so i cannot say what is there in the end etc.But overall, it's a fun experience i enjoy playing.''It's a good timewaster'' in short.8.5 outta 10 "

												Fun little game. Will grab your attention for an hour or so. Basically you use this cute little robot tractor to pull cubes across the screen. The cubes can be used as weapons to take out baddies or combined to make turrents. NES style graphics and runs real smooth (as you would expect). Chirptune midi			"

												It's a sort of recombination of elements from familiar genres without quite belonging in any of them. You have to destroy all the enemy buildings, but you have no offensive capabilities of your own. Instead, you spend your time creating buildings to do it for you, but what you can build and where you can build it is determined by the placement of blocks on the playfield. So you can't always approach things the obvious way, and even if you can, the obvious way may not be the optimal approach that gets the enemy buildings destroyed before yours.It's basically a puzzle game, but it's a puzzle game with a lot of dodging.

By Asians, for AsiansUnless you have extremely good patience, stamina, and reaction time, similar to that of Jackie Chan, you will NOT be able to 100% this game. I started this in 2013 and finished in 2016, and believe me, I have played and beaten hard games in the past. Huge thanks to the man, the myth, the legend - CaptainThiefLP - for saving my a$$ in multiple spots, because the game is mind-breaking. No, I am not saying it's a bad game, but it's a pretty brutal game, and repetitive soundtrack does not help the frustration. I also think that a player's success should not depend on how critters spawn and such, because there were moments when my imminent victory was impeded by random bs. Where is Ludochip with an improved sequel or spiritual successor to Cubetractor? Nobody knows, and it's been years.I hope the developers come out of their hiatus closet sometime soon to release a new game, making it more attemptable for the slower and lazier hamburger-wielding Western audiences.Also, lower the price of this one to something like $2. Why rub expensive $9.99 salt into the wounds of the poor guys and gals who purchased this in hopes for an enjoyable friday night puzzle session?PS: spare us from using the magnifying tool - add full-screen7/10 "

Things were challenging enough that I didn't get bored but I also never felt stuck.  It's refreshing to see a puzzle game with a unique game mechanic, one that isn't yet another familiar type like a Bejeweled clone (match-3).  The plot is goofy but harmless.  It's short-ish (I finished it in ~7 hours) and I found it to be a lot of fun.			"

												This is a fun little indie game that feels like maybe it was made at a game-jam or some weekend programming competition. I will add that it is polished, and didn't have any bugs or issues when I played it. Controller support was really nice too. It does bring a novel new mechanic to the table, and the art and music are decent enough. I got this title really cheap, so I really don't have any issues with it or the purchase. Would I go out of my way to recommend this to a friend? Nope. There is nothing *fresh enough* here. I could see this being a high-end flash game or something you could find to play for free on the internet. It is well done, but not really that addicting. I found myself zoning out. Thats a bad sign. If you are on the fence, I would just watch a few LPs - that should help you decide.			"

												Okay, when I first started this game (part of a bundle) I thought, it would be a tower defense game (I don't like them though). Turns out, this is a tower attack game. You play a robot, who is able to pull certain cubes either horziontal or vertical. Once moved they keep on moving, smashing everything in their way (critters, towers and, yes, even you). The tower part comes in, when you are able to pull two blocks on the same spot. They combine and you get a tower. Now imagine pulling blocks, while being chased by homing missles, getting attacked by critters and shot at by dozens REALLY fast shooting towers.Yeah, I like it, but man, this game will take some time. They could've at least made the ""pull THOSE two blocks at exactly THAT spot""-excercise easier Oo'... dunno, maybe a marker for when to pull or something.			"

												Hey look, a plucky indie game!  It has quasi 8-bit graphics, so retro!  It's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ offspring of two genres you would never think to combine: bullet hell and tower defense!  It's got to be awesome, right?  Yeah, not so much.I think the idea has potential: I'm a fan of bullet hell, and somehow turrets are always fun, so a bullethell game in which you had to place turrets instead of shoot at aliens would probably be fun.  The problem with this game is the problem with so many other action games: the controls are clunky.  Unfortunately, in this case, the clunky controls aren't a result of incompetence - it was a deliberate design choice.You see, you create towers by smashing blocks together.  Smash different blocks, get a different tower.  This is really, really hard to control and it limits tower placement unnecessarily.  Far from being a heart-pounding action game, this game feels and plays more like a puzzle game.  Where did the creator want me to place the tower?  Also, it's really annoying to try to do this while you're getting shot at.			"

												Cubetractor is the first game from Ludochip, a small indie developer. Despite being their first release, they have managed to craft an interesting title with a good mix of gameplay styles. StoryThe game starts off with Endroi, the robot that players control, being given menial tasks like washing dirty cubes in the river using his ability to pull cubes towards himself. Quickly he goes out of control, using this skill to take down the walls blocking his way and then destroying even the turrets that were to stop his rampage. Endroi continues north, leaving ruin behind him, while thinking that everything he comes across is just another task he should deal with. PresentationThis game goes for a simple 2D style that works well. While not high resolution, everything is easy to recognise and has enough detail. Players will recognise each block and turret at a glance. The music is also very simple, and tends to loop maybe a bit too often, but its still nice enough. Nothing awful that would result in muting it has been found during gameplay. This game is however lacking in any sort of options, with only the basics covered, like muting the sound and toggling full screen, not even a different resolution setting available. ControlsThis game supports gamepad or keyboard controls, with only a few actions available. Endroi can move with the arrow keys, use the Z button to pull a block and X to remove a created turret. One problem with the game is the lack of changeable settings for these. GameplayAs already explained, the game starts off with players pulling blocks around. Over time, the player will learn to pull them into the paths of enemy towers and later to pull different blocks towards each other to form different allied towers, such as a defensive wall, a regular turret, a generator that boosts the fire rate of close by units and several others. While early levels will make this each, later locations will have blocks in difficult locations, so players must plan out what to pull on, while dodging enemy attacks all the while. The mix of action, puzzles and some tower defence does make for an interesting game, and most missions can be done in bursts of a few minutes, making this title suitable for those without a lot of time. LifespanEach of the primary missions has 4 ranks to earn, and even skilled gamers shouldn't expect to see a Master Rank after finishing each for the first time. The highest rank requires players to be fast and untouchable while still destroying every enemy in their way and collecting the items they drop. Gold or Silver ranks will be much more common early on. As well as the primary missions, players will also unlock side quests in which you must destroy every enemy and collect their item to complete each level, adding a bit more content to the game for those who enjoy the challenge. While this game doesn't stand out on how it presents itself, the gameplay with the mix of different styles works very well, though could drive away some players who don't enjoy all three.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this gameALSO NOTE: If I (the reviewer) have played a game that has less than 1 hour of gameplay and is recommended, means that I did not enjoy it but it passed a bit of my level of expectations! Think twice before buying/playing this game(This only applies to some games that have been recommended, not all, please read above before reading the review below) The game is... meh. It's not terrible, nor is it unplayable. It is a cute little strategy game, a very unique puzzle game with very good 2D pixel graphics. Really unique gameplay, accessible, easy to get into, however it can get a bit frustrating at some pointsNow to the recommendation, although I am giving it a recommendation, I didn't really enjoy playing it (hence the 15-20 minutes of gametime), for its full price, I would not recommend it, BUT if it is either in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game like I got it then I would recommend it. RECOMMENDED :)  Provided it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game, otherwise...  NOT RECOMMENDED :(  For its full price  "

												This game is a cute, pixulated, boldly 2D and incredibly FUSTRATING action puzzler! Even though I was able to get this game during an indi giveaway, the 9.99$ price tag might be just a tiny bit risky for folks who don't know what to expect. If you buy and play it, grab your 360 controller and expect to have lots of fun, laugh at the cute conversations and pull your hair out..a lot of it.			"

												This game was pretty difficult at times, nothing that was game stopping, but wasn't expecting anything to that level. Finished most with silver or gold. Only did the main story, which for a game i got on the humble bundle 2-3 hours of game play isn't to bad i think. Another one off the backlog yeahhhhhh. If you are into these sort of games worth a go, tons of bonus missions as well.			"

												A really really good game. It has the charm as if playing on a gameboy. The controll, music, soundeffects - everything is fine and fit together. It is not the game with the longest game time - but the time you spent on it is pure quality. I like it ;-)One of my favourite indie games.			"

												This is a surprisingly lively action puzzle combination that is easily one of my favorite indie game i've ever played. Only two hours long, and i spent the entire game highly entertained. WARNING: this game has a lot more puzzle than action. I see a lot of the reviews and it seems people who don't enjoy puzzle solving won't enjoy this gameThe core of the game revolves around combining cubes. Different cube combinations can build towers that either attack enemies or support your attacking towers. You can also pull cubes through enemies to deal sizable damage, which is surprisingly effective when possible. Without cubes your player character has no offensive power to deal with enemies, which means you deal with the enemies almost entirely through building structures that fight for you.I was surprised how smoothly the game played. Usually genre mixers tend to rely heavily on the first genre and include small elements from the second, but cubetractor makes an effort to blend the two and I personally found that it gave the player a lot of choice in how they can approach. You can start every level guns blazing combining as many cubes as possible and brute forcing the answer  but if you slow down you can find more efficient ways to complete a level. Most levels past the first three have 2-3 ways you can complete them and often sitting at the spawn point to plan out the level can be really enjoyable. One level i remember essentially having three different puzzles inside it, but you had to complete one puzzle in order to access the blocks to solve a second puzzle. Once you solve the second puzzle, you have to tear down buildings you had used for the first section to create a tower yet to be used in the level to hit some distant hard to reach enemies to unlock the exit.The complicated levels and variety of strategies make for a more interactive world and you don't feel like you're solving puzzles as much as you are solving problems that happen to be in the way of you and your goal. I didn't get the sense i get with most puzzle games that rather than solving puzzles because i enjoyed solving puzzles I was solving the puzzles just to finish the game. Instead Cubetractor's level design was a lot of fun.I only have two real complaints. Firstly, I did often found myself rushing to get the action going only to completely miss a cube in the corner that would make the level significantly easier. This happenned about three times before i noticed how often the developer seemed to put important cubes in corners, as if the devs were trying to teach the player to focus on their sourroundings. It's not really the developers fault that i wasn't paying attention, but it was very frusterating to fail a level multiple times only to notice how easy the solution was. Secondly the main story is somewhat confusing. You can choose to do the extra levels to get more of the story content, but even if you don't the game treats the story as if you had done all the side missions and learned all the characters quirks. Also don't bother trying to invest in the story. The characters can be cute in that Sesame Street sort of way where each character has a personality quirk or a gimmick, but pay too much attention and you notice how flat the writing is.Overall a very positive experience. If you're a fan of puzzle games you will definately enjoy Cubetractor			"

												Good game. The presentation, graphics, music & controls are fine. The game play can be fast-paced, yet also requires logic & thinking ahead. This is a retro style game, yet it is unique - I don't remember any other game that uses the mechanic of pulling cubes together to make certain things, like this game does. There's decent replay value, as you get 'gradings' for each level that you can improve on, & a good amount of levels to play. Totally worth £6.99.			"

												This game has an interesting and very simple concept it incorporates strategy with an easy to use controller concept. Don't get me wrong it is very simple and should not be taken for as a complex game but it has enough to make it enjoyable and has a reasonable price tag when on sale I would recommend the game for it's simple and fun gameplay but not for the price tag associated.
