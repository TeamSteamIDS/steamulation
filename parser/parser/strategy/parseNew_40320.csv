												Five WWII campaigns from a great (although now defunct) developer called Stormregion for $1.24: somewhat dated by today's standards but nonetheless fun to play.			"

												This game is much better than I expected, especially for the price. I've played many games priced higher than this that don't offer the same amount of enjoyment. I am especially fond of how each country speaks their own language, unless addressing something vital.			"

												While focused on the combat more then anything else, RFB Gold is a fun game.Like i said, it focus is on the combat. You don't have workers gather resourses, no buildings to be made, straight to the point; war. And, thankfully, its fun.There are 3 armies to choose from, Germany, US, and Russia, but aside from one or two unique unites, they all play the same. I've only started the main story, but have put some time into deathmatches. You can play with or against bots (yay!) and the AI is pretty good..While I can't give this RTS a 5/5 (no resourses, or building anything), it's worth a try, for sure.			"

												I sunk HOURS into this game when I was younger. Does it hold up to my memories? Hell yes. Even now, when I'm spoiled by games like CoH2, This games is still a good RTS. Graphics are good, (Except for the cutscenes...but those are so hilariously animated that it's hard to hate them.) Controls aren't awkward, and there isn't a butt ton to memorize. There are pop culture refences all over the game (Like, one time as the soviets, I captured the enemy base, and a soldier said: ""Run Nazis! All your base are belong to us!). There are cheats for the game that give your units invincibilty, insta-kill, infinite resources, and so on. (I use invincibility, I know it's cheap, but it's so much fun to send my Ranger officer headlong at a bunch of tanks, and capture one with no problem). The only problem I have is that there's no ""Select All Units"" button, or a UI element that shows all your troops. Which, when dealing with larger armies, can be a bit of a problem. I highly reccommend this game. Especially considering it's price. Definitely more casual than CoH2, but just as difficult.I will say, the multiplayer maps I have tried with a friend and bots, the ai can problematic as most of the time, they take all their troops and tanks right at the start and just bum rush you while and your friend are taking time to build up your army. But I haven't played it much after that, so...meh.			"

												I first played the vanilla game several years ago, with the Western Allies, Russian, German and French campaigns. It was quite possibly the greatest RTS game I have ever played, using a great system involving infantry, vehicles and crews, artillery, officers, airborne troops, all sorts of good stuff.With the Gold version, the ""Rush for the Bomb"" mode is added, detailing a fictional front of WWII with the rush to build the atomic bomb.Started as a great game, now became better.

												Although I haven't played through much of Rush for Berlin,  for those of you who are familiar with the COH series, this is similar, but you don't build or battle for resources. I would recommend this for those of you who want to get straight to the fighting. Graphics are light and ""pretty"" looking, and overall a good game for the price.			"

												Great ""little"" game. Rather large download at 7 gb but for what you get its rather enjoyable. Not to mention yes there are cheat codes but they all deal with the great Chuck Norris... rather great easter eggs to pop culture as well. All in all i give it a 8.5/10			"

												For me this game was always an example of how such games should be made, there are several interesting campaigns with great storyline, unique missions and units, many great funny cutscenes, lots of so-called 'easter eggs' in most (if not all) missions, that made me replay them again and again, as it felt like i'd necessarily miss something out.

												For $5, doesn't look bad. Looks and feels similar to COH (without infantry cover and base building) or Blitzkrieg 2. Tactical game, got on sale for $1.24. Chose to refund because it's not my type of game, but gave it a positive review because it looks playworthy.Good if you're strapped for cash and need to scratch a WW2 strategy/tactical itch.			"

But I can't.Controls are unresponsivePathfinding is terrible, units actually bump into mountains and then stop for a second, and then go perpendicularly until they hit another mountain.HP system is wack.Vehicles are underpowered when every infantry carries mines and grenades that 2 shots it.Graphics are lacklusterSuch an interesting concept brought down by execution			"

												If you like RTS warfare with tanks and small squads of men then this is likely something you already have in your library, if not then you might have spoilt your appetite with other games that fit this genre.  Personally it's a favourite in this kind of genre and unfortunely it only has spiritual successors since the developers now defunct.Like I've said in another review, if I could jump into a time machine and intervene at the point of purchasing, I wouldn't intervene since it was worth every penny.
