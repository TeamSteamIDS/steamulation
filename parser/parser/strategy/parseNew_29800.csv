												Ok, I bought this game for 14 cents and I'm gonna write a serious review and not ""bought the game, sold the cards, earned a cent, profit"".Pros:+Many options, you may change resolution and keys and sounds etc.+Difficulties - you can play it on 3 difficulties.+Reminds a PS1 game (for those who had one)+Keys are comfortable to play+Detailed tutorial+Controller support+Has cards+Combat is pretty good+Community made levels (?)+Many save slots+Cheap (even in full price)Cons:-No story at all-Needs achivements-I said in the 'Pros' that the combat is good, but, you can't stand still, or you die-Enemies do too much damage-Graphics aren't too good and the character's face is scary-No background music-Enemies are pretty the same-Enemies that get hit just turn red again and again until they explode, it's cool for the first minute but then gets boringNeutral:~Dash after level 1 is imbalancedBottom line:Recommended with a score of 6/10			"

												Despite the dated graphics, this game can be great fun in short bursts.  Playing around with the terrain, running at super-speed up vertical cliffs while machine-gunning energy bolts at mite-like things chasing you, dodging projectiles and then capping it off with a super-high jump that lands you hard enough to deform the ground?  That's a sort of rush that doesn't really appear in a lot of titles, let alone one with system requirements as relaxed as this.  The weapons are pretty unbalanced and you'll only be using one or two once you get them, but that's not really a problem given that competitive balance is a non-issue here.I only wish they'd given you more opportunities and incentive to use the terrain deformation powers to your advantage, in ways that would make you feel that same exhiliration.  It does lack variety and interesting strategy, which is sad.  Community support and quality custom levels and stuff would make this so much more worthwhile, given the core gameplay conceit, but even as it is, it's got a charm to it.  When it's bad, it's dull.  When it's good, it's that kind of game that's fun for the first few days, then you forget about it for a while, and then you pick it up again and relive the magic that hooked you the first time.  It's worth a buy, especially if it goes on sale.			"

												To be entirely clear, Caster is pretty terrible. It’s also a ton of fun, in large part because it’s only just barely holding it together and doesn’t really give a damn if anything makes sense as long as it’s entertaining.Everything about Caster is more than a little insane and nonsensical. It’s always trying new stuff just because it can, and though this means the whole game feels like a crash course in engine experimentation, somehow it works. It really has no business being as fun as it is, but something about running around as an immensely overpowered MegaMan-reject is so stupid I was barely able to keep it together while playing the game.I have no doubt Caster would be a huge chore if it insisted on imposing any restrictions on you or ever became an actual challenge (though a few moments in the second half begin to weigh the game down), but for the most part it lets you do whatever you want. It doesn’t matter if it unbalances the game or even breaks it in places, you’ve been put into this sandbox to blow stuff up and run really fast and that’s about all I needed.Caster might be barely competent but I can’t help but admire how little it cares or tries to pretend it’s anything but a bit of super dumb fun. I can’t stress enough how stupid everything here is and how delightful I found it. So, sure, I could tear it apart as an ugly piece of garbage, but apparently I was in the mood for something so-bad-it’s-good and Caster more than fit the bill.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Caster is an average third person shooter that does not contain any notable qualities, aside from the ability to destroy terrain and perform ridiculous map-crossing leaps.Your objective in each level is to either kill every enemy or do a generic fetch quest (there are a few other missions with different objectives but they're uninteresting, for example; shoot a tree). Every level is incredibly short, and even on my first time, each one averaged no longer than a minute. Speaking of game length, the entire thing isn't longer than an hour. The game abruptly ends with a ""To Be Continued..."", and despite being released in 2009, there has been no continuation, and it seems the website does not hint at anything of the sort either.Enemies are all very generic, and each one of their attacks can be easily avoided by just sprinting around or jumping. Even if they do manage to hit you, they deal hardly any damage, and they are easily dispatched; even more so with the weapon upgrades. The story is uninspired, and unless you've never heard or seen the ""It's humans against aliens, you're our only hope!"" plot, then I doubt you'll be interested. As I stated earlier, the game ends at a very unexpected random point with sequel bait. A map editor is available, but I did not use it or download custom maps, so I cannot comment on that.I did not find Caster to be particularly interesting in any way. Terrain destruction and super speed can be fun and worth it if you paid 0.14 cents, but beyond that, there's not much else that the game offers.			"

												I bought it for $0.14. If I'd know it would have been this good I would have happily paid $5. This game is a fantastic indie gem. It really gives me hope that not ALL the indie games on Steam are awful trash.PROS:+ Terrain deformation is fun and quick but doesn't feel gimmicky or normally required. It frees you up to play with things as you like.+ Running and jumping is smooth and handles well.+ The few enemies the game has are varied and interesting and also deform the terrain.+ Finding the hidden collectables isn't compulsory (it would be very annoying if it was) but makes for a fun extra goal to lengthen the game a little.+ The game doesn't stretch itself longer than it should be. There's not enough content here for 10 hours of gameplay so they didn't make that much.CONS:- The game is short, very short. There's probably more that could be done by adding a few more enemies and a few more levels.- Little problems with all the weapons. Not game ruining, just minor gripes:  > The blaster's crosshairs don't line up perfectly with its ostensibly straight shots. This only becomes apparent at extreme range.  > The eruptor is very hard to aim as it doesn't have a light effect or cast a shadow and just appears as a distortion on the screen. It's very hard to tell where one is in 3D space (how close/far). This also makes enemies that shoot it odd to fight.  > The homing shot has a very hard time hitting enemies. It flies around in circles and ends up slamming into terrain about 75% of the time.  > The shield attack is a neat idea but doesn't have an applicable purpose.- Very few enemies in the game, both in type and actual number. The game would benefit from a little more crowded levels. Some very large levels only have like 6 enemies in them.Final Verdict: Buy this game.If you see it on sale BUY THIS GAME.			"

												Caster is a third person platformer shooter with slight RPG elements. Basically, this is a mission based game. You select levels and get missions upon entering them. Missions are generally things like, collect all the orbs or kill all the enemies. Although there are more complicated missions, especially later. As you go through the first set of levels, you'll learn the basics, get new weapons, and collect in=game currency. You use the in-game currency to buy upgrades between levels, such as boosting your natural abilities and powering up the weapons you have collected. You can walk around, jump, and shoot for basic controls. However, you can also hit jump again and hold the button to do a super jump, which can help for dodging enemies and clearing distances and obstacles. The other special ability is a dash, which allows you to run quickly. This can help run up slopes and across water. Combining these two special abilities can make for some great techniques. There's also an interesting mechanic of being able to destroy and build up the land with your weapons. This can make tough situations easier depending on what you choose to upgrade and when. There are three sets of levels. The first set are there to help you learn the basics. The second set will make you use your abilities in more interesting ways. The third set will challenge your skills. It's a simple design that has lots of potential. The art is very colorful and pretty, even if I had to run it in minimum settings for my old worn out computer. It still looks really nice, and the music is alright too. It also has a low level of story investment. What I mean by that is... there's only vague story connections from mission to mission, and they don't have much to do with an overall plot. Also, not everyone will be thrilled with the graphical style, as it is dated in terms of modern games. Plus, the level selection method may turn away mordern minded gamers, as well as the simplistic gameplay. The third set of levels are made by the community and aside from the fact that they are very difficult, they're just a bit of a hassle to get. They aren't included with the game download, nor are they available through Steam workshop. To get the third set of levels, you need to go to their site, download the levels, and place them into the correct folder. It's not complicated, but it's a hassle that I'm guessing most won't bother to do, even though it's worth it for more levels. And you'll want more levels because the second set of levels, designed by the developer, is unfinished. There's one mission that, when selected, simply says to be continued. This game, according to the Steam store page, came out in 2009... and it's still not finished. This leads me to believe it's not going to be finished, or if it IS then it's going to have to wait until the developer isn't busy with other projects, which is a shame because this game has lots of potential and I'd sure like to see it through to the actual end to see know what it has been building up to.Still, Caster is tons of fun if you're into platforming third person shooters. It's kind of like a 3D Mega Man if they had done the Mega Man Legends games differently I guess. It has simple rules that create so much potential for cool and interesting levels and missions. While it's not complete yet, it's still worth the 3 dollar asking price. I got it on sale thinking I'd hate it, but it's actually a lot of fun. You could wait for a sale, but it's worth the money anyway. Just make sure you get those extra levels for some more fun. Caster gets a 7/10 for being a very fun third person platformer shooter similar to those a few generations ago.			"

												It's a quirky and fun, fast paced game where you have to destroy creatures called ""The Flanx"" because they are evil.To defeat these Flanxers, you can sprint really fast, jump super high and can use 6 weapons, all with their own abilities.One weapon, destroys the landscape and one weapon adds land. This makes terraforming a great part of the game.However, it would be wrong in this case, half of the weapons are pure♥♥♥♥♥♥in terms of usability. Even in the levels where you get a new weapon, you can easily use another. I've, for example, never used the Stun weapon and just blasted and destroyed so much land, that I bet I would get Greenpeace or such at my back.The campaign is also really short unless you really want a perfect score but what would that even be?You could be finished with the first campaign in about 30 minutes to an hour. There are 2 campaigns and possible even user-made content.Additionally, half the levels are pretty repetitive.Does this all makes the game bad? No. It's a nice game if you want some quick action and when it's on sale, it's certainly nice to possibly buy. Just don't expect something big however.			"

												QUALITY ""I AM A GOD!""POSITIVES:-Soundtrack, Length, Variety The gameplay is in hyper drive, but it doesn't feel nauseating or unmanageable.The initial controls are awkward, but the reset is easy. NEGATIVE:-the visuals. It hurts to be taunted with all the high quality concept art in comparison to the highly polished but outdated 3d graphics. This is one of the best examples of a game that was held back by the creator's & the hardware's limitations.But the game is still great regardless. Every little details adds to the epic all powerful thrill.Suggestions: -Update graphics, more character options, and release the soundtrack. oh and btw, this is what a Sonic game should feel like!

You can attack enemies in six unique and cool ways with two playable characters. Best part of this game is terrain deformation which allows you to change the structure of environment. I recommend buying it when it's on sale. Pros : ● Trading Cards ● Enjoyable Music ● Useful Tutorials● Simple Story ● Three difficulty levels● Good combat environment ● Terrain deformation ● You can run on water! :pCons : ● No achivements● Face texture needs to be fixed● Very Short ● No Multiplayer● Good controls but sometimes difficult to aim.

												I paid 14 cents for this game so my expectations were extremely low, I figured if I got 10 minutes of gameplay I got my money's worth.What I ended up getting was a delightful Sonic the Hedgehog/Megaman hybrid, in a 3D 3rd person setting that harkens back to the N64 PSX days when 2D platformers were first experimenting with the 3D style, except Caster's mechanics work fine.  You go from level to level, which for most of it is a choice as to which level you take on.  Each level has different objectives, there are about 3-4 different styles each with the occasional story sequence thrown in.  There are plenty of weapons to choose from, my favorite is the seeker, you probably should upgrade that first among the other weapons.  Performance wise I haven't ran into any issues, this game despite being made in 2010 knows I have a 144hz monitor and caps at 144 fps.  Major credit for that.  You would think this game would be great for a controller, but on default settings the camera control on the right stick is all messed up, best to just stick with the keyboard and mouse for this one.In conclusion, for 14 cents it's a no brainer, buy this game.  It's regular price is $3.00 I really don't think that is asking for too much for this game either.  Plus this game supports modding so it's worth it just for that.  I should also mention that the soundtrack is pretty awesome too and is worth the money alone.For the low price, and for what it is, with the inclusion of mod support, I give this game a 4 out of 5.

												keep in mind I paid 20 cents for this. Very simple, rough around the edges, and fun. The weapons: are pretty cool overall. And when you select them you change color like megaman... added bonus. Most weapons are useful, i thought the seeker and the yellow guns could use some fine tuning. but the fact that there are 2 weapons that raise and lower the terrain is very cool. The levels: small, very rough around the edges, looks like one of my first farcry maps. But at the same time the basic design of each level is pretty in its own way. It is easy to get where you want to, whether it be running up a giant vertical wall or jumping 500 feet over it.Game Mechanics / physics: Superfast, it is a reflex based game when it comes down to it. Again REALLY cool to jump super high like matrix / Hulk and land with a shockwave. Once you get the dash and jump leveled up it becomes a bit more fun. Most of the weapons fire satisfactorily. Music and SFX: Good Electronic soundtrack to go along with the fast-paced gameplay, pretty much house music. Sound effects are also good. People have compared it to Sonic and Megaman. I agree, I would also give it a comparison to flower because of the healing trees with your gun fire thing going on not to mention the short levels. Game is not finished... you feel like you are 75% done and it just ends abruptly. Hope they finish it! Maybe add some moves to it, you end up flying through the air a lot at the end of the game with no way to land if you jump to far besides holding the opposite direction which slows you in mid air. Maybe a mario ground pound or dive bomb to give you a swift landing. Could use some more interaction with the environment, vines to swing on, wall jumps, something else to do besides shoot and jump all the time.  "

												If you want to become god and kill everything and jump across maps with the speed of sound. This game has it covered.But let's review the description of the game.- ""Massive terrain deformation!"" - Making the terrain go up or down is not massive.- ""Use strategy to destroy hordes of bugs with a variety of unique behaviors and attacks"" - Not really. Just get and upgrade missiles and stun and everything becomes a joke.- ""Bring trees back to life and collect energy to purchase upgrades"" - Bring trees back to life? How's that a feature.  - ""Upgrade your skills to run on water and jump hundreds of feet into the air"" - Pretty much the fun part of the game, which is the movement since some maps are pretty big. Running on walls could have better controls.- ""Pulse pounding music by Trance Emerson"" - Music is pretty nice but nothing to brag about. How you like your music is your own taste and opinion.- ""3 levels of play (Casual, Normal, and Extreme)"" - Even on extreme its easy if you upgraded your sprint. If nothing can touch you whats going to kill you? If you guessed lava, acid and sorts. You're right. Enemies suck.- ""2 playable characters"" - It's pretty much the same character but with a different gender. They both have the same abilities and whatnot so there's nothing different from one another. It's pretty much if Mass Effect said theres 2 characters but one is male Shepard and female Shepard.- ""6 unique attacks"" - I wouldn't say unique. 3 attacks are lasers which 1 goes foward, the other you can cast multiple and the last its a homing laser. 2 change the terrain and the last one stuns enemies.It's not amazing and the graphics are meh. Don't get me started with the player models and the enemies. Jesus how did that go so wrong. (The fact that the concept art was pretty cool and interesting).Crosshair is a lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The camera controls, I really don't know what to say about it. It's just wrong.Apart from messed up lazy models, the messy controls and camera. On and all, I had fun. I think it's a game where you can easily spend 2 hours on it without feeling bored or stressed out. Get it on sale thou. "

												So, I played this game for roughly 5-6 missions or so and I got a decent bit of feeling for the game. This is what I have to say:~====~Graphics~====~This game is good for what you are into when it comes to gaming though the graphics aren't the best which is fine, but sometimes if someone would want to have the best graphics on because they are used to it or they just want full graphics then this won't be the best for you. The characters are a bit blocky which is also fine, but in ""This day in age"" we aren't used to seeing super blocky characters unless the whole game is made like that. For example, Minecraft is made to be a blocky game so that you can enjoy the building aspect in it to it's fullest extent, though when you play this game you would assume it to be a bit more adjusted to the kind of graphics we see today. The animations are pretty good and the game has a lot of potential in this category but for now I give it this:~Not the Best but hopefully be improved upon~~====~Combat~====~There isn't much to talk about in regards to combat in this game but, the combat in this game could be a bit better and also a bit less repetitive in it's own way. Basically, you spawn into the mission, you're given an objective to do then you do the objective and the mission is done. The objectives aren't all too complicated but they do get repetitive after a while of playing, I know I have only played for 35 minutes or so but that's because I don't feel like going through the same stuff constantly. So I would give the combat this:~It gets Repetitive after a while~~====~Story~====~I am not gonna lie but I didn't pay attention to the story all that much, I started the game and I was given a black screen with text explaining the story. After about a minute or so I realized I had to click the mouse to continue the text scrolling so I kept reading a few more messages. After I read a bit more, I figured that this would just show me millions of text boxes to read so I just skipped through them so I could actually play the game. So, I would give the story this:~Possibly Good if you take the time to read~~====~Final Verdict~====~This game isn't really worth to buy unless you get it on a great sale like I did or you really like these kinds of games. I would check out videos by players about it to get a better feel for the game before you buy it.			"

												This game is like megaman but in free 3D world.3rd person shooter game when you just run, shoot and dodge while completing the mission.What aspects of the game that makes this game fun?Run and dodge the missile like attack from the enemies lol.Pro :+ Low spec game and low capacity+ Free movement and easy control+ Just shoot them all + Run+ Dodge+ Good for killing timeCons :- Low graphic quality (What did you expect with low spec game dude?)- Makes you bored in long run- Some minor bug with mouse movement when you hold your left-click mouse- There is no solid storyline, just doing some missionsDon't buy with full price, because i think it's not worth with full price, if it gets discount, you can consider to buy it.Be sure to play moderate or extreme difficulty, because the easiest one is way to boring.And I recommended to play it in extreme difficulty and see how could you dodge those incoming missiles lol.8/10 would run and dodge those missiles.

												the gameplay is surprisingly really fun. multitude of different enemies and attacks. you also have a dash that you can upgrade so you can run up walls and over the surface of water (or lava that wont damage you when you are sprinting over the surface. very useful, though if you stop sprinting, then of course you fall in and take a lot of damage.there are additional maps after you beat the first. the first map dosent take very long. luckily there is more, just go back to main menu then load to see the new area available. the game is rather easy, if you play it on hard mode it gets a good bit more challenging, especially on the second map, really fast paced moving and shooting to keep from getting killed. I recomend playing it on hard.			"

												The premise is clear: the Flanx have invaded Middon, which is short of experienced mages, and you, a noob Caster, gets the job of owning the bad guys.Right away, you’re put in this action shooter game that has a remind of a 3D Megaman. You’ll be dashing, double jumping and collecting  several diferent weapons that will by fired by your arm and many of which can be charged before firing. Among the arsenal you will find from energy blasts and bombs to seeker missiles and a stunner, including some kind of gravitational gun that will deform the terrain increasing its height. If it was not enough, you can actually deform and destroy all the terrain by all your attacks, which also spices the combat mechanics.You will face from cockroaches and flying beetles to giant worms. Each enemy is very different in all aspects starting by the models, and including their weapon and combat approach. You should even be prepared for enemies lurking out from the ground and find yourself running while saying ugly words. What is a bit strange is that, having put the time in differentiating the enemies so much, most, if not all, of them just use the same weapons available to you just colored differently.The game packs 15 short levels and the progress is quite fast. You will start with just an energy gun and the ability to do some small double jumps and dashes and a small health bar. However, in each level you will collect energy by killing Flanx and healing trees, which then you will be able to spend upgrading yourself. There are also some weapons that you will have to find -not that it is hard- to unlock them, and your character will even change color when changing weapon -what does that remind you of, again?-.Caster can be completed in a couple hours, maybe a little longer, although you won’t be able to upgrade everything -and I mean everything, your jumps height, dash duration, health level, weapons power…-, which may take an extra hour replaying some levels. However, if you really want to play more, you can find mods in the game’s website that will give you some extra content. And you will probably want to play some more, since it’s one of those games where you’re just telling yourself after each level ‘Only one more level and then I walk the dog’ and more soon than later there is no one more level.About the soundtrack, I should mention it’s not constant. It packs some tracks that you won’t notice to be there and some others that will really pick your attention because they’re actually good.Overall, Caster is one of these very beautiful indie games that also packs good controls and gameplay and will leave you a taste of wanting more.

												As I see the only real reason for so many positive reviews is some kind of PS1 (and others from that era) nostalgia. But I still cant understand it. Good PS1 games made 15-20 years ago had much better composed graph and animations, more interesting gameplay, worlds, overall design. In the late '90s this game would be mediocre at best. Two decades later its simply bad.Good games remain good games even after decades. This one is far from catching up with them.			"

I highly doubt it will be continued considering the game is almost 6 years old but i digress.It also has mod support and you can get extra, community made levels from the games website. The soundtrack is good and compliments the fast-pace of the game very nicely.Also, as i'm writing this, it costs 20 cents, so why the hell not?Pick it up, its pretty fun.			"

												I really enjoyed my time with Caster.  This is a 3d combat platformer.  Most importantly the game is just fun.This is a good example of a game that excels without having top end artwork.  The art is decent, and they really like using particle effects.  But, the textures and models are dirt simple.But the GAME.  The game is great.  Controls are tight.  That is super important in an action game.  Your super jumps and dashes FEEL really powerful.  The animations are smooth.  And there are a decent number of options to customize your experience.Play follows through a number of stages.  After each stage, the amount of energy balls you pick up allows you to purchase upgrades for your character, thereby allowing you to specialize your strengths to fit your playstyle.  I also really liked the music, YMMV.  Don't overlook this one.9/10			"

What's bad:Still unfinished, 6 years after release. Poor visual quality with short fog distance, basically looks like something you'd find on a demo disc for your PS1.  Very basic gameplay, pick up orbs and destroy enemies. The worst gamepad control layout I've ever seen.  (Left and right on your right thumb stick to look up and down, oh and it also fires your weapon, SERIOUSLY?).  Pretty short game, 22 missions, many of them only take a couple minutes to finish.What's good:And yet, its strangely entertaining to play.  There's a good sense of speed when you sprint and super jump around the maps, and the terrain manipulation, while often not needed, is a cool gimmick.  It also controls great with mouse and keys for a third person game.Worth getting?Even if its a bit short you can still get some hours of reasonably entertaining action here.  So yes, there's far worse things you can do with your €3 than getting this game.  I've also seen the game discounted so deep, that putting the trading cards from it on the market basically pays for the game as well.			"

There are plenty of people who would do you a model of one character with a bit better quality for free.> Mods... I'm expecting custom characters and all but all I get is more lazily designed maps.> Terrible interface and main menu. (yes, even for an indie game)If you ever get so high and want to do random stuff then you could give this a try. If not, don't get it at all.			"

												Extremely repetative and simple score attack shooter. No story or anything to take you along.If oyu like running and bullet hell in 3D this is your game. But I wouldn't recommend if you are looking anything more than hour's worth of gameplay.There isn't much here, specially at the start to keep you interesting and the good, but few in selection, of songs only keep you interested for a while.The weaponry is interesting and allows manipulation of the polygon based environment, but other than that will not offer anything else.Enemies come in 3 variety, Fast, Stationary and Bullet hell. The simple graphics allow you to view some cool effects of the weapon but other than that, doesn't offer anything to look at, bland textures, boring level design. Having low production value doens't mean it is bad, it is just way blander than it should be.There was extreme amount of potential at show.			"

												While Caster can be fun some of the time, there's really no other value there. If all you want to do is spam overpowered weapons while sprinting around at mach speed, this is probably the game for you. But if you like your games with actual value in them, actual story, playability, difficulty, challenge or what have you, then look elsewhere, because Caster lacks all of those and then some. The graphics are very outdated and the textures/models can be glitchy as they clip a good amount, but even if they don't they're still not pleasant to look at. The character isn't even aesthetically pleasing and that's the one thing you have to stare at the entire game. Not to mention his/her face is just down-right creepy at some angles. The balancing is dreadful, as you get a game-breaking weapon at about level two, and the difficulty spikes up and down more than a heart monitor. Also, once you max out your health and sprint ability (which can be done very early game, mind you), you can just sprint back and forth to avoid every projectile, while spamming you're broken weapon that shoots as fast as you can click (and if you're like me, that means it can be spammed at speeds that will melt bosses in no time). So there's no balancing and the graphics are bad, what else? Well, the story is worse than both of those cons combined. The easiest way to describe the story is by saying that there just isn't one. You're a new recruit and you're sent on missions to combat what seems to be an evil creature-empire that's expanding and trying to take over the world(?). You go place to place and just clear each level, there's no more objectives than that. Also, there's only like two themes of levels, and they're repeated over and over. Later game you run into a few levels that are almost impossible given the game's engine, where you have to keep a small ship out of the water even though it goes way faster than you can terraform the ground in front of it, and a boss battle that just drags on so long no matter how much damage you deal per second, and you just have to spam and dodge for like five minutes straight. The game is also very short. And last but not least, the developer decided to incorporate a destructible environment... everywhere. Weapons that deal a little bit of area damage will also chip away at the ground on every level, so if you max out your weapon and you're spamming like hell (as is the custom) the ground will basically meltdown out from under where you're aiming. It breaks the map and it breaks the game, even though it was already broken from all the other previously mentioned problems. When it's all said and done, I would not recommend the Caster to- well, anybody. The only reason it's not getting a 1/10 is because sprinting back and forth at mach speed while spamming your blaster like you have some sort of turrets is actually quite enjoyable in a weird way. So because I ran into a little bit of fun there, I give Caster a generous 3/10. That being said, do not buy this no matter what, not only because you'll waste money, but mostly because you'll just waste your time. I got it on sale for pocket change and I feel like I still got ripped off.3.4/10			"

												Fast paced action game with destructable terrain, although few modes (Kill all enemies, collect energy orbs or uninfect a tree). The graphics are very good for a 3D indie game. I had experienced a few bugs on one of the levels although it was very minor. The fighting style makes for a nice change compared to the current standards, and it is always nice to see such a good game with low resource usage.			"

												Once you go Blast, you never go back.As in you only need like, one power to basically sweep all the enemies in this game. However, I do enjoy playing this game, even if there isn't any real story. But its practically this (I'm assuming):In this world these insect beings known as the Flanx have been destroying the environment, as well as people. Humanity rises up to this challenge by calling for the help of people known as Casters. Casters, having vast amount of magical energies can run fast, kill Flanx with lasers, and restore trees to their natural beauty. Now its up to one caster to defeat the Flanx and restore the land.That's the ""story"", imagine Megaman and Sonic like someone else said in the review section :)7/10			"

												Caster is a fast paced 3rd person shooting game that has a lot of interesting ideas that don't really pan out properly. They give you multiple interesting weapons to use but you only need one to beat the game and two to make it even easier. There's also a nifty upgrade system that maxes out too quickly and leaves you feeling way too overpowered very early on in the game. That being said I still had fun with the game though it is disappointingly short and the story doesn't make much sense since there's a lot left out of context. I bought this game for $0.14 and am happy with what I got but if I had even paid the regular $2.99 amount I probably would have been much more upset with this game and wouldn't have been able to enjoy it as easily. The developer seems to still care for this game and I hope that with some constructive criticism and their continuing to approach this game in a creative way it can get better over time and I can recommend it for the full price that they want.

												READ NOWThe thing is:This game hasn't actually been abandoned as some people say it has, the creator (Elecorn) has been working on and off on a massive update for a while now and he's probably going to comeback with a big bang on this game at some point, thats why its starting to get a bunch of PROMOTION SALES in the past 18 months or so. Anyway, My review:I'll start with the bad things about this game:- When i first played through the game, it left me a bit downhearted because i enjoyed it, but then this message pops up saying it hasn't been finished yet and to check a website for updates, WTF (this was at that moment anyway) i mean this game was released quite a while ago (Release: 2009) and it hasnt been finished past two chapters? (Disapointment filled my heart)- The Gameplay: Extensive in terms of moving around the environment, however extremely limited to what powers you use, The enemies constantly appear and are very repetetive to fight against, and it feels really wasteful as to understanding what it is you are supposed to do, makes a game feel rather pointless, especially if it isn't visually amazing either.- And I feel that this game could beso much better with a certain amount of... satisfaction in terms of succeeding, this could have been introduced by introducing achievements or special in-game rewards that add to the exxperience, but this isn't such a big deal.THE GEWD STUPH:- Potential! Potential! Potential! : I dont give a s hit if this game was made over five years ago, knowing the future may probably hold a great deal of gameplay is good enough for me, like i said, it hasn't been abandoned and there is hope for this game.- As awkward as the graphics were, it was also very creative, this game is certainly a unique and creative piece of unfinished work, the terrain is potenitally extensive and could be editted a fair bit more, but the concept is very exciting.- As limited as your options are in terms of fighting styles, there is no denial in the fact that it is extremely accreting in the sense that it makes you feel superior to the world you are being introduced to, this goes along the lines of games like Forced Unleashed and Prototype as a listed ""Badass simulator"", it just feels awkward because the developer hasn't 100% succeeded at creating it yet, I certainly hope he will finish it.Stylisticly (even when finished) this game isn't going to be appealling to a fair few people. BUT if you think about how much this game may or may not evolve from here, you could be finding your ideal game that will extend your feel for the indi-game genre, and besides, there isn't really anything to waste, i mean, the amount of sales on this vary between      10-50 cents, i mean come on, thats cheap af.Realistically (for all the Stiffs out there) Rating: 5/10, buy anyways, its cheap.Optimistically (For sick-dawgs to support there fellow gamer/dev) Rating: 8.5/10, BUY NOW, because the opportunity in this could go from what it is to a great stylistic game introducing a new genre of gaming as well as bringing out thing like possibly multiplayer or even more stylistic traits. ;) "

Don't play with a controller unless you enjoy insanity. Keyboard controls are so much easier and work quite well.The game doesnt make sense and its all a bit of a mash up graphics wise. There is something there though that once youve been playing it a while (desperately hoping that the last trading card gets added to your inventory so you can stop playing) becomes quite fun.Maybe if this game was released 25 years ago itd be awesome but it wasnt - its poo!

												I do not understand the negativity surrounding this game. I bought it for 16 cents and sold the trading cards for 18 cents. This alone should give reason to buy it. However, there is so much more. The game is amazing. Sure, the graphics are terrible, and sure, there's no story. But the gameplay is stellar. By the time you've fully upgraded every power, you feel like a god among mortals. Heck, you only have to upgrade dash and jump to enjoy the game. You can easily earn more money than you spent on this game, but even at full price it's a steal.			"

												Let's say something honest about this game.This game makes me sad. Not because it is mediocre (just mediocre though, not utterly shameful), but because it tries and fails.Caster has a few features which got me entertained for some time despite the poor overall quality of the game. The character movements are well-done and it's pleasant to jump n' run around with actually quite much fluidity. The entire terrain deformation feature also made me have a bunch of fun at it's well-included in the level design (I'd even say this is pretty much the only thing that keeps the lev-des acceptable along with the variety of the environnements).BUT.The first thing which will strike you is the graphics. Jesus. I know it's Elecorn's first game, but the game came out in 2009 and I felt like I was playing an early PS2 game. The textures are low-res (giving by the way to your character the face of an eternal suffering) and the models are quite polygonal.While I'm at it with the general graphics, the particle and pyrotechnic effects are horrendous. When you cast an attack, you really don't have a feel of empowerment because they just look so weak and unimpressive. Some fire and explosions would be welcome in order to take these pew-pews to the next level. Even the attacks from your ennemies are looking unthreatening, while they in fact at medium defficulty deal a good bunch of punch. This seems like a detail, but that will make the boredom come at you in an even shorter time.Now 'bout the the gameplay. Like I said, there are a few interesting things which brings some spice to your adventure. But the gameplay is seriously too repetitive. There are tens of levels and the objective is always the same. Either kill all the ennemies, pick up some energy balls or make a dead tree come back to life. And it's a shame, because this game has potential. There could've been much more things to do, especially with the pleasant movement system and the different attacks to gather along the game.Oh, yes, the attacks. There's a total of six attacks which are, like I said, pretty unimpressive, but fun to use for a little time. You have a basic pulse laser attack, a charged blast attack which deals great damage to both the ennemies and the environnement, an ability to raise the level of the ground, seeking missiles, stunning lasers and a (quite useless) shield.Not only they look pitiful, but their upgrade system is too classical and bulky, and you just gather these attacks by approaching spheres which are spread in the in-game world. You don't acquire them by defeating bosses or gathering an out-of-the-ordinary object, nah. You just encounter 'dem spheres and yoohoo, magical attack learning. That is and will remain too simplistic and it totally does not give any feeling of accomplishment.I could bash this game for a longer time, but this is just sad to look at. There's been effort and you can feel it. And I don't want to be too harsh on somthing that's been the output of many hours of work. So I just hope Elecorn will learn from its failures of the past and make us a neat Caster 2 in the future. Because they really seem to have good ideas, and good ideas leads to potential.C'mon. You can do it, guys.			"

												Fun concept, decent enough execution. Wish there was a bit more replay value on the individual stages, but aside from that they are well crafted and fun to roam around. It doesn't seem like you earn anything special for achieving all the objectives, and sometimes the orbs are hard to find. Not a point of frustration though, just an unnecessary annoyance.

												Absolutely sensational quality content. The integrity displayed overwhelmed me with three main points; the divinely hand crafted atmosphere most games lack, the unassailible and limitless ways to share your victories with others, and the enticing graphics to draw you straight into the action.Without doubt, the setting portrayed throughout the stages perfectly inveigled me into the story like no other have I experienced. The peachy skies and flawless earls encrusting the curiosity held in deep under the covers. I would suggest one to visit the profile of yours truly, to absorb the scenery in the screenshot photography I specialise in.Many a time, I would be left alone in other games, a lonely tension in the air. Fear not, for caster consumatley fulfills this hunger for companionship one so desires. To quote Nicholas Sparks:  “She was struck by the simple truth that sometimes the most ordinary things could be made extraordinary, simply by doing them with the right people...”  I would highly encourage this lively experience for anyone sociable or not.In most cases with mainstream games, one would be marketed to a particular audience, focusing on one factor such as story, gameplay, or graphics, etc. Caster? nop. Caster is a game that is truly extraordinarily well blended, like a single malt Glenmorangie fitted in a round bottomed dummy, dohdoh, or binky (Pacifier for the uneducated). The immense effort put into the adrenaline pumping, delicately balanced partition in the clouds that this piece of artistic genius presents can only be summarised by a quote from Barry himself:  ""Every day should have its golden moments, it's the diamond standard"". So ye, twas alriCapri,General Consultant.			"

												Well, i have beaten the game on medium difficult and i seriously didn't have that much fun, the game has an interesting concept but that's about it. This is more like a prototype, a ""test"" from the developers and it does have some interesting mechanics. Music was great, loved it. Graphics not so much, it is too much ""meh"", they look like some sort of graphic that a ps1 game would have, which not necesseraly makes it bad, but there is simply nothing unique about it, it doesn't catch your attention, it has absolutly no proper style. And the gameplay, oh the gameplay, so much mixed feelings about it... First of all, it is quite fun to search for all the weapons, but after you got all of them (about halfway through) it absolutely doesn't make you want to continue. As you upgrade your gear you start becoming OP, very early in game i maxed my normal gun and a few moments later my dash and my jump, it wasn't very hard to do this and yet, i became a monster. Max Dash+Max jump = saints row 4 flying mechanic. Max laser gun = Continuos beam of death. What irritates the most is that the developers though they could fix this by making the enemies even more OP. Bosses are bullet sponge, flying mosquitos are almost impossible to kill and do WAY too much damage. Plus, minus 1 point for that freaking Toxic cloud. After all, it was a short game, a interesting concept, a very nice music and that's about it. Worth 2 dollars? I don't think so, you probably will just keep in your steam library and never play.Want to buy this game on sale so you can sell the cards and ""win"" money? Good luck, i have beaten both campaings and won a single card. "

												Works brilliantly on my modest and old laptop ( A HP G7000 ) and is really great fun to play despite it's graphics being lacking by today's standards. The concept is very different from the norm, and the closest thing I can think of is the mini games in the Sega Genesis/Megadrive sonic the hedgehog where Sonic (The main Character) would run on a globe covered in red and blue spheres and your goal was to collect all the blue spheres without getting any of the red ones. Essentially this game seems to similar;  to collect power orbs while destroying the monsters that will try to stop you.It's very simple but it has me hooked and will be something I will be playing a lot on my laptop and maybe even on my main pc lol xD			"

												Caster is a 2009 game that would have been a big hit on the Nintendo 64. I'm talking about the good old Rareware quality before Microsoft turned it into just plain Rare. In spirit the developer should earn a Miyamoto award! I think the developer was a senior programmer at Hidden Path Entertainment, they are known for games like CS:GO and Defense Grid 2.Instead of writing a long review (which I may semi-do anyways ;P) I'd like to show some gameplay footage. From this hopefully you can deduce things like how quickly you can pass Caster and level of fun.


YouTube™ Video: Caster -  Various Play 

			Views: 48		

			I play four maps. No particular reason for selection. There are a few maps with some interesting features and slight variations to spice things up.		

The game directory contents is quite interesting. It uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and some other familiar DLL files. The assets are open to look at. For example the levels consist of two image maps. One for depth and one colour coded that represents the actual design. Essentially you could just create a level in Photoshop or Paint.The biggest problem with Caster is that it freezes my PC randomly. It may have something to do with the graphics since the game works fine in safe mode. The only thing you can do is press the reset button on your PC when it happens since Ctrl + Alt + Del won't even work.			"

Even though it cost only 9p due to the sale, I found it to be a very interesting and fun game and I would've bought it even if it weren't on a sale.-- ProsA very interesting graphics choice - it reminds me of PS1/PS2 games.Amazing soundtrack, I was bobbing my head every time I heard a track.2 storylinesEven with the old Playstation-esque graphics, there are a lot of options to improve graphics.6 different weapons which can be upgraded, as well as your attributes, such as dashing speed.Continuing with my previous point, you're basically a humanoid Sanic that jumps ridiculously high and changes colour like a chameleon according to the weapons. Me encanta.3 different difficulties.The levels are huge.-- ConsSome people may find the graphics to be poor.The game was way too short - I put in just a bit over an hour.The game was released in 2009 and still hasn't been updated to continue on with the 2nd storyline. I am disappoint :cSome things, like the toxic clouds in some levels, kill you too quickly.The enemies are too weak in terms of damage, are mostly microscopic and incredibly high in defence.There was no character development. Like seriously, the only thing that speaks to you is this woman called Asha that does nothing to help you. And there's this ""Commander's Log"" which is just filler.Overall, I did find the game to be fun, but the cons were what changed my mind of the game a tiny bit.8/10A Sonikku seal of approval			"

This game is a fast paced 3rd person shooter with N64/PS1 graphics and an amazing soundtrack. The gameplay is great and the game is alot fo fun! I recommend buying it because for 20 cents thats a huge steal.			"

												Well I made profit on this, but it is still a decent game. The graphics are quite bad, but the game runs well and looks better than most indie games actually. The combat demands skill, something even AAA games lack and is kept interesting. There is no story however, just more levels with different enemies.			"

												So then.Caster.I guess the only way to describe this is with a story.Imagine you are sitting at a bar. There you are with your group of friends, sitting, drinking, eating, normal bar activities. You glance over the shoulder of your friend and see a very ugly woman sitting at the back of the bar. You point her out to your friends and she notices, blushing harshly under the glare of you and your group.Everyone stands up and laughs at her because she is so horrifically hideous, however she then stands up and laughs with everyone.It turns out she is actually a really fun person, you look past her ugly exterior and you slowly fall in love with her. But after a while you realise she is only fun in one or two situations, all of the other times you dont even know what to say to her, or what to do.You leave her, she cries for a few days but she gets over it.Turns out you only gave her 9p.Worth it.

												I got Caster for something like 20 cents. The game is similar to a PS1/N64 game and has that kind of quality to it. I grew up with these so I knew what to expect. The game looks ugly, but it reminds me of those PS1 games making me like it a little. There are different powers to try out and they're all fun, the game is challenging and makes you use all of your skills. I enjoyed it because there was no right way to beat an enemy. You can run rings around them looking for an opening or leap into the air and rain death from above. Don't expect anything amazing but for the price it's worth it, you can just have fun with it. Also if you had a PS1 or N64 it has a really cool nostolgia factor towards it. 6/10			"

												I'm not even going to lie, I bought it because of the Steam cards. Once I opened the game it just looked like another generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low-priced videogame that people buy because profit, but just for good measure I started playing it. I was shocked because of all the options it has, quite impressed to be honest that in a game like this you can change the depth of field, resolution, shadows and so on and so forth. The gameplay is actually pretty well designed, the combat is a little bit repetitive not going to lie but you do have a quite variety of weapons to chose from if you so desire, even though the balance in this game is ABSOLUTELY disgusting. You can kill the final boss of the first campaign just by freezing the damn thing and shooting it with your basic attack. The dash ability is ridiculously Overpowered as well as the super jump which at this rate might as well be called flying because that's exactly what you end up doing, flying through half of the map, stay on the ground for a few seconds and then take off to get to the other side of the map.Another thing that bothers me is the fact that the game doesn't actually encourage you to complete all of the stages without taking any damage other than the 2,000 bonus credits you get that are incredibly useless once you are fully upgraded (at last in the part of the game I stopped playing). Guns are too powerful, enemies are the same and predictable and the game is way too easy, I literally just finished the first campaign using two weapons and the others just to pick up the Energy Orbs when needed. Nice game it is worth the price just needs more attention on the balance side of things.			"

												Going into this I wasn't expecting much.  The preview video and the screenshots revealed little about its gameplay, and the art style didn't look like much, either.  But boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The spells you cast are really fun to use and each have their place against certain enemies, the movement is so satisfying and fun (dashing at the speed of sound and leaping across the entire map, anyone?) and the enemies, at this stage in the game, are easy but varied.  My only gripe is that the game hands you too many upgrade points at once.  I'm not even an hour in and I've already maxed three abilities (jump, dash and Pulse) and it's making the maps trivial at best.  Maybe this was the intention?  All in all, a great purchase (on sale for $0.14 USD) and I also think it's a good purchase at its full price as well.  Definitely worth your time.  Also, community maps!			"

												I would like to begin by saying this is game is worth the money. While i may have purchased this game for 20 cents it is worth the 3 dollars that the developer is asking for. The reasoning is rather simple.The game consists of approx 40 levels with some that can be added in with mods and while not complex provide enough entertainment and replay value while giving a summary of what was missed in the level collectables such as Orbs and enemies. And what is also nice is the levels are short allowing for quick sessions if desired.The gameplay stands above everything in this game including the Presentation and Story. Including Fast gameplay, varied enemies and a choice of 6 different weapons. While the graphics leave something to be desired looking like a game from the N64 era the fast movement, insane jump height , and ability to scale walls add a nice touch to this 3rd person shooter that outweigh the graphics or lack of story in this game. Not to mention that the game has upgrades that can be applied to every ability.The last thing i would add is if you do end up playing it or want the game to look more appealing, turn on cartoon shading in the .ini file of the game.

												A friend bought me this game for what I believe was $0.18. Even that price overvalues this unplayable broken mess of code, graphics, and sound that cannot accurately be referred to as a game.You know when you're walking on the sidewalk and there's those slopes for cars to drive up to get over the sidewalk and into a driveway or something? Well what do you do if you encounter one of those? I'd think you would simply walk across it because it's not even close to an obstacle and it's the most minor thing any person has had to conquer in their life.WELL NOT IF YOU'RE THE MAIN CHARACTER FROM CASTER!!Yes, really. The character from Caster freezes in place and gets stuck in a sliding animation at each and every microscopic slope, at every grain of sand on the ground, at every little dent or uneven footing. This is not like Super Mario 64 where you slide down a slope if it's steep enough. First, you don't even slide; you get immobilized and the only way out of it is to jump only to become immobile again. Second, almost no ground exists for this character to easily walk across it like a normal person. The Caster kid needs his/her land to be a mathematically defined plane! Oh, but not any mathematically defined plane! It must universally form a perpedicular angle with gravity at every yoctometer squared lest thou Caster kid freezeth upon thy fine slope! I mean, this is just PLANE ridiculous!Oh yeah. I also have to talk about the graphics, sound, controls, and gameplay. The graphics suck, the sound sucks, the controls suck, and the gameplay sssucks.Don't even buy this for two cents.			"

												It's quite an interesting game actually. 1st off, i love the game mechanics, that is what makes this game really fun and enjoyable to play. I really didn't expect it would be fun when i bought it but hey, it is, however, although this game has fun game mechanics, the level design and graphics are awful. It looks like the developers just spent 1 hour creating each level. That makes this game seem so cheap. I want to reccommend to the developer that if they created some amazing levels, i would consider this quite an amazing game. Take the map of Skyrim for example, or titanfall. The map/s in those games are detailed and amazing. Something similar in this game would have made it even better. I would have also preferred voice acting. So in conclusion, it has fun game mechanics but horrible level design and graphics. They could have upped the texture res a good bit at least.			"

												I think this is my first indie game on Steam I liked (though I am new to them). Caster is a well-designed game with very tight controls and unique enemies that can change the way you play levels for a very fun experience. The story isn't the most well put-together and neither is the main character, but it serves well enough to get the game rolling. I think the levels are built very uniquely and not only cater to Caster's abilities and need for space when fighting enemies but also show how large and empty the world that Caster lives in. And while the Middon levels were fun, I think the ones in Lydonia were the more superiorly designed levels, though I hope the creator ends up making that last level, because that was a bit of a harsh slap to the face after having played so many engaging levels. This is definitely a game I recommend you don't pass up.			"

												Basically this game is a engine demo for a Mega Man Legends inspired game. It doesn't have tank controls though. You have 8 abilities and the ability to dash super jump. Jumping 500 feet into the air is super satisfied. You can upgrade all weapons, health, dashing, and jumping though points earned during the level. So you're Super Jumps become flying. The story is nearly non existant. You are Caster (seemingly a spell caster) who gets spells to destroy monsters and revive trees from evil flanks (creatures). The character looks inspired by Megaman. Theres a missions system where in the level you get the power up for certain creatures is similiar to megaman. The only other character in the game is a blonde who tells you a basic mission and says good job when you do it (Like Roll). IT IS A UNFINISHED GAME! But every level introduces new mechanics. The floor is destructable which can lead to some strategy on some level. The levels are basic, but have a general mechanic they are built around. Later missions I actually died. You are getting swarmed by flying enemies and little ground swarmers, and the chaos gets pretty fun. Seems like this game was made by a few people in thier free time. It's a shame nothing more came out of it because with money and polish if feels like it could have been a series. First 3 levels are meh. Then it gets more interesting. It is bland, but what is there is interesting and endearing. It's just sad because more resources could have turned a good tech demo into a great game. It's definitely worth a peek if on sale, you are a diehard megaman fan, and can appreciate the simple things. I shouldn't like this game as much as I do, but it grows on you. Which seems to be the general sentiment in reviews.			"

												I went into this game with very low expectations. Frankly, I only got it because there was a ridiculous sale that dropped the price down to 14 cents. Upon playing it, I was pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is simple but very fun. It's a third person run and gun action game that puts you in arenas of varying sizes, each with a simple task to complete. There isn't a lot of variety in these tasks, it's either collect orbs, destroy monsters or a boss, or shoot a tree... it makes sense in context. The game isn't very challenging or long, I beat all the currently available missions within three hours and a good chunk of that time was just faffing about running and jumping for fun. The mobility in this game is what makes it so fun. Running and high jumping all over the map kept me amused and entertained throughout the whole game. There's also an arsenal of weapons that range from rapid fire homing bolts to terrain morphing blasts that make the gameplay more unique. The art and design style leaves a lot to be desired. Everything is blocky and unpolished. It looks like an early PS1 game in alpha. Still, it doesn't really affect gameplay so it's not a big deal. There hasn't been many updates to this game even though it's pretty old so don't expect new content. There are community mods, however, so you're not limited to the main game. Even then, this game is reasonably priced so you're not getting ripped off if there aren't any more updates. I'd say, give it a try. It's far from perfect but for what it is, it's fun. Plus, it'll kill a couple hours if you're bored.			"

												A great game for it's price. Still learning the game, yet it seems like the power scale of the weapons is a wide range, to the fact where, unless I need a specific weapon is needed for an area, I always use it (SPOILER: orbit, it shields from attacks fires fast, and can be held down to make many different things). Not sure about later in the game though. The tutorial and the pop-up texts explain almost everything you need to know. It's a bit dark in parts of the game, and hit detection on a few of the enemies are off, but aside from that and me getting lost in some of the bigger maps, I have no complaints. I've seen other complaints about the game not being finished, but it seems pretty much done to me, aside from a few bug patches.			"

												I want to like this game. For the $.20 I paid for it, I wasn't disappointed. But for what this game COULD be I am extremely let down. It feels like a half-finished project, especially when you get to what is currently the last level and it says ""to be continued, check the website for news."" This game was released 6 years ago and there's about 2 hours worth of play currently. This game is due for a major update or at least a well-rounded sequel, complete with an actual story-line, explanations as to what the hell you're doing and why, and some variation to gameplay other than ""hold down mouse button, run fast, collect orbs.""This game looks ♥♥♥♥ing neat. It looks like it should be amazing. I REALLY want to like this game. But I can't honestly say I'm thrilled with it. For it's cheap price, it's totaly worth it. And for that alone I'm reccomending it.			"

												I bought this during the sale with some spare Steam Wallet cash, and I mean, this isn't the best game I've seen, but I mean, it's not a terrible game. I like the way the game controls for the most part. I liked the dashing and double jumping. The shooting was easy, and the weapons were at least varied enough to actually all be interesting to see what they did. I mean, I probably won't play this game to its end, but I mean, it has some good parts, and some bad. The levels felt open and barren, but each one was at least somewhat unique for as far as I played. The graphics could use a bit of work in my opinion, but I mean, I think for the sale price, I'm not really going to complain too much.I only really recommend this with the sale price, I mean, 3 bucks for this wouldn't be too bad in my opinion, but I mean, I probably wouldn't have picked it up myself at this price.

												I would like to begin by saying this is game is worth the money. While i may have purchased this game for 20 cents it is worth the 3 dollars that the developer is asking for. The reasoning is rather simple.The game consists of approx 40 levels with some that can be added in with mods and while not complex provide enough entertainment and replay value while giving a summary of what was missed in the level collectables such as Orbs and enemies. And what is also nice is the levels are short allowing for quick sessions if desired.The gameplay stands above everything in this game including the Presentation and Story. Including Fast gameplay, varied enemies and a choice of 6 different weapons. While the graphics leave something to be desired looking like a game from the N64 era the fast movement, insane jump height , and ability to scale walls add a nice touch to this 3rd person shooter that outweigh the graphics or lack of story in this game. Not to mention that the game has upgrades that can be applied to every ability.The last thing i would add is if you do end up playing it or want the game to look more appealing, turn on cartoon shading in the .ini file of the game.

												A friend bought me this game for what I believe was $0.18. Even that price overvalues this unplayable broken mess of code, graphics, and sound that cannot accurately be referred to as a game.You know when you're walking on the sidewalk and there's those slopes for cars to drive up to get over the sidewalk and into a driveway or something? Well what do you do if you encounter one of those? I'd think you would simply walk across it because it's not even close to an obstacle and it's the most minor thing any person has had to conquer in their life.WELL NOT IF YOU'RE THE MAIN CHARACTER FROM CASTER!!Yes, really. The character from Caster freezes in place and gets stuck in a sliding animation at each and every microscopic slope, at every grain of sand on the ground, at every little dent or uneven footing. This is not like Super Mario 64 where you slide down a slope if it's steep enough. First, you don't even slide; you get immobilized and the only way out of it is to jump only to become immobile again. Second, almost no ground exists for this character to easily walk across it like a normal person. The Caster kid needs his/her land to be a mathematically defined plane! Oh, but not any mathematically defined plane! It must universally form a perpedicular angle with gravity at every yoctometer squared lest thou Caster kid freezeth upon thy fine slope! I mean, this is just PLANE ridiculous!Oh yeah. I also have to talk about the graphics, sound, controls, and gameplay. The graphics suck, the sound sucks, the controls suck, and the gameplay sssucks.Don't even buy this for two cents.			"

The game looks ugly, but it reminds me of those PS1 games making me like it a little. There are different powers to try out and they're all fun, the game is challenging and makes you use all of your skills. I enjoyed it because there was no right way to beat an enemy. You can run rings around them looking for an opening or leap into the air and rain death from above. Don't expect anything amazing but for the price it's worth it, you can just have fun with it. Also if you had a PS1 or N64 it has a really cool nostolgia factor towards it. 6/10			"

What is it with this game being crazy!? The enemys are completely different from what ive seen in any game, the use of weapons on enemys and the way they (Sometimes) blend into or go with the environment.Overall rating: 8.3/10:This game is Totally out of my comfort zone inside gaming, and im SO glad i pushed the boundries.

												Seriously, I bought this during a sale and I do not regret it. Even though it cost only 9p due to the sale, I found it to be a very interesting and fun game and I would've bought it even if it weren't on a sale.-- ProsA very interesting graphics choice - it reminds me of PS1/PS2 games.Amazing soundtrack, I was bobbing my head every time I heard a track.2 storylinesEven with the old Playstation-esque graphics, there are a lot of options to improve graphics.6 different weapons which can be upgraded, as well as your attributes, such as dashing speed.Continuing with my previous point, you're basically a humanoid Sanic that jumps ridiculously high and changes colour like a chameleon according to the weapons. Me encanta.3 different difficulties.The levels are huge.-- ConsSome people may find the graphics to be poor.The game was way too short - I put in just a bit over an hour.The game was released in 2009 and still hasn't been updated to continue on with the 2nd storyline. I am disappoint :cSome things, like the toxic clouds in some levels, kill you too quickly.The enemies are too weak in terms of damage, are mostly microscopic and incredibly high in defence.There was no character development. Like seriously, the only thing that speaks to you is this woman called Asha that does nothing to help you. And there's this ""Commander's Log"" which is just filler.Overall, I did find the game to be fun, but the cons were what changed my mind of the game a tiny bit.8/10A Sonikku seal of approval			"

I did not expect it to have this much fun in it.It has better terraforming than Starforge and destruction better than BF4.10/10			"

												Got it on sale for $0.14 and I tell ya. for that price, it's more than absolutely worth it!  It's a classic 3D, fast paced, shooter.  Can't go wrong.  Its actually very fun gameplay too, takes me back to the original xbox games I played as a kid.You can jump super high, and run around very fast (best way to stay alive) so it feels engaging for sure.You upgrade and acquire weapons and abilities too, so the overall gameplay is not boring.

												Caster is a 2009 game that would have been a big hit on the Nintendo 64. I'm talking about the good old Rareware quality before Microsoft turned it into just plain Rare. In spirit the developer should earn a Miyamoto award! I think the developer was a senior programmer at Hidden Path Entertainment, they are known for games like CS:GO and Defense Grid 2.Instead of writing a long review (which I may semi-do anyways ;P) I'd like to show some gameplay footage. From this hopefully you can deduce things like how quickly you can pass Caster and level of fun.


YouTube™ Video: Caster -  Various Play 

			Views: 48		

			I play four maps. No particular reason for selection. There are a few maps with some interesting features and slight variations to spice things up.		

The game directory contents is quite interesting. It uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and some other familiar DLL files. The assets are open to look at. For example the levels consist of two image maps. One for depth and one colour coded that represents the actual design. Essentially you could just create a level in Photoshop or Paint.The biggest problem with Caster is that it freezes my PC randomly. It may have something to do with the graphics since the game works fine in safe mode. The only thing you can do is press the reset button on your PC when it happens since Ctrl + Alt + Del won't even work.			"

												This game could have given so much more. To give you an idea, I beat this game in 89 minutes, that's with exploring, and completing EVERY little objective this game has. As soon as I beat it I never touched it again. Here are some pros and cons...Pros:-The game is fun, and gives you a break from hardcore games.-I've never really seen any other game like it, it's fresh.-Easy to pick up, easy to play.-Fun abilities, and once yo finish the level you don't have to leave. There was a couple of times where I kinda dicked around a lot, but it was fun.Cons:-The levels/worlds are not very expansive, it can take anyone not even 2 minutes to walk from one side to the other.-The games levels also kind of seem unfinished, they made landscaping where they wanted you to go. Only one level was actually good, it was kind of a swampy level.-Small variety in enemies.Over all, this game was a bit rushed, or it was someones first project, I have no clue. If you have an hour or two to waste, buy this game, it's only $0.49. "

												I have never played a more holy game than this. It is the best game since lego harry potter to use a function where you have to switch out the weapons manually while the Flanx attack you. What I liked most personally has to be the reset of the game after you apply options. Other than that, I customize my characters left and right varrying from male to female. I have died a dozens times trying to figure out how to defeat Flanx, but then I noticed that they clearly explained how to beat them. I now look forward to the many days where I shall replay it over and over. It was pretty smart. 10/10			"

												While I liked what I've actually played of this game, I honestly cannot recommend it even for the 3EUR, or whatever it is in your country, right now.For one thing, the game looks like, well, s**t. And I'm no graphics w****, but this game just looks... really, really bad. Mind you, I don't really care, but if graphics are something you care in any way about, this game isn't for you.Of course, other problems include level design, which tends to be completely generic and uninspired at its best, and just s***e at it's worst. One level is just a bunch of squares arranged in rows, like so________|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |Well. That's the closest thing I can get with ASCII art, anyway. Others can be a bit more interesting, with mountains and stuff, but the game's level design is nothing special.Of course, the real problem with this game is how hilariously unbalanced it is. It's not long before you can throw around mighty balls of energy that deform the landscape at will, are capable of jumping hundreds of feet in the air, running around faster than Sonic on steroids, etc. etc.And while some of this is alleviated with the fact that some enemies have huge amounts of health or are capable of one of your mighty super-move-esque blasts, it's not nearly enough.To be honest, something I felt the game could have really benefited from is some multiplayer, because that could genuinely be interesting, with groups running and jumping all over the place, deforming the landscape at will and attempting to hit each other, but alas, it was not to be.So there you go. That's my opinions, based on what I've played. Might've missed some things that somehow magically fix all this, but the game lost me before that if that's the case.			"

Caster isn't a deep game. Caster isn't really a pretty game. But Caster IS a fun game.The meat of Caster is using your energy powers to blast giant bugs to hell. You have 6 powers you can unlock (With additional abilities for running, jumping and shield regen):  Pulse (Basic projectiles) Orbit (Defensive orbs form a shield that is also used as a weak attack) Seeker (Guided missles that go for all available targets) Stun (Does exactly what the name implies) Blast (Modifies the terrain by blasting it down) Eruptor (Modifies the terrain by blasting it up)Though Eruptor and Blast could have easily been a single power, and Orbit is basically useless, the powers are all fun to play around with. Especially when fully upgraded, which is done simply by purchasing them in the menu by using points obtained after completing each level. You can get more points by killing all enemies on the map, finding all the large power orbs, picking up all the small power orbs dropped by both enemies and trees aftter ""healing"" them (shooting them with your powers). The levels themselves are fairly large and sparse, perfect for the breakneck pace you'll be running and jumping after upgrading your basic abilities.The bugs, your enemies, have a few interesting designs. But by a few I mean a few since there is little actual enemy variety in this game. You have swarmers, shooters and grabbers. Bosses are more or less bigger, badder versions of the basic enemies.Graphically the game is no better than an early PS2 title, which just adds to the charm. That said the article effects look pretty damn good. The only thing I can say looks outright bad or ugly are the character portraits which look like they're right out of someones DeviantArt account from 10 years ago.Music is enjoyable, no annoying tracks to be found but nothing too memorable either.tl;dr if you want a fun little arcade-y game where you're super OP and go ham on hordes of enemies then play this game "

												One day I played this game together with my brother. Although we finished it in just about 3 hours, I have to say, this is a game that shouldn't be missed. The simple design, which reminded me of Mega man, drew me and my brother into it. I wish there was more content from the makers - well, there's a MOD community that can make levels, so there's that :)This also surprisingly fills a void in my life which is supposed to be filled in by Mega Man Legends.

Upgrading system was a pretty thing to add in the game.Debuffs!1. Character models look wierd as hell.2.Not like a long story I could possibly beat this game less in 2 hours heck 1.3.They just had area block off like a big wall not like a certain area sealed off.Not much for the debuffs.One thing I was ok with!The game was really slow in the start but becomes really fast paced later on.

												Even though recieved at a 75% reduction in sales price, well worth the full $2. As I see other reviews giving it a hard time for it's outdated graphics and negative comments, I wonder why there are people hating on a developer such as this who took time to create a small indie-sized yet enjoyable sandbox-like, bullet-hell masterpiece but the same ones give AAA games that lack nearly any creativity the ""10"" rating that it doesn't deserve. If you are like myself who can play a games and can overlook small flaws to design in areas like grahpics and clunkiness from time-to-time, then I'm sure you will find the price is well worth this Electronic-soundtracked indie dark horse.

												Never have I been so excited to run and shoot things in my life.For those who want the short and simple review, Caster is fun. Alot of fun. Get it.For those who like to read:Caster is an overall great game, but it has its ups and downs. The colorful array of powers and the interesting #D terrain makes for a great experience. I especially enjoy the fact that I was able to play with a controller, as it requires a little more skill. What KILLS me about this game is the general lack on contect. I was able to complete the game within in an hour on its normal dificulty. Graphics wise there is alot to be desired, but that's just me being picky. All in all I give it a 7/10, definitely worth playing considering its price.			"

												Price / hour 0,58€ (there's some sales to get it cheaper)First off why it's a masterpiece in it's own way: It's unique and featured in ""250 Indie Games You Must Play""Before I move to Pros and cons, I say this: If you like the trailer (ignore the music), buy it. It's not like the new game trailers that doesn't have anything to do with the gameplay, this Steam trailer fits the whole gameplay pretty well. People who like fast and different movement in gaming like me, this is absolutely a good choice for it.Pros:- Soundtrack. It's not like in trailer, it's peaceful with little power in it, so heck it's awesome and enertaining.- The speed. As I said about the different and fast movement, it's true.- Destroyable enviroment -  The weapons destroy (or add) some ground and you can use it to example avoid attacks.Cons:- Length- Bonus maps by mods. Mod pack 1 took like 20 mins to complete, there's no much fanbase to this game and therefore no more maps, doesn't affect so much to the interest of this game.- Unbalanced weapons. Seriously I used almost only one weapon to complete the game because it was simply the best when upgrading to best- Super jump is too.. superior. You can kinda just fly through the map and kill the enemies above. It's not what Caster is about as you can see from the trailer. ---> I like the upgrades and stuff, but it makes stuff way too easy. If this game would be longer though, this issue could be removed, because you can't get half of the upgrades at the first levels.- Ignore the partial controller support - at least when my Gamecube controller was attached to my computer, it somehow bugged that it forced the mouse to go upwards 24/7			"

												Disclaimer: I've been playing offline, that's why it says I've only played 0.2 hours. In reality it's closer to 1.2 hours.The game has 2 chapters, and at the time of writing, I'm about halfway through the second one.The main complaint I have about this game is that it's just way too easy. I played on Extreme difficulty and I could still get through most of the levels without even taking damage. The Dash move, which is unlocked at the start is basically just a sprint which makes you run at about 3 times the speed of sound. After each level you can buy upgrades which cost about half as much as a ♥♥♥♥ing Twix, and after upgrading the Dash a few times you can dash for about 30 seconds with a 3 second cooldown afterwards.While dashing, you can walk on water, toxin and lava don't hurt you and you move too fast for enemy projectiles to be able to hit you. The only times you even need to bother with killing enemies are the levels where the objective is to clear out the area. When the objective is just to heal the tree at the end, or to collect all of the energy orbs, you can just sprint past the Flanx (enemies) and finish the level in about 30 seconds.For attacks, the only one you need is the Pulse, which is basically a rocketlauncer that you can charge to do more damage, but just spamming the uncharged attack is enough to kill most enemies in no time once you've upgraded the attack a few times. Even the big♥♥♥♥♥bosses are a piece of cake once you know how to spam the attack.The controls are good, and I like how your attacks can affect the level (shooting rockets makes craters appear etc.), and the monster design is pretty good and creative as well.That said, the difficulty is really a dealbreaker and therefore I can't say I recommend Caster.4/10			"

												I played a bit of Caster and I didn't find it particularly interesting. I don't care about the graphics, which doesn't look good, but the game is simply not fun to play. You have 6 different weapons (that you collect as you progress) with which you can kill/stun your enemies, but the enemy variety is little, and basically it's always a question of running around the enemies to avoid being hit and shoot them until they die. Levels are really small, and with the instructions + map it's very easy to finish them.Sound effects are basic, and there's no story to get involved with. A plus of the game is the options' menu, very rich, but all in all I simply wouldn't recommend playing the game. Pick it up only if it's heavily discounted.One final thing: on Mac, this game crashed once while I was playing, and once it failed to launch.			"

												I'm sorry, I wanted to like this game, I really believe that a concept like this could work but how it's done here gets kind of boring and tedious after a while even on hard mode. Not to mention all other weapons except the first one you start off with are useless. The only time I got to use any of the other ones was the eruptor, and I only used that once or twice to get some energy thingies from out of the water since you can swim under it in this game. Let's also not forget the AI is terrible, they either don't move around at all and when you want enemies that do they move around they do so way too much for your projectiles to even come close to them. It just feels like a college student's project that's not even finished, like so much more could be done.			"

												It's alright if you want some stupid fun every once in a while.The graphics ain't that fantastic and the characters i hardly can even describe without quotes, but...The gameplay's pretty funny.At first, it's confusing, then painful, but then you start noticing things...And then things get interesting.And you learn things.And then you have fun with the things you learn.It's not for everyone, and by no means is it a great game, but...It's not bad or boring, or at least not TOO bad or boring.I just think with more ideas and resources, this could be a BETTER game....Oh, and there's community mods too.

												This is honestly a terrible game, even for 2009 standards.The camera angle is beyond screwed, and camera speed comes with 10 settings, which are realistically just variations of ""WAY TOO SLOW!"" and ""HOLYJEEZTHISISTOOFASTTOKNOWWHATI'MDOINGBUTTHISCOCAINESMELLSSOGOOD!"" so I'd recommend a mouse with adjustable DPI for that.The story is as rich as a dead hobo, and the gameplay bored the living hell out of me, which (Summarised) is: Collect magical orb thing, kill random alien things, go to the giant yellow light for Scotty to beam you up. Also, there's something about shooting a dead tree, and bringing it back to life, then getting more orb things to upgrade your super powers.Audio quality is very mixed, with some levels having nice music, and others being absolutely shocking. The level after the tutorial gave me a three hour headache after listening to a shoddy loop of rain until my punishment was over, and I finished the level.I picked this game up for 10 cents, and I regret buying it. Even if it was so I could sell the cards.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to change the Music volume everytime by 10%.You are able to change the Sound volume everytime by 10%.All resolution sizes are available.You can toggle between fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a camera sensitivity.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.You are able to change the controls on the controller.You are able to play the game with a controller. Obviously.There is ""How to play"".There is a difficulty level available.There are many save slots available.About the game.You are playing with some kind of thing and you are send into a mission. You have to complete objectives to move on to the next level. Mostly killing enemies or collecting orbs. The game is getting dull very quickly as it has nothing to offer. You are basically doing the same stuff over and over and over again. You got a shop to upgrade things and a mini-radar at the bottom.You can choose between male or female character.However the scenery in this game is very bland, and i mean VERY VERY BLAND/EMPTY.The animations are very dull.The game Graphics are from N64. The music is the best part of this game.Enemies are easy and not very interesting. I am playing this on the highest difficulty and there isnt a big issue to deal with.Other things.It would be better to only get this game during a sale or discount, otherwise you are better off playing a different game. Don't expect too much form this game.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			"

												It's repetitive, generic, short & unpolished even for a one man indie game. The most creative idea in Caster (reforming terrain with weapons) is only used functionally in 2 levels in the main storyline in 2 short puzzles. The shooting gameplay involves very little thought, you'll find yourself spamming the attack button with the reticle pointed in the general direction of the enemies alot while running in circles or backwards to avoid getting hit. Enemy AI is extremely predictable, they literally do the same thing every time without variation, e.g. everytime you shoot a certain type of bug, it will jump into the air & land until you shoot it again, another type of enemy walks back a specific number of units every time it gets hit.If you can sell the cards you get & essentially get the game for free, then you might as well try it, but I doubt you will enjoy it. Most 5th/early 6th gen store attack shooters are better.			"

												Caster is a really fun, action-packed shooter game. You're able to run super fast, and also jump very, VERY high, which makes the game quite interesting. You get throughout the game 6 different powers (different attacks) which you'll be able to use in the later maps. These 2 combined together makes a quite nice punch, as you'll be able to jump quite high and run fast to dodge the enemy attacks and at the same time shoot the enemies (this made the game quite easy for me tho). This reminded me very much of Megaman -series, since the character also looked alot like Megaman.The game took about 1,5 hours for me to play through. "

												Caster is probably not for all people and its not for me either. In caster you play as a rookie caster who is asked to fight off a deadly waves of aliens called flanx. It gives you diffrent powers to fight them which is cool because some of those powers are pretty cool. The worlds you visit look awfull and look dull its just fields of nothing. The flanx types look awfull and sometimes just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to fight them off. With infinite lives you cant die so that helps to fight some of the tougher enemies. But some missions are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥such as Acid meadows. In that missions you have to escort a boat by lifting up the ground through the acid lake and the boat can be destroyed. Overall this game is just awfull in all ways horrible graphics, bland worlds, terrible gunplay and awfull enemies its just a title you need to stay away from so if you want to buy it be warned i give this game a 2/10			"

I snagged this little gem for only 14 cents with a 95% Steam week-long sale.It's a lot of fun, is very fast paced and the controls are tight and responsive.You got levels to beat, lot of baddies to shoot down, towering cliffs to double jump on, and pools of water to jump into from far above to create an epic splash effect!  Super Fun!The options for both graphics, screen resolution, and sound are nice in an inexpensive game like this as well, plus it offers over 10 different game saves.At the regular prices of $2.99 USD, this game is a good deal... but at the 14 cent sale I bought it at, this is a no brainer.  ..If you play it 10 minutes, you've gotten you money's worth, lol.  Thumbs up all day, every day.  Pure win.			"

												I will list this game pros and consPros    - got it on sale, sold the cards the game gave me, made a profetCons   - the graphics are not so great. The face of your charecter is REALLY WIERD!   - out off all the cool abilitys you may ever get in this game you only need one and use one   - upgrading those abillitys is so one sided since you only ever need and use one   - mainley the game was just tooo easy. you cant really lose even if you dont try playingIn the end the only time you should buy this game is when it is on sale for 25 cents. play for a little and get 4 game cards. sell these cards for 7 cents a piece and make 3 cents. Otherwise NEVER GET THIS GAME			"

												Very lengthy but interesting storyline, great characters. Real tearjerker. Recommend to anyone who likes an emotional, serious and immersive experience. This game has some of the best graphics I have ever seen, and literally ran on a computer I was powering with an array of 10 potato batteries.On the plus side, this is the only game you will be able to play after the zombie apocalypse.

												I bought this game because it looked like it had some potential. However, this is clearly someones first game as it is basically the engines default graphics and such. You have a poorly made character with poorly made animations. The controls on the controller are misconfigured, so you have to essentially use the keyboard. The game consists of you running around collecting orbs that are scattered over the world. I'm sure there are enemies and such later on, but, there's nothing unique about the game. I'm sorry to have to write such a poor review of the game, but it's really really terrible. It's so bad, that in the intro level, you collect an orb that says, hey, there's some extra graphical settings we included, but didn't program into the settings, so you have to manually edit the .ini file if you want them. And another that states, if the controller isn't working right, you need to manually change it around.I can't stress enough how boring this game is. I would highly recommend against buying it, even if it is just 50 cents on sale. Go buy a candy bar, you'll enjoy it more.To the devs: do a better job. If you're a programmer making a game, hire some artists and designers. If you're an artist trying to learn to program, hire a programmer. If you're a 12 year old and this is your first game, then you're on the right track, but don't try and sell your 1st, 2nd, or 50th game until it's actually worth playing. If you're a team of artists and developers, then shame on you for producing this horrendous abomination trying to make a quick buck.			"

												Honestly I wasn't expecting much, but this game surprised me.Gameplay: 7/10Music: Pretty good. 7.5/10Graphics: Looks like an advanced PS1 game from the 90's. But it feels like an aesthetic for me.Combat is alright. You get 6 different weapons with their own physics and abilities that are pretty neat.Some cool mechanics with how you can use different to change the landscape.I'd say it's worth the price especially when it's on sale. The cards are definitely a bonus.			"

												So, after having played Caster for a good while...What do I think of it?On my first time, I started and stopped the game due to controller issues, but it was likely a problem on my end. I'm unsure if it's accostumed to XInput or DirectInput... Anyway, the controls are pretty simple and fluid, since it's the basic move-shoot-jump combo with a Dash button. You have an upgrade system, in which you can up your shield (Lifebar), your pickup distance, Super Jump, Dash (which becomes really handy as you go on), along with the six weapons. The graphics are reminiscent of the early PS2 era, meaning that if your computer is the equivalent of a toaster you shouldn't have any problems running it. You have three difficulties - Casual, Normal, and Hardcore - that are all functional in their own way. You have a good bunch of levels, though the objectives are straightforward. The gameplay in itself feels like a cross between Megaman Legends and a Bullet Hell, when you have loads of enemies. The music has a touch of electronica, neither ill-advised nor well-suited, but it gets the job done. The story's pretty simple, as you're a completely new Caster trying to go up against an alien race known as Flanx. As usual, it's all up to you as you traverse through the game. As you power up your weapons, you're going to have to play a little bit differently as each weapon intensifies its use - as an example, Blast blows small craters on its first upgrade, developing into giant holes as you further upgrade. The scenery, as advertised, shifts along with the battles you have in the level, in a level of terraforming I haven't seen in any game of yet - reminding me a bit of the Dragon Ball Z series, in a way. It's not exactly a time-sinker, as it is Single-Player, but it's always good for a round or two if you're a little bit bored. It does have mods, but you need to go to the game's site to get them. At the time of this review, there's only one modpack - that assumes you have everything upgraded, as it ups the challenge. Perhaps if this game had enough of a fanbase, it might qualify for a Steam Workshop...?tl;dr - Forgettable if you let it slide back into your games library not to touch it, but your first playthroughs are decisively fun and entertaining, and likely enough to keep you entertained.4/5 - Gameplay3/5 - Sound3/5 - GraphicsFINAL SCORE:3/5 - Reasonable!

												This game was boring right off the bat, but it seemed to be getting more interesting so I kept playing.  I finished the entire first campaign.  It actually managed to get worse.Nothing in this game is done well.  The combat requires no skill, just persistance.  Instead of actually ramping up difficulty, the designer just made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bullet sponges.  The various attacks and upgrade system are horribly imbalanced, with some things being almost completely useless.  For example, the stun ability has an incredibly short effect time.  The levels are horribly designed.   There was one level where the mission briefing told me to elmininate all the enemies while climbing what was essentially a huge spiral staircase around a tower.  It then allowed me to just run up the side of the tower, ignoring every enemy, and complete the mission by reaching the top.  Of course, I'm sure I don't need to tell you that it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥too.  After all, you have eyes.I really cannot see how anyone would have terrible enough taste to reccomend this.  It's slow, easy, tedious, unoriginal, and ugly.It's trash.			"

This was rather dissapointing, asking me to check the website for updates, but the game hasnt been updated in 5 years, they JUST added steam badges and cards, not really something I care about. I only hope that this recent update will mean they are back to developing the game!  For 14 cents got well more then my money's worth			"

Very basic, no complicated objectives, no vastly different tactics for different enemies, no adventure elements, all this makes it actually very enjoyable. Meditative. Really relaxing.

												I thought this game was fun in the short amount of time it lasted. The levels do get a little challenging at times, but it gets easier and more fun as you level your powers up(sprinting and jumping pay off the most funwise id say). Graphics definately remind me of the N64 days, Story is short and not that original, but if your looking for a good timewaster, youll waste a couple hours flying across maps, running up vertical hills, and altering the terrain like i have. I give it a 7/10.			"

												Out of boredom I used the last coins in my wallet to buy this game, at first I was thinking it would be a terrible mistake, ironically, this game has potential, and got me playing it for 2 hours 'till I found it's end.The spells at their first levels aren't that interesting, but after farming those trees for a bit and unlocking more powerful levels, I found out that it's incredibly fun to blow several enemies with that acid blast spell while jumping several feet high and creating a massive hole on the ground at the same time. I think the development should continue, and maybe in the future this game can earn a sequel, or a revamp in these graphics, because it's really worth it. So to sum it up, I love this precious mini-game, but I'd love to see the full version of it.			"

												Just... just get it. It's amazing, fun, makes entertaining use of the underutilized mechanic of terrain deformation, stylish, and lets you go from weak to able to jump across entire maps in a single bound, run on lava, and blow massive craters or lift hills out of the terrain with single shots.

												I thought this game was fun in the short amount of time it lasted. The levels do get a little challenging at times, but it gets easier and more fun as you level your powers up(sprinting and jumping pay off the most funwise id say). Graphics definately remind me of the N64 days, Story is short and not that original, but if your looking for a good timewaster, youll waste a couple hours flying across maps, running up vertical hills, and altering the terrain like i have. I give it a 7/10.			"

You are running through the Levels killing giant Insects and finding new Super Powers. The Game is really easy and has no really hard moments (maybe the last boss was a bit harder)I think you can buy this Game for little bit fun, but wait for it to be on Sale again.			"

												Steam Game Review: Caster     As many avid gamers out there know, Steam is an absolute must have when it comes to buying and/or sharing games and gaming experiences. There is an innumerable amount of content on Steam that can tickle the fancy of pretty much anybody out there. Among these games, is that of ""Caster.""     First, let's start with the basics. Pretty much any sale that Steam advertises on their 'Store' page, features this game. It's no more than a quarter (25 cents) every time a sale happens, so with that said, there really isn't too much reason NOT to get it. Let's face it, 25 cents really doesn't get you a whole lot nowadays as it is... You're lucky if you can get a giant gumball for that price at your local grocery store.     Caster is a neat little game that was developed by Elecorn, who is in turn an indie developer. With this said, one should definitely take into consideration the fact that the graphics won't be up to ""par"" as say a major developer's game (Bethesda, 2K Games, Activision, etc) would be. That's not to say that graphics are everything, however. The game does a great job of launching the player into this world that could be described as styled after an old Nintendo 64 3D platformer, much like Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie. Keeping this in mind, a controller adds to this nostalgic feel as the camera angles and movement work in much the same manner. Once the player goes through a brief tutorial mission, explaining how things work, the game then takes the player on a journey through a very outlandish world. It incorporates a rough combat system that puts a slowly unlocked arsenal of various lasers at the player's disposal. Each of these weapons serves a purpose on each level, and it's up to the player to use that noggin of theirs to figure out how each weapon applies to the current mission.     With the mention of weapons, and missions, there is a neat little ""leveling up"" system that happens as well. With each mission the player can destroy enemies and shoot trees to gain an in-game currency, which in turn let's the player upgrade various abilities as well as the lasers. These abilities include the ability to run faster or jump higher, for instance. Cool right? In fact, once some of these abilities are upgraded, the missions become a flatout breeze to go through in some instances. This could be looked at as a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on who the player is. That said, I'll leave that up to interpretation.      While nostalgia, loads of money to grab, and fun ways to outsmart the enemy are fun... This game falls short, and detrimentally so, in a few other, more crucial areas. First off, there is no real ""story."" This is absolutely key when it comes to immersing the player. Without a story... there's very little that will actually make the player feel as though anything is getting accomplished.     Another big problem with this game is the fact that the enemies are almost static in a sense. They have no real movement styles and the ability to decimate them by the thousands is absolutely comical. There's no real combat mechanics that the player needs to acquire in order thwart the enemy and whatever threat they pose in this distant place where nobody seems to know what's going on. This, in and of itself, can absolutely destroy the experience.     So... we have lots of guns, a ""leveling"" system, nostalgia that is offset by lack of story and no real challenge. The bad can offset the good, or vice versa. And maybe it wouldn't be all that bad if that was all there is to the story, however, it's not. Speaking of ""all there is to the story,"" this game, above all things, is NOT COMPLETE. Judging by the looks of things, it won't ever be completed by the developer. This poor little gem of a game has been left incomplete for quite some time now (years, in fact) and the developer has yet to blink an eye at it. It's really quite a shame too, because there is so much potential here. All it needs just a little TLC and just a bit of polishing and this game could turn out to get the recognition that it (potentially) deserves. But don't hold your breath.     On a sidenote, however, I would like to include the fact that the developer was courteous enough to include an actual mission editor and level designer that allows players to fill in holes or create a whole new world. I have tried the editor out, and while it is somewhat wonky at first, I am highly appreciative that Elecorn allowed for the followers of the game the ability to take things into their own hands, if need be. In fact, there is also a section on the Caster/Elecorn website that allows for community submissions to be downloaded by the public to play. So... at least the ""DLC"" is free.     Taking ALL of this into account, I enjoyed my time with the game. And for only 25 cents, I enjoyed it even more. Given that it might take some imagination on the player's part to keep things going, it's well worth the small donation to try. That is... if you are willing to overlook the terribly awful state the game was left in.(Here's to hoping that at some point in time Elecorn revisits this 'pound puppy' of video games gives it the attention that it deserves.)For more information on Caster or download the game, please visit:http://www.elecorn.com/caster3d/index.htmlBe sure to check out my other content!YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qABlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/Tumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/Follow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming			"

I would have loved to play more of it, the game was too short but I heard that more episodes will be released in the future, for free(only if you buy the game, of course). Until then I can enjoy a few mods that I found on Caster's website. I definitely recommend it.			"

												This game was on sale for $0.14 so I bought this game for cards but when I started playing it, I just couldn't stop ! Despite the poor graphics, this game is incredibly fun :D The environments keeps getting interesting as you progress, the terrain being affected during combat, the electronic background music and other stuff perfectly bind together the game. The gameplay is easy and quite smooth, killing bug-like things running at you, exiciting terrains, vaious attacks and upgrades and several other factors will add hours to your gameplay :)On the flip side, it has some cons too. It lacks some strategy and variety. The game is very short and the levels got only a few enemies, and it also seems that the developers spent more time on the environments rather than the characters. Overall, this game is awesome ! Worth a buy, especially if it goes on sale. I would rate this game 8.5/10 :)			"

I love this game so much... *Starts Crying* That I would make it my son... If it were my son... I would love him like this game... Thank you all for your time... Read this review with the urge to buy this game, I believe it will change you as well.. Goodbye everybody.. I've got to go... Got to leave you all behind.. And face truth... Mama.. OOOOOOOO...

Dated and UnengagingCaster feels, in every way, like a game I might've rented for Nintendo 64 back in the day and completely forgotten about by the time the weekend came to an end.Clocking in at about an hour, the game is incredibly brief and simplistic--loosely guided by a storyline so insufficient it's difficult to understand what is actually going on, you dash across barren landscapes for a couple of minutes to fulfil what is usually one of two objectives: kill all flanks on the map or collect all energy balls on the map.The energy balls act as a currency enabling you to upgrade your shield, dash and jump abilities, as well as your arsenal of six weapons, which along with the rudimentary environmental deformation adds a little variety to the game. Regardless, I solely used the Blast weapon throughout the first campaign because none of the others ever offered any advantage. The second, shorter campaign simultaneously makes Caster more interesting and frustrating, posing more thoughtful objectives and stronger enemies yet forcing you to use useless weapons such as the Seeker, whose supposedly ""seeking"" missiles hit their target about 10% of the time.Frankly, this game wouldn't have made it past the bargain bin back on the Nintendo 64, and thus it's embarassing to see such an incredibly amateurish product released in 2009, indie or not, at the laughable price of 4.99. The fact that the second campaign still leaves you with a ""to be continued"" message, five years on, is telling of the fact that Caster has likely been abandoned, and rightly so.			"

												  Megan Man-esque with the ability to alter terrain. I was shocked in just how interesting this game would become. I wasn't expecting much, but it became interesting. The thing is, the premise and the concept...it could have been SO MUCH more. Not that this is bad, I just think the creator could have taken this and made something amazing. But this is what we have. Beautiful in its simplicity. It's definitley unique, and I hope the creator went on to big things. It's still a great game, especially for the price I paid: (17 cents). But for full price ($3.00 USD) I would still say it's worth it. In terms of value: I paid .17 cents. A scale from 1-10. Ten. For the full price, I say its around a 7.			"

												In this Dragonball inspired game, you play as a 'rookie caster' who is the only one left to restore the world and defend against the infestation known as the Flanx. This game will have you dashing about at high speeds blasting enemies and altering terrain with several different abilities. Launching this game the player's eyes will be assaulted with a fuzzy polygonal mess and a crudely conceived UI design. The nicest piece of art this game has to offer is the Steam thumbnail. Having bad production value doesn't mean a game isn't fun but unfortunately Caster has very little to offer in terms of gameplay. Caster is a third-person shooter with a camera angle that can very from directly behind the player-character to a top down perspective.  It can be fun to zip around the map and lay waste to enemies but the player won't experience this until at least one hour into the game. Caster requires the player to collect energy in order to upgrade abilities and as a result the first hour or so of gameplay is very slow and tedious. After this first hour there will be a brief moment of mild amusement and then the player is immediately introduced to enemies and situations that require a slower playstyle. In my opinion the developers would have done well to skip the whole upgrade process that made the first hour or so of gameplay a waste of time and focus on high speed gameplay that this game advertises. Just shy of two hours, my gameplay experience was ended by getting killed because my character was held motionless for a cutscene. This happened to me two consecutive times. This game supports USB controller gameplay however the controls seemed pretty bad (and maybe unworkable). I played with the keyboard and mouse. Score: 2/10			"

Product received for free
												I got this for free and I still feel cheated.• The visuals. Textures look like they've been pulled from the 90s. Maps are big, floating rectangles with some hills here and there, surrounded by invisible walls. Trees were probably added ten minutes before the deadline. UI, well, exists, and that's the best I can tell about it.• The mechanics. Camera movement is a joke. Above you it doesn't show anything useful, and behind you it distorts the distance between you and your goal. Enemies can jump bazillion metres in the air and you cannot aim at them. But they can still hit you. You can upgrade your skills for credits, but the game doesn't tell you how will it affect them. For example, first upgrade for ""dashing"" (basically sprint) made it last 10 seconds instead of 1.• And the other stuff. Dashing makes you glued to the terrain like trucks in Big Rigs. That means you can climb terrain even at 90 degrees. Tutorial tells you, as an ADVANCED tip, that there are graphics options unavailable from settings menu and YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY EDIT CONFIG to access them. Pathetic.Overall: 1/10. I feel like I've put more effort into this review than devs into the game. Disgusting.			"

												Caster is like the old 3D games, dated but fun. You play as a young caster, and the rest of the story is ignorable.  The game is a 3rd person shooter but instead of using cover you run and jump yourself to safety. There is also a points system that doubles as a currency to spend on upgrades to spells, mobility or health. The combat is fast and fun. You can run very fast and up any terrain as well as having a super jump that can clear most gaps. The spells are varied and have an impact as well as some being able to change the terrain. The enemies can be repetitive but they mix them up a bit. The presentation is basic but function, not pretty but it will get the job done. The game is split into two sections and the second section is noticeably more difficult. The only downsides are it will take about 2 hours to get through the whole game and it ends with a ""to be continued” instead of a last mission. Nevertheless this is a fun shooter and I recommend it to anyone interested in these types of games.  "

												Fun, but incomplete.The game is fun, it is a little indy game with retro like graphics. it is less fast paced than it look like in the trailer, but the feeling of speed and liberty is great. Pros: -speed depend on the player, go all gun blazing or take your time-really open environement-liberty to play with terrain and weapons-interesting world-upgrading system that permit player libertyCons:-the control of wall running are a tad clunky-the camera is not alway your best friend, but could be worst-barely any explaination on the world lord, your there and you kill baddies-incomplete (end on a ""to be continue..."")I virtually finish all avaible levels, from my gaming experience the first 80% of the game is pretty much a tutorial and when you unlock the second chronicle it is when the difficulty spike up a lot. It is not really an extremely hard game not at all rather the ennemies turn from total push overs to actually being able to kill you. The best way I could describe this game would be a sort of shoot them up mixed with a bullet hell, avoid the baddies and shoot the baddies.I personally liked the game, but it is really short, but I do believe it worth the price, especially when it is on sale. 19 cents for some game with more a less a good replay value. question of price/fun this game is well balanced.

												Very nostalgic, reminds me of PS1 games I played as a kid (sort of reminded me of terracon). The terrible camera control definitely added to this nostalgia, as I remember spending many a tantrum over not being able to see what my character was doing as a child.All sarcasm aside, I enjoyed the fast paced gameplay, and didn't even care that I sold the trading cards for a cent less than what I paid, this is a 9/10 game, definitely worth a play.

												For the little I spent for this game, I did not expect to have such frantic fun throughout my short playthrough. Reminiscent of a budget GunValkyrie crossed with a bit of MegaMan. While you start out very week and vulnerable, within a few levels your character becomes a map jumping, earthshaping war machine that somehow surpasses the multimillion dollar budget that Fracture had, as awful as that game was.That being said, even with a decent amount of levels, you'll be able to collect just about everything and wipe out the main story within a couple hours. The real meat is found in community made maps, but by the time I got there the game had lost its draw as I had seen just about all I was going to see.The combat is fairly fluid, and a variety of weapons with multiple functions offering your preference of extermination. There are some extremely basic puzzles, and a good handful of secrets, all adding up to upgrading your tools, but once you max everything out, that's it. The rest is just for personal achievement. You can always start a new game on a higher difficulty, but there isn't any bonus content that I could percieve. I've poured hundreds of hours into vacant games and came away with only the ghost of fun, but this, for the short time it offers it, is a more genuinely fun experience, and left me wanting more. While the late game levels were a bit more tedious than anything else, I was engrossed in reviving trees and blowing holes in the earth. For a sale or even for its base price, Caster is a short and charming experience that definitely struck a cord with me. A game that even without the story and collectables is a blast to play, and really, isn't that what made a lot of us fall in love with games to begin with?			"

												I do not see any real reason this game should have bad reviews other than personal expectations being set too high.Right now it is 20 cents, I bought this game back when I first got my account, I still buy copies to give away or to encourage a trade.The simplistic nature of the levels pairs well with the arcade feel to the platforming action shooting gameplay.Yes the graphics are kind of oldish, but why complain, you play on PC... everything back to the text adventures can be had on your super rig, not just the hyper 3D flare.Really, you just blast stuff and upgrade your weapons.  The ability to morph the terrain is just great, and really reminded me of my time spent digging holes through levels in the first Red Faction.If you liked Mega Man 64, or maybe P.N.03 you really can't go wrong with a low requirement 20 cent title like this.A game like this EASILY could have been in an arcade, 25 cents a go.Like I said, the only real reason for a negative review from anyone boils down to their personal expectations, even if the game ends up feeling a bit like a work in progress, it works and it is fun.

												I remember I was on vacation in Cape May when I found this game.  I bought it because it was on sale for $0.19.  Little did I know, I had just purchased the greatest game ever made.  The game looked terrible, crashed constantly, and was insanely difficult, but after doing great amounts of research, I found out that the game was actually made in the year 2564, and is simply not meant to be played on any technological device of this era.  The mechanics and graphics are in fact actually SO advanced that they made a full circle in their quality and ended up looking worse than Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase for the Sony Playstation 1.  The game is clearly glitched from the most basic files up because it is being played in a world that isn't yet ready for it.  I urge you to buy Caster in hopes that with enough exposure, modern sciences can better analyze its ways and create a device capable of providing the world with its technological advances 510 years early.  For the good of this world and all worlds to come, please buy Caster.			"

												[ENG] Seriously is this a game? At the price of 3 Euros? LOL. I just bought this game for 30 cents with a random coupon, i'm playing it just for trading cards... Even if the game was released in 2009, it has a very bad graphic and the gameplay is very stupid. Maybe it could be nice for its simplicity, but seriously, it's nothing special... this could be a random flashgame on the internet. I would not spend more than 5/15 cents.[ITA] Seriamente questo è un gioco? Al prezzo di 3 euro? LOL. L'ho comprato per 30 centesimi con un coupon, ci gioco giusto per le carte collezionabili...

												Quite literally, I have seen worse games than this. I bought this game for $0.17, worth it. $2.99? Ehh, not really. I've seen better games that are cheaper (even the ones that aren't on sale, ex: Orion: Prelude) Once you get the upgrades for your characters (and not the guns just yet, except the first one you get) it's just going around the whole map in seconds, shooting everything! If you see the game on sale and you have nothing to do for an hour or so, you should get this game. Best game ever? Far from it. But, I could of seen this game being probably a really fun game on the classic consoles (ps1, n64, snes, and possibly a sega 32x or sega cd. But, considering those consoles only have so much they can do, i would probably think ps2, dreamcast, xbox, and gamecube would be the only ones to be able to handle it. Plus, this game would have probably been a game that was at launch with the consoles, showing off what the consoles could handle. Also, once you know what you're doing, you can beat the game pretty easily). So, all in all, it's not bad. I would just recommend if you're killing time and feel like just destroying a big map, this game is a time killer for you.			"

												Gameplay is somewhat ok, other than that its bad. Its like playing megaman on 3D with the same graphic as megaman X from the 90s. The control is badn, its way too hard to aim unless you have a perfect sensitivity, which is hard since the sensitivity option is very limited. Once you finish about 2 levels, it  gets repetitive and boring mostly because there is no story. And don't forget the characters' faces, they look like PS1 charachters.			"

												This game is consistently available for under 20 cents.It's not great, but it does two things exceedingly well that are rare features in many other games, AAA or indie:1) Fairly impressive terrain destruction. Instead of handling destructible terrain in the traditional way of having set destructible parts of the environment which will explode in a physics-based manner, Caster just creates entire levels out of fully terraform-able terrain. It's easy to create dents, craters, hills, and mountains out of the world around you on a whim, and that feels pretty cool.2) Empowering movement. Your character has two big movement abilities which make it very easy to cover huge distances in short time. There's a ""super jump,"" which behaves like a double jump with absurd height to it, and a dash ability which increases movement speed, and allows you to run on water and up any walls. It feels fantastic and I haven't played with anything quite like it before.Outside of those two features, Caster is pretty dull. The combat, music, aesthetics, graphics, and general polish are all sorely lacking. That said, if you can spare fifteen cents and fifteen minutes, I'd recommend checking this game out for just long enough to experience how fluid and satisfying it is to run around in this game's world.

There's not much to do other than shoot enemies, get orbs, upgrade, then repeat. They do show new enemie types and the aforementioned powers, which spruce up the game.I give this game a 7/10, it's a nice shooter game with simple controls and simple gameplay, but it suffers from lack of depth.

												Unfortunately, I can't rate, but I am using this to tell you:I couldn't play it, after I start New game, still in a menu, It freezes and my PC restarts. IDK why. I will still say Yes, buy on SALE, it has trading cards, so I just left it idle to get them. But due to that bug, I never got to play and was too lazy to do sth with it.			"

												I've played the first map completely and I'm not very impressed.  The game is not finished for starters since it only has 2 chapters.  The worst part is I got bored since it is pretty repetitive.It reminds me of a N64 game, and not a very good one.  Maybe a cheap Mega Man Legends game or something.			"

												Played this game when it first came out on the app store on my 1st gen iPod touch, actually won a contest and the creator of this game sent me a glow in the dark t-shirt and a personal sketch of the Caster guy jumping out of said iPod touch. Still have it all in a box somewhere in my parents basement back at home. Anyways. Great game. Nothing too special but a nice third-person arcade shooter with a upbeat disco soundtrack and destructive environment! Love this game :)			"

												not bad; it was pretty short and sprinting is a pain until you actually buy upgrades for it (affordable like 5 minutes in) then the whole game is pretty badass. Shooting can be irritating since the aim moves slowly but there's a lot of AoE and homing weapons you get along the storyline. Only criticism is it's really short, but it is 99p and even goes on offer a lot.			"

												There's a lot to like here but unfortunately I can't recommend the game in the form it's in.  Right before the final mission of the second and final campaign map you get a ""check the website for updates"" alert.  I know there isn't much of a story here but this is worse than a bad ending, this just seems unfinished.  And given the length of time it's been out I doubt there's much chance we'll see an ending.Onto the good: it was fun while it lasted.  Nostalgia-inducing retro graphics.  Short, punchy missions.  Very fast paced.  Puts the 'Action' in 'Action Adventure'.  You get drawn in by the fluid gameplay, switching out weaponry to combat the different critters that come your way, sprinting up sheer cliffs, across water, leaping over mountains, all the while tossing huge amounts of colorful munitions at your beast alien foes.But then, bam, the rug is pulled from under you.  And all you can do is awkwardly roll your way back to the main menu, quit and uninstall.			"

												This is a kind of a bullet hell game,it has alot of energy blasts flying everywhere when you are fighting and thats really itThe graphics arent very great,it feel like n64....and the main male character looks like the kid from Quest64 too.But it makes up for it very well by build really fluid and feeling great to move around and fight.The music fits really well to the battle and style of the game,and it all works amazingly wellThe power ups you use to fight can also be used to change the land around you which is really fun and a neat idea.The enemies are kinda generic and are all pretty easy but the combat is still fun with the how short the game is kinda works in its favor where you dont really notice the repeating fightsI beat the game in about an hour,I didnt 100% every level but it still wouldnt add that much time to the overall playthrough,There is one level that i found to just be made to be annoying and bad,basically mixing terrible A.I. and weird terraforming power ups and it turns the enjoyable experience into something i hated and almost gave up the game but i wanted to give it a fair chance.(and plus the level is in the 2nd part of the game)Overall,this game was way above my expectations and i really enjoyed most of it(that one level i really hated) Play it for a short and fun time			"

												Well.... I have no idea what I expected for 14 cents but dang it really was something.Basically the map and graphics look like something from the N64/PS1 era except slightly more crudely made. (A rough 3D map tool basically) From there you take the speed of Sonic, the jumping ability of Moon Shoes on a Pogo Stick, the physics of Big Rigs, awesome mech warrior/magic powers, the landscaping tool from Rollercoaster Tycoon and combine  them into one game. And it is just... a once in a lifetime experience. Other then that, the game has some variety in missions, enemies, and things to do albeit very easy even on normal and ""extreme"" difficulties. For 14 cents... Yea, I'd go for it. It's something to remember.			"

												Don't you dare take this game seriously. This game is ridiculous, its crazy, it makes no sense, but i love it. The destructable enviroment of this game is aweosome, you can make a hole that goes from the top of the map to the bottom. using the different types of weapons you get is pretty fun, but my favourite is spamming the ground destruction bomb, as it has the biggest splash damage. I completed the first ""campaign"" in about an hour on medium (including time spent goofing off) so its a quick playthrough, until you get to the boss. Massive jump into ""what the hell"" land. Of course, this game is not the greatest, and there are plenty of flaws. I'm sure some people hate this game. But I feel it has that ""I don't care what you think about me"" attitude that I like in certain games. So give it a shot. If you don't like it, get a refund. No harm done!My reccomendation to you: get this game right now while it's on sale, level up your super jump to the max, and fly across the map like you're using that flying scroll from Morrowwind while carpet bombing enemies below. You'll thank me later.			"

												It's not great, but it's damn good. For 14c the price I bought it, it was a steal. I have many games that I've played that are much more expensive and suck much more proportionately. It really is fun when the character's finally been powered to max. It seems like a really good class project. It's definitely worth the $3.00 that the dev's are asking. Best way I'd explain it is, think Megaman 64, but you can play as male or female character.The game isn't long, but offers ability to be modded, has destructible environment, and the soundtrack alone is worth the $3.00. The things I didn't like {Destructible environment:Yes, it's a good gimmick, it's why I really liked Bad Company 2, but in this game it makes killing monsters a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I ended up using bombs to kill enemies because if I didn't I'd end up with a giant crater with little bug monsters I couldn't see. ""Aim better"" some might say, but easier said than done as the projectiles have travel speed and don't always seem to hit where I'd want them too even with reticle on target and monster charging straight ahead. Also if you miss one time, many if not all subsequent shots will dig a hole too.AnimationSometimes character would shoot forward while holding blaster hand upward. Running is a bit wonky.TL;DRBuy the darn game, it's worth the money and doesn't suck.			"

												I remember I was on vacation in Cape May when I found this game.  I bought it because it was on sale for $0.19.  Little did I know, I had just purchased the greatest game ever made.  The game looked terrible, crashed constantly, and was insanely difficult, but after doing great amounts of research, I found out that the game was actually made in the year 2564, and is simply not meant to be played on any technological device of this era.  The mechanics and graphics are in fact actually SO advanced that they made a full circle in their quality and ended up looking worse than Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase for the Sony Playstation 1.  The game is clearly glitched from the most basic files up because it is being played in a world that isn't yet ready for it.  I urge you to buy Caster in hopes that with enough exposure, modern sciences can better analyze its ways and create a device capable of providing the world with its technological advances 510 years early.  For the good of this world and all worlds to come, please buy Caster.			"

												I just completed the first set of levels after just under an hour (50 minutes) and I have to say I am pretty impressed. Paid 20c and this game is really enjoyable. It's probably not the game to lose heaps of hours in, I'm sure I'll do at least 2 full play-throughs at about 4 hours total, but there is no real replay value apart from the fact the game itself is really fun. There is no story, no real variety in enemies, and no people to talk to (apart from at the beginning and end of each level for a very quick debriefing, which is still only text). But at a price like this, I can't argue. Even at the full $3 price it's well worth it. If you miss your old nintendo 64, gamecube and PS2 games then this is one for you. It certainly feels like a worthwhile indie gem for all to enjoy.			"

												Very quick completion (I've played 59 minutes and I'm on the final boss), but overall very fun and super unique. If you thought Son of Nor looked cool but didn't have 30$ on you (Or however much that game costed) for sure get this game.			"

												Sure, it's a good game, but it takes less than 2 hours to 100% the game, which hasn't been updated for far too long for me to have any hope for. I don't suggest you get it at the full price of $0.99, but I did get this game while it was on a massive sale, so for the pennies, it was worth it.			"

												For the little I spent for this game, I did not expect to have such frantic fun throughout my short playthrough. Reminiscent of a budget GunValkyrie crossed with a bit of MegaMan. While you start out very week and vulnerable, within a few levels your character becomes a map jumping, earthshaping war machine that somehow surpasses the multimillion dollar budget that Fracture had, as awful as that game was.That being said, even with a decent amount of levels, you'll be able to collect just about everything and wipe out the main story within a couple hours. The real meat is found in community made maps, but by the time I got there the game had lost its draw as I had seen just about all I was going to see.The combat is fairly fluid, and a variety of weapons with multiple functions offering your preference of extermination. There are some extremely basic puzzles, and a good handful of secrets, all adding up to upgrading your tools, but once you max everything out, that's it. The rest is just for personal achievement. You can always start a new game on a higher difficulty, but there isn't any bonus content that I could percieve. I've poured hundreds of hours into vacant games and came away with only the ghost of fun, but this, for the short time it offers it, is a more genuinely fun experience, and left me wanting more. While the late game levels were a bit more tedious than anything else, I was engrossed in reviving trees and blowing holes in the earth. For a sale or even for its base price, Caster is a short and charming experience that definitely struck a cord with me. A game that even without the story and collectables is a blast to play, and really, isn't that what made a lot of us fall in love with games to begin with?			"

												There's a lot to like here but unfortunately I can't recommend the game in the form it's in.  Right before the final mission of the second and final campaign map you get a ""check the website for updates"" alert.  I know there isn't much of a story here but this is worse than a bad ending, this just seems unfinished.  And given the length of time it's been out I doubt there's much chance we'll see an ending.Onto the good: it was fun while it lasted.  Nostalgia-inducing retro graphics.  Short, punchy missions.  Very fast paced.  Puts the 'Action' in 'Action Adventure'.  You get drawn in by the fluid gameplay, switching out weaponry to combat the different critters that come your way, sprinting up sheer cliffs, across water, leaping over mountains, all the while tossing huge amounts of colorful munitions at your beast alien foes.But then, bam, the rug is pulled from under you.  And all you can do is awkwardly roll your way back to the main menu, quit and uninstall.			"

												This game somehow manages to pull off an early PS2-era 3D game feel to it. I'm not really sure how it does that, but the combination of a number of things ranging from the sound to the questionable graphics to the gameplay bumps this game up beyond first impressions (which for me were very bad).One of those so bad its good kind of things.

Caster isn't perfect, but it's a decent 3D arena shooter with a variety of shot types and a feeling of power.  A second episode was added and there might be more to come.  In the meantime, players can add their own missions.http://www.elecorn.com/caster3d/ "

												A fun little indie game. You play as a wizard in training, and you upgrade and learn new spells during the course of the game. While you start out pretty weak, soon you'll be devastating enemies left and right.The terrain is fully deformable, so the power of your magic attacks really shows.While the later levels get a lot harder, the game is still fun. Especially if you like a challenge.A good purchase, especially when it's on sale.			"

												I have to admit that I bought the game merely for stupid reasons while it was on sale. However, this game has proven to me that people are right when using the quote ""Never Judge A Book By It's Cover"".  Throughout the gameplay I found myself having so much fun, that I really wondered. Many people may have bought any game that was on sale mainly thinking of making profits selling the cards, which has happened to be my idea in the past too. Although, how about giving the game a shot? I definitelly believe that this game is worth every cent I spent due to all the fun I had playing it. The bosses weren't that hard but it adds to the interest. The graffics may not be of the best quality thus making the game look a little more retreau, do not be mistaken. There are some stages that are notably tricky and ones that are a child's play but still, it is enjoyable for gamers of various ages with different interests			"

YouTube™ Video: Cheap PC Games: Caster Review 

			Views: 38		

			http://store.steampowered.com/app/29800/ Mods for the game: http://www.elecorn.com/caster3d/mods.html Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Little_B_Gaming		

I like Caster. I really do. But there are few flaws, that annoyed me. Let me share my thoughts with you, but the short answer is, it's worth buying right now.I was quite surprise from the settings here. Motion blur, Glow, Water reflection, AA, Fullscreen on and off, sound sliders, rebindable keys and controller support. Despite all video options the game is not pretty to look at.After you choose male or female character and naming him/her, it's time to play the game. You are a Caster. Your clan send you to help get rid of infestation of Flanx – bugs in different sizes. This is the story. I feel this is a missed opportunity for something big.The gameplay is what matters here. This is fast-paced TPS. What is different from other games is the speed your character moves. You start with little stamina. With a press of a button your character starts running fast, but for a short period of time. After each mission, you will receive credits, which you will spend for upgrades. They are pretty straightforward. I recommend first to upgrade Dash and Super Jump. That way stamina will increase. Your character will run fast for longer period of time and jumps extremly high. Both are the core of fun here. The game remind me just a little of The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction with one difference – the shooting. Even when you fall from really high, the ground beneath your feet is shaking and making a wave. Well, The Incredible Hulk is more fun, but Caster is fun in its own right.Except with low stamina, you will star with just one weapon. A basic lazer. But soon you will acquire new ones, by finding a specific ball. They are not original. The Eruptor is somewhat interesting, but I wouldn't call it a weapon. With him you can raise the ground and it's useful at few places. Other are: Blast – granade type of weapon; Pusle – basic weapon, but after upgrading it, becomes like a machine gun; Seeker – homing lazer; Stun – well, stuning enemies and Orbit. It have two uses. While holding the LMB button, it forms a shield around you and when is released, you shoot the enemy. I didn't find it that useful, the projectiles are too slow. With exception of Eruptor and Orbit, every other weapon is. Fast enemy – Stun him and kill him with Seeker. Group of bugs around you – jump high and use Blast. With combination of high speed and high jumps, you are up for a adrenaline filled adventure. The character can even run on vertical walls and on water!!!The level desing is kinda disappointing. Just open spaces with hills or puddles on the ground. In terms of mechanics it's great, the character run fast and jumps high. There are some levels filled with lava or toxic gas in the sky and few other specifics conditions, but there isn't enough variety in the environment. There is one interesting thing – terrain deformation. With Blast you will destroy parts of the ground, but with Eruptor you can raise it. It's ton of fun.The textures are not great also. They are bland. The game was released in 2009, but it looks like something that came out from the early 2000's. This apply too for the character you control and the enemies. But don't let this bother you.There are three mission objectives in the game – kill everything, collect energy balls or heal trees by shooting them. They are just not enough variety.Enemies are bug with different sizes. From small ones that just charge at you to a huge ones that shoots you and the game starts to feel like bullet-hell. Of course, the distant cousin of Sonic, uses his speed to avoid the damage. The AI is okay. When you hit some enemies they run from you for a few seconds and then again  turn towards you. This is easily exploitable and I don't like it. Of course, there are others with different behavior. Overall i'd say enemiy diversity and AI are fine, nothing spectacular. In some levels you have to use the surroundings to kill enemies, because regular weapons don't work on them or have other requirements. They were fun.Sound design is good. Effects are alright, but the music is fantastic. Punchy, energetic trance that fits extremly well with the fast gameplay. Some are little more relaxing and slow, but still great. While listening it I wanted my character to move faster and faster. Great soundtrack! The biggest letdown for me was the length of the game. 2 h and 38 min. If I didn't want to collect all energy balls, the time would be less. When I reached the end and saw “To be continued” I was like “That's it”? The game costs 2,99 E and I shoudn't complain, but I had fun, but it wasn't enough. That is way this is my biggest issue. There few mods for the game to extend the fun, so bear that in mind.From the bottom of my heart I admit I wasn't expecting to have so much fun. Don't be fooled by the bad graphics or you will miss a great game. Some people are writtting, that this is how Sonic should look like. What immpress me is every weapon is useful, some more than other. This is rare. Perfect controls, fantastic soundtrack, great gameplay, above 60 fps, but it have some minor (for me) issues like bad graphics and not-so-great level design. This is fantastic short game, but still I highly recommend it.			"

												Pros-I got it for a 14 cents-Interesting Ideas-Trading Cards-Nostalgic-The view-changing mechanics are goodCons-The Graphics-Gameplay-No story-No Achievements-Enemies are too tanky-Enemies are seem to be the same-It's boring; its not fun-Clunky controlsOverall, I do NOT recommend this game, i mean sure im kinda happy with the price I got it for but I truly do not recommend this game because it has good ideas but it gets them all wrong like the main character able to change colours and abilites that is a good idea but its so bad. I literally played for like 5 mins and after that I just left the game on for the trading cards and once they were all out, I immediately uninstalled this game. I mean if you get it as cheap as I did then you can but its honestly not worth it.Rating: Don't get it/ Get it on saleFinal Verdict: 3/10			"

												Not a great engine, visuals are very mediocre and I randomly got stuck on inclines for no apparent reason. Funnily enough, you can normally dash up vertical inclines; the level 'Treacherous Tower' allows you to dash straight up to the exit and skip the level. Pretty generic action shooter, there isn't really a story. Levels aren't really too varied in objectives or visuals. The only things that exist in this world are you, enemies, trees and the terrain. There are several varied types of weapons and shooting the terrain can change it (usually lower/raise). You don't really use the terrain until the second chapter (currently 'To Be Continued'), where one unique level requires you 'escort' a ball to the exit point by raising the terrain in front of it to remove the acid.I first upgraded Dash and Pulse and could skip enemies, collect orbs, and skip through the levels. You don't need to fight enemies in most levels. After upgrades, you have pretty good mobility to run around, shoot things and collect orbs which is the whole game (or run around, avoid things and collect orbs like me).If you don't care about graphics or story and just want to run around shooting random things and collect orbs, then you might like this game. This seems more fit as a decent 3rd-party game for the N64. It's not a terrible game, but there doesn't seem to be a point to continue playing except if you like the combat for mindless fun.			"

												I love this game. The music alone is worth more than I paid, so I love to crank it up while I'm dashing around. I love the dash and double jump commands, and how they feel. I play with a mouse and keyboard, and the controls feel natural. I like the way the character is upgraded; I get to pick my upgrades and while there's plenty of weapons, I basically only use two. They are my favorites so I upgraded them to maxium damage. With a mouse, it can be a little difficult to switch weapons, but this isn't something you need to do in combat. You're so fast, you can run away to survive anytime you get in over your head. I don't really like the hidden energy balls (that don't show on your radar) but you don't need to collect them. It's important to know that you can't go underwater; one of your weapons raises the level of the ground. I see that tip in a lot of reviews, but I wish the game had simply told me that when I got the weapon. Overall, excellent game, great music, and 3 hours in, I still have most of the second terrority left to explore. Yes, your vision is limited, but that's part of the game design. Some times you're not supposed to see the enemies clearly, due to the alien environment. That said, I completely disagree with those saying the graphics are bad. The lighting effects are everything and the game has a specific style (that matches the music... it's kind of techno-dance-led style). Enjoy the game!			"

												I can see this being a test run for very, very new devolopers in the video game scene but it is not a completed project. It resembles a poorly made PS1 game in which the atmosphere of the game is very blank and dry, little to no features in it. The game itself physically looks like a Shooter met the Sims 2 environment creator. This game is not worth the time or the money if you are seriously interested, but if you have throwaround money and a spare two hours of your time then go for it.Pros: Very cheap cost         Not graphically intensiveCons: Everything starting after the game loads          Weak and generic storyline, no depth          Looks like a failed PS1 title          Makes you reconsider your life decisions			"

You play through the first chapter and it's essentially a tutorial chapter, takes around 30-45 minutes and you get all 6 abilities. BUT THEN, the second chapter has about 6-7 levels in it and says ""Too be continued, check casterthegame.com for updates"". I WASNT AWARE I WAS BUYING AN INCOMPLTE AND ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME!!! With all these reviews I'm wondering if people even played through it all? I literally completed the whole game in my entire playtime of 1.1 hours. Granted, there was a small handfull of levels that I didn't 100%, but I could have easily. That's another thing, this game is incredibly easy as well! Would not recommened at all.			"

												This game certainly looks dated (to put it mildly), but it employs a number of gameplay mechanics that I've never seen before, and I had no trouble getting into it.There is a story, or at least the skeleton of one. I either don't remember the details, or none were offered up.The gameplay is where this title shines. You'll find yourself having to change the face of the terrain in several levels in order to accomlish your objectives. I'd say more, but I don't want to give too much away.I hope the developers of this game go on to bigger and better things. There are some great ideas in this game, and they don't suffer from the game's simple design. This is an interesting little game, well worth purchasing while on sale.			"

												  Ever so sweet and oh so simple. A beautiful mix of modern and retro styles; the music, the physics, the monsters... this is definitely a game you might expect to find in a modern cici's pizza arcade room. It's the kind of game you'd spend $25 in quarters on over the course of just one summer. That is, if you're playing on hard mode. Casual and novice gamers can still play for hours on end, but a certain balance of the environment is lost without feeling the heat. Either way, it's an eerily elegant adventure with little story and expansive gameplay. Only two things are missing to make this game an instant classic: a music album for purchase, and multiplayer mode, but something tells me both are in the works. So, yeah, you've got a great deal staring you in the face. Get it before they start charging what it's truly worth. "

												It's not great, but it's damn good. For 14c the price I bought it, it was a steal. I have many games that I've played that are much more expensive and suck much more proportionately. It really is fun when the character's finally been powered to max. It seems like a really good class project. It's definitely worth the $3.00 that the dev's are asking. Best way I'd explain it is, think Megaman 64, but you can play as male or female character.The game isn't long, but offers ability to be modded, has destructible environment, and the soundtrack alone is worth the $3.00. The things I didn't like {Destructible environment:Yes, it's a good gimmick, it's why I really liked Bad Company 2, but in this game it makes killing monsters a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I ended up using bombs to kill enemies because if I didn't I'd end up with a giant crater with little bug monsters I couldn't see. ""Aim better"" some might say, but easier said than done as the projectiles have travel speed and don't always seem to hit where I'd want them too even with reticle on target and monster charging straight ahead. Also if you miss one time, many if not all subsequent shots will dig a hole too.AnimationSometimes character would shoot forward while holding blaster hand upward. Running is a bit wonky.TL;DRBuy the darn game, it's worth the money and doesn't suck.			"

												Well.... I have no idea what I expected for 14 cents but dang it really was something.Basically the map and graphics look like something from the N64/PS1 era except slightly more crudely made. (A rough 3D map tool basically) From there you take the speed of Sonic, the jumping ability of Moon Shoes on a Pogo Stick, the physics of Big Rigs, awesome mech warrior/magic powers, the landscaping tool from Rollercoaster Tycoon and combine  them into one game. And it is just... a once in a lifetime experience. Other then that, the game has some variety in missions, enemies, and things to do albeit very easy even on normal and ""extreme"" difficulties. For 14 cents... Yea, I'd go for it. It's something to remember.			"

												For the little I spent for this game, I did not expect to have such frantic fun throughout my short playthrough. Reminiscent of a budget GunValkyrie crossed with a bit of MegaMan. While you start out very week and vulnerable, within a few levels your character becomes a map jumping, earthshaping war machine that somehow surpasses the multimillion dollar budget that Fracture had, as awful as that game was.That being said, even with a decent amount of levels, you'll be able to collect just about everything and wipe out the main story within a couple hours. The real meat is found in community made maps, but by the time I got there the game had lost its draw as I had seen just about all I was going to see.The combat is fairly fluid, and a variety of weapons with multiple functions offering your preference of extermination. There are some extremely basic puzzles, and a good handful of secrets, all adding up to upgrading your tools, but once you max everything out, that's it. The rest is just for personal achievement. You can always start a new game on a higher difficulty, but there isn't any bonus content that I could percieve. I've poured hundreds of hours into vacant games and came away with only the ghost of fun, but this, for the short time it offers it, is a more genuinely fun experience, and left me wanting more. While the late game levels were a bit more tedious than anything else, I was engrossed in reviving trees and blowing holes in the earth. For a sale or even for its base price, Caster is a short and charming experience that definitely struck a cord with me. A game that even without the story and collectables is a blast to play, and really, isn't that what made a lot of us fall in love with games to begin with?			"

												This game has a few issues. Now if you enjoy it that's cool. But here are my issues:1. It is not finished, and they do not work on it anymore. I got to the second map, and they said there were going to be more levels. There have not been any new updates for a good deal of time. 2. The characters look like they belong in a 70's or 80's anime. There is no customization and the characters are kind of ugly.3. It doesn't have enough Powers. This game is based around the obtaining of powers to use agains the Flanx. You get all the powers pretty early, and as I said earlier, they do not have many levels. 4. There are mods, but most of the 6 do not work. This is a minor complaint though.Overall, it's not a terrible game, it just has a few more downs than ups. but if you want to try it, it honestly is worth the $2.99 + Tax.			"

												I gave this game a chance, then another, then I asked my friend to try it, it all resulted in the same verdict: complete wate of time. Graphics are aweful, even on a retro game level but the worst are the controls, which are totally unintuitive. It's as if someone tried to make a game that had all the flaws of the worst PS1 games. Seriously: I read some positive reviews and I couldn't make out if the writers were trying to troll me. Possibly, the game gets better after playing it for one hour, or five hours, or maybe fifty but I don't really care because the first half hour was so awfully annoying that I regret even trying it.

												Very nice RPG game.The graphics look like that this game came out in PS2 generation. I don't really mind about the graphics so this game looks beautiful to me. Plenty of levels and the enemies you face can be challenging. You have 6 abilities and they are upgradable. There are abilities that have the power to cultivate or raise the ground. I recommend this game to those who want to past time playing a quick RPG game. And if your system specs are not for high end gaming, this game would run very fine even on weak notebooks like mine.  10/10  "

Although by modern standarts the graphics are somewhat 'simple' but the game does compensate well by introducing interesting array of 'powers' to be upgraded and used in the missions.  The level architecture is well done and poses different challenges as you progress through the game. Thumbs up to the developers and a strong recommendation.			"

It has an upgrades system where you can choose how to spend your collected points. Actually, it's surprisingly enjoyable. I think it's for kids mainly.

The game doesn't look great, or even play very great, but it's not bad for wasting an hour or two, but that's pretty much all the playtime you will get from it, the first level was quite difficult if only because of the speed that the enemies move, and how slow you are until you have a few upgrades, after you have bought an upgrade or two though the difficulty nose dives, with only giant homing missile seeking firing rock? monsters being the only thing that can really hurt you, though with ant of the starter weapons maxed out they do go down fairly quickly.

-=Serious Review=--tl;dr reviewCaster is a perfect metaphor for the gaming industry as of writing this review. Caster represents an awesome idea that actually works and has only one real flaw with it, and that's how it's just too easy (Even so, that's eay to fix.) However, because of its unique style, it will not truly achieve the praise it needs. It's also unfortunate that the game has been essentially discontinued. That doesn't mean the community can't take it up on their own to continue it.-What is Caster? What genre does it fit into?Caster doesn't truly fit into the predefined genres we have today, the closest similar game would be Borderlands. It's definitely a shooting game, and also has some RPG elements. I guess we can call it an FPRPS (First Person Role-Playing Shooter.) It's third-person perspective and simple graphics also gives it that PS1/Arcade feel to it, and it's definitely appealing. Plus it easily gets 60+ fps on even the most burnt potato out there, so anyone can enjoy it.-StoryThere isn't much to the story, but the story that is there is enough... barely. All you're truly given is a name to the main enemies and some minor exposition. Basically, not a lot of text boxes.-GameplayThis is where Caster truly does shine. To start off, your character has free roam over wherever you are. As such you are given the ability to dash and super jump (which is a powerful double jump) to enhance the fun of it. With the base dash and jump, you're not moving very far or going very high, but as you upgrade you become more epic. Eventually you'll be dashing for longer distances, running on water, and even running on walls. I'll be damned if I could find another game that makes wall-running and shooting both fun and easy.When you start off, you'll only have your basic shooting ""ability"" ""Pulse."" It's not very strong starting out looking and behaving very similar to Mega Man's basic attack. It needs to be upgraded to become even better. Missions are where you earn the credits to upgrade this ability. And as you do more missions you'll gain access to more abilities, each with their unique-ness.Environment interaction. For a game off this size, it's incredible to have environments that are fully interactable. A lot of things can cause craters to form, from both you and enemies. If you super jump and fall long enough, you can leave a small crater and create a shockwave. Your basic shots can build craters too. You can even get an ability to create hills, to get bonuses underwater mainly. There's even one instance where enemies will try to stay underground and take pot shots at you.Enemies, however, is the only true point where the game doesn't shine. The enemies in Caster are way too easy. Upgrades for abilities just do massive amounts of damage, and enemies don't get adjusted for this in each level as you progress. Eventually, even on hard, you'll get to a point where you're just like: ""That's cool, and now it's dead. Next level."" It's a damn shame too, because adaptive enemies would pad out the gameplay much better than spreading them out. Too bad that'll never be fixed :c-tl;dr gameplaySonic the Hedgehog + Mega Man + Borderlands - Difficult AI = Caster-ModdingWhile I'm not truly a ""Modder"" (At the time of writing, at least) Caster looks way more than simple to mod. There is mod support from what I can tell at the time of writing this. I would also wager that this game would be a perfect start for getting into modding, as it's so simple and open to the idea of community-created content. Hell, why stop at making single-player campaigns? You could probably add some sort of multiplayer to this game easier than any other indie game on Steam. This might be where the game has a future, and it would be up to the community.			"

												Caster has some cool ideas, like weapons that deform the terrain and have multiple modes. The sense of speed you get (once you get Dash past level 1) is also pretty cool.However, the game looks primitive, if functional, and the missions seem incredibly dull. Admittedly, I only did about 10 missions, but the environments weren't interesting and the objectives were overly simple. Enemy AI is awful. There's a blob that literally does nothing unless you run into it (it doesn't even move), and some kind of walking worm thing that you just stunlock by hitting it every few seconds. On top of that, all the enemies are bullet sponges.Any fun you get from the sense of running around at ludicrous speeds is undermined by the fact that all you really do is circle-strafe and pump shots into bullet-sponge enemies. If you stop moving, you die quickly. The sense of speed is appealing for a few minutes, but that's about it. There are no checkpoints in missions, and most of them involve a lot of running through bland landscapes.			"

												I just completed the first set of levels after just under an hour (50 minutes) and I have to say I am pretty impressed. Paid 20c and this game is really enjoyable. It's probably not the game to lose heaps of hours in, I'm sure I'll do at least 2 full play-throughs at about 4 hours total, but there is no real replay value apart from the fact the game itself is really fun. There is no story, no real variety in enemies, and no people to talk to (apart from at the beginning and end of each level for a very quick debriefing, which is still only text). But at a price like this, I can't argue. Even at the full $3 price it's well worth it. If you miss your old nintendo 64, gamecube and PS2 games then this is one for you. It certainly feels like a worthwhile indie gem for all to enjoy.			"

												I love this game. The music alone is worth more than I paid, so I love to crank it up while I'm dashing around. I love the dash and double jump commands, and how they feel. I play with a mouse and keyboard, and the controls feel natural. I like the way the character is upgraded; I get to pick my upgrades and while there's plenty of weapons, I basically only use two. They are my favorites so I upgraded them to maxium damage. With a mouse, it can be a little difficult to switch weapons, but this isn't something you need to do in combat. You're so fast, you can run away to survive anytime you get in over your head. I don't really like the hidden energy balls (that don't show on your radar) but you don't need to collect them. It's important to know that you can't go underwater; one of your weapons raises the level of the ground. I see that tip in a lot of reviews, but I wish the game had simply told me that when I got the weapon. Overall, excellent game, great music, and 3 hours in, I still have most of the second terrority left to explore. Yes, your vision is limited, but that's part of the game design. Some times you're not supposed to see the enemies clearly, due to the alien environment. That said, I completely disagree with those saying the graphics are bad. The lighting effects are everything and the game has a specific style (that matches the music... it's kind of techno-dance-led style). Enjoy the game!			"

												For the little I spent for this game, I did not expect to have such frantic fun throughout my short playthrough. Reminiscent of a budget GunValkyrie crossed with a bit of MegaMan. While you start out very week and vulnerable, within a few levels your character becomes a map jumping, earthshaping war machine that somehow surpasses the multimillion dollar budget that Fracture had, as awful as that game was.That being said, even with a decent amount of levels, you'll be able to collect just about everything and wipe out the main story within a couple hours. The real meat is found in community made maps, but by the time I got there the game had lost its draw as I had seen just about all I was going to see.The combat is fairly fluid, and a variety of weapons with multiple functions offering your preference of extermination. There are some extremely basic puzzles, and a good handful of secrets, all adding up to upgrading your tools, but once you max everything out, that's it. The rest is just for personal achievement. You can always start a new game on a higher difficulty, but there isn't any bonus content that I could percieve. I've poured hundreds of hours into vacant games and came away with only the ghost of fun, but this, for the short time it offers it, is a more genuinely fun experience, and left me wanting more. While the late game levels were a bit more tedious than anything else, I was engrossed in reviving trees and blowing holes in the earth. For a sale or even for its base price, Caster is a short and charming experience that definitely struck a cord with me. A game that even without the story and collectables is a blast to play, and really, isn't that what made a lot of us fall in love with games to begin with?			"

												A good game for the price. I greatly enjoyed the sense of speed and aerial freedom (even if it is clumsy at times) as well as the competently-arranged difficulty curve and the open level design. The combat is alright, although sometimes you have to fight with the camera to get it to look at where you want it to.The only thing I hate about this game is the length. I like the idea of being able to terraform and fight things in wide open environments, but the game can be finished in a couple of hours. I'm left with a concept that's well-executed but too short for it to fully explore its own mechanics. If you can overlook the length, this is a decent game.			"

												There are some GREAT ideas, and some terrible execution.First is terrain deformation, at first you think COOL! they figured it out, that's awesome. However, in reality the game is using auto generated planes as 'terrain'. and the deformation is either a + or - in height. There is NO other detail or deformation other than height. The texture is low quality, and doesn't deform with the mesh, so you get stretched and grainy textures all over the place. In addition to this, the tiniest 'down' deformation on an otherwise flat area will trap your character, stopping you in your tracks. Super annoying, and a tip that the terrain is calculated as a series of boxes, instead of a mesh (lets stack boxes under a blanket, and ignore the fact that you run into the box and can't move, despite the blanket still being flat).Second is the mouse controls. Do you really expect anyone to play at such a low mouse movement speed? I'm REALLY glad I've got a G9x where I can adjust sensitivity on the fly. The menus are great on my 'normal' but at this speed it takes 6 swipes across my XXL mousepad for me to look in a circle. I adjust it up once, and it takes 3... which is reasonable. Then there is the fact that you start each level staring at your feet. You can move like normal in this view, which caused my death in the training... I was shooting my feet the entire level. AND this is the normal start for EVERY level.Lastly, Powerups are cool, but the default 4 are the obvious choices. ""oh, I can pull money from the entire map if I level up this one first?... nah, I'ma go with leveling up a weapon first."" The lack of damage counters, or additional effects also makes any weapon upgrades underwhelming. With just a little bit of effort, this one could be stricken off my list of complaints.LAST WORD:decent repetitive gameplay. Try it out if you must, but get it on sale when you can.			"

Very fluid controls for a cheap game, doesnt feel clunky at all (just make sure to adjust mouse sensitivity)3. Pretty decent music, definitely easy to zone out on4. It might not have the best graphics but its actually fun to playCons1. Zero depth, zilch, none, if this was a pizza it would be those little dollar totinos pizzas, its not great but hey its there!2. Very little diversity among enemies, you have the ones that shoot at you and the ones that move and shoot at youIn all honesty throw this same style of game in a new game engine with modern graphics, add some voice acting and a few cutscenes with some more enemy diversity and i would happily pay 20 bucks for it.

												This is an interesting little N64-esque 3rd person action game. At first it appears to be a bland and uninspired Megaman 64 clone, but it's much more than just that. I'm not going to review this super in-depth, but just take my word for this one, it's certainly worth its 14 cent price.			"

												Best $.14 I've ever spent on a game.Is it a good game? No, It's just an ok game.Every mission is pretty much the same thing and you just kind of do it.The graphics are pretty lacking and the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, there is no story and it's basically just shoot things and collect orbs.For $3 I wouldn't even think about maybe buying this game.For $.14 though there is no reason not to buy it, for less than an average steam trading card you can get a few hours of fun. You pay more for a 5 minute game at an arcade.I've spent more on worse games, if you can pick this up for less than $.50 I would highly recommend it.Not to mention it's one of the few games on steam you can actually make a profit off of.

												I didn't actually expect this game to be at all decent when I got it, but I thought for $0.14 how could you go wrong.Well, nothing did go wrong in fact, and it turned out thatI actually liked the game long enough to get into it. I ended up maxing out every ability and reclaiming both areas before I quit even. It reminds me a little bit of Red Faction, in the sense that you can cause damage to your environment, or at least the ground (thats where the likeness ends though). It made me reminisce about older games that I spent time playing, mainly because of the very outdated sprites that were still fun nonethless to play with. It gives the game a very nice retro feel to it.Tl;dr - This is a fun little game that can be beat in an hour or two, and while its true that I probably wouldn't pay the normal price, if you can get this game when it's on sale and you don't mind old graphics, I would recommend this game.

I got 2 cards that were 7 cents and 1 card that was 6 cents (3 cards from paying 14 cents), which, minus the taxes, adds up to 14 cents. You can probably get more or less yourself depending on what cards you get, but hey, I'd probably still be satisfied even if it didn't have trading cards.			"

The main thing this game has going for it is it's just fun. You can jump around, manuever around the map quickly, and even mold the terrain. There's just something about dodging lasers while shooting a monster (Flanx) and jumping around that is just really enjoyable and satisfying. I bought this game with little expectations, but I expect to be playing it quite a bit in the future.Also, you can shoot trees. And they grow REALLY big. It's awesome.			"

 CASTER On the surface, Caster is a generic third-person shooter with absolutely horrid graphics.Have you heard of a little phrase that goes ""Don't judge a book by it's cover""? I know its cliche, but, Caster fits into that little phrase perfectly.Play beyond the original generic shooting and bad graphics and you'll find several fun and interesting things.To list a few:A fun and smooth movement systemInteresting and diverse enemy typesPower-up abilities AND enemies that affect the terrain of the levelA multitude of different levels, with community support for even more levelsTo be honest, I've had more fun with this game than some games that cost 10x the amount this does, mainly because of the mechanics it includes that, on paper, seem game-breaking and/or horrible but actually make the game extremely fun. For example, in one of the first few missions, I was running along when I run into this huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scorpion thing that comes out of the ground and shoots a giant reflective ball at me. Naturally, I move out of the way of the ball and look to where it lands and realise that it just created terrain. I swear I spent about 15 minutes just screwing around with what was now my new best friend and making what was once a grassy plain into a deslote wasteland full of mountains. Its that sort of thing that makes me love this game. Not to mention, not long after that mission, you get a powerup that lets you shoot, get this: THE BALLS THE FREAKING SCORPIONS CAN SHOOT. That point is the happiest any game has ever made me feel. However this powerup is a little unbalanced, as it does ridiculous amounts of damage AND is AOE. Basically, this game is full of silliness like that and it is surprisingly fun. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to screw around with a game.			"

Very few issues with the game, my only qualm being the overwhelming damage one of the enemies does to you in one of the levels near the end. Otherwise, it's a Nine-and-one-half out of Ten from me.

The game doesn't look great, or even play very great, but it's not bad for wasting an hour or two, but that's pretty much all the playtime you will get from it, the first level was quite difficult if only because of the speed that the enemies move, and how slow you are until you have a few upgrades, after you have bought an upgrade or two though the difficulty nose dives, with only giant homing missile seeking firing rock? monsters being the only thing that can really hurt you, though with ant of the starter weapons maxed out they do go down fairly quickly. As long as it is on sale, I would say this game is worth a try, however I would never pay £2.00 for this.			"

												Whoa, i really got taken aback by this.Caster is game where you are sent on missions in restricted enviroments in order to blast bug-mosters.Let me be honest; the game is rough around the edges. If I were to nitpick, I could find a long list of failings: outdated low-poly graphics, paper-thin plot, weapon imbalances, short length, etc. But screw all that.This game is all about the game-play. In a nutshell, it is so delightful to run around and shoot things! Elecorn, the game developer, doubled down on capturing the essential controls and game-feel, making Caster an accessible, fast-paced action shooter, which really makes you feal at ease when playing. Traversing through the map is enjoyable, shooting the bright, colourful weapons is fun, and your shots can kill bugs as well as affect the landscape, making you at later levels feel really powerful with your mountain-levelling, monster-slaying wrist-blaster.Just don't expect something grandiose like a Witcher game, and are sure to have an entertaining diversion.PS. There are some solid mods/DLCs at the game's website, if you wanna kill some more time and bugs. "

												The graphics are pretty awful, and the story is pretty forgettable, BUT this game has some damn fine gameplay. The engine as well as the mechanics made the game fun to play. The different styles off attack allow for different builds and different play styles. A good choice to pick up for very little.			"

												Got this game over a Steam sale for $1, and am absolutely glad I did so. Caster is a gem in the rough - a rough gem. Quick breakdown below:Graphics - The graphics might seem a little off-putting at first, but I quickly got over it as soon as I got into the gameplay. The character textures and models could definitely use a lot of work though.Gameplay - It's got a retro feel to it. That is, a lack of premise, but immersive gameplay. If you're looking for something with a storyline, you'll be disappointed. I've only played through the game on normal difficulty, but even then there were some stages that surprised me (in a good, challenging sort of way). Camera/controls are *occasionally* fidgety, (egs. running on walls in certain maps can be pretty trippy) but it's never enough to really detract from the game. Replay value is so-so. Ending indicates a game that its creators no longer wanted to invest money/time into.Audio - Hit-and-miss for me. Some tracks are amazing, and really go well with the action, others just sound like cheap techno tracks.Mods - Rather than mods, I'd call them user-created stages. Downloaded a mod-pack off the game's website, and had a lot of fun with those.All in all, I got about 3 hours of gameplay from this. Thoroughly enjoyed this, my only major complain being the lack of content (in terms of stages). Maybe there are more mods in forums, but I have not looked at those yet.			"

												I really enjoy this game. I expected a load of garbage based off how low the price was (+sale was only 14 cents!), but I found myself having a really good time. I love games like Crackdown and Saint's Row 4 that allow you to fly, run, and jump at incredible speeds. Caster is just like that, but then again, it's not. The game feels (and looks) like it was a test run for the developer. There's no real story, graphics look like a cross-breed of N64 and PS1, and the levels are small and have almost nothing of interest in them. However, the physics in this game were very interesting. Certain attacks did certain things, like leveling the ground or erecting it. You're attacks can also ""heal"" trees, which I thought was pretty nifty. The enemies are creepy, and (even though they were nearly barren) the maps were fun to explore. I spent the first maybe ten minutes of the game just messing around with the physics, jumping and running around, shooting holes into the ground, just having a fun little time. I hope the devs make something out of this game (or finish/update it), I honestly love it. For 14 cents, yeah, I do recommend this game. However, for five bucks? Maybe not. Basically, if you're lucky enough to see this ""review"" before the sale ends, what's spending/blowing 14 cents? It's not going to harm you. (At least, I hope it doesn't.) So why not check this little gem out? And hey, if you end up loathing the game, you can just sell the card drops for a profit. It's a win/win. So whatta ya say?			"

												There are some GREAT ideas, and some terrible execution.First is terrain deformation, at first you think COOL! they figured it out, that's awesome. However, in reality the game is using auto generated planes as 'terrain'. and the deformation is either a + or - in height. There is NO other detail or deformation other than height. The texture is low quality, and doesn't deform with the mesh, so you get stretched and grainy textures all over the place. In addition to this, the tiniest 'down' deformation on an otherwise flat area will trap your character, stopping you in your tracks. Super annoying, and a tip that the terrain is calculated as a series of boxes, instead of a mesh (lets stack boxes under a blanket, and ignore the fact that you run into the box and can't move, despite the blanket still being flat).Second is the mouse controls. Do you really expect anyone to play at such a low mouse movement speed? I'm REALLY glad I've got a G9x where I can adjust sensitivity on the fly. The menus are great on my 'normal' but at this speed it takes 6 swipes across my XXL mousepad for me to look in a circle. I adjust it up once, and it takes 3... which is reasonable. Then there is the fact that you start each level staring at your feet. You can move like normal in this view, which caused my death in the training... I was shooting my feet the entire level. AND this is the normal start for EVERY level.Lastly, Powerups are cool, but the default 4 are the obvious choices. ""oh, I can pull money from the entire map if I level up this one first?... nah, I'ma go with leveling up a weapon first."" The lack of damage counters, or additional effects also makes any weapon upgrades underwhelming. With just a little bit of effort, this one could be stricken off my list of complaints.LAST WORD:decent repetitive gameplay. Try it out if you must, but get it on sale when you can.			"

Flashbacks of Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando and the Jak and Daxter games but with a DIY cell-shaded anime aesthetic. On max settings, it is all bold tones smeared in radioactive light.

												The game seems to be REALLY promising, considering that it seems to be a mix of megaman with sonic, but I am unable to play it due to the broken game menu, as soon as you go in full screen at 1080p, the mouse cursor goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ making it impossible to  change it in the game, so you will resort to ini tweaking and even then this problem seems to show up at random.

												This game reminded me more of Oni for the Playstation 2 than of a ""danmaku"" game like the reviews said, mostly because of the art style and music. Goodness, I bloody LOVED the game's music~ The gameplay was also great, and considering I only paid £0.10 for it, it made it all the better! Very few issues with the game, my only qualm being the overwhelming damage one of the enemies does to you in one of the levels near the end. Otherwise, it's a Nine-and-one-half out of Ten from me.

												Price : 0'14€  I don't even know why I bough this game. I was so cheap I fell for it I think. Anyway, the cards the game will give to you (3 of them) will be more money in your steam wallet than 0'14€ so, if you don't even know how to send and email but you used to watch hackers' movies of the 90's where all the hackers dressed with tiny black cyclist glasses and leather overcoats and you want to feel how is hacking Steam stealing them about 0'03€ after and/or before (but probably after) giving them all your savings, this is a good idea. The game is not bad, is simple like a regular PSX game was, one of those you played a few times and wasn't too funny but you will always remember because you only had a few great ones and a lot of cheap pirated tittles and half of them couldn't work because your father got it from second hand with the CDs all in one.

												The Game is very simplistic in its essence, but it didnt make it any less enjoyable. You have your  six given attacks, and with a highly movile character you have to shoot your ways throught the levels.The mayor issue is that the game is very short. And i feel it did not live up to its potencial. A more active comunity could give this game back its life with custom maps etc. For the tools are there. all thats missing is someone to do the work were the creator lacked offConsidering its shortness, (some less if you get the  7 or 8 community made maps from the official caster page) it is been worth the money paid(I got it 75% off).

												I enjoyed this a bit more than I thought I would. It was a beautiful blast of being in a world not ready for the power contained within the small, player-controlled child.			"

												The game is not buggy, I'll give it that, but a game is not good just because it's cheap and isn't completely broken. The game is short and uninteresting, enemies are dumb and gameplay is horrible. Even though I got this as a joke gift from my friend, it still felt like a waste of time. The game may have potential, but potential isn't enough to make a game enjoyable. And since it's been 7 years I don't see them fixing anything, even though the game itself promises there will be more. It's not even worth the low cost. Buy a lollipop or save those cents for something more worthy.			"

												A short game that combines sandbox with MegaMan-esque power-ups. Two powers affect the terrain around you, which creates some diversity, two are for crowd control, and the other two are strictly for damage. Though personally, Blast (terrain damager) is the most powerful because of how fast you can fire it off and how much damage it does when fully charged.The levels have the same few objectives: go this tree/kill all the enemies/collect all the orbs. It's rather mundane, but for a fantasy? It's great. You run around each level, jumping really high and dashing really fast, obliterating everything in your way.At the current price ($1.99), I would not recommend it. During a sale, definitely.			"

												Entertaining little game, good for people who just wanna get to shooting.Has a simple story line and great gameplay.And the powers are freaking fun and generally new.The fast and free movement is also something to make a note off,since combining it with the varied powers makes for fun annihilations !Njoy folks.

												It's okay. 3rd person shooter where you fight the same 4 monsters to gain new gun types and upgrade them, your jump height, health, and run speed. I didn't bother looking at community mods and the story is left incomplete. Otherwise it's a relaxing game to jump around and shoot at things.			"

												Mix Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog in a 3D game with the Style of an old N64 game and you got this. This is probably the retro-fanboy in me, but I love this!			"

												I'm really glad I took a chance and picked this title up. The controls are intuitive, and the gameplay is simple yet engaging. I would recommend this to anybody that wants a megaman meets mario meets metroid feel. Old-school gaming fun that runs like butter and feels like a classic. Cheers!			"
