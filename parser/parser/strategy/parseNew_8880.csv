												7/10This is a classic comic book game.It's a classic game about comic books.It's a game about classic comic books.If you remember the classic days when comics were cheesy and entertaining. If you ever saw the old 4-colour editions of Marvel or weird tales, then you know what to expect here. The game controls are a little clunky, but you soon forget  that as you get lost in the narrative complete with Golden Age staples like the patriotism and clear dividing lines between good and evil, right and wrong. The ability to create you own hero is great, it also provides a deal of complexity and possiblilities that outstrip any modern game. The only thing I've seen that tops it is ""Marvel Super Heroes- the Role Playing Game"" but that was paper and dice, so it doesn't count.			"

												This isn't really a review but more of a warning to those that consider playing this game. The game itself is quite old that makes it very prone to some technical issues. And one of these problems is the pathfinding, which is makeing the game nearly unplayable but there is an easy solution  to that problem and down below there is a link that is fixing that problem.steam://openurl/http://steamcommunity.com/app/8880/discussions/0/358416640398103145/#p1Now making this review I also wanted to make the game score go a bit higher, the reason to that is that the game itself is getting very negative opinions that could be (possibly) eraesd just by downloading this patch. So anyone that is already considering giving this game a bad mark just for the controls that can be fixed can rethink writing the review and try the game that is actually playable.			"

												I love this game.   The game is really old so people don't know about it but it has a huge library of custom content.  you can basically put any hero you want into the game if you probe the internet for content.  This game is a must have game as its pretty unquie.   The ability to make your own hero goes far beyond any hero editor on the market today.  the story line is very enteraining as well.			"

												All you need to do is ask yourself how many games can you pick up a taxi cab and throw it at a mobster or beat giant robots with lamp-posts. Does that sound like fun to you? If so this could be right up your ally.I must have played over 400 hours of this game heck maybe even more, I re-bought it here on steam as my old disk became unable to load after 15 years of dragging it in and out of the CD rom.. It is a wonderful delight for any old comic book fan. the characters are campy like the old batman/superman tv shows. The stories are fun and characters are a hoot. Characters like the fun loving sea urchin, or the speedy southern boy ""Bullet."" Mentor the master of mind control or Melancholy ""Man-Bot"" will keep you going through the different stories and invested in the them The only thing better than the characters are the villains, and the guy narrating does a great job. The game has many short stories, which play like episodes and they all lead up to a final showdown, worth getting too. (20-30 hours on average i would say)The game has massive re-playability with leveling different characters, I think there are 12+ and  you could play through the game 10 times and still have more characters to try. Not to mention the many character combo's and who to use the XP canisters to level up more. Leveling up certain characters can really makes them shine and give a whole new way to play them. Mixing and matching can lead to tons of different ways to play the levels. Who you bring on each mission, and which ones you give canisters too can really change the whole feel of the game. I will say, the interface and game play takes a lot to get used to, if you aren't familiar with the older GUI's from the 90's it can be tough. But once you figure out how the hits work, and AOE powers and such, it really is fantastic.  Just play the game in win98 Compatibility and run as an Admin and you should have no issues, but some do, and I am not sure why. Try reading some of the trouble shooting tips if you are having issues. Outside of the getting to run issue, I have very rarely hit a bug, and typically when they happen you can restart the mission and you should not see it again. Just remember to make a save after or before each mission just in case, as the auto-saves are not very often.This is one of my favorite games ever made, while FFII, was good, it just is not as good as the first. But if you do like this one, I highly recommend the sequel as it really is more of the same with some better balance. The second is a bit shorter, and is lacking in the amount of new characters. The game is more of a continuation that feels like an expansion verse the whole game of the first. That said, it really is to bad that Irrational never made a third because even an expansion of this to me is better than tons of stuff out there on the market. Maybe one day, but till then try it..  The game is ""Antastic!""(there is also a GoG version now that fixes the dread cursor bug, so you might wan't to take that into consideration)			"

												Firstly, I'd just lke to say that I bought Freedom Force (FF) at full retail years ago, and I've only just bought it on Steam due to ease of use. Don't let my 'time playing' mislead you as to my level of experience with this game.Secondly, I am a massive turn-based tactical (TBT) nut. I love TBT games. A game in which intelligence rather than reflex speed rewards the player is my idea of heaven. I'm an older gamer, and despite plenty of time in Doom (and sequels), Duke Nukem 3D, Borderlands, ARMA, BF2 etc., I find my reflexes just can't keep up with the young'uns any more. And so this brings us to Freedom Force, a realtime-with-pause superhero game that pays shameless homage to the pulpy artwork and storylines of Jack Kirby, the single most important figure in Golden Age comics (sorry, Stan Lee). While not a TBT game per se, Freedom Force has the same structure of rewarding mind over muscle. The game starts slowly enough, with a single brawler-type character called The Patriot- an analogue of Captain America- and soon expands to incorporate other hero and heroine archetypes. Gaining experience gives you resources that allow you to add new characters from a bank of heroes that you encounter along the way.One of the primary points of difference is the ability to also use these resources to recruit a custom character. I've played a couple of superhero-themed MMO's and the area in which they all fall flat is character creation. Where they offer 'archetypes' that require your superhero to conform to a template, Freedom Force gives you complete leeway to create any kind of superhero you want. The only limitation is that the more powerful you make your custom character, the longer it will take to obtain the resources you need to field that character.Now, I'm not exaggerating when I say 'complete leeway'. Want a flying character who drains enemy special powers in a brilliant purple beam then fires them back in a green fireball that does AoE and DoT damage? Done. Want a 'Hulk' style character who throws cars around and absorbs enemy attacks to get stronger? Easy peasy. Want a male toon that seduces enemies into leaving cover using blown kisses, a la a cross-dressing Bugs Bunny, so that your compatriots can smash them flat? Well, it's not very fifties, but I'm sure it's possible. In playing Freedom Force, you will encounter all kinds of classic 1950's enemies, from evil, Communist ice-villains and  giant radioactive ants to self-duplicating cloners. This is where the incredibly deep customisation system comes into play. Every defence has a counter. Every counter has a counter-counter. It's a lot like the Cold War in that respect.But all that aside, Freedom Force looks and plays brilliantly for a twelve-year-old game. With a fiendish, but not ridiculous difficulty level, amazingly deep customisation, cerebral gameplay and a perfect Kirby aesthetic, Freedom Force is likely the most underrated game ever released.PROS:-Deepest customisation ever seen in the superhero genre-Great storyline-Loving homage to Golden-Age comicsCONS:-Graphics are soooo last-generation.-Takes ages to get stupidly overpowered custom characters into the game.NEEDS:-A reboot, with better graphics, possibly set in the Silver Age of comics (1970's-1980's) incorporating new threats and themes. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.WILL APPEAL TO:-Golden Age comics fans-Superhero fans who really want to create their 'perfect hero'-People tired of superhero MMO's but still looking for caped action-People looking for an tactical game with more flexibility than traditional TBT "

												If you like squad based RTS gameplay you should love this game. If you also enjoy classic super-hero storytelling and to fool around with the might of superheroes then why aren't you playing this game instead of reading this recommendation?FF is a game that the creators obviously put a lot of love into and it shows here and in the sequel. If you have any interest in the genre and/or subject matter then you'd be remiss not playing this game sometime before you stop playing games altogether.			"

												     My dad had the disc version of this game, but lost the CD code. I wanted to play it, but was never able to. So I finally looked up the CD code and loaded the game. Then I found out it was outdated. So naturally I looked on Steam. I was excited to find it, but when I got it I found it had some compatibility issues with Window 8. I knew this would happen from reading some reviews and followed the steps one of the reviews listed and ran the game that way. It worked perfectly!     Gameplay was torturous at first. If you directed a character to a location, he (or she) would run off in some other direction most of the time and it took a lot of attention to keep the characters on task and became impossible eventually. When I followed the suggested steps, the gameplay was perfect!     The game is hilarious at the same time as being action packed. The click discriptions are plain funny and the catch-phrases are comically old-fangled. The graphics are simpler than modern games (as it is old), but it's altogether awesome! The role-playing mechanics are very sound and make a lot of sense.     This game has all the elements of a good comic superhero world. Colorful heroes and villains, clever catch phrases, and an amusing story line. This is among the best superhero-themed games I've ever played!			"

												Although I love a lot of things about this game, the short of this review is that the game had a lot of technical issues back in the day, and still does- it's a pain to get running, and it's a pain to get things like the pathing bug resolved.  While one can expect PC users to be problem solvers, I still think it's important to raise the flag with a non-recommendation.With that (mostly) out of the way:Freedom force is a top-down squad game with superhero motif and themes and character progression elements.  The shining features of the game are undoubtedly its self-aware corniness, the ability to create your own superhero and fight alongside freedom force with them (Cancerquake did his duty well), and the voice acting.To my knowledge besides its expansion, Freedom Force is one-of-a-kind, and tries to hit all the theme notes- secret societies, giant bugs, giant robots, aliens, gangsters, communists (in particular nuclear winter's theme song is a thing of greatness)- however it generally involves the same small sets of enemies for a number of levels in a row, and levels get really long with limited healing.  I ripped through it due to a great custom character, and it still took a long time; the game manages to be both erratic and kinda boring simultaeneously.  The giant robot enemies in particular are enormous wads of healthpoints.The combat is serviceable- but arbitrarily either tough but manageable or an unending onslaught.  One particular issue is when you're forced to bring heroes that are woefully unqualified for their required tasks.  A couple notable examples are El Diablo's early battle with mobsters and freeze soldiers, any map where Minuteman actually needs to hit something, Liberty Lad's levels wherein he needs to survive eight fights when he can barely win three, anything with Eve or Deja Vu, and any part of the last gamut of levels wherein you will inevitably run out of steam many times.  You are going to have to save and load to disarm Nuclear Winter's bomb.  Probably a lot.The combat is simply not balanced- throwing objects and area attacks are the only reliable ways to deal damage (and the latter don't work against fliers).  Beams miss more often than not, melee is required but most of the good fighters miss often or take forever to swing and get trounced, and healing is a nightmare. Through this tirade of flaws, the game still manages to be fun with its corniness- but that's sure to be a turn-off for some as well.  There are a few points where maybe a little subtlety might have worked better, but the cheesy narrator and the hilariously sketchy comic-book origins are worth a lot of laughs, as do the alliterative item descriptions.If you can struggle past the bad and you're not scared of a lot of savescumming and obtuse scenarios, the fighting is strategic to some extent and there's a hell of a lot of customization- as well as mods for traditional superheroes if you know where to look.  Some people are going to love Green Latern helping the freedom force, and it's hard not to see that appeal.Long of this review is, the game is cheap and novel, but you're probably never going to play it because it's a pain to do so.  I ended up playing it due to a roulette.			"

												A 2002 super hero game.  It was near the time that I really hate EA for all the things they did to the game industry and decided to boycott the game and didn't buy it. From what I heard from other friends this is still a quite decently made game that drags long long time.Despite the bad impression I got so many years ago I finnaly decided to give it a try since it's a squad based RTS with all the different unit powers.Yes.. it does drag on a long long time and I am finnaly near the end of it. The game itself was the way before all the super hero movies and strange heros that not native to DC or Marvel universe didn't get much recognition. Objectively this game have fun old school comic graphics with old sound effect in text box trick to attract hardcore hero comic fans. All the different super powers from strength, regen, ranged blast, psi control are all in the game with nicely planned balance. Music is also very comic like and pretty fitting for the game.  The game difficulty is quite hard and you can fail some objects easily and have to save and load offen. For most level I had to try 2-3 times to learn all the surprises before I can do it perfectly. There are also many many levels of this game and the story develops quite linear and semi interesting. It does feel like plots that you seen or read before from other comics if you are a hardcore fan of comic. For new fans of heroic games its just not all that suprising either. Overall  it's just quite so..so.. game that will provide some entertainment though the not too aged graphics and cheessy fun. 6.0/10 for a bare minimum recommendation. IF you have something else to play.. don't try this as it will take long and just so so...			"

												This is a bit old and the controls will sometimes be frustrating if you expect a very polished game. On the other hand, Freedom Force will appeal to the comic book fan in you, with a cheesy superhero story and many heroes met along the way.All characters have a different set of powers: some stick to walls, some can fly and some can pick up heavy objects. Plus, the buildings can be destroyed.It's an old flawed game, yet controlling a team of superheroes is as fun as I remember it to be in this game that hasn't been totally replicated (except for its sequel of course).The developer made System Shock 2 and would go on to make BioShock.

												Whimsical is probably the best game which can be used to describe this game. Set in an alternative history where random individuals were given super powers, they decide to become super heroes and villains, and the sort of stories we normally see in comic books are what results. You control a squad of these do-gooders over the course of the campaign, and level them up how you see fit through all sorts of random adventures. Combat is real-time, albeit with pause. I only played through the single player (I presume the pause is not present in multiplayer), but the controls basically feel like a very early form of what is now considered the norm in MMOs.All in all, it's a fair bit of fun. It's old, and so comes with the general baggage one would expect, but it's an excellent example of gaming from the time and can still be fun to boot up.			"

												The game is entirely unplayable in Windows 10. I have not found a solution. I've poured several hours into attempting fixes found on all forums trying to get the ""Fist Bug"" to go away. I've tried dozens of options and nothing has worked. Once, and only once, did it work. I was able to play joyfully for about an hour before I had to shut it down. Looking back, I should have left the game open and just powered through the entire game.I would love to have this game playable for years to come as it's so incredibly fun and would be interested in funding someone to correct this problem through a patch. Why can't Steam get involved in this? Why sell a game that is unplayable??!! Refund? No. I want a playable game. (Even the old disc version didn't work. We need a patch.) Specific Windows 10 64bit fixes are welcome here. Good luck.			"

												I first got this game several years ago, played a ton of it, and was pleased to find it was on Steam along with its sequel (which I unfortunately haven't played as of yet). It's an enjoyable real-time pause-based strategy game set in a 40s-50s era metropolis filled with superheroes and villians.Overall, the main appeal this game has (at least for me) is how much like a comic book it actually is. The writing is fun and incredibly campy (and revels in it), and very cartoonish, but it has its more serious moments too. The characters are all knockoffs of actual comic book superheroes and villians (though I didn't catch some of the parallels. Granted, I'm not well-versed in comics), but each has his or her own twist, and I found them all enjoyable, and while fairly cliché, they worked well. Personally I found the game to be hilarious, but I do enjoy some campiness now and then.The gameplay itself, as I mentioned, is a mix between real-time and turn-based gameplay, with events happening in real time, and the issuing of commands done while the game is paused, though you can still issue some commands (such as a certain attack or movement) in real time as well. Sometimes the pathfinding is a bit clunky, but it works, and any little quirks can usually be fixed with a quick pause or micromanagement. The game also features many destructible objects (including buildings) for you to knock down, pick up, wield as clubs, throw, blow up, etc., all the better to dispatch the enemy henchmen with. Enemy variety and the simple aesthetic of the game make this all the more enjoyable. Something that also pleasantly surprised me (although I could just be bad) is that the game is fairly challenging, and a few moves can mean the difference between failure and success. It's not particularly brutal or anything, but it's not exactly a breeze, which is nice.The game is structured in different missions (complete with a comic book cover loading screen, but with modern systems you might not have time to appreciate them), with several usually spanning a certain villian, before their inevitable demise. Between these missions, you have several different options to upgrade your heroes using experience you accumulate during the missions, as well as hire new heroes with a 'currency' called prestige which you gain from completing objectives. The most enjoyable part about this is that the game also includes a hero editor, wherein you can create your own superhero, and you may then hire them using prestige to play them in your campaign, though this isn't necessary to complete the game by any means.As for the Steam version, I did have a bug when I attempted to play the game, in which the default left click action is set to attack and cannot be changed (on the forums this is sometimes called the 'Fist Bug' if you need help), meaning you can't click to move (though you may still move and use other actions using the right click command interface). For me, this was fixed by verifying the cache, but this may not work for everyone. (EDIT: If this did work and you have the issue once again, I found you need to verify the cache each time you launch the game. It's a bit annoying, but it only takes a few seconds. However, I personally need to redownload a 24 KB file (though this does happen automatically and quickly after hitting the Verify Game Cache button in the preferences), so if constant internet connectivity is a problem, be warned.) Keep in mind this game is over ten years old now, and you will likely have some compatability issues. From the sound of it, most can be fixed, but do be warned.Overall, I found it a fun little romp through a comic book world, and I highly recommend it if it sounds remotely interesting. You can pick up both this game and its sequel in a bundle for the same price as one, so why not try both? (EDIT January 1st, 2016: During this winter sale, it appears the bundle with both games is now about 40 cents more (unsure of other regions). Still, it's incredibly close.)EDIT: If this isn't enough, John ""TotalBiscuit"" Bain recently called this game ""f***ing great"" on the December 17th episode of the Co-Optional Podcast.			"

												Windows 8.1 or 10?  Don't bother.From what little I've played, it seems like a great game-- however, due to compatibility issues this game is downright unplayable.  The pathfinding is just broken so that you'll indefinitely run the wrong way and have to click 3 times in arbitrary points to do any interaction, and the game is very prone to softlocking.  This is especially problematic as WHEN (not if) the game softlocks and crashes, it locks your cursor, meaning either restarting your computer or going through Task Manager with Ctrl-Shift-Esc and keyboard controls without looking at the screen will be necessary just to close the game.I'm definitely glad I got this from a Humble Bundle, otherwise it would have been a huge letdown.  Even then, it's disappointing because these problems stand in the way of what seems to be a genuinely great game.  Go buy it on GOG instead, from what I've read they fixed the problem.  The 1.3 version Steam has is broken on Windows 8 and above, and quite possibly 7 as well, so once again, GOG is the first place you should look for old games.  Accept no substitutes.On the bright side, the sequel ""FF vs. the 3rd Reich"" seems to be fine on modern systems, even with the Steam version.  You're still a fool if you buy it on Steam instead of GOG, but hey, you'll be a fool with a working game.			"

												Growing up, I always wanted this game. It looked super interesting and tons of fun for what it was. I finally picked it up today and... it is unplayable. When I give commands, Minute Man does not follow them. He runs around where ever he pleases. That was very frustrating. I somehow got through the first level by left clicking and I selected an option with the right click (i.e. I should just have to right click then left click but I had to right click then left click the option I wanted then left click again once Minute Man started moving.) But I can't start the second mission. I'm so confused. I do not know if there is a problem I need to fix in my settings or if this is truly unplayable as it is. I wish steam support wasn't down so I could figure this all out. It's very upsetting. I'm extremely disappointed.			"

												Ok this game is just a guilty pleasure. I loved how you can customize your own hero and send him/her into combat to fight evil. The game feels like a 1940’s comic book without being so cheesy you have to smash your head with something hard just to convince yourself to play it. Despite the game being dated I think it’s still a lot of fun. Complaint, the game drags a bit which leads to an eventual outcome of “don’t care, I’m done.” "

												This game captures the feel of 60's and 70's comic books so perfectly that it sometimes feels like it's entirely possible that there is an alternate universe somewhere where these comics exist and the Avengers comupter game is getting this review.So it has a great theme, and excellent tactical gameplay that is, unfortunatley, still pretty rare (outside of the excellent sequel).One of a small number of games that truely captures the feel of playing as a superhero group, instead of a solo superhero (the other being Sentinels of the Multiverse).

												Completely unplayable.  There is a control bug.  What is *supposed* to happen is you have a cursur that changes depending on what you are hovering over, but what *actually* happens is somehow it gets stuck in fist (attack) mode and won't change back.  I've seen various posts on fixing this, including changing the game compatibility mode, but none of them work.Do not buy.			"

												The game itself is fun, when it works. Don't spend much on this game because it is so full of bugs that I can only play it about 20% of the time I try to. Right now, I have the same old problem many others do - the icon stays as a fist and doesn't allow me to move or anything unless I right click. Then, after doing so, my character just runs off the map.  I have tried every fix I've found on the internet but to no avail.			"

												8/10It's the basic formula that the sequel (Freedom Force vs the Third Reich) improved quite a lot.- Pros;It has great cast of characters, most of them have an actual purpose.Art style is pretty nice, comic-book like, a bit too much if I may say so myself.A lot different than most of the games you'd see, and yet as easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥to play.You can even make your own character and a lot of mods and stuff.Graphics are great even for that old of a game.Not buggy at all, no technical problems, it runs fine on any PC possible.Battle system is fun, when you get used to it.Great backstories on the characters.- Cons:MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD, NO ONE EVEN PLAYS THIS ;_;The price is a bit too high for the game now, I bought it back when it was on sale for 2 euros both games. Amazing deal, I had the sequel bought retail a while ago and I just had to have this.The campaign sometimes gets a bit stale at some points, but it's a fun over the top RPG-like game. "

												Do you want to punch EVIL in the face? Of course you do! In this comic game player takes control of superhero band - each with their own strengths and weaknesess. We play through the campaign, while taking care of recruiting new heroes and getting up the abilities of the older ones. There is of course an option to create your own hero - and why not?Amongst many others there are such character archetypes as Captain America rip-off (main hero) and his sidekick, Jalapeno Guy (Mexican with fiery powers), Ant Man (selfexplanatory), compulsory Good Alien From Totally Evil Alien Race, Magician Girl, Ironman rip-off (based on his early images), an Reprogrammed Android Turned Good and many more (there is even Aquaman rip-off).Overall the game isn't hard, but forces player to really plan his movies. There are also weaknesess and special abilities - some of our guys can fly, other just hop on the buildings, while trying to look cool. Even simple thugs with weapons can be dangerous for our merry band of heroes. There is no life regeneration, so the only health we'll get back is because of use special health kits or hero medals (which are special 'one-off' abilities and can be also used to ressurect or buff our characters).Option of active pause makes the game really interesting, especially because without it everything would dissolve into colorful chaos. It's not really that heavy on computer because cartoonish graphics don't really use any fancy effects. Even on my olden laptop I didn't really got any slowdowns - and that's something with all the stuff and explosions on the screen.The worthy successor to the game is Freedom Force vs. the Third Reich with deals with different main villain and wholly different story - and time travel of course... because, why not?

												+ So much fun! Hilarious, addictive and fairly challenging on higher difficulty. Fully destructible cities. Also pretty long. Good replayability with loads of characters to level up, skill sets and a comprehensive create-a-character.- It's a bit buggy, save often. The sandbox element is at once it's greatest strength and most annoying weakness - throwing cars and punting guys with telephone poles never gets old but most of your heroes don't take kindly to the same treatment. You really need to watch all of them all the time.Just try not to rage at the flying policemen... (""I am above the law!"")			"

Comic book heroes (and villians) in a stylish 3D world with comic book panels, superb voice overs, multiple special powers, destructible environments and party based, tactical combat, all wrapped in an RPG coat. Yes, if you still don't get it by now, this game was (and still is !) an excellent example of how to create an epic game. I really shouldn't talk about it any longer, it's something you just have to experience. Minuteman, El Diablo and Man-Bot await thee ![Rating: 90/100]			"

												Don't Buy it!  Unplayably buggy and broken!  This was a great game when it came out, but it hasnt aged well.  Tons and tons of bugs, I mean big mountains of em.   I couldnt even get through the first mission without the unit pathing and player controls flipping out in gamebreaking ways.  Doesnt seem to be much support (or any)  from the publishers or makers of the game.  I am running windows 7 and have tried running in various compatibility modes and messed with all kinds of things to try to get this game playable but I havent been able to get it working well enough that I can tolerate all the issues.This could be a great game to remake or for the publishers to fix up and re-release but until then save your money (or buy xcom or a Marvel superhero game or something else thats similar instead!).  I loved this game as a kid but in its current state its just not worth your money.Valve should be a bit embarassed for promoting (putting on sale!) stuff like this without checking if its actually playable.  With a 90% metacritic review, and reasonable price, I bet a ton of people have bought this only to discover they've thrown money away on something completely unplayable.I hope the new refund policy helps people avoid traps like this and helps games like this get cleaned up or get taken off the store.  I purchased this years before the refund policy so I doubt they will honor it, but I will be pursuing a refund on this one.    "

												This game seems like it could be a lot of fun. It has a great look and feel despite its age. The interface isn't perfect, but it's flexible and gives you options on how to control your character. The action is a little clumsy, but since you're issuing commands to your character rather than controlling them directly, I can take it as part of the package.I would love to play it some more, but there are a variety of devastating bugs. After trying several fixes recommended in the forums, I finally fixed one problem, but then hit another that won't let me continue past the first mission.Even though it's cheap, I can't recommend this game if so many people are having the same problems I did. It just doesn't belong on Steam if it's working this poorly.			"

												Unfortunately I can't recommend this game, not even at $1.24.   You'll see several compatibility fixes on the Community Hub, unfortunately none of them work consistently or at all.  There appears to be an issue with how the game renders terrain and how that interacts with modern Windows and/or modern videocards.  It renders the game buggy at the best of times, unplayable the rest of it.  If a consistent fix could be found I would recommend this game heartily.  It's the first example I ever ran across of destroyable terrain, and has a very enjoyable superhero campy type story.			"

												Game looks friggen awesome. Had some audio issues but was able to resolve them with emulator. However upon loading the gameplay the cursor locks into a fist and movement is impossible. I have tried three different compatibility fixes, including running Steam itself in XP comp mode. Nothing works.The only ""fix"" is to try and get the cursor into a corner where there is no destructible object and hope that it isn't hovering over one when you load. Which means you could start the game 40 or 50 times and it will be totally unplayable.Look - I realize that the game is old, but this is the kind of kink based on resolution that should be worked out for modern systems if it is going to stay on the market. Irrational isn't defunct, this could be fixed fairly easily. While the game itself may be fantastic, I can't recomment this copy until they actually hotfix modern resolutions for gameplay - or remove them from the options so that people don't find themselves with a game that doesn't work.

The tutorial mission already wkill not respond to my commands to move the character, resulting in the character randomly running off the map and ignoring any player prompts. There is a, ""fix"" to this bug, being you have to put your mouse in a corner of the screen during loading where there is no enemies. Also, the audio needs to be tinkered with on newer machines in order to make it work.Overall, I had no clue what this game was, and couldn't really play it due to the amount of bugs I faced in the progress of attempting to play it. If you feel like putting in the effort, then take a gamble as it is a cheap game anyways I guess,  "

Nuclear Winter o-o-oturn your around to snow<something something :P> for the Motherlando-o-o― Nuclear Winter Boss Theme. Will stay with you for a long time ;)Freedom Force is a game, which I remember from 2002 release time. I played it short and always wanted to return. I went back and... sometimes you can never swim in the same river twice. In this case, in murky pond.After 20h (probably interrupted just before the final):PROS+ comic-book missions' style (Issues)+ comic-book combat style (KO, BUMP, etc.)+ funny dialogues' pomposity+ stories ""how I became a superhero"" (secret origin stories)+ friendly fire+ lot of interesting hero-powers+ own hero editor and possibility to add him to the team+ many superheroes to create our unique team before each mission+ nice soundtrack+ long campaignCONS- dialogues' pomposity sometimes too funny and embarrassing- a lot of bugs that hinder smooth gameplay, and in my case - even complete the game- some secondary objects require almost divine skills and timing- lack of information about secondary objects progress- sound problems- very average camera's quality - if we choose the wrong team completing the mission may not be possible- throwing cars inflict 9 dmg, but simple punch inda face 20...- friendly fire + a HUGE lack of superheroes' accuracy (when from a distance of 2 meters your superhero doesn't get enemy three times in a row, but from 100 m can send perfectly critical 30 dmg backstab companion :?)- no ranged superpowers repeated attack, you have to click, click, click...- buildings demolition with a rifle & pistol o0- plenty of superpowers totally useless- lots of annoying enemies- in later parts of FF enemies are OPSubjective rate: A for comic book fun & story; C-/D for technical sideI haven't finished the game because of bugs and the fact that at some point FF makes more frustrating than fun. I would recommend this game only hardcore and loyal Marvel/DC fans. I wish you luck and a whole ton of super-perseverance.			"

												I'm not entirely sure what this game is or what it's about or why I have it or if I even bought it, but it's here in my list and I'm feeling like reviewing more games so I'm just going to make up some♥♥♥♥♥♥and we'll pretend it's what this game is really about. So there's this team of super heroes, right? There's a vampire hunter, a lucky French woman, a kid who is also a robot and loves Ovaltine and a man who owns a pizza shop and likes punching things in the face. They need to fight the crime in Pittsburgh, because there are criminals out there who need to be fought. The plot is a bit circular, but you can forgive the game for its amazing fight scenes. Later in the game, the team stargates to Bajor and helps the resistance fight off their Cardassian oppressors, improving Pittsburgher/Bajoran relations and making it socially acceptable for cities to have open relationships with planets. The Freedom Force successfully destroyed Gul Dukat's ship, saving the Bajorans forever!			"

												Not sure why I got this game. I thought I had good memories of it. I was mistaken. The controls are lackluster, the graphics are really old by now, the voice acting is ATROCIOUS and the story is just meh, so what is there? Technically it's a squad based tactics game, but to be honest the controls are imho to finicky to really make use of the game mechanics. If you're desperate for some 3rd grade superhero action, go ahead. Otherwise just leave this be.If you DO pick it up, be sure to check the community hub for the cursor fix on modern systems. Otherwise your commands will just not work properly (left click completely disabled apart from attacking) and your character will run off screen eventually, breaking the mission.Oh and the game crashes after every exit on Windows 10.

Still fantastic classic.  multi plaYER maybe...  Maybe someone will make another - the making your powers section is uber brilliant...			"

												Wow! What a game.  This game is so bad, not because of the story but because this game is so broken it is rediculous.  I read the reviews and every single person is saying the same exact thing.  It just doesn't work and apparently it is not getting fixed anytime soon, because there is a sequel but ironically that has very positive reviews.  If you haven't already gotten this game in a bundle or have purchased yet; don't.  Let me repeat that DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unfortunately I got this game in some sort of humble bundle I can't remember which one, but wow do I regret having this dog♥♥♥♥♥♥in my library. Speaking of that bundle it came with the sequel as well, so hopefully that one actually works.  Currently I have about 140 games in my steam library, about 90% of those games came from humble.  Don't get me wrong Humble is amazing, I am even subscribed to Humble Monthly, but sometimes they'll sneak in♥♥♥♥♥♥like this and it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.

												Downloaded it once to give it a play with my brother. Not only was it an extreme hassle to get a multiplayer game running (about 18 of the 20 minutes I spent playing it was on trying to get it to work), but once the game did start, it barely functioned, with my brother unable to even act while I wailed away at his characters.We tried restarting, thinking it was just a bad connection, but the game refused to allow us to enter a game together again. So I tried to restart the entire game, and it crashed when I hit Exit Game. My brother couldn't even close the game.This game barely functions, which is completely unacceptible. This game is bad, and Irrational Games should feel bad. Don't bother wasting your money on this terrible terrible game.			"

												Pretty fun game, just wish the upgrade system was quicker so it felt more rewarding.Basically this is a real time tactical combat with super heros.  You can pause, tell them all what to you, then unpause and watch it happen.It was funny and enjoyable ~ my regret is that upgrading the charactors is really slow.  After 8 levels, most of the chars still had the same abilities and few upgrades so the combat became stale.  Just my opinion but I would rate the game awesome if it was shorter with quicker upgrades... would add fun and replayability.			"

												I wish I could give this game a glowing review. The whole concept of it sounds amazing, the graphics are fairly good, and the comic book geek in me sobs at having to admit that I didn't like it. However, after giving it a try, I have to say just that: I didn't like it. The controls gave me some trouble, the hit boxes seemed to be annoying, and the interface drove me up the wall. I was never a fan of this style of 'overhead gaming' in the NES, and here, it didn't do anything with it that made me like it even more.One day, I may come back and try this again, and see whether the game may live up to my expectations with a rest break. However, until that day, I have to suggest that you get the game on sale if you want it at all.			"

												One of the finest tactical RPG experiences ever made, Freedom Force is also one of the most purely satisfying, faithful comic book superhero games. The writing is a loving homage to (and satire of) 50s comics, and the level of environmental interaction and destructibility has yet to be matched by other games in the superhero genre. It does have a few balance and design issues, and I found custom hero creation much less satisfying than simply using the pregenerated options, but ultimately these are minor quibbles.			"

Seeing each backstory unfold like a comic is wonderfull. The turn bace style gameplay may take a bit of getting use to but once you do you are hook.

												One of the games that I consider a ""classic must-play"" game. Sure, some of it has to do with my extreme romanticism of superheroes. Some of it might be about this game coming out in my formative years of PC gaming. Some of it may even have something to do with the destructible environments. But don't let any of these biases fool you, this is a wonderful game that deserves any and all praise heaped upon it.Form the common comic book tropes that are taken and slightly skewed, to the awesomely imitated art style of the Ditko/Romita classic Silver Age, to the isometric part real time strategy gameplay that focused on mixing superpowers (even of custom characters!) to best effect in destructible environments, this game checked off so many things that I adore.It's a shame that Irrational studios is downsizing because I always hoped that they would eventually go back to the proverbial well and give us another Freedom Force, but it apparently is not in the cards. I'll just have to console myself with another playthrough...			"

												If you like playing as homages to 50's 5 cent comics in a beautiful cel-shaded romp through the stereotypical golden-age east coast backdrops, beating up russians, and dinosaurs, and russian dinosaurs, play Freedom Force.If you don't like that, get the ♥♥♥♥ away from me.			"

												This game was great. WAS. Now it's a glitchy mess. Before I got the compatability run, the game would have the heroes go off in random directions or randomly beat up civilians. While I got this fixed, the bigger problem now is that I can't properly close the game. Either it would close by crashing or not even close at all, prompting me to reset my computer just because I can't access Task Manager to close it from there.Don't get this game unless you know exactly how to fix these glitches or they get patched, which considering how old this game is, is unlikely.

												The game's concept is a lot of fun, don the cape of a silver age super hero and fight crime. The graphics are meh but whatever. What annoys me is the controls. It lets you pause by hitting the space bar (like old school CRPGs just like Baldurs Gate) how ever when ever you want to move somewhere you right click your move location and then click ""move."" Simple enough, right? Nope. Instead of going where you just told your character to go he instead heads off on a B-line in whatever direction he is facing. You then have to left click where you want him to go and then he'll actually go in the right direction. Then there's the matter of path finding/climbing buildings.The initial protaganist, The Minuteman, has the ability to leap onto roof tops, sometimes. Other times instead of scaling a building to get to the roof he'll bring the roof too him by destroying part of the building. While this show ingenuity on his part it is highly detremental as the citizens of Patriot City aren't so keen on their costumed heroes tearing apart the city while bringing about justice.From what I understand the issues I've faced are related to the game being incompatible with different operating systems. While that might be a fine explanation I'm not pleased with buying a game and having to dig through tech support forums to make it work. want to like this game, I really do; but unless there is a patch that didn't load for me then it is too finicky to be played.Steam ought to consider putting notices on game that won't work with modern operating systems.

												This, and its sequel, are potentially the greatest superhero games ever made. The sheer amount of customization of characters you can do, mixed with the lovable corniness of the story, makes it a timeless clasic. I honestly canot recomend it more, even with the low-end graphics. The only problem I really have is that you can't customize a custom hero's appearance, you can only make them look like another character in the game.			"

												Obviously, a lot of people have been having trouble with this game. I haven't but I think I'm in the minority, so that alone might be pause for consideration before forking out on the pack. if you can get it to run though, Freedom Force is a lot of fun. I purchased the pack for convenience as I still have the boxed version gathering dust from back when FF first came out and its nice to be able to run the game at a higher resolution that the older version allowed. That said, FF avoids looking too dated as it uses a comic style for its design that, while simplistic by todays standards, looks more indie than archaic. The whole game has a tongue in cheek silver age Marvel aesthetic that honors the genre while lovingly pointing out just how silly it often is. It a delicate ballance that FF pulls off well with numerous superheros, archvillians and plotlines that made the game stick happily in my memory more than a great many other contenders.In gameplay, where FF excells imo, is in the ballance between challenging and frustrating. You can usually find a way to complete a level relatively swiftly but you can't just stroll in and expect to win. The levels themselves have enough variety to avoid repetition and invite you to play around a bit until you solve them. The game mechanics work well but begin to show the cracks in a potentially great game: Certain abilities are of more use than others to the point that using half the roster simply makes the game inherently more difficult and the xp awards add to this. XP is too limited, increasingly limiting the usability of most characters in the roster as you focus on the better ones. In other cases, the XP is insufficent to max out some toons; Eve being the obvious example, with her top tier abilities inacessible with the amount of XP provided from her addition to the roster. The 'create your own heros' option is limited too, leaving such characters outside the xp generation pocess and highly expensive to purchase (and grossly overpowered if you pay attention to the weaknesses of enemies).In short then yes, Freedom Force is flawred, it has issues but Great Scott, it is fun when you get into it.

												The game is great, but you're most likely to encounter a game breaking bug in the game. This is how to fix it. Credit to cajun for this fix. But look after that1) Find the executable ""fforce.exe"" in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Freedom Force2) Right-click on it and open the Properties3) Click the Compatibility tab4) Click the checkbox for ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"", and select ""Windows 98/Windows ME""5) Click the checkbox for ""Disable visual themes""6) Click the checkbox for ""Disable desktop composition""7) Click ""Apply"" and click ""OK""8) Double-click the ""fforce.exe"" file to run the game directly, rather than going through Steam HOWEVER, each time you exit the game, it goes back to it's old status. You must verify your files each time you play again. This is teidious, but if you love the game, you'll bear it. If you get past the bug, you'll get the excellent game.			"

												This version of the game is EXTREMELY buggy for me. It's because of Windows 7 Professional.I had to do the following.Find the FF.exe file in the game folder, right click it, go to properties, compatibility tab,1. check the box that says ""run in compatability mode"" , in the pull down menu select ""Win95"" 2. check to box to disable visual desktop3. check to box to disable desktop composition4. check run as administrator (!!!)5. click the OK button6. Now right click on the STEAM shortcut on your desktop that launches STEAM (not the game shortcut.7. right click it, go to properties, compatibility tab.8. check the box that says""run in compatability mode"" , in the pull down menu select ""XP service pack 3"". 9. click the OK button*IMPORTANT*. EXIT steam, make sure you right click close steam thats is still running on your system tray or the changes won't take affect.Now when you launch steam it will be in xp compatibilty mode, which will allow you to launch freedom force in win 95 mode to play the game without the fist bug on newer video cards / newer OSes.

												Let's start off with the bad.This game is extremely dated. And it makes it hard to play. I'd make sure you head over to the PC Gaming Wiki and check out the issues with it being so old, and how much of it you can remedy. I can't seem to play it comfortably anymore on my Windows 7 machine.Now the good.This is one of the most awesome squad-based real-time strategy games ever made. The rarely used superhero theme is very refreshing, and the Champions style character building is completely awesome. It's very tongue-in-cheek, a shout-out to the comic book world is cute and humorous.I really wish I could relive my first playthrough of this game. But to someone who has never played it, it might be worth putting up with, or working around the dated engine.I recommend this game to anyone who's never played the series at all. If you own Third Reich, stick with it.			"

												freedom force is an absolutely amazing game, it's got a brilliant story, fantastic gameplay and for the gamers with more creative tastes, the hero creator is years in advance, so much so, that little to no game has even thought about power or ability customization in such a scale that this game did. the best thing about the hero creator is that you could create a completely OP'd character and just wreak havoc on the bad guys in this game, or you could create a down to earth hero with scaled down powers if you want to afford them in the game. this game is literally perfect for the right kind of people, meaning it might be a little too child friendly for some gamers, but that shouldn't be counted as a point about this game, as it did a good job on keeping it child friendly, as the violence is cartoony, not gory, or scary or in any way adult, and there's also the design choice to make it so that the characters just get knocked unconcious, not dead. in the hands of a child, it is practically a godsend because they can actually play it and have a lot of fun. and for those gamers who adore absolute carnage, the environment around you is completely destructable, save for the ground. there are some bad points to this game however, for instance, the prestige system. during missions, the better you do, the more prestige you get, there's nothing wrong with that, but, the prestige you get isn't nearly enough to pay for even the weakest of heroes, you have to save up your prestige and by the time you've saved up enough for a fairly decent hero, you're halfway through the game. it's like saving up for 20 luxurious apartments with spa's built in using only your pocket money and your deadline is within 10 months. and also, i would prefer if the game had a built-in skin and mesh creator, as you have to create it on a download from modforce and on photo editing software. but beyond those two problems and other little ones, this game is a bit underrated, but an absolute gem and i can't recommend it enough.

												If you are unfamiliar with these fun and hilarious games, then you must buy them and play them immediately! FF and FF vs the 3rd Reich are not just an excellent homage to the Silver Age of Comic books and indeed America in the 50s and 60s in general - more than that they are very skillfully produced strategy games, with the added charm of rpg-style character upgrading and customisation. If half of the bad games produced in the name of the big hitters of the comics industry such as Marvel and DC comics were as ernestly produced and with the same love and care for the medium of comics as Freedom Force, many of them would dominate the charts without any problems. However until that happens, I'll be sticking with the Minuteman and his loveable, crazy crew!			"

												One of the finest tactical RPG experiences ever made, Freedom Force is also one of the most purely satisfying, faithful comic book superhero games. The writing is a loving homage to (and satire of) 50s comics, and the level of environmental interaction and destructibility has yet to be matched by other games in the superhero genre. It does have a few balance and design issues, and I found custom hero creation much less satisfying than simply using the pregenerated options, but ultimately these are minor quibbles.			"

												If you like playing as homages to 50's 5 cent comics in a beautiful cel-shaded romp through the stereotypical golden-age east coast backdrops, beating up russians, and dinosaurs, and russian dinosaurs, play Freedom Force.If you don't like that, get the ♥♥♥♥ away from me.			"

												I loved Freedom Force back in the day as a kid. I was both a computer game lame and a comicbook nerd, so this title was right up my ally. Normally I would say something like, if you have a soft spot for isometric RPGs and silver age campiness you shout try this... but no.There are a lot of compatibility issues with modern OS and some cause game breaking glitches early on making it literally unplayable. I got the double pack... let's hope FF vs. The Third Riech works.			"

												I played this on Windows 7 and didn't have any of the problems some others have seen. If I had experienced those problems, I would have also been frustrated.But since I didn't...Freedom Force was a fantastic game back in its day (though I didn't play it back then) and has stood up reasonably well over the years. The genre is (still) unique and the game is a lot of fun. The destroyable city environments are especially impressive given the game's age. Now, most of the destruction isn't that USEFUL. It might look cool to pick up a telephone pole and bash someone with it, usually using your super powers makes a lot more sense.You get a large variety of characters and the game does a decent job of forcing you to play most of them (instead of just picking the 4 you like best and sticking with them for every mission). That said, there were several characters that just didn't see as useful as others. In general melee characters seem underpowered--they take damage at a high rate and keeping them alive is sometime challenging. I found it usually better to try to pack my roster with ranged attacks.The character builder is pretty amazing but I can't imagine actually spending the time on it. But back in the day, lots of people did, and you can lots of custom skins and characters. I don't feel like the game really rewards you for that effort, especially given that multiplayer is non-existent today (and I don't think it was ever that popular).Overall, a great game that (provided you get it to run; not every has) is still fun today.

												This game is pretty broken at the moment. I even set the game to compatibility mode, and game seems to either crash at times or the game just doesn't function as well as it should. Apparently, my character moves the opposite way I originally clicked. Hope there is a fix soon.			"

												I remember this being really good back in the day... however now it looks dated, the controls feel awkward, and I couldn't get back into it.			"

												This was an amazing game back in its day.  Sadly, I can't recommend it. Too many bugs make it unplayable on modern versions of Windows.			"

												It doesn't work. If you really want it, you MIGHT be able to wrestle it into submission; however, I highly recommend the sequel (also on Steam) instead.			"

												This game is buggy as hell. Issues popped up as soon as I tried playing the tutorial mission. ""Click on the citizen to talk to them!""....I clicked on them, and my character immediately whacked them across the screen. Amusing, but other issues included a complete inablility to control the characters movements, spontaneously knocking down buildings, and the game crashing in general. After a good bit of tweaking and fiddling, I only got it to work properly once before giving up in frustration.			"
