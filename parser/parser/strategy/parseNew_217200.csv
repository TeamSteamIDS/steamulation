												Easily the pinnacle of the Worms series. Everything that needed to be added to the earlier games without the more gimmicky and confusing content of the later games. This is the essence of Worms. Should delight fans of the series and newcomers alike. Easy enough to pick up and play, but perfecting the art of Wormfare is no small thing.			"

												Worms Armageddon was the stand-alone expansion to arguably the best artillery strategy ever made... Worms 2. Though it lacks the insanely tweakable ammo and game settings of the original and doesn't have boobytrapped crates, WA is the best iteration in the series. Especially given that it's playable on modern Windows systems since the 3.16 patch. Forget Reloaded and other new Worms games: this game delivers everything you'ld want in almost perfect style. Thing is: you could get really good at it. It allows a great deal of skill development and at the same time it's a very capable strategy in its own right. Figure out your own style of play: very creative or very effective. Mass damage or darksiding!ALSO a must on any decent LAN so make sure everyone of your friends picks it up at a sale (or have a working install on your pc as the game is portable ;)gameplay: 10/10sounds: 10/10fun: 10/10(PS just picked it up on steam, so time invested doesn't reflect the the real number of hours I spent on it since the 90's)[EDIT]I've read some negatives and wanted to give some heads-up to people that are unfamiliar with Worms games or with the old ones. The full price of 15 euro's (or bucks or whatever) is quite a lot if you do not know what to expect. You'll probably better wait for a sale. Also, it's pretty smart to try and check if the game works on your system like it should beforehand. We have LAN's at least twice a year and some pc's have problems with the title, while others have no problem at all. I'm running Win10, my Win7 had no problems as well. I've seen people running 7,8 and 10 with and without problems, but mostly Win8 seems to be the biggest issue (which is to be expected of course :P). But as I said, I've never experienced problems on my systems after patch 3.16.Furthermore there's quite a lot of contempt over the control scheme and that it isn't rebindable. I understand the issue, but that is indeed how old games often were made. And the game also provides few explanation about the mechanics involved. It's probably best to play with a friend that knows some of the basics, or someone that does want to give some education about it.HF			"

												The best Worms game to ever come out - seriously. If you are looking which Worm game to buy first, make it this one. Do not be fooled by my hours on steam, I've spent countless when I first bought the game back in 1999.Worms Armageddon has single player elements and multi player elements to it. Traditionally, Worm games are turn based, and there can be two to four teams present on the battlefield. Each turn, a different worm has a chance to unleash mayhem. The playing terrain can be shot away with and you might find one of your worms just sitting above water, short of drowning. What makes this game dynamic is the multitude of weapons given at your disposal. Super sheep's that can fly through the air, controlled by the player. Holy hand grenades that take away a good chunk of the map. Banana bombs that bounce around everywhere and release more banana bombs. On the map as well, there are randomly placed proximity mines and fire barrels that explode and spread fire when provoked. One player training missions are available and make for a good challenge and breakaway from single player mode. Teams can be customized from grave choice to voice type, even a flag can be thrown into the mix to represent your team. Custom names can also be given to team worm players. This game is a good local game to play with friends, and probably is the only turn based game I'd be willing to play at any time. Absolutely, I would say this game is what made the series. I would like to see maybe in a future Worms' series a real-time worm game rather than turn based. How would that work? Well if I got paid for further suggestions in my reviews I'd share how :).RATING : 8.0/10 Gameplay A Story / Campaign A Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B+ Replay-ability A- Overall  A "

												I bought this game on Dreamcast around 1999, not knowing what to expect, which I think allowed me to find hidden gems like Worms Armageddon. I had never played a Worms game before and was on the hunt for any great game in the limited library available on the Dreamcast. Going back to that day, it has been nearly 15 years. It's amazing to think this game still holds up so well. Since then I have played several Worms games, almost all have fallen short of the complexity, difficulty, and variety that WA offered me as a child.This is a great game to play in a room with several people, which may be hard to do on the PC version. Most of those days are lost, but when you try to carefully plan out an assassination, walking and jumping through mines, from perfectly landing Ninja Rope insanity, only to end up undershooting a Holy Grenade and blowing your elite worm 300 yards into the water -- the room of viewers will burst into laughter and you won’t care that you probably lost the game. Moments like these are what make the Worms games so great. The newer Worms games offer online and clan wars, but lets be honest... That is a dull experience in comparison. Online can be fun, don't get me wrong, but it is totally competitive and not intended for newer players.I must also mention in a bit of detail, the Ninja Rope. It has since dramatically changed in all Worms, but in my opinion, not for the better. The classic Ninja Rope took a ludicrous amount of skill and refinement. Not everyone could master it, but those that did, were true bad asses. It is one of the funnest tools in any Worms game, and makes this classic stand out amongst all the sequels. Let me just say, it is a little overpowered. Just like how everyone remembers Quake for ""Rocket Jumping,"" the older Worms games are remembered for Ninja Ropes.The single player in this game was pretty tough, and if you have troubles, check out my video tutorials on completing it (on Steam or YouTube). It is pretty fun though, and teaches you several tricks of the trade. I would say to try and complete the training and a few campaign missions before ever playing online. This should give you the basic understanding of how to utilize your weapons/tools. Then see what people do online to become a pro. It takes some time and patience, but is worth it in the end when you start blowing egos into the water.In short, if you're looking for a massive array of weapons, level designs, laughter, and difficulty -- look no further. This game is amazing 15 years later, and will be in another 15. Give it a try if you've found the newer Worms games a bit too easy or you've never played Worms at all. There’s no other games like them and there’s a reason Team17 (the creator) has prospered all these years as one of the oldest independent game companies around.Graphics:        7/10Sound:            8/10Gameplay:      10/10Replay Value:  9/10---------------------Overall:           9/10			"

												Once upon a time, in the dark ages before I joined the Internet, a friend I had at the time somehow managed to get me a bootleg copy of this game. I installed it on the computer my parents had at the time.. and me and the friend spent endless zany hours blowing each other to smithereens. ""I'll blow you, up!  No, I'll blow YOU up instead!  ...Oops, I blew us both up...""And I spent even more hours smacking the AI around for fun and hilarity when my friend wasn't around.Fast forward to 2016, The computer and friend that I had at the time are long since gone, replaced by the doldrums of ordinary adult life. Then I found this game on sale via Steam and knew I had to buy it right away. So that I can spend more endless hours blowing things to smithereens! =D			"

												This is the best Worms out there. The graphics are low-fi but very charming, the physics engine feels great, and there's all kinds of neat weapons and game options that never made a reappearance. The only problem is that the single-player sucks and it's how you unlock all the cool options but if you really want that stuff you can just get a team editor and give yourself a completed save file.Or you can be a total dork like me and do it for real for no particular reason.

												Worms has been around for years and still has new releases, yet this game remains on top.  There are two primary gameplay modes: Campaign and Deathmatch.The campaign is comprised of different levels that teach you the gameplay mechanics and give you different goals to reach with a given set of weapons.  It starts out explaining how aiming, power, and wind effect different weapon such as grenades and the bazooka.  You quickly learn how different weapons react to different environments.  The game then puts you in situations where you have to get from point A to point B while only using specific utilities.  There are many levels that will only be completed through trial and error--and that is one of the best parts of the game--it doesn't hold your hand.  You learn how everything works through experimentation.  You learn for example, that a girder can be used for protection as well as to traverse the maps.Death Match is a simple 1 on 1 where each player takes turns controlling an individual worm trying to eliminate the other team.  It starts out simple, giving you the obvious advantage in team size and poor ai aiming, while slowing ramping up the difficulty with each match.  By the end, you have a smaller team size and the ai has impeccable aim.  The last match will likely take many tries.  But, when you do win, you will feel like you truly earned it.All Worms games follow the same mold, but what makes this one truly stand out is the customization.  You choose the name of every worm on your team as well as their gravestone and voice from a huge list of options.  When you want to face off with a friend or the ai, the game gives an astounding amount of options that are sadly lacking from more recent titles.  You can choose which weapons and utilities you want available (there is a lot to choose from!), how much ammo they have, when they can be used, etc.  You can choose how often health/weapons/utilities drop.  You have control over worm life and sudden death options.  You can essentially change anything you would possibly want.  Don't like the random stages the game gives you?  You can create your own stages as well!One of the things that makes Worms Armageddon so great is that you can play multiplayer locally as well as online.  Sure, you can see all of your opponent's crate pickups during local play, but nothing beats being able to see their face when you land that amazing grenade toss to win the game.Although newer titles may look nicer in the graphics department, this game still reigns supreme in terms of content and customizability.  This game was amazing in 1999, and it still holds up today in 2015.			"

												Worms Armageddon is the definitive Worms game. If you are a fan of the Worms genre, then you probably own this game already. Even to this day, I still reckon Worms Armageddon is the greatest turn based game of all time.PROS:-	A load of weapons to choose from.-	The graphics, sounds and psychics are spot on.-	Can be played on higher resolutions.-	Online multiplayer is still amazing as always. Plenty of games to join, or host your own.-	Single Player mode, whilst nothing special, is a refreshing diversion. Completing Training Modes, Missions or Deathmatch Games unlocks extra features to tinker around with.-	Thanks to all the updates in the past – you can now play on larger maps, coloured maps, have more worms on each side, and even more things to customise.CONS:-	£10.99 is a very steep price to pay for a game that’s over fifteen years old. Wait for a sale.-	Since Armageddon is released on Steam, it would have been nice to have a selection of achievements and trading cards.Overall score: 93/100 "

												Worms Armageddon is one heck of a classic game, so why review it now? Mostly because it's kinda newly released in Steam, but also because I've played it a lot with friends the recent weeks. Worms Armageddon is a game that's made to play with friends, if you have nothing to do between playing a game of CS:GO and are too tired to get back to your Campaign in Civilization V, than look at Worms Armageddon.With Worms Armageddon you can murder your friends with a Banana Bomb, or throw a huge metal Donkey on them. The game has a wide variety with weapons, everything from MMA to rocket launchers. If you see a worm on the edge of the beach, should you kill him with your shotgun or perhaps your grenade? Or why not only stand beside him and push him into the water. (Protip: Worms can't swim)The game is 2D and you can only walk to the left and right, and jump. There is a map creator so you wont ever run out of maps, I can also recommend playing on an empty map, just try it, It's fun.Either way, if you are bored and have friends, get this game, play it with them. You won't regret it! (Hopefully)			"

												Normally, in my years of browsing Steam games on their store, I would look at this game, see the graphics and the price, and move on (NOOOO I dont judge games by graphics, and a lot of games that have these graphics now adays are worth playing, but not worth the price tag this one has, mind you).  But, if you pay attention to the reviews, there is a reason for the price.  This game holds its weight even after over 15 years.  Extremely fun, very challenging, and a lot of fun to play turn by turn with your spose, children, siblings, friends, be it on LAN or on the same screen together taking turns.  This game rivals Chess in its strategy, having so many different variables to use to conquer your opponent, and so many different ways to go about doing so.  The campaign is fun and all, in my opinion, by my greatest pleasure has been playing with friends and family, and in my own time, playing progessive deathmatch against the PC.  Each game you win it gets harder and harder with the odds more against you. Not to mention full custom course creation, as well as team creation.  Name 8 team members and choose the team flag, their accent/voice, and their grave stones for when the lil' guys die for you, even choose the victory song that plays at the end of a match.  Go even further and choose the amount of ammo you start with, what guns you start with, the time for each turn, round, match, falling damage on/off, mine timer duration, crate drop occurence, power of each weapon (nothing better than having a bow and arrow cause more damage than a **HOLY HAND GRENADE** but seriously, this game gives very little limitation to creating the perfect match for you and your friends.  2 people left on map in a stalemate, afraid to move.  Sudden Death kicks in, it becomes a race to the top.  10/106 people left on map, a box drops from the sky.  Super banana bomb, it becomes a slaughter!!  10/104 people left on map, you throw a grenade that bounces back on you, and kills your last two guys.  10/10Don't bother yourself with the newer ""3D"" versions of this game. While fun, they are mere attempts at capturing the greatness that this game wasBuy this game!!!			"

												Old school game, a game that never dies. Simple but extremely addictive, if you have never played this game, you haven't had childhood. A bunch of worms fighting between themselves using more than 50 types of weapons, it is not needed to explain too much.It has a pretty decent online community, there are between 40 and 90 players playing everyday so you always will find someone to play with. Anyway, in my opinion, the main point of this game is a kind of mod called ""shopper"" which is basically a mode that force you to use rope to take the crates that fall from sky. Really addictive.

												The best artillery game ever made and one of the best turn-based strategy games ever made. This ain't an opinion, this game still holds up today and it was released almost 17 years ago. PROS:- Timeless, humorous 2d graphics that make even the most gruesome worm death look funny.- Rewarding turn-based gameplay that focuses on strategy and being careful. One small mistake can ♥♥♥♥ your whole game up.- Randomly generated levels provide a new experience every single game, and if that's not good enough for you, you can even make your own levels. You spoiled ♥♥♥♥♥ucker.- Customization options up the ♥♥♥♥in♥♥♥♥♥ you can set your team of worms to speak Chinese or even Polish for christ's sake. Although granted the Polish voice is annoying as♥♥♥♥♥- The soundtrack kicks♥♥♥♥♥even after 2 decades. There's nothing like sneaking around and setting a stick of lit dynamite under a worms♥♥♥♥♥while some super sexy bass line plays in the background. ♥♥♥♥.- The developers, Team 17, still and I mean STILL support this game. It's 2016 and they're still releasing patches and fixes for this ♥♥♥♥in game man. Now that's dedication. This ain't like modern games where the devs abandon that♥♥♥♥♥♥after like 2 months. These guys are the real deal. Team 17, just for that, I'll let all of you bang my wife. Free of charge. You guys earned it.CONS:- The AI is infamous in this game because it blatantly ♥♥♥♥ing cheats. Jesus christ, I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to punch a hole through my monitor over the years because some ♥♥♥♥ing smug computer-controlled worm threw  a grenade across the ♥♥♥♥in level that just so happened to land right next to my worm. I can't really complain about this though because it just makes the game more challenging, so stop being such a ♥♥♥♥♥.BUY THIS GAME, NERD.			"

												A great game, especially with friends!  It's hard to get use with the controls, but once you do, a lot of fun awaits!A lot of maps, options, coach co-op/multi, online co-op/multi and more!A retro look, that might not be for everyone, but still amazingly looking!Do not buy it for the campaign. It's badly made!			"

If Team17 are that one band who keep putting out songs that sound the same, then Worms Armageddon is their greatest hit.Armageddon (and World Party) is the quintessential Worms game. Strategy, accuracy, creativity and fun all mix together. The weapons are varied and satisfying (or frustrating if you miss that carefully planned shot!). You can ""git gud"" and snipe someone with a bazooka from 50 metres away or you can play for the fun of it. Also, the ninja rope is witchcraft.Customisation is the game's biggest strength, letting you set everything from your team's accent and victory song to the rules of each round, the damage and scarcity of every weapon... lets you draw your own terrain or import it as a BMP. Lets you create presets of everything. A game that treats you like a PC gamer. And none of that ""streamlining"" or DLC or ""consolisation"" or ""tabletisation"" (I'm looking at you, Worms Reloaded.) It's the full package. It doesn't hold back to condescend to you or slowly squeeze your wallet.You can play it by yourself.You can play it against someone sitting next to you.You can play it online. Shenanigans ensue.The menu screens are stuck at 640x480 but the gameplay can be set to glorious full HD.(All that said, Worms WMD looks very interesting.)			"

												The definitive Worms game that still, 15 years later beats all the competition. To this day no other Worms game has been able to reach this level of strategic versatility and creativity. If you want, you can play silly and just relax and have a great time with friends. You can also make it an honorable, chess-like duel of masterful maneuvers and strategies.Compared to Reloaded and onwards, this game features more sensible physics that can be utilized to carry out pixel-precise maneuvers and strategic plans. Also, the Ninja Rope is as deadly as it's supposed to be, not the gimped and clumsy version featured in later installments.Compared to Worms World Party, this game is still being updated and has been supporting high screen resolutions and modern operating systems for ages. Also some gameplay-related peculiarities have been fixed (like the difference between fall damage distance and parachute deployment distance), game settings are far more fine-tunable in the game UI, it's minimizable everywhere, maps can be of near arbitrary size, .png format maps are supported in online games, automatic game recordings etc... so yeah, there's a lot to improve in WWP RM.The only thing missing from W:A are some Wormpot modes and I reckon the mission variety is not quite as wide.

This is the only Worms game I would currently recommend. If there is anything bad about this Worms game, it's the limited amount of modes to play.			"

Mechwarior and Half life were my favorite but my mother also deciced i couldnt play those anymore because they were to violent after seeing me beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of some scientists with a crowbar. Worms became what I played and i loved it. This game brings back many memories of an overly strict mother who made me an aquard ♥♥♥♥ in highschool sho didnt turn out how she wanted.  buy it.			"

												This game... is a black hole for your time! Unless you want to be productive at all, I see no problems with this game.The physics are great, the graphics still look appealing and besides, IT'S WORMS!One thing I don't understand is that despite the fact this is only the 4th game in a massive series, Armageddon has one of the largest/best arsenals in the series. While there are others with similar sized arsenals, most were just full of filler weapons. Not this one. Seriously, if you don't own this game, buy it now. If you do, play it some more. If you're Team 17, bring back Patsy's Magic Bullet, the Mole Squadron and the Priceless Ming Vase. Please?			"

												I'm not sure how many of you know, but W:A has a flourishing online community to this day. There's a big central site (tus-wa.com) and some independent leagues, irc channels, forums, wiki... Two developers working on the game for free (but officially), they have delivered some awesome updates.The game might look fun-but-silly at first sight, but there's a very well thought-out system in the background, enabling all sorts of custom schemes to be played, from pixel-perfect puzzles, through fast-paced ninja-rope battles to turn-based strategy and much more.Highly recommended!

												(Hours logged in-game only apply to the Steam version of W:A I purchased. The actual amount of time I've spent playing this game is incalculable.)Best game ever made, hands down. Better than all of the newer Worms titles. (Although we shall see if W.M.D. ends up being any good.) Unbeatable replay value and deeply strategic gaming. This game literally never gets old. I've been playing it online since 1999 and I'll be playing it until I die, probably. Looks are deceiving - what appears to be a simplistic, cartoony game for kids is actually the best online multi-player turn-based strategy game there is. The learning curve is practically endless. No matter how much you've played, you can always improve. This is also a fantastic choice for less hardcore Worms players if you merely want to have some 6-player action with your friends and laugh your heads off. I really don't understand why this game isn't more popular. To this day I have yet to find any game with as much replay value due to how customizable it is, and community-created schemes and maps are abundant. One word of warning to newbies: People have been playing this game for a LONG time. If you find yourself losing (and you will), don't be put off by it. Every match is a learning experience and this game takes time to master. Nobody becomes good at this overnight. The community in general is friendly and willing to answer questions.This game is digital crack cocaine. Yes, the graphics are dated, but the gameplay is outstanding.			"

WA has stood the test of time much better than many of the recent games.The price tag may seem a bit steep for a game that is, at this point, over 14 years old, but the game continues to get software updates to this day.

My second being Worms 2, which was also available on disk for PC.- A casual, 2D side-scroller- A game of war between worms, vs AI, PvP, or campaign modes.- Customisable with voices (die a brave hero, or scream like a little girl)- Create your own maps and terrain Slightly sad that the mini movies as the game started up were not included, I loved watching those!Worth playing.

												Worms Armageddon is a classic game from '99 that derives some strategy and arcade concepts, and it has gained very positive reviews on various gaming magazines throughout the world. No wonder. Being the successor to Worms 2, it improved much. Nonetheless, it is still a fun game that you can play with the whole family and friends. Many interesting weapons to choose from, different schemes, colourful maps, speech banks and obviously single-player missions to accomplish should make it enjoyable for everyone. You can even play it online, I can guarantee that there will always be someone to join your host!			"

												Seriously, this is the best game ever made. I am not lying!Ive played it for about hundret hours in its steam version.Some years ago Ive played for even more hours with the retail version. (I have plenty of them, always managed to lose the disc at some point heh) And when I was a kid Ive played Worms World Party when it was released for even even more. With my schoolmates Ive played the demo version on the same map over and over again for I-cant-even-remember-how-many-times. I bet Im scratching on the thousand hours now.I dont think I could handle any real professional player online. There were some years of inactivity in between my sessions.But being the best isnt really the point of the game. The point is to play with others and having a great time.Its turn based, so its ideal for chilled evenings. When your turn is over you can chat with your enemys in the chat. The most enjoyable moments are these when something funny happens, when a whole dozen of worms are flying through the air or when a tricky shot succeed. Or failed and killed your own team instead the enemy.Really, there are so many cool moments in this game you dont have in any other kind of games.If you dont know anyone who plays with you, you can join the online servers. Depending of the daytimes you will find others to play with. If you fear this game will ever stop being popular online: Dont worry. The userbase was never really shrinking since its release. Of course playing with relatives is still way cooler than doing so with strangers.And a few of the developer are still working on this game. They do fixes, keep it running on up-to-date computers and adding features. Still the game itself stays oldschool. I bet you wont find any game which are still getting that much attention from their devs.If you get the concept of the game and like online matches with up to 5 other people from all over the world, this is your game. I think the single player of Worms World Party is better, but nothing tops the multiplayer of this timeless classic!			"

												Thank you Andy Davidson & co (Team17), Deadcode and Cybershadow for making my favourite game of all-time. I wish more people would realize that this game is not just ""LOL HOLY GRENADE AND BANANA BOMB IS SO FUNNY xD"". Don't get me wrong, they are funny, but it is so, so much more.			"

												I have owned and played every single worms game for over 20 years. I wake up in the morning grab a coffee and play a game or 2 while I am waking up. This game is a classic. It survives the test of time and is enjoyable today as it was 20 years ago. (previous versions). I changed my HDD and my old copy (on CD-Rom) was lost so I just bought it on steam. I can tell you in WA alone I have over 2000 hours. There is not a single thing I can say is wrong with this game. I play exclussivly SP and the game just never gets old. Safe for kids fun for adults. A few different types of things to do, like deathmatch, you VS AI turn based, you VS friend turn based and missions.  This game gets a 10/10. not because it is a visual masterpeice, it is not. But because it stands the test of time. It is always fun.			"

												Nearly 18 years after its release, it's still one of, if not the best game of its kind. Playing it with a couple of friends is quite possibly the most fun you'll have online. And if you're all in the same room together, you don't even need a second copy of the game to play together, as hotseat multiplayer is how it works. Bonus points if your friends make sudden, loud noises right next to your ears just as you're lining up your shot.			"

												This is probably the most wide-known and well-loved 2D worms game. And I can see why. My personal favourite is Worms World Party, but this game definitely is up there with it. If you like what you see from these games in the videos, I think that really explains it best. You play as worms, you pick voices and hats, then you shoot each other with many different weapons! Totally sounds simple, but is so great! Play online, play campaign, play however you want! Just have fun.			"

												This game is now 15 years old, but (sorry to say Team 17) it's the best Worms game by far. Even in the years after it's initial realease, this was the pinnacle of 2D worms. It built on the original game, and tweaked the flaws in Worms 2, but the reason this is still the best after 15 years are the patches that have been released over the last few years. Team 17 have allowed 2 coders (Deadcode & Cybershadow) to keep updating the game. Adding user requested features and tweaks that have just perfected the game. The games resolution can now be set far higher than when originally released, making the game look sharp on modern PCs. Map sizes have virtually no limit, allowing for the game to evolve in so many ways it;s creators could not have envisiged. (Checkout my maps on http://www.wmdb.org/users/ohms ) To Team 17's credit the game is still playable online via their servers, and it's never been so much fun. I wonder how Team 17 will ever create a worms game that will lure us WA players away from it. I kinda hope they succeed one day. EDIT: It's almost 2017 and they still haven't!!			"

												Worms Armageddon is a very fun turn-based battle with the cutest little worms ever! Even though it was originally released in 1999, it has been updated a ton, it seems, and rivals today's games of similar genres.Something that is a little hard to deal with, is the fact that there is no tutorial, but mashing keys will help you figure out most of it. The price may be a bit high in some people's minds, but I think this is a very valid game even for 2014. I bought it at full price, but if it's still an issue, wait for it to go on sale.But oh man, watching worms throw rockets and exploding sheep and exploding rocket sheep at each other is really really fun!Oh and, it has online multiplayer too!

												I don't think I have to explain what one of the most famous PC games of all time is, do I? I'll just skip that part.While Armageddon is growing a bit dated in its appearance, it is still the best worms Team 17 ever made, in this reviewer's opinion. Out of all the worms games, Armageddon is one of the better games in terms of customization options and number/balance of weapons. It also has great mobility for the worms, including really crazy physics-defying uses of the ninja rope, if you get good at using it. But one of the biggest factors for my preferring Armageddon over all other installments in the worms franchise is the size of the battles. Armageddon lets you create much bigger teams than other Worms games, and you can therefore have a greater number of worms on the map at a given time. This gives you a lot more tactical options per match, but also improves those crazy moments where you explode a holy hand grenade and six worms go soaring through the air in all directions.Armageddon also boasts a really fun and challenging set of story missions that challenge you in a variety of ways. Usually there is either a puzzle element to the mission or else it challenges you to think about a particular weapon or skill in a new way. It is very fun to go on a one-worm infiltration style mission, for example. Or there is another mission where you have one worm with 10hp and have to kill an enemy worm with 150hp who is hiding in an underground cave with no entrances, and you have to figure out how to kill him (without getting killed yourself) within a certain number of turns. It requires a lot of retries and experimentation, but you get it eventually. Challenges like these are an excellent change of pace to the typical all-out deathmatch.Buy W:A and enjoy your holy hand grenade.			"

												PLUSES:+ Beter graphics than Worms (1995) and good for its year.+ There are a lot of speaking languages of worms, hymns. I surely say first time in game history.+ There are a lot of game configurations.+ Expect random maps, there are a lot of maps for play.MINUSES:- You can't change camera zoom configuration.			"

												Despite its ancient age, this game still holds the title of my favorite game of all time. I am not the only one with this opinion. Worms Armageddon still has a very large following. It is not often when there aren't any lobbies and can't get any players for a game. Massive replayablitiy as well as amazing, well thought out design made this all possible.			"

												The classic. While I still love Worms 2 most of all, mainly due to the stellar soundtrack which they never came close to matching in the dozen sequels, this is definitely Worms 2.5. This is the old reliable workhorse of the series. There's still people online, and they've done a good job making this stay compatible for modern systems and supported well on Steam. What issues they cant fix on Windows 8 and such, they warn you about and suggest workarounds. Nice effort. Not many games from the late 90's are so usable on Steam with no tweaking.I haven't played much Worms Revolutions and none of Clan Wars, but this still seems to be the Worms title with the most accurate gameplay. Everything is pixel perfect, and the physics can be counted upon to not screw you up unfairly. There's still a lot of charm here, and for people with very weak hardware, this is your game. This series has been milked pretty bad, and you aren't missing much from newer entries besides graphics and shuffling up the equipment. While some can argue the equipment here is unbalanced, that's why you can make your own incredibly detailed rulesets when playing. Create your own balance over time.Anyway, good memories here, but no nostalgia goggles are worn.			"

												Worms Armageddon... where do I even begin.This game will ruin every friendship you'v eever had. I cannot recommend avoiding this game enough. Only purchase if you have plan on contemplating suicede every time you open this program. It will be the end of you. There is literally no way to be good at this game. The only way to win is to be lucky enough to not be killed by your own worms. DO NOT PLAY THIS WITH ANYONE THAT YOU PLAN ON REMAINING FRIENDS WITH.tl;dr: A damn good time, hell of a lot of fun. Even more fun with friends that are willing to take part in all the giggles that are sure to ensue with every move. Game of the Year 1912.			"

												I think this game is Fantastic i can't believe this game is now 15 years old! ¬_¬ God i feel so old but one problem that i witnessed when i had to reinstall my game cause my pc ♥♥♥♥ed up and i had to get a new hardrive the sound i can only hear it normally when stuff's happening in the middle of the screen when its not in the middle of the screen i can barely hear the sound any solutions?Well anyway weapons are such a big variety and with the same graphics of worms 2 (with some slight changes) i think this game is in my top 10 fav games of all time same with reloaded which i dont play much anymore <:\ I give this game a 9.5/10 I KNOW i could of gone for the 10 but still 15 years later with this score i think thats well done with a lot of replayability. Except online is very more competive now :( Most people will ask u rules of a gametype and most of the time if you dont know you will get kicked I hate pros even though i am one, But that doesnt mean i like playing with them just dont like how they want to play mostly by the rules, make ur own scheme and have fun and make a password and there you go have fun with friends! Any Helpful tips? you can ask me or look up worms armageddon big tutorial on youtube thats the best thing to do if ur beginner at this game. Anyways i reccomend this game have fun wormers!EDIT 05/29/2015:Actually i take it back this is my favourite worms game of all time it used to be reloaded, but now its this. the amount of custimization is absoultly top and it kicks the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the new games's e.g. so u want a game with lots of mines, ok then just go to the game options and set the mines from 8 to 250 :D(and all your eneimes will fly away.....well including yourself lol). if you havent yet played this. PLAY THIS GAME! what are you doing? playing cod? (not saying cod's bad just eh not my fav game of all time lol) nah jk i wont judge anyone that plays cod you play what you want ;) but if you read this review well yea all of the above tells what you need to know lol. I'm certainly not afraid to give this a 10/10 and thats final |:).			"

												I actually can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet.I had Worms Reunited and Reinforcements when I was alot younger as a new game, so I know a bit about the game. Some functionality was removed from that game to make it more up to date (setting wind, exploding on kamikaze and surviving etc.) Anyway, I am not reviewing that game.Pros:Map editing is pretty simpleYou can have as many teams as you like (Always name your entire team stupidly, I usually have Bob, Shakira, Indiana Worm and so on (they are some of my best worms))FunnyBananasCons:Sometimes doesn't sync well in MP (probably my pc)Pixel land kills easily if you don't spot itNinja ropes require real ninja skills to get over ridgesAnyway.The game contains awards at the end of rounds and matches which after so many hours you probably have seen them all (don't forget to knock the enemy off the edge of the screen for home runs, theres an award for that)What can you do?Set team -names-gravestones-special weapons-voice set-flagfire -sheep-pigeons-old women-nukes-bananasI don't really need to say much more other than buy it for multiplayer. If your after a laugh though get Bob was hungry. If you want to shoot people, get this.			"

												""What's the best Worms game"" is surely a matter of intense debate over a very long series of installments. And sure, some of the most recent titles have been pretty solid. But I dunno. Maybe I'm biased when I say there's just something about Worms Armageddon, but I think you could make a pretty solid case that this one was just the best. I'm sure someone would agree.

PROS:+ really fun gameplay+ nice variety of funky weapons+ classic graphics+ difficult but fair missionsCONS:- less variety compared to newer Worms games- clunky online mulitplayer (local co-op works fine)- AI can seem dumb sometimesComment:The first game in the Worms franchize I have ever played. And I played it with my friend for hours and hours and hours. This game was (and I dare say still is) very addictive and fun. A variety of cool weapons and gadgets to get rid of the opposing worms (or to surrender...coward). This was improved in Worms World Party, which is unfortunately missing here on Steam. But Armageddon is the next best thing! The newer Worms games are okay too but somehow even though they have more variety it is still Armageddon that grabs my heart. Online co-op is clunky and problematic but that can be expected from a game this old (although a fix would be nice). It still takes from the rating I give this game. My personal view on this game is that it is best played with someone right at your side so you can see the stupid look on their face when you have a chance for a double-kill on their worms...and they can see yours when you mess up and kill your worms instead. It is a cool game worth recommending so go and grab it!			"

Worms Armageddon: An all-time classicEveryone who has played this game from early days knows what I am talking. The game mechanics are simple but offer a lot of tactical and strategical possibilities but remaining fun. The training and mission mode will help you learn the game while the deathmatch mode will steeply increase the difficulty of each match.While the online multiplayer mode is not working properly, playing with several players on one PC is just awesome. The turn-based system makes it possible to play with 4 players on the same computer without losing fun at all.The graphics still look pretty nice over one and a half decades after release!Worth some € to spend on.

												The controls are hard to get used to.If you  can master those, you are in for a great 2D battle arena experience unlike any other games out there. Hurl grenades, launch bazookas, wield an uzi, and be the last worm alive.The idea is a turn based ""artillery simulation"" where you want to use your team of worms to drain other worms' health or launch them off the stage into water, because worms can't swim.The levels are all interesting, there are many many different weapons to use, all fitting for different tactics, and all games turn out differently. The graphics still hold out phenominally.I would recommend this classic to anyone willing to try a completely new, unparalleled type of game. Worms Armageddon is a must-play.			"

												Good old worms, variety of fun and extremely destructive weapons that you enable or disable depending if you want fun or game balance.Same thing for game rules options : destructible terrain., etc...Very fun game to enjoy with friends.Only negative aspects : Not uptaded with ladder or automated matchmaking (though  it is possible to play online). And no achievements. But those are minor points.			"

												9/10Highlights: Nostalgia, Sound and GameplayI've spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on this game way, way back when it was first released. This game, Age of Empires II, and Starcraft I were the only games I played for months. I challenged many friends, tested out multiple strategies, perfected my aim, and created multiple schemes and maps. This game will always hold a special place in my gaming experiences.Anyways, the gameplay of this Worms game is probably the best in the series. I'm not just saying that due to nostalgia. After playing Worms 3D, Worms 2 Armageddon, Worms Reloaded, Worms 4 Mayhem, Worms Revolution, Worms Open Warfare, and so on, those all feel inferior to the classic gameplay shown in Worms Armageddon. Bazooka in particular has always felt just write on the 2D landscape in this game. But things like traversing the landscape, setting up traps, and strategizing combos worked well within this gameplay style.Character customization is as charming as ever. The worms voices and sounds are still fantatically presented. The graphics are also better than what I remember from the 15 year old game.Overall, this is one game I'll always cherish and looking forward to more zany battles with these dastardly invertebrates.

Is Worms Armageddon (1999) still good for today's standards? HELL YEAH! One of the best (if not the best) Worms classic games! There's little to add to it, as it's considered a masterpiece!    -Highly customisable matches, solo AND multiplayer (and with maps you can create using a built-in tool or some advanced free programs in the community);    -Huge arsenal of weapons (even compared to modern Worms games);    -Online Multiplayer (Yes! There're people still playing this 1999's game online. It's that good!);    -Local Multiplayer with up to 6 teams and 48 worms (Thanks to the 2010 upgrade);    -33 solo missions that will gradually test your skills;    -A Training session that can help you a lot;    -A Deathmatch mode to entertain good players and make the hardened ones try to finish it;    -Extras and Rewards that are given to you as you complete trainnings and missions (and can be easily unlocked with mods, if you wish);   -Many, many, many Addons and Mods from years of community;   -Many (new) graphic options to suite your pc configuration (but it doesn't replace the classic art style); The game received a big upgrade in 2010, is updated from time to time, and can run in all machines (Windows, Linux and Macs). If a problem occur (which in unusual) you just need a quick look on google to find a solution. I've spent more than 50 hours playing it solo and as local coop. If you think my opinion is spoiled by nostalgia, I must mention that I've only got my own copy in mid 2013 and barely played this game when I was young. If you are still not sure, buy it on sale or consult a doctor.			"

The short review:GENIUS!The long review:Throughout the history of Worms Armageddon, way before the game was available on Steam, I've always been stumbling in order to get this game work. Back in the 90's my hardware was always a tad too old to get this visually impressive game working. In the 2000's the situation turned out upside down – my new PC was suddenly too modern to run an old game like this. Due to this kind of technical difficulties being able to play Worms Armageddon has always been somewhat of a struggle to me. But that struggle hasn't stopped me from loving this game from the bottom of my heart. On the contrary the fact that I've always been ready to spend hours to configure compatibility modes and workarounds proves that this game is simply worth every drop of sweat, blood and tears spilled in order to be able to spend even a brief moment with it.With this backstory I would like to give my big thanks to all the people who continued the development of Worms Armageddon and who made it available on Steam. My current PC doesn't even have this old-fashioned device called CD-player attached to it – but who knew I'd still be able to enjoy the game of which physical CD was my most cherished possession as a kid.Whaaaat? You came here to read about the game, not about my pathetic childhood obsessions? Well there you had it, Worms Armageddon has always been the biggest obsession in my whole life!""It's just a bunch of worms shooting at each other. Fun for a while"" you say? Wrong!!! Worms Armageddon is probably the most long lasting fun ever! The numerous deep features and the rock hard mechanics make the game play solid and simply enjoyable. Pretty much every modern game (including the new Worms games) seems to rely on ""realistic physics"". And although many ""physics games"" are super fun I hereby claim that the mechanics behind Worms Armageddon are of the absolute finest quality to have in a 2D-destructible-terrain-battle like this. Imagine a scenario where I want to bounce a grenade off a vertical arc that is a circular blast hole from a previous shot. If the game worked with realistic physics the bouncing angle would be super hard to estimate and would vary largely depending on which precise pixel of that wall the grenade happens to hit. Now, compare this to Worms Armageddon's fool-proof physics: if the grenade collides horizontally it will simply mirror its horizontal direction! Same applies vertically. GENIUS!But it's not only the bounce logic that is amazing. The game contains numerous small features like walking backwards, jumping in 5 different ways, interacting with other moving objects and skipping projectiles across the surface of water. All those features are built deep into the game logic and they allow amazing variation that brings up new ways to play the game even after fifteen years of playing. Like, did you know you can do a Bungee backwards in order to drop Mad Cows down towards the very cliff you're hanging from? GENIUS!Oh yes, there's also this one weapon/utility that is worth a special mention. Actually it's really worth a whole another eight paragraphs of reviewing but let me just sum it up by simply mentioning it: the original Ninja Rope. GENIUS!			"

												Reviews of old games: are they worth the time to read or write? Most likely not. And a lot of what there is out there is dripping with obvious nostalgia factored in, to the point where it is hard to take anything written as credible (because fan boys are stupid). But this game stands to this day as an example of a game so well designed, it will continue to be playable and should be played until there is a game of this type capable of replacing it (still waiting).While I would have preferred that Worms World Party as available (as it's basically Armageddon with a few extras), this is a rare game indeed. At least for me. Many games that I've poured so much time into I've felt as if I've thrown away my life. So many games have also made me feel like I wish I didn't purchase them (like the majority of my steam library). This game is a rarity because I've enjoyed pretty much every moment of it. For the past 15 years of playing it. Hundreds of hours in Armageddon (not including playtime on steam), double that with World Party. Regrets? Maybe not having enough people to play with in offline multiplayer.While an humongous understatement: This game is excellent.For one, it can run on anything now. The graphics are still excellent, crisp, adorable, and the animations are great... but who cares about such superficial♥♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay is where this game becomes a timeless classic, as it is more or less a game of chess with so much complexity.  It feels like a turn based fighting game, as you need to take out the enemies, while holding favorable ground, and requires a lot of forethought. So many factors have effects on the outcomes of your actions.Many weapons that have different effects, many of which make craters and are (sometimes) accompanied by a blast radius, and depending on how close you hit an opponent, and the incline of terrain they're on, and if there is any overhang or terrain features for them to bounce off, of if there are barrels and mines, the wind, the momentum of their inevitable flights and the possibility of sending one worm into another for a tackle, etc etc long run-on sentence.There is so much to learn, so much to experiment with: I think this game should be available to all school computer labs for little kids just to give them all a good lesson in physics (as well as coming up with creative problem solving).This game is really deep though, and it can actually be very daunting for someone who hasn't put the time to learn all the many facets of this game. Like learning the best digging techniques, how to be mindful of having the proper coverage at the end of your move to mitigate a too severe reprisal, efficient movement and how the terrain can be either helpful or detrimental (I hate you GRASS), how to take advantage of the pleasantly wonky ninja-rope physics, and more.There is a lot you can do with this game, like playing multiplayer (offline is always best, enjoyment is dependent on the number of friends and their willingness to play this game) or deathmatch with the A.I. (at elite level the game becomes a puzzle that changes with every play), or all the fun training modes and missions.A final note: this game is the definintion of replayable.  Randomized maps and with time and practice pulling off perfectly placed shots, this game can lead to awesome and hilarious experiences.I’m going back to putting more time into this gem.  And you should be playing this as well.1 year of Steam version edit:After 1,200 Deathmatch wins, countless hours in local MP practice mode messing with Roping/Super Sheep/other game modes, this is probably my personal favorite game ever.

												This is overall one of the best multiplayer games I've played. The graphics are more than adequate. The controls take some getting used to, but are nuanced and technical. There is a hilarious variety of weapons. A match can be both heated and also very casual. I can only recommend it if you have friends that play, but you can always just send me a request and I'll join.			"

												Reviews of old games: are they worth the time to read or write? Most likely not. And a lot of what there is out there is dripping with obvious nostalgia factored in, to the point where it is hard to take anything written as credible (because fan boys are stupid). But this game stands to this day as an example of a game so well designed, it will continue to be playable and should be played until there is a game of this type capable of replacing it (still waiting).While I would have preferred that Worms World Party as available (as it's basically Armageddon with a few extras), this is a rare game indeed. At least for me. Many games that I've poured so much time into I've felt as if I've thrown away my life. So many games have also made me feel like I wish I didn't purchase them (like the majority of my steam library). This game is a rarity because I've enjoyed pretty much every moment of it. For the past 15 years of playing it. Hundreds of hours in Armageddon (not including playtime on steam), double that with World Party. Regrets? Maybe not having enough people to play with in offline multiplayer.While an humongous understatement: This game is excellent.For one, it can run on anything now. The graphics are still excellent, crisp, adorable, and the animations are great... but who cares about such superficial♥♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay is where this game becomes a timeless classic, as it is more or less a game of chess with so much complexity.  It feels like a turn based fighting game, as you need to take out the enemies, while holding favorable ground, and requires a lot of forethought. So many factors have effects on the outcomes of your actions.Many weapons that have different effects, many of which make craters and are (sometimes) accompanied by a blast radius, and depending on how close you hit an opponent, and the incline of terrain they're on, and if there is any overhang or terrain features for them to bounce off, of if there are barrels and mines, the wind, the momentum of their inevitable flights and the possibility of sending one worm into another for a tackle, etc etc long run-on sentence.There is so much to learn, so much to experiment with: I think this game should be available to all school computer labs for little kids just to give them all a good lesson in physics (as well as coming up with creative problem solving).This game is really deep though, and it can actually be very daunting for someone who hasn't put the time to learn all the many facets of this game. Like learning the best digging techniques, how to be mindful of having the proper coverage at the end of your move to mitigate a too severe reprisal, efficient movement and how the terrain can be either helpful or detrimental (I hate you GRASS), how to take advantage of the pleasantly wonky ninja-rope physics, and more.There is a lot you can do with this game, like playing multiplayer (offline is always best, enjoyment is dependent on the number of friends and their willingness to play this game) or deathmatch with the A.I. (at elite level the game becomes a puzzle that changes with every play), or all the fun training modes and missions.A final note: this game is the definintion of replayable.  Randomized maps and with time and practice pulling off perfectly placed shots, this game can lead to awesome and hilarious experiences.I’m going back to putting more time into this gem.  And you should be playing this as well.1 year of Steam version edit:After 1,200 Deathmatch wins, countless hours in local MP practice mode messing with Roping/Super Sheep/other game modes, this is probably my personal favorite game ever.

												A classic that refuses to die. Worms Armageddon is easily the best title of the entire ""Worms"" franchise even though it's from 1999.  It's a 2D turn based strategy game where you have up to several worm teams face off against each other (each team being led by a differend person/AI or you could have a few teams being led by the same person :D). I whole-heartedly recommend this title.			"

												//My hours of playing do not at all display the amount of time I have really been playing this game//Again one of those games who has shaped my childhood. :)Yes it is indeed an old game, has it aged well? Yes indeed it has!I have been playing worms revolution, ultimate mayhem, clan wars, and even the lovely early worms-mod for halflife 1(which was one of the best 3D ""installments"" of this frachies, even though it was created by fans)and I must say none of the installments has the same madness, fluidity and ""simplicy"" as Worms - armageddon.And I must say I'm not one of those 3D worms haters, but it is hard to not hate or dislike many of the 3D installments for bad grafic engine, bad controllers, lack of the atmosphere and madness and such.My review is also lacking the singleplayer part because I have never played it, I have only been playing this with my friends and I believe that is also what this game is best for :)Okay lets take the cons first, shall we :)- Needs a DLC or patch with more weaponary (okay one thing first, armageddon do have the best selection of weaponry and a customization and so on compared to the others) but when you have played armageddon a lot and have played some of the later installments with some of their few new crazy weapons, you do miss some of those from the newer installments.- Sometimes the bots can be rather stupid, normally they are quite average, nothing really to complain about, but a few times I have experienced some stupid bahaviors from their part XD- Thats it, I can't really come up with anything else. Sorry!And here it the PROS! :)- The simplicity! No simplicity does not mean it is boring and plain, not at all. From my perspective the best games has always been the simple one, not those who tries with lots of special effects or twisting plots(With plotholes) to hide their lackness, but those games who are simply being what they are, nothing more, nothing less. Worms armageddon is for everyone, from little children to grown ups, it is easy to start with, but hard to master. And even if you have mastered the game, luck still has to smile upon you in a battle with your friends. :P- Fluidity. Both the grafic and the playthrough are indeed very fluident, so smooth compared to others and especially clan wars which still lags even with a really great gamercomputer 'cause of a stupid grafic engine.- ZEE CUSTOMIZATION! In a multiplayer game you can custom anything from your teams, to the map, the game modes, time, drops of crates, starting health, weaponry, the ammo(infinite bananas! XD) and strenght of the weapons. So much to do which can really change the gameplay totally. I just love it! all the opportunities, but which is presented in a simple way so even a totally newbie would be able to understand.- Mulitiplayer gameplay, fair play. Okay without any doubt it really does help if you have played this game many times before. But still when it comes down to it, luck is a big part of it. I cannot count how many times I have been beaten by newbies because of this. It makes it fun for everyone and challenging in a non frustrating way.- The styleart. Even though it is vey simple and cartoonish, I think that is what makes this game so charming, it is so pretty in its simple cartoonish styleart.- It works with every computer(I don't know about mac and linux)! I have been playing this on windows millennium, windows XP, windows 7, windows 8 and windows 10. Maybe I'm lucky but I have had no problems at all both with the CD version and steam version.- Bananas? Infinites Bananas? Bananas with max blast strength? The only weapon, which you have, is bananas? now that is indeed fun!! Blast your friends with a high chance of killing lots of your own worms :PWorms armageddon is meant to be a simple game filled with fun and madness in a way which are enjoyable for nearly all ages. :) And in my opinion this game does not only beat all other installments in this franchies, it is one of the kind. :) No wonder why so many people have falling in love with the franchies ^^ because even though it is purely violence, it is violence in this fun and silly cartoonish way that you cannot complain about it :)Aged well, just as a good wine ^^			"

												I remember playing this game in my childhood. It was so awesome. I got it again, to try it. This game is from 1999 , but hasn't aged at all. Worms Armageddon is still a really enjoyable game! I really love it, it's so awesome. Even though it's from 1999, it features 720p! So HD is there too! The graphics are as i said, pretty good concidering they're from 1999, it's pretty much like an other worms game in graphical terms. The only thing I would like to see, is a mod or update where you can actually rebind the controls, unfortunately, with the game in this state still, you can't. Anyway, if you love the actual Worms series, this a game that you don't wanna miss out on!			"

												This is the best Worms game ever made. I mean... Worms 2 was already good, but Worms Armageddon is where they reached perfection. Games that came after that were unable really to add to it. None of them was anything new. And the attempt to move the gameplay to 3D killed most of the fun. Seeing they put this in the store finally, I have to tell you... This is the most epic thing you can get! Mastering it isn''t easy, but MIssions and Trainings will teach you many tricks. And if you gather friends for a hot seat game, actually playing together on one PC, it is most likely the best thing for a house party: it will give everybody a lot of fun and laughing! I know it did in my case. I'm not kidding you, I personally rate this game 10/10.			"

												This game is good. I will tell u why. Good online, customization, good controls, amazing graphics(especially for 1999 standards) and so much more. The only bad thing about the game is that there are no online filters, so I can't play people in my area or people without the project x mod(yes, I don't have it installed, although if you wanna give me a link I would like it). Go buy the game now. Really, its that good.

												Very likely the pinnacle of the worms series. It was the game that didn't need to try to hard to be a success. A mixture of serious and hilarious weaponry, many of which are hidden or unlockable, coupled with a great set of maps to play on make this game a winner. The missions are varied and entertaining, deviating from the standard deathmatch which defines the regular game. Overall, a game that has much replayability, great multiplayer, particularly hotseat multiplayer, and varied and fun action that is easy to pick up but take a while to master.			"

It is still as beautiful and slick as I remember it from all those years ago. In my honest opinion, it is VERY much worth paying those ten bucks to preorder the new Worms game just for Armageddon!

Also no way to easily rebind the controls (perhaps acceptable for a game of its age but then a lot of other issues have been fixed).The community guide fixes the missing voices/flags but not the other two problems.Other than that the game is as good as ever. It also comes with a bunch of the later patches/fixes for proper resolutions which is nice.			"

												This is the best game in the Worms franchise, and the game everybody wishes Team17 would simply re-release with fully modern hardware and networking support. Worms Reloaded was like a shoddy demo of Armageddon, having maybe 1/4 the amount of its content, and much less in terms of customization and configuration. And Reloaded had no map editor. Armageddon is the game that makes people still pay attention to Team17 today.			"

												Best Worms game, bad steam version.Hoped that they would have improved the behavior of the menu and the resolution so setting everything up would be a little bit less fiddly.Even worse, this game has no controller support! So when playing on the big screen, keep in mind that you have to pass around keyboard and mouse all the time. (Also the n64 version of this game certainly has controller support which could have been transfered easily to the pc version. WTF?!)Nonetheless, this game is a welcome contrast to all those turbulent local multiplayer games, as laid back as it is.And most impotantly, this is a Worms game that lets you customize your custom games completely including all super weapons. How come that newer alternations do not let you do that?!			"

												About the game: Worms armageddon! With more weapons, mayhem & chaos. Worms go toe 2 toe in teams upto 8 for the ultimate victory. The rewards? noone really knows!""Bring you're rockets, bring you're grenades, hell, bring that concret donkey cause we might need that too! You may never know... Don't argue soldier! Back in line, we say jump you jump, that reminds me, don't forget the parachut's or grapple hooks cause we could use those's too... yes..""Turned base old school tank vs tank style with a few twists, water can raise, tanks can drown, tanks can crawl, Tank's do bleed? oh yes, & tanks are actually worms! you can dig, aim, fly, shoot, but all normally in a limited amount of time. Worms is still fun, relaxing and enjoy-able. I'd recommend to any classic players.Side note:I shoulda wrote this review back in 1996!Worms! You got worms?The game is a classic, Turned based kill or be killed. Worms was my ultimate favourite game growing up, infact, it was my favorite windows game! Didn't know to much about computers or games in the 90s but I always remembered worms :) Turning on that bulky screen, waiting for the tower to bootup and give image to the screen.  Worms was always the 3rd and priorty to that very same process today lol			"

												One of the reasons I pre-ordered Worms Revolution was to get this old classic. The game that was updated so much by Worms fans to keep up to date that Team17 hired them to do so officially. Now it's availible on Steam for a very cheap price. I still would prefer Worms World Party for more of it's options and nostalgia (I played WWP more than WA). In my honest opinion, this game had the most unique arsenal of weapons and the best physics for them. No matter what the newer games do, you cannot replicate the feel of this game's Ninja Rope in any other. Overall, best 2D Worms game next to Worms World Party.			"

												Legend.A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.[1] Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. Unlike a computer virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program.[2] Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.Many worms that have been created are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through. However, as the Morris worm and Mydoom showed, even these ""payload free"" worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects. A ""payload"" is code in the worm designed to do more than spread the worm—it might delete files on a host system (e.g., the ExploreZip worm), encrypt files in a ransomware attack, or send documents via e-mail. A very common payload for worms is to install a backdoor in the infected computer to allow the creation of a ""zombie"" computer under control of the worm author. Networks of such machines are often referred to as botnets and are very commonly used by spam senders for sending junk email or to cloak their website's address.[3] Spammers are therefore thought to be a source of funding for the creation of such worms,[4][5] and the worm writers have been caught selling lists of IP addresses of infected machines.[6] Others try to blackmail companies or schools with threatening DoS attacks.[7]Users can minimize the threat posed by worms by keeping their computers' operating system and other software up to date, avoiding opening unrecognized or unexpected emails and running firewall and antivirus software.[8]			"

												Still one of the best game! I love it! I used to play it years before, but this game simply good.Personally I think the Armageddon has the best graphics in the whole series. The new ones are not that authentical.Anyway, if you didn't buy it yet, I warmly recommend this game.			"

												Pro:Cute graphicsSingle, multi & co-op playFunnyKinda family friendlyCon:No controller suppotSlowRepetitiveVery OverpricedNo cards or achievesThere are better worms gamesStupid game (read below)Overall:This is not the best worms game out there but like the other ones if it took itself seriously, the game would suck. However it doesn't and is at times funny & silly.  Does this counter the negative aspects? That's your call.  This game really needs a demo.5/10 -1 no cards -2 price  -1 not a good game (boring & repetitive) +1 funny +1 graphics +1 often in bundles = 4/10Get it in a bundle and try out one of the cheap ""worms"" games to see if you like the houmor 1st.

												I deleted my old (Bad) review and I am making a new one.Last time I did not reccomend the game because one of the  voices says the B word it is the voice who says ""Nice shot big boy!""I think.Some one said that I should accept that people swear in video games,well I just won't use that voice,and I already accepted the fact that people swear in video games.Now despite the E rating,It does have swear words (Amazing rating 1999 ESRB),and does have a blood cheat code which is used in alot of servers.But onto the real review,the gameplay is a fun artillery game (Although it is sometimes slow),the graphics are good,sound is awesome,the voices are superb,and the music is randomly generated (I think) so you're not listening to repetitive music. 9/10,It was between 9/10 and 10/10.

												There, it's out. No dumb preorder exclusivity, no fragmented DLC, no dumbed down console-oriented design decisions, currently still receiving updates by Deadcode with new features and fixes, WormNET enabled instead of run by GameSpy, no team size limitations, will run on pretty much any Windows-based toaster you could possibly get your hands on, and most importantly (going by community logic), the good old ninja rope in all its game-breaking glory.Now you never have to buy a new release of Worms again.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here. It’s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you learn, the more you earn.” Now maybe you’ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it’s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have a college degree, I had no opportunities. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it’s not just about money, it’s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it’s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it’ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are. Now, this isn’t a “get rich quick” scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I’m not promising you that tomorrow you’re gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it’s not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it’s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I’m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it’s completely free to watch it it’s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don’t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say “Ah that’s not real that’s for somebody else.” Don’t listen, don’t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said “optimism” so if you’re a cynic, if you’re a pessimist you don’t need to click here. Don’t worry about it, I don’t need to talk to everybody. But if you’re somebody who knows that there’s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it’s not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it’s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company. Maybe it’s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you’re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I’ll see you on my website, it’s a quick video and you’ll see there absolutely free. So just click this video and you’ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I’m excited to share this amazing stuff. You’ll see, not because of anything of me but because I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me. Not just in books like these, although I love books but also real in-person mentors. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They’re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site.			"

												If you don't know what Worms Armageddon is, it's a sexually transmitted disease that's very communicable but is treatable if treated within 72 hours.  But it's very difficult to spot in that time frame.  It has a 78% mortality rate so you're pretty ♥♥♥♥ed if you're reading about it just now.			"

												Buying this as a new player because it was ""the best Worms game,"" it's just a frustrating experience with zero explanation how to do anything.  Everyone has their nostalgia glasses donned when they talk about how this is the best game in my opinion, because if you didn't have this in your childhood and are picking it up for the first time, it hasn't aged well and gives you a pretty large learning curve and you'll need to look up a lot of stuff online.  And I wouldn't recommend playing online with random players, becuase in my experience they were ninja experts swinging around using their ropes and annihalated me immediately.Overall, if you're new to Worms, I would tell you to skip this title and opt for Worms: Revolution or newer, because you'll have an actual introduction to the game and its mechanics as well as a better interface, visuals, and controls.

												Trying to re-learn how to play this game has been one of the most aggrivating, and unrewarding experiences I've EVER had in gaming.Sure, everyone remembers Worms. You take turns angling and firing all kinds of different weapons in deathmatches, but I didn't remember all of the controls.The options menu has no way to change, or view the controls, nor does the basic training. The basic training is just a series of missions where it tells you to do something, but doesn't give you ANY inkling of how. I haven't played this game in over a decade, I don't remember how to open up the weapons menu. But if you don't figure it out in time, you fail the basic training mission, and have to go back not to the start of the mission, but three missions back. I can't even fathom what absolute moronic ""game designer"" thought that was a good idea. If you do two missions, and fail the third because of an unfair time limit, zero explaination of the controls, and zero guidance on how to use them.Seriously, I'm dropped into a BASIC TRAINING mission, where I need to reach a crate, and two targets on platforms slightly above me. It explains that I can use an uppercut to reach them. But if you use said uppercut, it's not nearly high enough to reach, and you've used up your single punch you get for that mission and fail. Now you need to complete the two previous missions to get back to this point and figure out what you did wrong. How am I supposed to figure out that not only do you need to jump, but you need to DOUBLETAP backspace (Which isn't even the jump key), and then hit space to double backflip, and then at the peak of your jump, use the uppercut? On top of that, the training missions are MANDATORY in order to play the real missions, and I STILL don't know how to open the weapons menu.So I'm sitting here, having only played for less than thirty minutes, and I'm frantically searching the internet on how I do absolute basic, and mandatory things like jumping, and opening the weapons menu.It's tragic, I have so many fond memories of this game, but back in the day, my friend introduced it to me and told me all the controls. Trying to learn the basic controls of this game is the biggest ""F-You"" I've EVER seen in gaming in my entire life.Buy this game for the nostalgia, but new players, stay the HELL away.			"

												Firstly it doesn't work on newer operating systems (I'm on win 7) without problems. Secondly once you get the game working the controls are pretty retro and can't be rebinded. I'm running at 2560x1440 and the game displays fine at that resolution however, the aiming seems to be off slightly and I can only assume that its down to higher modern resolutions. The menus are all really low resolution which is something I don't care for but I guess thats a personal preference. There is also content missing, I was wanting to use the scottish voices but they are not in the steam version along with about 5 others. So you need to download them all and place them in the appropriate directory. Back in 2012 There were promises being made that the game would be updated for modern OS's and key rebinding would be implemented, it's now March 2015 and they haven't lifted a finger so I think it's fair to say they have forgotten about it :(Worms Amageddon was a good game in its day, but the developers just seem to be doing a cash grab putting it on steam in it's original untouched version without optimising or updating it.

												Im not like other people. I don't reccomend this game for many reasons......1. You can't go up curved,wavy slopes2. The chracters move WAY too slowely3. (If you are not patient) you can get frustrated ALOT4. Some teams (If you have no Idea) have OP weapons that can easly destroy your team5. Beginners training can be HARD for beginners!6. If your teammate worms spawn in a bad area it takes a long time trying to get to the enemy!Honestly in my point of view (don't kill me for this) I downright hate this game and think it is overrated for what it is.By all means buy something like freedom planet even though its 15.00$ its still a much better game.

""Remember to use fuse settings.""Honestly, I've always liked the idea of these games, but this is my first time trying one, and it doesn't tell me how to do anything at all. It never tells you how to change fuse settings, nor even how to aim or fire. A tutorial should, at the minimum, assume you have never played the game, nor any like it, nor any game at all. It should be insulting in how little it assumes you know.I would love to play this game, but I don't have the patience to figure everything out on my own in a freaking tutorial that should be telling me how to play. I'm certainly not going to spend the two hours I get before being unable to refund the game figuring out if I can learn how to play the tutorial. Refunding, because a game that costs $15 should definitely have more intuitive controls than use the arrow keys to aim (no WASD at all, from what I could find) and spacebar to fire, or at the very least tell me that instead of me figuring it out by accident.

												As a multiplayer game, Worms Armageddon is absolutely glorious. If you have friends or family willing to play this game with you, it's definitely worth grabbing during a sale. I will say that the controls are very confusing and can be difficult to learn, especially as there is nothing in the way of even a very basic tutorial or instructions screen. Once you do figure out the controls though, you can have a lot of fun with this- in multiplayer mode.As a single-player game, however, it's a completely different animal. It's enjoyable at first, but over time becomes more and more frustrating until it just feels indescribably awful. This is the only game I've ever played where you can claim that the computer cheats and not necessarily be wrong. Just...don't.			"

												I bought this expecting it to be one of the more recent ones like the one on IOS, but it wasn't. It was the other Worms game. I honestly think that the game is dated today, and would only suggest this if you have nostalgia for the classic Worms games. Otherwise, check out the other games in the series on Steam.If you don't like the fact I have no nostalgia for this game and mechanically didn't like it, that's my opinion. Only people who have played this game at the time will like it. If you did, good for you. I didn't.			"

												Worms Armageddon was a fun game in 1999...Today, it's barely playableWithout any option to see the controls or effectively use any weapons in-game, one is left to flail about uselessly in one-on-one matches with a computer opponent that is stacked to the gills with talent and damage-doing abilityRemember those times - back in the day- when you would curse a game for 'cheating' or 'being impossible?"" this game actually does cheat and, while matches against the comp aren't impossible, they are stacked heavily against the human player. Even if the game offered a tutorial so the player could learn to control their worms in battle, It would be tough to play against the computer player which seem to take half as much damage as human-controlled worms.If you can get it for a $.10 or less, enjoy the game...otherwise you should pass on this dated crapheap			"

												This is sadly unplayable on any modern system, Vista onwards. It flickers madly on startup, and if you manage to get into the advanced options to (maybe) fix it by ticking some boxes, you'll find the screen will black out within minutes when you start playing ,and after being forced to kill the program using task manager, the black screen will persist for several seconds each time you click, forcing a restart. Yes that's right, it's so incompatible it cripples your PC even after you stop playing it. DO NOT BUY.			"

To put it bluntly-a lot of weapons, a lot of maps, a lot of custamisation options and a lot of bloodthirsty worms wanting to blast the living hell out of each other.

												I had this game before, several years ago, when I'd play it with my brothers on our old Windows XP PC. This game is just as much fun now as it was back then. It's simple, chaotic, cathartic fun, but with surprising depth when you go below the surface. The worm customization system is nicely in-depth, and while it lacks the more exotic options available in more recent games, such as optional hats and worm skin colours, it makes up for it with team size options of up to 8 worms on a team in combat, although this goes down when you have three or more players simply due to the size of the levels themselves.Also, protip: If you want to stay friends with someone, NEVER play against them on a bridge level. Particularly if said bridges have water under them. There is no quicker way to destroy a friendship.			"

												I have spent many hours playing this game when it was first released. When I found that it was on sale for ~$5 here on Steam, I had to redownload it. It's just as fun now as it was in the late 90s/early 00s. It's a little dated, but still well worth checking out.I'm not sure how it stacks up against newer Worms games, as I have yet to play them. I should check them out.			"

												I distinctly remember playing (and loving) a game on Nickelodeon's website a long time ago called ""This Means War"", which was an artillery game based off of the show Catscratch. It was the only artillery game I had ever played for a long time, so I had no idea that there was a whole genre of it. A friend of mine introduced me to Worms Armageddon, and I have to say, I love it.The best part about Worms is the worms; they have cute animations, they react in hilarious ways to everything, and they feel like their own characters (especially once you put names to them). The gameplay is also fairly solid; there's no randomness, it's all down to strategy and skill. The multiplayer is relatively active for such an old game, but it's definitely best played with friends.Unfortunately, the game does show its age. The UI can be clunky, and the menu resolution (not the in-game resolution, which is fine) stays very low no matter what. If further patches could be made to revamp the UI, or at least remaster it for higher resolutions, it would be spectacular.Worms Armageddon is a classic in the Worms series as well as the artillery genre in general. For anyone looking for a hilarious time, I definitely recommend it.			"

												I can't even begin to estimate how much time in middle school I spent with this one.  I remember taking the CD of this game over to friends' houses, where we'd team up against the computer in the most outlandish scenarios we could think of.  Yes, we'd sometimes kill half our own team with an extremely poorly-planned super banana bomb, but we didn't care.  In this game, the hilarity of mistakes outclassed even the feeling of finally throwing that perfect grenade. It was stupid, perfect fun no matter what happened.Don't just get Armageddon for the nostalgia value, though.  Get it because it's still as great as it was in 1999.  Get because it's still being patched and has a big community behind it even today. Get it because there hasn't been a greater Worms game since.			"

												Game was great when i played it back in school when it was released for PS, and it's great now.Just don't expect much from this game. The singleplayer is pathetic, the graphics are bad, the lag in local area networks is annoying... the only fun that this game gives you, is what you do with your friends with it, but in that regard, it's a 1000 times better party game then anything Nintendo ever made... and i usually love Nintendo stuff...Imagine a turn based game like smash, where everyone got 4 - 6 Nintendo guys, and then you blow each other up with bombs and stuff... (I wish)That's really a genre that could profit from those 20 year old mechanics. While in smash, you just mash buttons and everything is over in no time, without anyone knowing who even killed whom, in Worms, everyone gets to watch every piece of the action. If someone did a realy sneaky move, to do something to you or your other opponent, then you will know it, you will see it, and you will get mad or laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off about it.After the fight, you take a minute to start a new game, and in that minute, your friends and you can actually talk about what happened... people plan revenge... people plot things... Unlike in Smash like games, where after the fight, nobody know who killed whom, and you just start the next game, with again, everyone just mashing buttons, like last rounds...If you are able to play this game locally, or with a voice setup with friends, it's one of the best game that you can quickly bring up and play for a few minutes or hours. Without the social aspect of... you know... trust and betrayal etc... there won't be much fun in this game for you.			"

												Y'all know how the defacto hot seat party game now is Smash? Well at a time just before that the goto one was Worms. If you're an oldbag feeling nostalgic or a newbag that wants novelty it still holds up to this day. There's a bajllion versions now and they're roughly interchangeable, but this one is still the best for its feature:price ratio. Besides the main attraction there's also a plethora of singleplayer missions that are gated behind some tedious skill based challenges, an online lobby that you'll only meet seasoned professionals in (because of the aforementioned diaspora), and a random quickmatch mode against ai opponents if you're someone with no friends.9/10Would use a flying sheep to launch a best mate into explodable crates filled with napalm again.

												This is the best turn-based and strategy game to date, there is a plethora of weapons that all do different things and can be used for different scenerios. If you don't feel like doing the many missions that they have put in the game, you could fight it out with a friend or sibling in the local coop, or maybe you can't find anyone to play with, well then they have various levels of AI to fight on tons of different maps. If you don't like the games rules, make your own! With the map creator and match editor you can help or hinder your opponents by making some weapons unaccessable, or placing a handicap on their team. If you are looking for a great family-friendly game to be able to punch the guy who just handgunned you into the ocean, this is a great game for you!			"

												This is one of the games that defined my childhood. I spent hours upon hours figuring out a multitude of humorous ways to kill little invertebrates. After more than 10 years, I've finally been reunited with this classic game and playing it today feels just as good as back in the day. Don't get me wrong though, nostalgia isn't the only reason I bought this game (again). In my opinion, its one of the most fun turn based strategy games from the late 90's to early 00's and it requires skill to get good at it.			"

Second, the keyboard controls are terrible. The game has no controls tutorial, no list, and no place to re-map them, so it can be a bit much for new comers.			"

												The best Worms game. By far. Classic gameplay, slapstick hilarity, and just... Just... Fun. Endless fun. Especially with multiple friends!The controls might be a bit hard to get used to for newcomers, but don't worry - there are plenty ways to practice them. And after that... The world's your oyster. You can create and customize so many things - voice packs, team flags, gravestones, and even levels! That aspect alone wins the game a lot of points, in my eyes.It's got a ton of replayability. Definitely worth the buy.			"

												This is the best turn-based and strategy game to date, there is a plethora of weapons that all do different things and can be used for different scenerios. If you don't feel like doing the many missions that they have put in the game, you could fight it out with a friend or sibling in the local coop, or maybe you can't find anyone to play with, well then they have various levels of AI to fight on tons of different maps. If you don't like the games rules, make your own! With the map creator and match editor you can help or hinder your opponents by making some weapons unaccessable, or placing a handicap on their team. If you are looking for a great family-friendly game to be able to punch the guy who just handgunned you into the ocean, this is a great game for you!			"

												I haven't played this again since I bought it on steam, but I played a lot of the game back in the day (sigh, I know I'm old). The worms games are a lot of fun all around. They come with good humor, fun gameplay, and enough interesting levels to keep you interested for some time. I've played a few of the games in the series and I have to say, this one feels the most well rounded. Admittedly they've made some cool new advances in subsequent games, but this one just feels right. The weapons, levels, and dialogue all come through very well in this one.I haven't really talked about what type of game this is. Well, you get a team of worms and you blow up another team of worms, funny dialogue and cool weapons ensue. I'm sure most people already know what the worms games are all about anyway. I'd recommend any of them, but this one is at the top of the list.			"

												This is, by far, the best Worms game in the series. Forget chunky 3D gameplay, forget worm ""classes"" and forget needless DLC. Just bask in the chaos of the late 90s, where game developers knew how to keep it real and give you something respectable.This game is frustrating, unfair and chaotic....but that's what makes it so fun to play. This game drops a Concrete Donkey on games that spend too much time holding your hand, giving you cakewalk tutorials and play-it-safe stories and characters. They're worms with bazookas killing each other on crazy♥♥♥♥♥psychadelic battlefields. It doesn't need to make any sense!			"

												Ah, games of old making their way on Steam. I've been wanting to get this one again since ages, though, as my old CD ended up being badly gnawed upon by the teeth of time. Worms Armageddon opens up an old can of worms full of fun, madness and exploding things that were probably never meant to do so. Use crazy weapons against your friends in epic multiplayer rounds, practice your skills and unlock new options with various missions, and experience the frustration of the dreaded Eiffel Tower mission once more.. and again, and again...It's a cult classic, and especially recommended when on sale.

												This is one of my favorite strategy series of all time. I played a version on the PSP and loved it, so naturally I wanted to try out more. This game was made a bit ago, so be warned there are a few nuances that may hinder the experience. First and foremost, this game has no controller support what so ever. Second, the keyboard controls are terrible. The game has no controls tutorial, no list, and no place to re-map them, so it can be a bit much for new comers.			"

												The best worms game.The Worms franchise is a very good idea executed very similarly over and over again. You have a bunch of cute little worms, with cute little physics-based weapons (well, sometimes they're not so little), trying to destroy each other. It's brilliant because it's ridiculously fun for both casual and hardcore gamers. The hardcore gamers get their kicks from practising their technique until they become unstoppably accurate with all their shots, whereas the causal gamers simply enjoy the trial-and-error fun of shooting bazookas at each other.That's the entire Worms franchise. All the Worms games are more or less like this: quality games that are more or less interchangeable. That being said, I would have to say that Worms Armageddon is the best Worms game so far. It has a wide variety of weaponry, a huge capacity for customisation (although you need to beat the game to get the full options), very accessible level editor, interesting missions, training that is actually fun, as well as a ""deathmatch"" mode that is fun, intense, and has never since been replicated.Although these are petty concerns, where WA falls short is in two respects: a slight lack of help in how to play the game, and in its online community. I found that, when I first played WA (when it came out), it was difficult to figure out all the little controls. There are two jump buttons, and pressing or double pressing produces different jumps, which was confusing at first. Also, customising grenades, such as changing the fuse time or making them bouncy, was never clearly explained. If you buy this game, consult the following page:http://wormsarmageddon.team17.com/main.html?page=abou&area=contMost of the necessary controls you can pick up in the game, but the page is a useful reference when you really want to nail down your grenade shots or your ninja roping.The other problem, as I mentioned, was the online community. When last I checked, WA had an entrenched and hostile online community, where the standard was absurdly high, and anyone not of this standard was abused and/or dropped from games. But, so long as you play with friends, this shouldn't be a problem.			"

												Seriously, the best worms game of them all. Suprisingly this game is still being updated and plays pretty well on large modern lcd monitors. -Just what you need to see all the action at once. Though the menus are still a little pixalated.It generally goes downhill in the series from here, especially when there is a focus on 3d gameplay. But some are okay. Worms world party comes in close at second for that classic worms artillery style gameplay, gone nuts.			"

												I can't even begin to estimate how much time in middle school I spent with this one.  I remember taking the CD of this game over to friends' houses, where we'd team up against the computer in the most outlandish scenarios we could think of.  Yes, we'd sometimes kill half our own team with an extremely poorly-planned super banana bomb, but we didn't care.  In this game, the hilarity of mistakes outclassed even the feeling of finally throwing that perfect grenade. It was stupid, perfect fun no matter what happened.Don't just get Armageddon for the nostalgia value, though.  Get it because it's still as great as it was in 1999.  Get because it's still being patched and has a big community behind it even today. Get it because there hasn't been a greater Worms game since.			"

												I distinctly remember playing (and loving) a game on Nickelodeon's website a long time ago called ""This Means War"", which was an artillery game based off of the show Catscratch. It was the only artillery game I had ever played for a long time, so I had no idea that there was a whole genre of it. A friend of mine introduced me to Worms Armageddon, and I have to say, I love it.The best part about Worms is the worms; they have cute animations, they react in hilarious ways to everything, and they feel like their own characters (especially once you put names to them). The gameplay is also fairly solid; there's no randomness, it's all down to strategy and skill. The multiplayer is relatively active for such an old game, but it's definitely best played with friends.Unfortunately, the game does show its age. The UI can be clunky, and the menu resolution (not the in-game resolution, which is fine) stays very low no matter what. If further patches could be made to revamp the UI, or at least remaster it for higher resolutions, it would be spectacular.Worms Armageddon is a classic in the Worms series as well as the artillery genre in general. For anyone looking for a hilarious time, I definitely recommend it.			"

I've owned this on the PS1, a very old PC and now on steam. It still holds up strong, even today. The single player aspect of it is really only a fraction of how good this is to play with people. If you and your friends need a new game to play, buy this and install Hamachi. It doesn't get old quickly and there is still a community behind this game, that's how good it is. Go download some game modes. I recommend shopper. You can even make and import your own maps into it. Don't go without playing this truly great classic, you'll make Team 17 cry.			"

												I had this game before, several years ago, when I'd play it with my brothers on our old Windows XP PC. This game is just as much fun now as it was back then. It's simple, chaotic, cathartic fun, but with surprising depth when you go below the surface. The worm customization system is nicely in-depth, and while it lacks the more exotic options available in more recent games, such as optional hats and worm skin colours, it makes up for it with team size options of up to 8 worms on a team in combat, although this goes down when you have three or more players simply due to the size of the levels themselves.Also, protip: If you want to stay friends with someone, NEVER play against them on a bridge level. Particularly if said bridges have water under them. There is no quicker way to destroy a friendship.			"

												This game brings back a lot of childhood memories. Being re-united with what is arguably the best Worms game in the series is a fantastic feeling for a nostalgia junkie like me. But aside from nostalgia, the game itself has never failed to impress me.The turn based gameplay means that every battle is unpredictable. Even if you're a veteran to the series, it's impossible to determine what might happen next. The sense of unknown with each battle keeps me coming back. The AI isn't the best in the world, but that's arguably a good thing, because it means they are prone to mistakes. And when they do make mistakes, the outcome is often hilarious. It compliments the witty charm of the game.I love games that you can make your own and Worms Armagdedon is no exception. There are tons of ways to customize your team. The best part is undoubtably the wide range of voices you can apply. My personal favourites for general banter are the 'Danish Pyrus' and the 'Soul Man' voices, but there are countless others which you a bound to find at least mildly amusing.Why is Armageddon the best in the series? It gets it right off the bat. The interface is fluent, the visual style is the most memorable. The sounds are on point and the overall gameplay is smooth and straight forward. Plus, I've always believed that the selection of weapons in Armageddon has been better than the rest.If you're thinking of getting into the Worms franchise, I highly recommend getting this one first. As far as I'm concerned, its the most comprehensive of all Worms games. It's funny, its well paced and its very addictive. Plus, people like me who have potatoes for operating systems need not worry about hardware upgrades or any of that nonsense. Just install it and play to your hearts content.Above all, this game has not aged in the slightest since its 1999 release, and that's extremely rare. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece. It gets a 10/10 from me. It is one of THE very best games I have ever played.			"

												All of the 2-dimensional classic Worms 2 and more in an online death bundle you don't want to miss.Maybe not as sophisticated as its 3D brothers, yet the classic design is full of win.It's simple: you have guns, you shoot worms. Weeks of gaming guaranteed!The delay between an action and its effects on the other players' game could be considered as a flaw, a bit painful in a LAN party when you hear your friend's reaction before you see what actually happened. Yet, just a little con against an air strike of pros!			"

												This game seemingly created a genre. Over a dozen years later it has not even aged that badly - infact some argue the game is more playable than ever. I am not one of those people though; while the game made the series a staple it lacks a lot of polish that modern 'worms-like' games have. Mentioning those, every single worms game worth a ♥♥♥♥ing quid that has come after this game has tried, but mostly not succeeded at recreating the magic that makes this game so great. In short, if you grew up with this game play it, if not, there are newer (clan wars) better worms like games to tackle. Oh, and my favorite item is and will always be the sheep. It's so classic.			"

												This is truly the definitive Worms title. This game, which, other than World Party, was the last good Worms game, contains more weapons and enjoyability than all the new games combined. And for the haters crying ""why is there no customization?"" there is tons of it! You can customize yourself with an auto-tuned death cry, a flag, a tombstone, a team name, and your 8-worm team of soldiers with names you choose. ""No hats?"" I hear you crying, who in the hell cares? Just get your head out of the dirt and dodge this well-placed air strike. ""Bad graphics"" my♥♥♥♥♥ this thing looks better than having a worm with a water baloon for a  head ""Revolution I'm looking at you."" I think I'm done ranting now. Just buy a couple copies with your friends and have some bloody good fun, with all the exploding sheep you'll ever want.			"

I've owned this on the PS1, a very old PC and now on steam. It still holds up strong, even today. The single player aspect of it is really only a fraction of how good this is to play with people. If you and your friends need a new game to play, buy this and install Hamachi. It doesn't get old quickly and there is still a community behind this game, that's how good it is. Go download some game modes. I recommend shopper. You can even make and import your own maps into it. Don't go without playing this truly great classic, you'll make Team 17 cry.			"

												I used to play this game alot when i was a kid back around like 1999 or so. It is one of the best worms games i have ever played back then and i think it still is so far..or atleast the best 2D Worms game made. The controls might be a bit weird in the beginning (considering I had to learn back the basics but thank god for a tutorial that is in the game in the form of ''basic training'') but after that it felt all nostalgic to me. Furthermore it has also something what i didn't had back then which was online multiplayer. It is definately fun tho local multiplayer is also fun as hell (because you can annoy your little brother by ''accidentally'' pressing the spacebar when he has a Bazooka on his hands). Another Fun feature this game has takes a little bit of time in searching in your local data but there is a map in the folders named Bank Editor. This is software which allows you to put vocals in it as a voicebank for your Worms.In short:- Relatively easy to play (or otherwhise some tutorials which are good)- Iconic weapons as a Banana Bomb and Holy Hand Grenade- Good old random fun""- (Online) Multiplayer-editable voicebanks so costumazation is possible- old nostalgic feeling- wide array of weaponary			"

												Worms Armageddon is the best Worms game ever released, and will probably remain to be the best Worms game. Playing this game back in '98 with the Nintendo 64 brings back found memories, and having Worms Armagaddon released on steam gives what the 90's version had and more with its online multiplayer. I had lots of fun both with singleplayer and multiplayer, more fun then I had then many other multiplayer games I play. What really makes this the best Worms game is it's tight controls, large arsenal, lots of settings, fun and bright graphics, and enjoyable sound and music. If you are to get any Worms game, you should definitely get this one, and with its moderate sized, yet enthusiastic community, you'll have alot of fun.			"

												This is one of the few games I've played where, even if you lose horribly, you'll be laughing at yourself rather than raging. If you've never had a bazooka shot accidentally knock a mine into one of your worms, causing a cascade that blasts your entire team off the map, then you haven't truly lived. And doing the same kind of thing to your opponent will make you feel like an omnipotent golden god.			"

												Well after over 15 Years i assume it is the right time to make a long term opinion of the game.  The price of the game speaks for itself. It still hasnt reached the lowes budget junkyard.... and that after over 15 years (!). Try finding just ONE other game which also made it this far. I mean the game is older than steam and still on times costs more than cs. But now enough advertising.Graphics: Seriously i believe those worms are pretty done for. they dont look too happy but thats not why they enter the arena. The come to nuke the enemy with all they can get their hands on.Gameplay: Fight em with all you got. Donkeys, grandmas, cows or even bananas. Buy the game. you wont regret it. The single player is great and the multiplayer still works great ... even after 15 years.			"

												At the time of writing, it says I've clocked 150 hours on this game. That fails to account for the hundreds of hours I spent playing this when I owned a hard copy on disk.Team 17 continues to pump out Worms titles, but to this day they still have not managed to top this one. The perfect blend of gameplay, aesthetics, physics, and humour make this the best Worms in my book by far. It's not an easy game to succeed at, but the comical nature of the game's failures helps to take the sting out of it. You'd think that after watching Druss giggle like a maniac as he crawls away from the stick of dynamite he dropped on Uncle Rory's head and his ensuing cry of terror when it's about to explode for the 100th time that it might get old, yet it never does.

												Still the best game developed by Team 17. Timeless classic. Do not ever buy, Team 17's Worms World Party Remastered. I think that title is such a disgrace that even not allowed to be sold in Steam. Anyways community still prefers this one. Also before they release WWP Remastered, this game already had the features like hd visiuals, compability with new systems, wide game settings offered by WWP Remastered, thanks to its devoted community modders.You can't play online if you buy WWP Remastered, because they ♥♥♥♥ed the NetCode up.I wish this game had controller support and Wormpots though.

												A timeless classic; one that I've only recently purchased on Steam, but have many fond memories of this title from my younger years. The excitement of punching a worm into the sea or landing the perfect Holy Hand Grenade is just as great as it was on day 1.Mechanically, Worms Armageddon is superb. The sprite and turn based combat lends itself to tactical thinking as well as precise aiming considering wind speed and direction. A touch of luck helps; a handy drop could change the game. The worms are charismatic and funny, and have obscene gestures and tombstones. Many hours were spent in the multiplayer, sabotaging friends and foes alike.			"

												I can't even begin to estimate how much time in middle school I spent with this one.  I remember taking the CD of this game over to friends' houses, where we'd team up against the computer in the most outlandish scenarios we could think of.  Yes, we'd sometimes kill half our own team with an extremely poorly-planned super banana bomb, but we didn't care.  In this game, the hilarity of mistakes outclassed even the feeling of finally throwing that perfect grenade. It was stupid, perfect fun no matter what happened.Don't just get Armageddon for the nostalgia value, though.  Get it because it's still as great as it was in 1999.  Get because it's still being patched and has a big community behind it even today. Get it because there hasn't been a greater Worms game since.			"

												This is, by far, the best Worms game in the series. Forget chunky 3D gameplay, forget worm ""classes"" and forget needless DLC.

												I haven't played this again since I bought it on steam, but I played a lot of the game back in the day (sigh, I know I'm old). The worms games are a lot of fun all around. They come with good humor, fun gameplay, and enough interesting levels to keep you interested for some time. I've played a few of the games in the series and I have to say, this one feels the most well rounded. Admittedly they've made some cool new advances in subsequent games, but this one just feels right. The weapons, levels, and dialogue all come through very well in this one.I haven't really talked about what type of game this is. Well, you get a team of worms and you blow up another team of worms, funny dialogue and cool weapons ensue. I'm sure most people already know what the worms games are all about anyway. I'd recommend any of them, but this one is at the top of the list.			"

												Worms Armageddon is the best Worms game ever released, and will probably remain to be the best Worms game. Playing this game back in '98 with the Nintendo 64 brings back found memories, and having Worms Armagaddon released on steam gives what the 90's version had and more with its online multiplayer. I had lots of fun both with singleplayer and multiplayer, more fun then I had then many other multiplayer games I play. What really makes this the best Worms game is it's tight controls, large arsenal, lots of settings, fun and bright graphics, and enjoyable sound and music. If you are to get any Worms game, you should definitely get this one, and with its moderate sized, yet enthusiastic community, you'll have alot of fun.			"

												AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWHYEAH, IMO still the best Worms game in the series. We've gone from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old school to worms2, which introduced the ""new"" fat worms like we know them. It was awesome but not perfect... But then ARMAGEDDON was upon us and it was the best thing EVER. World party was also fun, but was mostly more of the same with less of an online community. The release after that was Worms 3D and was not that good... all other 3D ones weren't that much better. When the series returned to its roots with Reloaded there as hope, but it just wasn't that great... the ones after it haven't improved. Worms Armageddon is still the pinacle of the series and still has an awesome and strong going community supporting the game. There are still patches being made and matches being played, I mean how awesome is that? The game is more than 14 years old, but really it's timeless. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to relive childhood memories and kill worms that I named after people I despise <3It stood the test of time			"

												One of my all-time favorite hot seat, party games. Turn based, strategic fighting where you play as cutesy worms with deadly weapons. Play defensively and watch as your friends take each other out, or go on the offense and kill your buddies one by one. There's traditional weapons like a bazooka or a shotgun, and wacky items like an exploding, poisonous grandma and the Holy Hand Grenade.Definitely worth the price.			"

												This game brings back a lot of childhood memories. Being re-united with what is arguably the best Worms game in the series is a fantastic feeling for a nostalgia junkie like me. But aside from nostalgia, the game itself has never failed to impress me.The turn based gameplay means that every battle is unpredictable. Even if you're a veteran to the series, it's impossible to determine what might happen next. The sense of unknown with each battle keeps me coming back. The AI isn't the best in the world, but that's arguably a good thing, because it means they are prone to mistakes. And when they do make mistakes, the outcome is often hilarious. It compliments the witty charm of the game.I love games that you can make your own and Worms Armagdedon is no exception. There are tons of ways to customize your team. The best part is undoubtably the wide range of voices you can apply. My personal favourites for general banter are the 'Danish Pyrus' and the 'Soul Man' voices, but there are countless others which you a bound to find at least mildly amusing.Why is Armageddon the best in the series? It gets it right off the bat. The interface is fluent, the visual style is the most memorable. The sounds are on point and the overall gameplay is smooth and straight forward. Plus, I've always believed that the selection of weapons in Armageddon has been better than the rest.If you're thinking of getting into the Worms franchise, I highly recommend getting this one first. As far as I'm concerned, its the most comprehensive of all Worms games. It's funny, its well paced and its very addictive. Plus, people like me who have potatoes for operating systems need not worry about hardware upgrades or any of that nonsense. Just install it and play to your hearts content.Above all, this game has not aged in the slightest since its 1999 release, and that's extremely rare. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece. It gets a 10/10 from me. It is one of THE very best games I have ever played.			"

												At the time of writing, it says I've clocked 150 hours on this game. That fails to account for the hundreds of hours I spent playing this when I owned a hard copy on disk.Team 17 continues to pump out Worms titles, but to this day they still have not managed to top this one. The perfect blend of gameplay, aesthetics, physics, and humour make this the best Worms in my book by far. It's not an easy game to succeed at, but the comical nature of the game's failures helps to take the sting out of it. You'd think that after watching Druss giggle like a maniac as he crawls away from the stick of dynamite he dropped on Uncle Rory's head and his ensuing cry of terror when it's about to explode for the 100th time that it might get old, yet it never does.

												A timeless classic; one that I've only recently purchased on Steam, but have many fond memories of this title from my younger years. The excitement of punching a worm into the sea or landing the perfect Holy Hand Grenade is just as great as it was on day 1.Mechanically, Worms Armageddon is superb. The sprite and turn based combat lends itself to tactical thinking as well as precise aiming considering wind speed and direction. A touch of luck helps; a handy drop could change the game. The worms are charismatic and funny, and have obscene gestures and tombstones. Many hours were spent in the multiplayer, sabotaging friends and foes alike.			"

												Probably the last worms game in it's origin game play idea, where you get points for making multiplayer matches against the KI or yourself, where you could use LAN / internet connection to play with friends or random people, although this wasn't what the game was focused on. Here was the focus on solo player missions, trainings and deathmatches. Things like clan wars, 3D graphics and other additional things, like buying your worms costumes, weren't implemented and the worms were really ""cute"" not like Team 17 is doing them now.

Great portThis is a Worms game to have. ►Not simply upscaled, but definitely improved graphics that look perfect on a 1080p monitor. ►Multiplayer that is very well alive - always someone to play with.►Very reasonable price, especially when you grab this on sale.The only thing I'd love to see added is achievements, but overall this is a great classic that still holds up to this day. 9/10 "

												Great game. In fact, it's the best Worms game to date because it has the most content and attention to detail. The newer ones currently traded a few weapons, tools and customizables for better graphics and physics. Worms Armageddon is a turn-based, 2D competitive game that will not disappoint, but be warned, this is a game that came out in 1999 so it's a bit dated and this pc port does not cooperate with certain hardware and operating systems. For example, I had to get a refund because it was not optimized for my widescreen display and it would constantly think my Windows 10 os was WIndows 8 and ask me if it could change some permissions in order to run properly. I will recommend this game for those who can play it properly, though, for it is my favorite Worms game and one of my favorite Playstation 1 games.			"

The genre is stretched paper thin now with a plethora of terrible games, most feeling like an Armageddon clone. WWP was a nice addition, but it might as well have been an expansion pack.Worms Armageddon is timeless and has infinite replayability. Optional variations such as level design and customizable rulesets enable this game to compete with new releases.

												Well after over 15 Years i assume it is the right time to make a long term opinion of the game.  The price of the game speaks for itself. It still hasnt reached the lowes budget junkyard.... and that after over 15 years (!). Try finding just ONE other game which also made it this far. I mean the game is older than steam and still on times costs more than cs. But now enough advertising.Graphics: Seriously i believe those worms are pretty done for. they dont look too happy but thats not why they enter the arena. The come to nuke the enemy with all they can get their hands on.Gameplay: Fight em with all you got. Donkeys, grandmas, cows or even bananas. Buy the game. you wont regret it. The single player is great and the multiplayer still works great ... even after 15 years.			"

												Years ago, my brothers and I would play this on our N64.  It was one of the most entertaining things ever.  My brother bought it for me this year for Christmas, and after playing it again after all these years, it really holds up.  It's better then the newer ones, such as Reloaded.  And now that it has internet multiplayer, it's even better.			"

												This is one of the few games I've played where, even if you lose horribly, you'll be laughing at yourself rather than raging. If you've never had a bazooka shot accidentally knock a mine into one of your worms, causing a cascade that blasts your entire team off the map, then you haven't truly lived. And doing the same kind of thing to your opponent will make you feel like an omnipotent golden god.			"

It's amazing that this game is still going (and being updated) almost 20 years after it's first release. And the online multiplayer even still works. "

												Probably the last worms game in it's origin game play idea, where you get points for making multiplayer matches against the KI or yourself, where you could use LAN / internet connection to play with friends or random people, although this wasn't what the game was focused on. Here was the focus on solo player missions, trainings and deathmatches. Things like clan wars, 3D graphics and other additional things, like buying your worms costumes, weren't implemented and the worms were really ""cute"" not like Team 17 is doing them now. Those were the times.			"

												This is game made Worms a classic and there's a reason for it. None of the newer games have reached the level of gameplay this one achieved. There's something addictive in it that cannot be explained. It's so intuitive, easy to understand,which allows any member of my family to play and enjoy it. It also has a reward for experienced users, but still anyone can play it.On the ther hand, I hope Steam gives Worms Armageddon a Steam Workshop or Steam functionalities because, right now, to customize the game you have to surf the web, and there's not that many options available.

												This is an old-school classic, I had this on the N64 -- one of my all time favs. There is a ton of fun to have as a newcomer, plenty of single-player and multi-player laughs to be had. There is also a deep-rooted community that still plays online today, on a competitive level, and in different ways. There are rope-swing pros, tunnel-fighting pros, classic style pros, shotgun/pachinko pros, and the list goes on.I would say this is the definitive worms title, definitely worth checking out even in 2017, anything newer seems like fluff to me (though I still like the newer titles for the most part too).
