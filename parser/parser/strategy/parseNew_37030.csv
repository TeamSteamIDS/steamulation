												UFO: Extraterrestrials GoldBackground:Purchased as part of a bundle from Bundle Stars. I played X-Com so many times when I was in University and completed it and Terror from the Deep at least once. Played this for over 20 hours.Impressions:So much nostalgia. UFO really captures everything about the original X-Com game perfectly and with updated graphics to match modern displays but many of the graphics look unpolished but functional. But that's not where the heart of UFO is.. it's in the strategic management of cash, research, building, manufacturing, expanding and alien hunting.As ever the missions are the best part: shoot down a UFO over land you get to send your team on a mission to slay/stun the invaders and bring back their technology, corpses and the occasional live specimen for your own probing experimentation... then it's back to base to research and re-equip.I had a lot of nostalgic fun with the game and while the weak graphics do jar the game mechanics are as solid and fun as ever.The Bman mod is included and it's well worth tinkering with the well annotated mods before you start playing. There is a temptation to make the game really easy (and the mod will let you make things a lot simpler.. giving more cash and stats for missions, etc.) but if you try some moderate tweaks you'll find the game remains a lot of fun while making progress easier. I recommend playing the game untweaked till you learn the ropes and then start a new game with the tweaks that make it fun for you.The Good:*Recaptures the feel of the original X-Com game all too well.*Lots to buy and equip.*Missions are really fun and get more so as you level up.*Renaming and equipping troops makes a squad to be proud of.*Random base missions are fun and add extra drama.*Lots of replay value.*Can save at almost any time.The Bad:*No tutorial: using med packs was really confusing until i googled it.*Visuals are sometimes under whelming.*Slow loading of sector map on missions.*Slow processing of alien moves when out of line of sight.*Obtaining and identifying Commanders is really tough without a mod tweak.*Some aliens are invisible to some marines (when floating over rocks).*Feels really dated, which works for fans of the original.*Grenades can feel overpowered.*Saves are too useful for avoiding heavy losses that are hard to come back from.Recommended for:Lovers of the first 2 X-Com games. Sci-fi fans who like their aliens unfriendly and their humans just as violent. Fans of strategy games will have something to get into here too.Conclusion.7/10. Huge fun once you get past the visuals and start to enjoy the strategy and base management  elements.			"

												This is an amazing UFO: Enemy Unknown remake. The Gold edition (Lite Bman's mod) made the vanilla version a much better game. If possible install the Full version of Bman's mod to fix some bugs and add some extra content (sounds and original xcom aliens) to the game. There's also a great mod to the game called Grayfiend's Unimod that improves the graphics details, adds new gameplay mechanics, adds the ability to play on Earth, improves the tactical maps randomization, etc.			"

												This game feels like an attempt to improve the good old X-com series (Which franky I liked quite a lot). Honestly, I played it through only once and I found it quite enjoyable, but I believe this will mostly apply to people who loved the old series.It sports the same old train-your-troops, go to turn based battles which makes this this genre unique, however I found the difficulty somewhat unbalanced at points (too easy or damn hard).All in all, I recommend the game for fans to kill time until you go and play the newer xcom series.

												I highly recommend this if you liked the original XCOM games!  I see this game as a more true spiritual successor to XCOM: Ufo Defense (otherwise known as UFO: Enemy Unknown in Australia), and XCOM: Terror from the Deep.  It's not just lasers and plasma, but there are multiple levels to alien tech - and the humans, once they have researched them all, come up with their own one, which is even better.  Aliens get progressively more difficult, which makes a really long campaign really challenging and rewarding once you get to the end.  I just found the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown was a bit short, and much more cinematic - great game on its own right, but not really a spiritual successor to the original XCOM games			"

												MOST UNDERRATED STEAM GAME I HAVE PLAYED This game is in many ways the best 'X-COM' type game.  It has more variety and more interesting aliens than the original.  It has a longer, more detailed research tree.  You have to earn promotions more; especially for the officer ranks.  The graphics and sounds are much better.  With the mods - the aliens can also be much sneakier.  And the air intercept missions are better than any X-Com game, except maybye Apocolyspse.  Only drawback, this agme crashes a LOT.  (Usually right after a mission or during mission prep screens.  Save a lot).  If you can find this game on sale, you owe to yourself to buy it.			"

												Not sure why but this seems to be ignored by most XCOM fans, although it is a quite good and fairly modern version of the originals. Of course now that the new 3D remake is available this may seem obsolete and it still suffers from a few bugs, but if you are in the mood it still can be fun to play through at least once. The game plays well, the visuals are nothing special but look good still and the gameplay (both the combat and the base management) is fluid and flawless.			"

												Playthrough on hard.+ Deep research Tree+ Decent combat+ Loads of alien types- The english and grammar is the worst I have ever seen in a game- Some text elements do not fit on the UI properly: Names and descriptions- The bee keeper 2 armour is brown in the equip screen but green in combat- If more than one soldier reacts to an alien but it dies with the first soldier shooting the other soldiers waste their reaction shooting nothing- If the second or third shot in an auto shot would fire where there is no line of sight it stops the attack completely- Mind shield has no description of how to actually use it- The Cruiser ship type barely has an appearance before the enemy start spamming heavier ships- Defences can be completely destroyed in one hit, not disabled and can take up to 40 days to build, in which time you can get attacked multiple times- The only ships to attack bases are battleships, which can spawn right next to the base they are going to attack giving you no chance to shoot it down first.- Base defences are weak.- On terror missions, very poor enemy and civilian placement means most civilians die on the first turn. (An in game item lets you see this)- Ships need an instant return distance around bases because they sometimes spin around a lot before entering them.- Reaction shots should NOT BE AUTOSHOTS.			"

												This game comes with the btmod and i like how it played.  Problem is after awhile it begins to be very easy.  I have found another mod using Unimod http://ufogr.com/ which is the best mod i think for this game.   The one thing it changes is the air battle is now difficult - aliens are no pushover (which realistically should not be).  Overall this game for me is 10/10 for xcom fans who want to relive the classic XCOM.  I have played the new XCOM but this game with Unimod in my opinion is a much better gaming strategy overall.  The new XCOM is like too much eyecandy... too little strategy.			"

												If you can look past the many small flaws and anti-climactic ending, UFO: Extraterrestrials is still a very solid game following in the footsteps of X-com.Sadly, the good parts of the game are overshadowed by the many small flaws, some of which make certain items close to useless. It may also crash at times, but this will not hurt your progress if you save often.Again, sadly, the variation in enemies leaves something to be desired. There may be a lot of aliens to fight, but the completely random decision of which aliens you end up fighting means that you will see all of them in short succession, and then you will always know what is coming for the rest of the game. While it is nothing too special and doesn't bring anything new to the genre, it's still worth your time and money if you enjoy(ed) X-com and similar games.			"

												SPOILER for FINAL MISSIONS:Wasted alot of time on this game preparing my elite force to enter the battle for earth. Build up piles of ammo for my ftl flagship since it can hold a whole crew and all that (storage area on board). Game says GO EFFFF YOURSELF YOU LITTLE Sh!t! No one gets out in space with this amount of ammo. WOW... you scavenge the whole wide world for alien tech, painstakingly turn recruits into brave warriors with the accuracy of an aimbot, provide them with insane amounts of ammo which btw get emptied if they happen to be less than 70% full (that means even if you got 2 full clips and waste 3 burst fire rounds in a mission the clip will magically disappear) just to learn that your final battle will be between a bunch of lieutenants without any reserves whatsoever. And SURPRISE! the earthlings that had an underground resistance base and happen to be in possession of a security device CAN'T even spare a few EFFFFING GUNS or BULLETS for your sorry♥♥♥♥♥let alone a few technicians that could recharge the godDAMP clips you brought over from Esperanza (that weird♥♥♥♥♥colony planet far off in space which could not be reached without a ftl ship but somehow has a planetary infrastructure on par with earth and enough population to  support your secret organization to fight against aliens... WHO THE MOTHER OF GOD came up with this braindead idea?)Anyway: If you want an Xcom experience that is on par with the classic Xcom look no further. It is classic frustrating Xcom from the beginning trough the end. Especially when end game is limiting your options and way of approach to a handful of equipped soldiers with half of them serving as mules overloaded with ammunition and medpacks and you can even take with you 2 weapon platforms (hover tanks) which OH WONDER never run out of refills back at base ... wonder why the hell my men cannot just charge up their guns on that magic BLACK HOLE energy syphon inside my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flying fortress then!!!!! AAAAARGH the ♥♥♥♥♥ing unholy unlogic is worse than losing all your men because at least you can farm alien ufos to rebuild your roster. Simply being FORCED to leave behind your overpowered squad because the game won't allow you to load up on supplys ... whose idea was it to design the missions like that, the magazine capacity bugs and the god forsaken not existing ship loadout. You have to kill every alien on screen, that means at least one guy will have to empty his clip and reload probably wasting another clip due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unrealistic discharge at end of each round. That means I have to go trough lots of missions plus mother ship with handful of clips and the magic tanks that are as durable as a boat folded out of paper thrown into a lake of fire... and these fkers are too big to navigate most of the end game stages since they have small corridors and doors. You'd have to spam grenades just to open the map up for the tanks since the alien a-holes won't rush your position like they used to back on esperanza. Case in point: You can transfer a lot of stuff from base to base except of course transporters and equipment for soldiers but for crying out loud. Could the flagship turned into a mini base be listed in the base menu so that I can throw all the stuff I have that way? Or better yet... automatically take everything stored in main base WITH YOU on the last couple of missions... ship is big enough.Everything else is just dandy. Overworld air to air combat is fun, you can anihilate anything that comes your way with a powerful squadron (just don't build Nightwolfs... they are expensive and take much less abuse then other interceptors even with the best shields, replace your outdated ships with Exterminators and JAG D1 superiority fighters late game to deal with the retaliation squads).And of course: DON'T build lot's of hangars at main base. Waste all you have on labs, and workshops to support yourself with manufactured superior weapons since every time you advance in technology the aliens will throw something at you that has thicker armor, higher damage and range and of course max HP.Sometimes there are UFO swarms (once a year I guess). That should be farmed for invaluable alien tech. Shot down the fleet commander, deploy troops and get that booty. If you happen to find an alien life form scanner consider the game beat. It shows you where aliens are located on all layers of the map. Simply ambush them and proceed to advance your tech. Oh and don't bother with most of the mechanized units except cobra and hammer (end game). Better off boosting your exp for soldiers then wasting it for the most unrealistic units in the whole game. That's right: Humans and aliens are more durable than armored tanks and shielded mini ufos... FK LOGIC this is XCOM.			"

												Not a bad game but all UFO like the 1st give you soldiers who worth nothing at fight. Thx to Bman to build more option to decrease aliens AI. Because when you start aliens hit you all time for sure & your stupid soldiers aren't able to do their job : hit with success. I don't believe that.

												UFO: Extraterrestrials GOLD is a new GOLD edition which includes a number of changes and improvements giving a player a new look on the classic game: new maps, possibility to hire soldiers, globe UFO swarms and configurability. UFO: Extraterrestrials GOLD represents fiction in which the human race faces a threat from space, aimed to be a spiritual sequel developed by Chaos Concept. The game picks up where the original left off, incorporating a twist of the aliens defeating Earth. The game is set on a newly colonized planet named Esperanza, where the alien threat has just arrived.			"

												First of all my hrs on record is that low b/c I mostly played this game in offline mode when my Internets weren't really working.So now that that's outta the way, I'll keep it short and simple:If you like the old x-com games (UFO Defense, TFTD, Apocalypse), Xenonauts or UFO:AI,I can holeheartedly recommend this game to you.It's not as polished as the aforementioned, but still worth your time and money (especially when on sale)Also it's now perfectly playable seeing as it is the gold version ( the old version was meh), I still highly recommend the mod from Grayfiend over yonder: http://ufogr.com/en/install/It really adds a lot of options, including old x-com enemies, or playing on earth for that matter.This kicks up the replayability up a bunch, because you have so much options to toy around with and turn this in your very own adventure/invasion.On thing to note is, that only your main base can sport troops etc, the others are mainly for detection.You should keep that in mind when constructing your main base. Threw me off the first time I played this way back in the days.Also the graphics are not everyone's cup of tea, so if you don't like 'em don't let that be the deciding factor, as the gameplay is solid.Summa summarum,this is a ton of fun even if it's the worst of my personal big 3 X-com clones ( Xenonauts, UFO:AI and this-a-here)!TL;DR:-for fans of the old x-coms this is a safe buy and worth every penny (even more so if on sale-only main base has troops etc, others mainly for detection-I recommend getting Grayfiend's mod over yonder: http://ufogr.com/en/install/  acause it makes it even more customizable and fun (and for the old veterans: lets you play on earth			"
