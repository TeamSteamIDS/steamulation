												Very fun first person shooter/real time strategy game crossover. The objective is to destroy all enemy bases.It is Aliens vs. Marines, each side has unique controls, weapons, and strategies.Each player has a first person view, and each team has 1 commander who has a top down view like a real time strategy game, directing the players on the field and giving them support and supplies when needed.A person should first understand the game and all units and structures, learn basic strategy, and play the game for a week or so before attempting to play as the commander.A mic silent game of Natural selection 2 is not a good thing. A player should always speak up if they want an upgrade from the commander, or see an opening for an attack. Do not stay silent and assume your commander or other players see what you see. The more information you share with your team, the better. I have seen countless matches where a team has control of almost all of the map, but end up losing, because they think that they've already won and don't need to communicate anymore. Slowly, the enemy team just wins all the fights and takes back the entire map.This game also has good mod support, with some nice alternative game types, including one similar to gungame from counterstrike, where you simply try to destroy the enemy base, and you get upgrades and get better lifeforms through spending points. You get those points by killing enemies.This game has a learning curve, you can't just jump in and start winning. It will take a lot of practice before you become good.If you were thinking about buying it, you should definitely go for it. If you stick to the game past the learning curve, you will have loads of fun. Plus, the developers are still supporting it with free, very frequent updates, with new content such as new units and weapons, bug fixes and better optimization.			"

												A missed opportunity.  That's all I can call it.  NS2 isn't a bad game.  In fact, despite not personally recommending it, I still think it is a good game.  The problem is that it isn't a game I can recommend to others.  If you look at my hours I'm not someone who hasn't given the game a chance.  In fact, I beta tested the original NS1 mod.   When NS2 was announced and they asked for help to fund it, I purchased a few copies of Zen of Sudoku (another game they produced).  Then, when they were near finished NS2, I pre-purchased the game, sight unseen, long before release.  So I do support the game and the makers.  I just can't recommend it anymore.  Why?  Well the answer can be found in the game's development.The big failure of the game is exactly what happened with NS1.  Basically the developers allowed a small--but vocal and intolerant--minority of players dictate the direction of gameplay development.  These 'pros', are basically the people and clanners who play games competitively and/or in tournaments.  Now I can see wanting to appeal to the 'pro' gamers as a means to generate interest, but there needs to be a balance between competitive and casual play.  Sadly, there never was.  In the end, the difficulty and learning curve puts this game well out of reach of all but the veterans.  New players are quickly steamrolled and wonder how the heck it happened.  What's worse is that they released the game without a trainer or tutorial mode.  While there is a basic 'sandbox' mode that helps to get a player acclimated to the game before they play, it's too little too late.I saw this all happen in NS1, and it saddened me when it happened here.  The competitive gamers basically co-opt the game, and casual players are forced to play at that high level or they don't play at all.  In my opinion, the logical way to develop the game would have been to introduce a 'tournament mode', with increased difficulty, for those dedicated players.  It could have been finely tuned to appeal directly to their form of play, while still leaving the game with a 'casual' player base that could actually play the game.  Unfortunately, the developers objected to this concept suggesting they didn't want there to be 'two games'.  But the reality is that difficulty levels are part of gaming.  That doesn't make it ""two games"", it makes it one game with two difficulty levels.  With the development team basically abandoning casual players, this basically meant that no matter how many sales they made, the new players never stuck around.  If you look at the history of the game, you will see that from the release in late October 2012 until the end of 2012, there was a large player base that bought the game and was playing.  Since everyone was still learning, it meant there was the potential for developers to cater to that casual player base and build their numbers further.  Instead, they went the other way, abandoning the casual player base in favor of the competitive and tournament players.Over on Steamcharts you can see just how the game started strong and then flamed out in a spectacular fashion.  ( steamcharts.com/app/4920 )   The all-time peak number of players online was just a bit shy of 10K.  At time of writing there were ~200 playing.  It's sad, it really is, since this could have been a much better overall game.The nail in the coffin for this game was when development for 'game balance' was put in the hands of volunteers.  Since the game is easy to modify (in the LUA scripts), balance changes didn't have to be hard coded into the game.  As such, a bunch of people who felt they 'knew better' how the game should be developed were able to markedly influence balance changes by verbally bullying anyone who disagreed with them.  Anyone who dared question those who wanted to make the game harder were verbally ridiculed and harassed.  The game forums became toxic as a result, and casual players began their exodus. Well, those competitive players got what they wanted.  The game is exactly how they said it should be balanced.  It's too bad there is hardly anyone left playing now.  What's worse is that the more appealing elements of the game--the highest level 'upgrades'--only show up when the outcome of the game is predetermined.  (which happens within the first few minutes)  Users who look and see the marine 'mech' robots and the 'rhino-size' alien don't realize that they will likely rarely if ever get to play them.  This game is a good example of what *not* to do when developing a game.  While I can see the appeal of competitive gaming to a game like this, it can't be at the expense of casual gamers.  Otherwise you kill the potential for the game to grow.  Look at TF2.  A game that is 'easy', but that can be hard based on the skill of the players.  That could have been how NS2 ended up.  Instead, the game is harder than ever.  What's worse is that they added a ranking system to which isolates players based on skill.  New players will find game choices limited as a result.Simple example of a poor balance choice?  In TF2, if you need to get health, you can pick up health kits (on the field or in spawn) and also be healed by the doctor.  In NS2 it used to be you could go to 'spawn' and heal up fully (health and armor) at the armory--like a med cabinet in TF2 spawn--and you could get health-only medkit drops in the field.  If one was away from spawn, armor could only be repaired with a welder. (like a medigun, except anyone could carry one if they bought it.)  However, the competitive complainers cabal (I love alliteration) pressured the person doing balance work to make it so the armory would no longer heal players.  In other words, once you lost armor you needed to be welded, and you can't weld yourself--other players have to do it.  The outcome of this change was that it made it that much harder for players to stay alive unless they are highly skilled.  In the end, I still play NS2, and I would recommend it to anyone who I felt had the skill to survive.  However, there aren't very many people who fit that description.  Unless you are someone who considers themselves an exceptionally good FPS player, I would advise you give the game a pass unless it is deeply discounted and you're willing to take the chance the game may not be fun for you.  While NS2 is--on the surface--a good game, it missed its chance to be a great one.			"

												It is unfortunate that in today's world despite the astounding technological advancements there are few games that actually surprise you with their novelty and innovation when putting this new arsenal of potential to use. However, Natural Selection 2 is twice as surprising in this regard as it innovates not in one, but two genres simultaneously. The concept of an FPS/RTS hybrid has been around for quite some time though never properly executed by any major title in gaming. This has always puzzled me as there is no greater satisfaction than seeing a game unfold from both the perspective of an overarching command and the boots on the ground itself. While Natural Selection 2 is a purely multiplayer experience it excels in bring new exciting gameplay to the stagnating genre of first person shooters, most of which have simply resorted to throw bigger guns, toys, and vehicles at you. Instead Natural Selection 2 recognizes the strengths of its predecessors innovative gameplay and polishes it to make an impressive new clean-cut version of a game every gamer should try at least once. While this game truly shines because of its innovation and creativity it does not spare any expense on its presentation either as all the character and alien models are fantastic and really brought to life by the dynamic lighting, sounds, and overall atmosphere that is simply blooming in this games thematic atmospheres.The first thing I noticed jumping into a lobby of NS2 is that cooperation between teammates is not only recommended but essentially necessary. This is absolutely phenomenal! There are too few games in this is online gaming world that actually demand that you interact with gamers in such a way as to properly execute a plan rather than everyone simply going at it alone, lone-wolf style. I've played my fair share of both Call of Duty and Battlefield and neither of those two triple-A giants require you to communicate with your teammates as much as NS2. If the new gaming era is going to strip us of local multiplayer and let us only play with strangers online, then they better give us a reason to want to talk to these people, and NS2 does just that by making the alternative to cooperation abject failure.The reason that cooperation is so essential in NS2 is because of its unique gameplay featuring 2 asymmetrical sides, the aliens vs. humans, and furthermore one player on each side must be chosen as your Commander/Hive mind, who will view the entire map from above and play the RTS portion of the game building, giving orders, and researching upgrades. The twist of course being that apart from a few builder units the Commander/Hive mind has no forces under his direct control but only the other players on his team who benefit most from executing his orders. Again, cooperation is paramount and having seen the difference between a skilled commander and bumbling one you really get to understand just how effective or ineffective you can be as a player or a leader.As for the gameplay as a soldier on the ground, the games generally proceed as follows. You will run out of your initial base to go seize the nearest resource point with your teammates and if you manage to control it without the enemy showing up then you will continue on to the next one. However, due to the impressive array of maps and the units/upgrades available to the different sides, you can never truly be sure just how easy or hard an objective given to you by your commander will be. Let us discuss some of the key differences between the sides at this point. The human marines are standard enough beginning the game with an assault rifle, pistol and trusty little hand axe. Throughout the game their commander will be attempting to accrue enough resources to get them upgrades such as shotguns, flamethrowers, jetpacks, better shielding, damage upgrades, and eventually mech suits. While all of these things seem like surefire upgrades from the starter equipment the truth is any of it is only as useful as the player who wields it. The aliens on the other hand begin the game as the base unit known as the skulk, an equivalent of a zergling more or less which can only effectively attack via melee. They however, are naturally much faster at moving about and can make use of the maps numerous vents which marines cannot enter. These skulks can then evolve throughout the game into other creatures ranging from the builder/medic class of the Gorge, the swift flying Lerk, the deadly Fade and the almighty Onos. Each of these creatures has its own unique strengths, weaknesses and special abilities and knowing when to use each one is critical in being a good alien player.Returning to the gameplay itself, there are some caveats to be given to new players. This game is rather unforgiving and those who are not any good at shooters on the PC will not find any user-friendly playground here. Though there are beginner level servers they are often such only in name and host just as many veteran players as any other server. Gameplay is rather fast and frenetic and you may often find yourself saying things like ""How didn't I hit that guy!?"" or ""4 of us ambushed him! How did he kill us all!?!"" And unfortunately if there is one thing to be said about this game is that the learning curve is about as steep as the Hoover dam. That is not to say that the community for the game isn't great, because since servers and players can sometimes be limited, dedicated gamers will do their best to teach newbies the ropes every chance they get. Yet despite the helpful tutors you'll run across you can't help but feel that the majority of people you are playing with in this game have simply come over from the Counterstrike community and have years of practice and experience over you. That being said, if you happen to be a CS gamer, this is your bag and you will feel right at home. The truth is however, that despite sometimes going all game without even a kill, I could still make a difference in the match through my targeting of key objectives or even posing as a distraction for my teammates who could actually effectively hit a moving target. This is what makes NS2 so brilliant, that even if you aren't your teams Rambo who CAN take on 4 aliens at once, there is always something that you can do to make yourself useful, and if you really must learn how to be a Rambo then simply practice, practice, practice, and eventually you may get... your first kill. All jokes aside, there is such a vast gap between some players in the NS2 community and while the game may not be as accessible to newcomers as I would like, it generally tends to balance out throughout games.Overall NS2 is a real treasure for all gamers and tells the success story of an ambitious group of modders who managed to create a revolutionary game that I believe has not gotten the attention it deserves. If more studios focused on innovation rather than repackaging and retheming then we would have more games with the spirit and uniqueness of NS2. The FPS/RTS is still a largely underused genre and yet probably my favorite, and while NS2 may have a steep learning curve which may prevent it from being my go-to just because I don't have the time to dedicate to mastering it, it is still an unforgettable and incomparable gaming experience from which larger studios should learn from.

												This game, while also being one of my favorites, should be much more recognized by the community. While I understand that game review is subjective as all hell. Many people have shot this game down as it is different. Further concurring on the theory that innovation in video games is not truly desired by video gamers. This game is innovative, becoming it's own genre of video game that Steam does not have a tag for. Notes about the game(I believe a pros and cons list to be inadequate)-I, as an experienced StarCraft II player, have found commanding to be enjoyable, but slightly more dumbed down than a regular RTS. This is further multiplied by the simplicity of alien commanding. This, however, makes it easy for new players to pick up commanding-The FPS action is incredibly tense, with the players having to turn off all other sources of sound or music to listen for footsteps or instructions from the commander.-One concern I had when first starting was that I only liked playing marines, and I'm sure others have similar issues. I quickly learned that I could easily enjoy playing both sides. One must understand what they enjoy about each team before truly finding enjoyment. -This game is- in my experience on the NA servers- generally underpopulated. However, as of the Winter sale of 2015-2016, their has been a huge surge of new players, strengthening the community and playerbase. Helpful tips--Be nice to rookies. The one thing that solidified my enjoyment of this game was a kind player urging me to be my best and guiding me when I had just began. A little kindness towards new players can and will strengthen the player base.-Carry a welder. Welders are cheap, available without any research, and can be truly vital in tense situations. Repairing a friendly's armor, or a marine in an exosuit can mean the difference between winning and losing.-As a skulk, remember that your life is less valuable than higher life forms. Remember to never be afraid to initiate a fight, with a higher life form like a fade or onos following suit. You will most likely die but you have paved the way for your team to win a fight without losing any important or expensive life forms.-Conceding can sometimes be the only option. Remember that there is always the option to concede by hitting x, and then selecting concede. Sometimes it is best, when new players join to just start fresh and hope for more even teams.Final comments-Natural Selection 2 is a fantastic game, made by fantastic developers that are constantly updating and listening to community feedback.I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys fast-paced action, is able to communicate well with others without getting in fights(my brother has this issue), and can be a good loser, because a loss can sometimes be inevitableHappy Hunting!

												This is one of the most unique games that I've played in quite some time.  The community is small, and the learning curve is steep.  Once you get past those, and fight in some balanced matches, you'll be hooked.  Admittedly, the skill gap between players can be drastic and result in some very one sided matches.  There are servers out there they do a pretty good job of evenly matching up teams, but you'll have to do some digging.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a Multiplayer team-based First Person Shooter & mixed Strategy game, with an awesome twist. One team are Human Marines ""Frontiersmen"" and the other are Alien Lifeforms ""Kharaa"", each team featuring a completely asymmetrical way of playing against the other, making the gameplay very diverse and versatile, yet very balanced. The marines, mainly relying on ranged weapons technology like rifles, shotguns etc VS the aliens that will ambush lonely unsuspecting marines by jumping down from dark corners in the ceilings in dark hallways or flying past scared marines chewing on their legs or exposing them to lethal toxins like poisonous gas.NS1 was a mod from 2002 developed until 2007 for the GoldSRC (Half-Life) engine which was very popular #1 HL mod(moddb.com), and in the last few years, a few original key people formed the company Unknown Worlds Entertainment to work on NS2 to become real, a sequel on its own engine with more than 150,000 owners and thousands of daily players, AAA-quality, released Nov 2012, and still being supported and developed with many updates each month even one year later. The developers won't abandon this game like many other developers do. The game has an awesome community not only noticable in-game, some of which helped crowdfund the developement of the game before it was even Beta-released; or contributing huge amounts of cash to help funding further huge updates to the game like massive new maps, new features lifeforms and revolutionary changes etc etc etc.The game is played in servers with player numbers ranging from 2 - ~32 players, however my sweet spot is around 16-20 players. (Note some n00b admins run some 32p servers on ancient server hardware causing bad experiences, beware)Each team has one player as the commander giving giving the game an amazing RTS addition, whom anyone can choose to be.Even after several hundred of hours you won't get bored or tired of the game. It only gets more and more fun the more immersed you get. The tension and fun of this game is 100% guaranteed Addictive! =)			"

												Yesterday I purchased a four pack and played this with friends... that is where this review's experience comes from and the questions I want to answer are these to follow...1: Is this a noob friendly game ...2: Does natural selection have a good community a few years later after its release?3: Is it worth it?4: Machanics of the game..Lets start with the machanics ... #4 : Natural Selection 2 is a asymetric RTS/FPS hybrid that pits two different species against eachother to battle for resources in order to gain map control and better tech .  The Marines side is best for startes , its more streight forward and self explanitory. If you like call of duty or Titan fall than the marines will feel at home with you. As a marine you will need to dodge , strafe and jump often to avoid the bites of aliens and their pesky projectiles that will murder you VERY FAST! so dtay afoot. Each side has a commander who will order you the player to make and construct buildings and power nodes to expand your region of power ( Map control ) , early and mid game sentries are amazing to stop or mitigate a rush to an expansion if placed right by the commander. Late game Sentries add to the horde of your firepower so dont hesitate regardless of what players may tell you , sentries can still kill people in the end game. Now the aliens side... as the aliens you must spread infestation and build structures as the commander , they play much like the zerg from Starcraft. The aliens have a few distinct species , the Skulk who is what you as a player will initially spawn as. Skulks are fast if used correctly so wall jump often to build up momentum and use your speed to do circles around the ankles of a exo suit or marine to kill them becuase skulks have very low health. Than we have the gorge , a pig styled alien builder who can make or brake the aliens flow of battle by placing mini turrets called hydras , walls called clogs , minions to assist and tunnels to move the aliens a great distance to where they or you may need to be. Continuing on we have the bird ( cant remember the bloody name ) , a flyer who is very fast and cna bite / shoot projectiles to kill marines very fast , great for taking out a straggler or two on your way to a base. And onto the Fade , an assasin with a lot more hp  , use the fades ability to travel insanely fast around marines , confusing and disorientng them as you tear them apart limb from limb. Finally... The ONO'S ... a ultralisk - ish feel to them indeed as these tanky titans stampede through a squade of marines like scissors through paper , their only rivals being the exo suit and grenade luanchers which cost a pretty penny for marines and commanders alike. Machanics in a gist , Team work is a massive need so listen to the commander and do as he / she tells you becuase YOU are the unit of this RTS. Map control and aggresion are key to victory. A good marine with a jet pack can turn the tide of a infestation in a jippy with the commanders support , likewise a good fade can end a large scale assult in the right hands. Skill and stratigy combine in this game.Now is this Noob friendly... TBH , in my experience it is rare to find players who wont vote to kick you for being a new player , as a rookie your name will be green until you have reached a certain number of hours played on the game. So its very noticable if you are a new player. Even in "" Rookie only servers "" veterans will join and the balance that was once there will dicipate into a one sided fight very quickly. So If and onlly if the community was larger than yes this would be noob friendly but as of now , the community is quite small.Community : Is it good??? TBH in the few hours ive played I thought about going back to League of Legends becuase players here are very hostile to newer inexperienced players like myself. Only one server welcomed my scrubdubbery with open arms and there i learned how to play. Finnaly is it worth a buy???? Yes! , even though the community of this game is somewhat toxic , if you buy a four pack , its great with friends and great when you can actually play an all rookie game when you start out. the tutorial explains a good bit but not all of what you need to know , there is a low learning curve to the game and if you enjoy fps games , this is a new twist on a genre thats been stale for some time.

												I don't normally review games, but Natural Selection 2 is a special case.For the tl;dr version- -Pros: Great game concept, smooth controls, intense gameplay, teamwork definetely required. -Cons: No progression systemI picked up this game a while ago, considering it among the many other great games I had in mind, but I still decided to experiment, and I spent my money on it. I was slightly wary of this purchase though, as I have made bad choices in games in the past, but I decided it was worth a shot. I started it up, and as soon as I joined my first lobby, immediately loved it. The game concept is great, merging a sort of warped MOBA with an First person shooter. Throw some aliens in there and basiclly sums it up.The game in essence is a moba, with two teams going at eachother, trying to destroy a immoble structure, but its so much more complicated then that. At the begining of the game, a commander is chosen for each team, a commander for the marines, and the ""Queen"" for the aliens. To win, the marine must destroy the Aliens ""Hive"" structure, where the Queen operates, and the aliens must destroy the Marines Command Station. Basiclly, the Commander/Queen is like Battlefield 4's Conquest mode, where either team's commander can virtually call in support, ping key points on map, research new weapons or technologies, and generally advise the team. Resources are important to either team. They are gained from building extractors, and can be used to buy upgrades, and weapons.However, the Marines are arguably as important, if not moree, then the commander. While commander can call in buildings, it takes the Marines to actually construct them. The marines also do all the fighting, their arsenal consisting of a medium range assault rifle, pistol secondary, and combat hatchet. (God I love that unholster animation) The Commander can research new weapons to add to the arsenal, including shotguns, landmines, and a range of grenades. Mid-to-late game, the Commander can order a lab drop, which lets you buy (with enough resources,) flame throwers, or exo-suits. Marines expand their territory by building facilities, such as power generators, then extractors, and so forth. If Marines can get multiple bases running, they can build teleports, which let you sweep across the map faster.For the Aliens, the game is very similar, yet so different. The ""Queen"" (Alien's commander) gets a skyhigh view of the map from her hive. She can ping areas, advise the team, and spread the infestation across the area. The aliens are very diverse. The default alien is a skulk. It appears to be some sort of hybrid of a crab, and a hyena or something. They run much faster then marines, can scale walls, or even crawl across the ceiling, even using vents to their advantage. Their default melee can kill a Marine in 2 or 3 hits. It also has a far weaker range, called Parasite.The second alien, and cheapest to evolve into, is the Gorge It generally resembles a turtle/hippo, with a swollen belly. It's attacks are all range, and involve it spitting up on Marines. But the Gorge's main purpose is to support. It can build Infestations, which cover rooms with swells of green goo. It's primary attack can also heal allies.Lerks are the third cheapest alien evolutions. They resemble pterodactyls, and flies around, quickly striking down Marines at close combat, or picking them off with their ranged spikes. Very agile and hard to hit, Lerk's are a fresh pain in the ♥♥♥ for Marines. The second most expensive evolution is the fade, the Fade is virtually an alien assassin, that can leap, teleport, and fade itself into invisiblity. Leaves Marines Wondering what hit them.The biggest evolution there is, usually a mid-to-late game version, is the Onos. Basiclly the alien equivalent of an exosuit, this thing appears to be a huge rhino, dinosaur mother hubbard that charges its way through enemy lines. It absorbs damage in its shell, and excels at smashing Marine structures to pieces.The game is amazingly fun to play, and much more diverse then the average moba. Unfortunately, there are a few cons. There is literally no progression systems. Of course, good Mobas really don't need them, as progression is'nt the point of the game. (Unless you play LoL, and your spending twenty bucks on a revealing outfit for your female champion.) But there are not even leaderboards, apart from some server's fanmade versions.The other problem I have with this game is its rarely updated. Currently there is 4 maps, but I believe there is definetely room for more. Of course, the way most of the game is already is pretty balanced, and trying to change the roots of it would not be good, but this game needs some DLC. Some kind or reskin, weapon modifications, anything.Overall this game deservers 8, or even 9 out of 10. It is one of my favorite games, and I hope to enjoy this game for many more years. "

												This used to be my favorite game. For 3 years, I played this game religiously and logged as many hours as I had in CS:S and TF2 previously. At a time, I would have rated this game much higher than both of those AAA titles. Sure, the public servers were always and still are a bad case of teamstacking due to a lack of in-game matchmaking or a proper team skill balancing system, and the game released full of bugs and was terribly optimized leading to an immediate and huge dropoff of players and dooming the game to a tiny community for the rest of it's existence... but the core game was an excellent foundation, and over the years with the help of the balance mod ""CompMod"" and ""Pub Friendly Comp Mod"" by Dragon as well as key quality of life mods like ""NS2+"" by mendasp and ""Shine"" by Ghoul (not to mention some long needed bug fixes and optimization), the game became great. The greatest game I ever played.But not anymore. I can no longer recommend this game for anyone. Not for any price, not even if it was free; I wouldn't wish this abomination of a game upon anyone. The developers (UWE), in some misguided attempt to help ""new player retention"", using some bizarre reasoning to ""help the game grow"" have actually started killing their own game. The most popular servers for the last 3 years, now dead. The one league there was for this game: dead. The games only competitive matchmaking system (NSL gathers): dead. The amazing mod ""CompMod"" mentioned before? Dead, with random features from it stripped and screwed with and thrown into the vanilla game in a poor attempt to ""shake up gameplay"".The developers of this game have ignored the community for so long, and their continued ignorance has now ruined the game for me, and so many like me. F*ck UWE. F*ck NS2.UWE: The balance is f*cked, and NS2's most loyal players are quitting and moving on, the majority of the remaining community hates you and your most dedicated and essential modders are sick of dealing with you. Revert these awful changes, and actually SUPPORT YOUR COMMUNITY or watch this game wither and die. "

												Natural Selection 2 has been my go-to multiplayer game for years.If not for modded servers, I would have quit playing a long, long time ago.Recently, the devs currently still making changes to the game have decided that modded servers don't represent what they want the game to be.  As a result, they've made changes to the game in an effort to destroy the biggest community the game still has left.  I can no longer recommend this game to anyone as this behaviour by the dev team is actively destroying what fun there is left to experience.  The devs keep making changes no one is asking for, and soon there will be no one left to play with as a result. "

												I love this game.  The action is fast paced but requries thought (tactically and strategically).  You don't just run in guns blazing, but you need to work with your teammates.  It's a perfect mix of FPS and RTS.  Biting marines as a skulk is fun too.Some say this game has a high learning curve.  Maybe it does, but I don't think so.  You work with your team, collect resources, and then you and your team can afford to buy upgrades -- oh yeah, and kill the other team while trying to prevent them from collecting resources and upgrading.  Is that hard?  Try the tutorials.  Start on newbie-friendly servers. USE A MIC and ask for direction.  It's a relatively small community and most players are very willing to help people who are looking to learn.Try it out.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

												This game is fast-paced, unique, challenging and incredibly rewarding, because even after hundreds of hours of playtime, you still make progress and learn new things. No two matches are alike, and - if you're willing to spend the initial time required to get familiar with the concept - you'll find yourself playing a game that's balanced, and where teamwork is the winning factor in your play.If you're the person that likes games where strategy matters and teamplay & communication are more valuable than just individual skill, this is for you.If you're the person that likes a mature community and player base (...we all know there are exceptions everywhere) where you actually talk to the opposing team after the match is over, complimenting them on their play and/or discussing the previous round, this is definitely for you.However: If you're the solo-rambo kind of guy who likes to be on top of the score list and not be dependent on anything or anyone: Don't buy this. You will not like this.			"

												My all-time favorite multiplayer FPS.At this point, balance is about as even as it's going to get for an FPS with asymmetrical teams, and the developers (both Unknown Worlds and the Community Dev Team) have added a significant amount of content in a number of rather sizable updates. The community is still quite active and is far less dickish than most, which, to me, is a rarity in this age of games going out of style once they're no longer the flavor of the month.The gameplay, while obviously an FPS, is very much dependent upon the strategic layer, and vice versa. What this means is that the commander's role is absolutely vital to the success of the players on foot, and their capability to win their encounters affects whether or not he can expand; it's not like Nuclear Dawn or some other RTS/FPS hybrids where one element is gimped or neutered while the other is fleshed out.My only complaint would be the devs' tendency to change things unnecessarily every other week, with minor balance patches or changes throwing the whole game out of whack. The game as it is now is NOT the same game it was at launch, not by a long shot. If you can keep pace with the changes and roll with the punches, however, it's excellent fun.One crucial tip for new players would be to use your microphone, if you have one (I know you do). Communication with your team is key. Don't be afraid to pipe up on voice, and always keep an eye on your map (bound to the C key by default).			"

												This review is made to present you my community. Recently all the 24+ servers (as well as modded servers) got removed from the default server browser view. With that change people will no longer be able to find an important part of this community.This is Woozas. Oldest and most popular NS2 servers alive.Are you looking for fun, without being moderated by every action? After 2.5 years we only have 5 bans in total.Do you like playing with others? With a lot of people? Wooza's Playground has 42 slots waiting for you. We also have Wooza's Hamster Wheel with 32 slots.You don't understand why some server hoster want to generate money? We neither. You can create your own badges and receive skins for free.Do you have problems finding your way into the game? Use text or voice chat and ask us anything! We are happy to help!Are you curious what other modders did with this game? We have servers running almost every game mode that is working! We also have a good relation to most modders and support them. If you are looking for competitve games (6vs6), our community highly recommends to join the ESNL Community[www.ensl.org]. They looking for newcomers. And we love to watch competative tournaments! Meanwhile many competitive players have quit the game because the developers do not care about another big community and their ""rapid update iteration"" broke the balance mod for compet so many times, that they decided to quit.Whatever you are looking for, NS2 has it!Just keep in mind that after recent changes  24+ slot and modded servers are both hidden from the server browser by default, as intended by the devs.Use the filters on top and press ""MODDED"" to see all NS2 servers and join the fun.Fun fact: The developers increased the limit of slots from 24 to 99 which means that our servers are now officially supported and part of NS2. We don't run any balance changes, our servers running completly vanilla NS2, but the devs still claims that our servers are ""modded"". Funny right?Join our Community[discord.gg] chat or add me as friend in Steam if you have any questions regarding the game or setting up a server.Thank you for reading this.-Wooza			"

												I bought this game I believe 2 years ago and I was absolutely in love with it for quite some time and played it quite a bit. But patch after patch has reduced the game into an elitist circlejerk that represents the gaming community and its forums. New players are looked down upon so badly for not even knowing what certain abilities or effects aliens can use. And not just new players, but anyone who has a differing opinion really to the mainstream elitist mentality. The community is completely toxic to normal people and their peasant opinions. ""git gud"" basically. Good luck to new players with green names because if you don't clock in at least 60 hours, people give you ♥♥♥♥ for ""sucking."" The good ones from the community have nearly all left and now all ns2 has are the dregs of idiotic narcissts who are there to pad their hive score that only the 15 remaining competitive people in the whole world even give a rat's ♥♥♥ about now. The community used to be fun and an absolute blast back when large servers such as Wooza's and modded servers were the most popular. They were popular for a good reason because it was actually fun to play. The dev's ruined that now by ""hiding"" those servers thus essentially killing off their biggest playerbase: casual/light gamers. People need to get their high horse out of their asses and understand that not everyone can clock in 1k+ hours and even those that do just want to relax and enjoy a good game at the end of the day. Not be two big macs away and a diet coke from a bursting a vein. Now the only 3-4 servers that you can play in NA are just completely ruined either due to terrible balance between the two races or just simply being full almost 24/7. And if you want to join an EU server because you happen to play at 7 AM, good luck because EU/Russia doesn't want our laggy comcast asses. So have fun in the 4 NA servers that are left. Which btw, there's always one or two guys who absolutely carry one team the entire time and you are just praying that they leave. Until another 4k hive score guy comes in. As far as patches go, the game is pretty unbalanced as of patch 299. Several of my fellow ns2 players are leaving solely because of this patch. They each have 1k - 2k hours. That in itself speaks volumes of how the devs only listen to the circlejerking community of the top 10 players who constantly whine about adding stupid ♥♥♥♥ like a broken OP HMG while consistently nerfing aliens because they miss ns1 but don't want to go and play ns1. Instead they want to make ns2 become ns1 with fancier graphics. And also ♥♥♥♥ing up aliens. Thank god Overwatch will be out in a couple days from now. I can finally uninstall this increasingly frustrating, broken, elitist, ♥♥♥♥ing game. Thank you blizzard. "

												I'll tell you why you may want to skip over NS2, but let me start on a positive note.NS2 is a bold step in an industry full of very similar multiplayer experiences. Multiplayer is asymmetrical, with each team featuring multiple classes and vastly different approaches to play between teams. Rounds require the participation of not only individual teammates and their skill, but also the (micro)management skills of a commander, acting in an RTS role. These factors lead to NS2 having not only very deep tactical gameplay, but also a very large skill curve to climb and become immersed in. The results of fully embracing and immersing yourself in these systems can lead to a very fun and utterly different kind of gameplay which is truly one-of-a-kind.Now I'm going to tell you why you may want to pass on getting this game.Unless you are prepared to adopt the committed ethic and mindset of a competitive gamer when going in, you're going to have a very rough time; or at least a very inconsistent experience. The difficulty curve is downright brutal. Maps are huge, complex sprawls with a lot of tactical options hidden away in the architecture and terrain placement. They take a lot of time to learn. Gameplay, even for the human side (which you'd think is in more familiar territory for most people) is not too hard to get a handle on at first, but the leap from functional play to consistently effective technique is ENORMOUS. It also does not help that the core community of this game consists of very talented and highly competitive players that one of them alone can stack a team to an almost assured victory.The other major problem that this game presents for new players is related to its greatest strength - its complexity and essential reliance on communication and teamwork for success. This depth ensures almost DOTA-like skill and tactical moments to shine in league play, but in pub play it is a different story. The reliance of one person, the commander, to basically support the rest of the team to ensure victory can be a huge liability in pub play, as having the wrong guy in the commander chair can spell instant doom for a match - very frustrating when it happens consistently. Unlike a lot of other games, like Battlefield and Team Fortress, in which throwing a lot of like-minded players at common objectives usually results in emergent teamplay, constant voice and text communication is essential to a fun and successful game in NS2. Sometimes you get lucky and have a lot of teammates who communicate effectively and listen to orders from the commander. A lot of the time, this isn't the case, and it's frustrating.Because of the aforementioned complexity, another problem arises. A small mistake by the commander, or players under him/her can lead to the team's doom in the early stages of the game. Most of the time everything goes smoothly early on and you roll the team, or you lose a battle early on and it's all over.Anyways, at the end of the day, I'll say this. If you're prepared to immerse yourself in NS2 completely - make it your religion, as you would with a game like DOTA - you're probably going to have a great time with its tactical complexity and heavy reliance on teamwork. If you're not that hardcore, you're going to play an interesting game, with interesting levels, but with an enormous skill curve and a lot of frustration trying to deal with players who seemingly cannot be killed or bested in any way.Me, I'm not that hardcore. I played the game, it was fun while it was interesting, but after 50 hours I can see some of the complex mechanisms move about and I realize I'm simply not a bad enough dude to become one of those 142 - 2 k/d kinds of players that you'll no doubt run into if you play this game.

												Great game with awsome play style and mechanics but a lack of players and very few people willing to play commander kill this game and those few who play are people who never touched a girl and will rage at the sight of a new player. Hell at one point among the tryhards they complained that the servers should have a 600hr restriction before being able to join. I think that the best thing to do is make it free to play so a wave of new players come in and fill the servers.			"

												I'm a hard fan to please. I want a game thats easy to learn but hard to master. Natural Selection 2 (NS2) is just that, a perfect blend of both RTS and FPS. It can satisfy the most demanding fast twitch high intensity gamers or the casual pubbers looking to watch / help those battling it out for map control. Typical days I find myself jumping on to a server for 20 minutes, before dinner, or spending 2 hours helping to keep a server alive, with action, until midnight.

												I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this game yet after 150+ hours into it. But I have returned from a long hiatus to play this game and again and I thought it was time for a review. In a world filled with boring repetitive multiplayer shooters where you run around like a chicken with their head cut off comes a game like Natural Selection 2. A game that ACTUALLY understands the point of competitive multiplayer. TO WORK AS A TEAM!You play as Aliens or Marines. The marines are fairly standard and easy to get the hang of. For the most part I’m a rather good marine player. Aliens are trickier and require more practice. While I’m not a great alien player I’m decent-ish. In other words I still manage to get more than 5 kills. Overall the game requires teamwork and strategy opposed to lone wolfing it. If you run off on your own you will die. You need to be supported by your team members. Also the game is farily well balanced as I did not notice any major balance issues. Highly recommended: 9/10 Great game.  "

												NS2 is a great game and i really do like it alot. I just cannot recommend it to anyone new because the ship has sailed in more ways than 1. The main issue is the community, don't get me wrong the playerbase is generally very friendly and accepting of newcomers, it is mostly a plesant experience and they are pretty dedicated to the game. It's just that it's rather small these days and the players who remain are really damn good, even with the basic tools and classes. You will be the equivilant a Star Trek Redshirt for a long time untill you eventually reach a point where you can at least get some objectives done, and even then you will still be lightyears behind the community skill level, it's so far ahead in fact that i fear that new comers won't catch up, you will spend alot of time lost and dead. As a result i just can't recommend this to anyone now simply because i don't think you'll get enjoyment from it. Which is a shame because the asymetical RTS gameplay is otherwise great.			"

												So yeah, you might be looking at my hours and think that i play games way too much, and you would be right.Natural selection 2 is by far the most enjoyable game i've played, and even when i burn myself out on it, i always find myself coming back.ProsExtremely teamwork orientatedDeep and complex gameplay, deceptivly simple, no game ever feels the same, and plays out differently depending on the types of players.You don't have to be a great shot to help out your  team in a big way, one player can win the game by constantly preasureing the enemy's undefended resource nodes, starveing them of crucial medpacks and upgrades.Marine commander gameplay is incredibly tense and fast paced, even morso than the shooter part of the game, there is always somthing to do, someone to med, something to research. Extremely varied playstyles for each lifeform and weapon, lerks and fades favour hit & run tactics and kill-focused playstyles, wheras the gorge is almost entirely a support role. Two different commander roles that play completely different. every marine weapon serves a different purpose. Jetpacks change the way marines can engage, and Exos change the way aliens have to engage. Very skill based. there is not many things in this game that can get you kills without some level of skill, and to play decently you need to learn the maps, and have a good memory-map of your surroundings, and be VERY aware of sounds. Sound based gameplay makes it feel different to other games.In NS2, oftentimes i'll be calling out what i hear in the next room, or i'll hear a faint click of a skulk, giving away his hiding spot. Hearing the marine reloading, giving you a 2 second window to get some free hits.you need to be very aware in this game, and i would say being able to know how many, and exactly where skulks/marines are before you enter a room is the most crucial skill to have. Every game plays out differently Generaly friendly community (at least in AUS, i cannot speak for the rest of the world.) Cons 
 Steep learning curve. the game can take a good amount of time to learn how to play decently, and it is not a game you can pick up casualy and play well in. it takes some amount of time investment to get the most out of Ns2.Especially when learning to play aliens, as they play drasticly diffrent to anythnig else from other games. and i would reccomend checking out one of my guide videos  here  if you want to play alien more effectivly. Rookies cannot just jump into the commander role. Being such a crucial role, many people do not like inexperienced players jumping in without asking first, or someone volunteering to teech them (i do that all the time) so expect to not see that portion of the game for a while unless you use a mic, or someone offers to teach you.And on AUS servers, it isn't unheard of to have a rookie command, with someone like myself coaching them. Some players can get quite hostile and newer player, but in my experience it happens far less often on AUS server than on NA ones. that said, don't let it get to you, and try to communicate, i've found it becomes quite hard for some people to yell at someone who has a voice, because suddenly they aren't just words-on-a-screen (same goes for any other game) ""Stacking"" Though oftentimes, it is unintentional, some amount of games end up with most of the experienced players on one team, making for a very short and unenjoyable game for both parties.It is often up to the players to fix the problem, though certain mods do try to deal with the problem (or make it worse in soem cases)In AUS, we may try to pick teams manually, and swap a few players around to improve the balance a little. to avoid these sorts of games, but when people aren't willing the game can get quite frustrating.SummaryI wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys communicating and working with other people. as well as strategy, and fast paced shooters. this game has it all, and no other game is as addicting as ns2 to me :DI have some more detailed notes on some of the topics above, but i am running out of time, so i'll leave it to you to read them if you so wish.CommunityIn the negative reviews, one of the main complaints i see is of the ""toxic"" community, and the low playerbase.I can't speak for the other parts of the world, but in AUS, everyone knows each other, and as long as rookies make an effort to listen, and take advice, and even better, use a mic or type back! no-one treats them any different.And even in aus, where the playerbase can't be any more than 100 people, there is ALWAYS a server running in peak times, the playerbase of this game is small, but dedicated, and new faces can only make it better.In fact, myself and a few others often go out of our way to help teach rookies the basics, and try to pull them through the games steep learning curve (i'll get to that later) Learning the gameProbebly the biggest reason for many rookies not enjoying the game is the steep learning curve, which is only made more difficult recently, because a large majoraty of the playerbase are well experienced (especially AUS servers) and how crucial teamwork and listening to your team can be.Don't buy this game expecting to be able to go rambo-mode and ignore your team, you WILL die a LOT. oftentimes, rookies in their first 10 hours will get little to no kills each game, but DO NOT let that discourage you, if you can manage to get past the inital hardships, you will enjoy the game more and more, trust me.on a side note, to anyone wanting to learn how to play aliens more effectivly, i DO have some helpful material on my youtube channel here.  here GameplayThe gameplay of Ns2 is  incredibly deep and complex to the new player, the ""classes"" alone take a long time to master, and you will never be able to master them all, you will always be better at one type of weapon/lifeform than another.The gameplay is heavily focused on map control, and coordination between team members, if one team is too agressive, even if they are slaughtering the enemy team, one or two palyers destroying resource nodes in the unprotected side of the map can quicly turn the tide, but that requires quick reaction time, and coordination. A player does not need to be getting kills to be useful, they only need to be where the enemy isn't, hitting res nodes is very important, and if one team holds more than 4 nodes for too long the game can start to snowball and one side will gain late game teach early, and the only option may be a last ditch base rush or a concede vote.BackgroundI first started playing the game way back in Dec 2012 and have been playing it on and off since then, but it wasn't until i got an average computer setup in Jun 2014, thus being able to play with higher than 20fps...Then being invited into a competitive team, and learning the finer points of the game, and drasticly improving my own performance. recently? i've taken to recording Ns2 games (among other things) to my youtube channel as a kind of hobby, and i'm one of the few youtube channels still around doing so.

												Great but incredibly complex game with a steep learning curve. The game pits the technologically advanced marines against the highly adaptive aliens (similarly to Terran vs Zerg in StarCraft). Both teams have unique playstyles and strategies which gives way to very interesting asymmetrical gameplay. Both teams also have a single player who becomes the team's commander. The commander basically builds structures, invests in upgrades, and guides the team as a whole.The biggest problem with this game would probably be the mediocre tutorial, which coupled with the aforementioned steep learning curve will require quite some time to learn the game. However, there are a lot of helpful players that play the game along with many rookie-only servers to get started with.In short, this is a difficult game with a wonderous level of depth, strategy, and tactics.

												Let me start off by saying that at the time of this review being posted, there is an average of 4-5 active servers populated with a split of bittervets and rookies.Like everyone says, the learning curve is pretty harsh - I strongly suggest taking some time to run the tutorials and a couple offline games, to get acquuainted with the controls and mechanics of the game. Bots will be a poor introduction for teammates and opponents, but at least you'll know what buttons do what and what you should (generally) be doing, in a match.There is a decent selection of available toys to play with, in game (standard fare, generally, but ""all these oldies are goldies"")Rounds... Playing the game... here is where things fall apart.. ""People"".. - Someone needs to step up as Commander, which can take upwards of 5 minutes, as nobody wants to Comm and get yelled at for being a failcomm.. So unless you have nerves of steel or natural talent, best of luck if you want to try your hand at playing Commander.- Forfeiture. 1 in 5 rounds will end in a team-wide ragequit (usually because they don't like their Commander) as soon as the team loses any amount of ground. About %10 of these forfeitures will be the Commander recycling all of the team's structures.Load times are kind of long, but it offers one the opportunity to take a bio-break or whatever (make a snack, do your taxes, read War and Peace).. The long load times can become trying, when rounds have repeated fail-starts... But it is tollerable, in general.That said.. This game has been some of the most fun I have had with a multiplayer FPS. The Commander/RTS aspect of the game adds some really neat aspects to the game, such as organic objectives (more than just ""kill them before they kill you, a la Counter-Strike or ""Stand in a ring until it is blue"" like any point-capture game.. Not that I have anything against them, just that NS2 has added a new element that I prefer over the others)Do I suggest this game to others? If they are fans of FPS and RTS games, it will offer some unique gameplay experiences. While the game is tough to pick up, it is rather rewarding to learn and perform even marginally well.TL;DR - Game's not crap, community can be. Tough learning curve, but rewarding.			"

												I fell in love with Natural-Selection 1 when it first came out, played hundreds and hundreds of hours until finally, NS2 came out. The alpha and beta releases seemed interesting but you could barely play them because of the horrible performance. Thankfully, the game has been optimized since then and it runs decently these days (Obviously still not the best optimization when it comes to newer games.) That aside, it's one of the few games that successfully blends in RTS and FPS gameplay where you need a commander to build structures, order your field players around the map and eventually win the game. I've never fully enjoyed multiplayer games where you can go around solo and kill everything by yourself. Surely that's possible in NS2 as well if your opposing team doesn't know how to work together. Teamplay is the key word here, it basically forces you and your teammates to work together in order to win the game.I've bought this game so many times it's ridiculous. Pre-ordered it three times, bought several copies after the release and even got the humble bundle package a couple of times just so it could get more active players. Community is friendly and mods are keeping the game alive and kicking, whether you want different models or some UI tweaks, it's all available in the steam workshop. Overall, it's a multiplayer game where teamwork is absolutely required. Don't like that? Then the game is not for you. However, if that concept seems like it could keep you entertained, then don't hesitate to buy. Highly recommended!			"

												A very challenging game that mixes RTS and FPS into one (pretty good) multiplayer game. One player is the commander, who places buildings and drops supplies for his units, who are the other players. This game is very hard, so I would be ready to lose.Also, this game is very CPU instensive, so it will not perform well (or at all) on older PCs.			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Natural Selection 2 (NS2) is a multiplayer team orientated game. Like most stories there are two sides to each. (NS2) is just that, one side is the first person shooter and the other is the commanding side top down real time strategy, with real life units the best kind of unit.. right? More detail on this later.In (NS2) teams are pitted against each other humans (Elite Marine Frontiersmen) versus aliens (Kharaa) both teams battle it out over strategic resources, over a range of very different maps. Till there is only one team left able to fight.I found this game to be right up my alley loving the tactical aspects as well as the strategies. Please keep in mind a majority of the player base have played for well over 500+ hours and many of them have no patience for newcomers all though some are very welcoming and have time to teach.Bearing that in mind I'll delve deeper into why I personally think this is a great game.The Game PlayBefore you jump eagerly jump into the multiplayer servers, the game will urge you to play the tutorials (some servers will not let you join without completing the tutorials) and I can strongly recommend this as back in my day when I first started this game I never had the chance.The tutorials will cover all basic aspects of the game such as marines, aliens and commanding. This does not include skill, which my friend is up to you and a bit of practice. Also knowing a map goes a long way. I still get lost... like a lot.So before I mentioned that this game has two sides the FPS and the RTS Commanding side.First Person ShooterSo this one says it all if you join the marines you are given a rifle, handgun and a trusty axe. Enlisted to exterminate the aliens and protect the command centre.If you join the aliens you hatch into a four legged dog like creature, known as a skulk with a very nasty bite and the ability to climb on walls and ceilings your objective is to protect the hive and destroy the marines.Commanding - Real Time StrategyOn each team there is a slot for a commander. For newcomers I recommend getting use to the game before attempting this position, as the weight of the teams victory rests on your shoulders. There is no i in team but the commanders sole purpose is to command whether it be aliens or marines.This position takes on a different view, this is a top down or bird's eye view of the map where you oversee operations.You build, research technology, give your team members orders. Whether the follow orders it's up to them but depends how coordinated your team is.  Don't get me wrong some servers there is literally no team work. The servers that do revolve around team play and good commanders, are usually the ones where players have been playing for a long time. They are more than happy for new players to join so long as they are able to listen and work as a team. Although skill will set you apart at first, in no time you will learn. DifficultyThis game can be very difficult, lucky for new comers the first 5 levels of your personal character enable you to join rookie servers where only rookies are allowed to play. Once you have grown past level 5 unfortunately those servers are inaccessible to you. Meaning you have to join the big boys.Practice, practice, practice... or just die a lot like I did, gritting your teeth at every turn. Controls & InterfaceNS2 is a keyboard and mouse based game, if you are use to FPS games or RTS game the controls are relatively straight forward and easy to pick up.If you are not happy with the bindings you are able to change them in the options.AchievementsThe achievements on this game are fairly straight forward although there will be a few that are difficult to acquire.There are no achievements that have sapped the fun out of it for me.StoryThere is no unfolding story to this game unfortunately and there is no single player campaign mode.Although there is single player horde mode and tutorials. Combat System The combat is all real time so you had better check those corners before you run out into the open.You never know what maybe lurking in the dark above you.Hint: Marines - Burst fire or you will hear dead man's click too often.Aliens - Jump off the wall bite, bite. Jump off a wall bite, bite?Skills & TraitsThere is no skill and trait system, there is a personal level system that works off exp gained from playing online.Online players also have a Hive skill score which relates to how well you play globally.The aliens however work differently from the marines while in a match. You as an alien may evolve and select different traits based on which hive the commander has chosen. Multiple hives means multiple choices.As an alien you may evolve (at a cost) in to other roles that have similarities as support Gorge), assassin Fade, tank Onos and flying nuisance... the Lerk. Sounds  & EffectsSounds are relative to the game and can be adjusted nicely into the menus. I found all the sounds suit the environment and had no issues.GraphicsThe graphics are very pleasant, first time rending can take some time, but the game has been optimised greatly. Humour & TriviaEveryone loves a cute gorge right? Well its regarded in the community that the gorge is cute I don't see it myself but something to do with the ears?Also ""T"" to taunt in game.Game UtilitiesThe steam workshop is available for this game and NS2 has a good community that produce mods and maps. Many of the top servers have been heavily modded so first time loading may take some time, but mods such as NS2+ options are totally worth the weight. NS2+ means you can play around with your heads up display (HUD) look and also vision options for aliens and much more.MultiplayerThis game is orientated to multiplayer and the single play modes are really just the tutorials and horde mode.Although some servers are hosted with bot teams so you can practice and there is also arcade modes that will present different challenges.Bugs - ImportantI haven't come into any game breaking bugs myself.I would say one of the only draw backs is that some of the loads screens can take a while. Especially if you are joining a new server for the first time with added mods. As upon joining the mods will download for the first time.Patience is a virtue.ConclusionSo a lengthy review, that I hoped I covered all the bases . I personally enjoy this game on many different levels as I love RTS games and FPS although I am a terrible shot.This a good all round game for FPS and RTS lovers. If you like killing aliens or hiding in a corner stalking your prey, until the time is right to slice and dice then I hope you will enjoy this game as much as me.Sorry for such a long review, hope I helped.ηυĸєΜ266 "

												Love this game!  I'll give it an 8/10Suggestions:It is a real time strategy and first person shooter.  If you don't like the RTS part you don't have to command your team, just ask someone else too.  Make sure you listen to your commander if he even talks.  This game is very fun when you get to learn it.  The biggest problem for me was it has a pretty steep learning curve.  You will join a server (hopefully it will be a rookie friendly server) and have NO IDEA what to do, maybe even after you played the tutorial.  It took some time learning.  If you can find a siege mode server you should try that.  The flow of the game play will be more repetitive instead of people trying to do different strategies you don't understand.  You will die alot.  Your best bet would be to play as a supporting player and watching what other people do.  Grab yourself a welder as a marine or follow people around as a gorge.  You will be killed by a skulk almost EVERYTIME before you finally manage to get lucky or see them before they see you.  Yet when you play as a skulk you will probably get killed EVERYTIME until you at least get a few hours in.  The game could change in a heartbeat if you have a good commander on either team.  What I like to do?  Xenocide alot If you get an exosuit stay back and blast the alien scum from a distance, Don't be a heroDon't do things alone When someone wants to rush in or your commander says so make sure everyone is there before you doDon't ignore your resource nodesFor the love of god don't hop in the com chair when you don't know what you are doing.  You will be burned aliveIf people want to be jerks to you just ignore them or go someplace elseJoin a rookie friendly server.Make friends with the mods and adminsDon't say I don't know what to do (say what it is you need help with instead)			"

												This game came from a MOD that was very successful in the high times of HL1. It was that good that the inventor was able to found a company to craft NS2. For me its the best multiplayer ever and i havent changed my mind since 15 years now.You can find out if this game is after your fancy by affirming following questions:You like real competitive gameplay?You hate casual games where every softy gets his achievemet easily?You love awesome teamplay with intense communication that can turn every round, doesent matter how bad it was by now?You are bored of multiplayers with a red and a blue team that are completely balanced and unique so it doesent matter on which side you are?You like games that offer more than shooting at enemies?You like the idea of combining FPS with RTS?You like games that are driven and enhenced by the community itself. That arent force you to buy loads of addons and are being buried by the publisher when it starts to stagnate?Well if at least  2-3 questions passed, this game takes you only 10 bugs and i promise it will please you :)			"

												I've loved this game since early Natural Selection (flying around as a lerk picking up gorges, oh the good old days), this is a nice upgrade although the only downside is lack of players. Currently as of this writing there's about 500-600 max players which isn't terrible, but for a game of this caliber you would expect more. This game is beautiful and runs smooth, and is Linux compatible which is amazing.If you're considering buying this game, which it has gone on sale multiple times - just get it and checkout the tutorial. If you try and jump into it, it may be too much to comprehend at first and I want you to come back ;P so see how it works and give it a go. I feel like anyone can get into this, it has a nice strategy element with teamwork being a crucial element.There's nothing like jumping around chomping down on humans, or fighting off a swarm of aliens nibbling at your feet. This is the only game I'm aware of that fills this need, so please support it. They also make an awesome undersea survival game called Subnautica, also a great game that I recommend Unknown Worlds makes games they care for and you can tell with the constant updates years later.Thanks, I'll probably be updating this as more comes to me.

												Ahhh. NS2. The perfect combination of RTS and FPS. I have spent hours doing pretty much everything possible in this game, sans competative play. From shooting aliens to chomping marine scum, I have had the pleasure of playing NS2 for a while, through its low phase of small player count, and into what is now a fine time to purchase the game, as people are once again active and the servers are finally occupied. NS2 to a stranger hosts a team of marines, who play a standard (from a control standpoint) FPS game with a birds eye RTS commander, and a team of aliens with their own RTS commander. Both teams struggle to earn resources, both for the commander to place structures and assistance to players (tech, medpacks, etc), and for the players who need to buy weapons and stronger aliens. As the marine experience is more standard, and is not the most unique and in need of description part of this game, I will describe only the aliens in more depth to save you time reading this. The free one (the skulk) walks on walls, the others include a flying bat like creature with poison bites and spikes, a blade handed creature who can ""teleport"" short distances, a tubby hippo with healspray, and a giant gorilla rhino thing. The learning curve is steep for marines, steeper for aliens, and the steepest for commanders, but once past it, the game opens up into a unique, unforgettable experience. Here is what NS2 is to me though:-Crawling through an airvent as a marine and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself when a cloaked skulk bites you and you spray and pray like nothing else.-Running away as a gorge from a marine that is pelting your behind and begging your teammates to save you.-That one guy who buys a flamethrower and everyone judges.-Beginners learning how to play as a higher alien lifeforms and thinking they are immortal (spoilers, they are not).-That marine who gets his exosuit for the first time, then screams ""I NEED WELDS"" when he loses 15 HP.-Commanders who care about their teams and strive to win, yet lose respectfully (most of the time).-A community that makes the stereotypical FPS community weep in jealousy...so many people who aren't pointlessly disrespectful and irritating.-Rookies (and people in general most of the time) who listen to advice, play hard and have fun. No matter what. In short, I 100% recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy, FPS, and gaming with people who are mature (most of the time), intelligent team players, especially if in need of a unique twist or change of pace.I have come back here to say a few things that one should know about this game and what they should expect:-This game is about resources and should be treated as a strategy game. Although yes the FPS aspect is incredible and for the alien team unforgettable, but you will only win matches by keeping a close eye on enemy resources and tech. Do not be pursuaded into thinking otherwise.-There will be players better than you until you have experience. These players require strategy to work around, and sometimes it will be frustrating. Some players are simply god like but again, there are balance features and ways to work around one very high skilled enemy.-Communication is invaluable. You do not need a mic to play this game, but being able to hear other people's communication is crucial to hear tactics and create and excecute plans. Not to say that in all matches there is perfect teamwork, but if you pitch in and communicate with your team you will ALWAYS make a difference even if you don't think so. -Find a community, or even better, make one. Natural selection 2 is a team game, and the best way to use that to its best potential is to be a part of a community of regulars who all work together on a server(s). Knowing other players makes teamwork easier and you have the added bonus of knowing your opponents better. Balance also becomes more easy as regulars will generally be able to detect any possible errors in skill balance. Even a server full of rookies that are regulars can grow as players and enjoy such a beautiful game.-Finally, please be constructive. Avoid pushing players down, and instead tell them how to improve for next time. If a person is being a pain, ignore them or if needed mute them (from the scoreboard) so you can continue to work with other construcive players. In general people are nice, but there will always be a rotten one in the bunch that will try to ruin your day. I promise that they are not as common as they may seem, and can be worked around if you put just a small bit of effort in.			"

												While Natural Selection 2 is past its prime in terms of community and playerbase, the game is a beautiful example of 'early access' done right. In 2009, before early access existed on steam, Unknown Worlds began taking preorders for its new game. The game was one of dozens of sequels to Half Life 1 mods which might never come to fruition. As an avid fan of the first game, I preordered and followed its progress.When Unknown Worlds released their first beta build, I downloaded it and found that my laptop could only run the game with an FPS of about 1. More builds came and with the unveiling of their new 'Just-in time rendering' system the game was finally playable for me. Many more optimizations and fps improvements came over the years since NS2's official release.Between constant balance changes, rebuilding the entire alien tech tree, adding an auto-cyst placement system for the alien com, as well as gorge babblers, webs, rail exos, and 3 types of hand grenade, it was hard for a player not to appreciate the unparalleled level of post-lauch support that this game has enjoyed.In late 2013, Unknown Worlds created this video.

In the video, the creators appealled to their playerbase on the basis that donations will allow the team to continue on NS2 longer before moving to a new project and also the cosmetics that they will recieve in return for a donation. Many outside the NS playerbase were incensed by this, seeing the move as a quick moneygrab. Three years later, Unknown Worlds have lived up to their words, continuing to expand and bug-fix the game where necessary, their most recent update releasing only six days ago at the time of this writing.So go on. Scroll up and watch one of the trailers, and if it appeals to you, click below to look at the playercount. Its a beautiful game made by a dedicated studio.

												Natural Selction 2 is a real standout in the FPS-Genre. The two factions play very differently from one another without feeling imbalanced (even though you will meet some players who say differently). Though there is a rather high learning curve, Natural Selection 2 is worth the frustration and failure you may experience at the beginning. Just visit the ""Rookie friendly servers"" and you will find many players who are willing to help you and explain certain mechanics that will lead to victory for you and your teammates. To me Natural Selection 2 isn’t great only because it’s very different from all the other  FPS's out there, but because it does asymmetrical multiplayer so damn well, offering up a variety of experiences in one small game.

												TL;DR: If Natural Selection 2 has ever interested you, don’t hesitate like I did!Had my eye on this game for over a year but was put off by negative reviews. Main concern was lack of a player-base, and that those that did play were hardcore vets who would rage at me for being new.The game was recently on free weekend, so figured why not.Turns out there is a healthy selection of servers, and plenty of rookie servers to play on. Game has a learning curve but after a couple games and some YouTube videos, playing as a marine grunt is easy (and FUN) enough. I’ve yet to try commander (even in the tutorial), and have barely touched the alien side, so having so much fun thus far with only about ¼ of the game’s content says a lot. I can easily see how people get a ton of hours out of this game, as there’s 4 unique ways to play it.Really blown away by the depth and required team work this game presents. Not only is it a fun shooter with unique asymmetrical game-play, but it also feels like an adventure horror game (as a marine, anyways). Venturing the eerily quiet ship with one or two other team-mates in itself is a thrill.As for the community, in my 5 and a half hours everyone has been very friendly and cooperative.			"

												A great competitive FPS, unfortunately ruined due to in my opinion launching too early. Of course it 'had to be launched for financial reasons' and I love the developers but I really wish they had an extra few years to flesh it out and then do the release. The main issues being performance, lack of in-depth or interactive tutorial, and a real way to have a form of player made matching which is for sure the new standard in all forms of video games, especially competitive video games.A lot of the negative reviews and feedback came from the games launch and thus I think really hurt the playerbase, and new potential players. The game didn't really come with an in-depth tutorial for this generations of 'everything in front of me, learn nothing' demographic of gamers. These new gamers also do not like to be demolished by veterans and learn from their mistakes, instead they blame things on cheats or simply complain and then remove the game from their library's and continue back with something more casual.The developers were very active in the forum and with updating even to this date. The community is great and really keeps the game alive and thriving. In its current state I for sure recommend you try it out if you like competitive fps what so ever. But don't always expect to find a server with your preferences as there isn't too many running. Especially if you like small player counts and not an excess of mods.As for the developers they continually work on other projects and I recommend you follow them and their products if you value your pc games. They keep a great community and really take into account player feedback.. it's pretty much your duty as a gamer to support developers such as this to keep the pc community thriving.. or else you'll end up with some multi-million dollar recycle every year that your three year old brother could play on a high level.I love this game, its community as I said before, and the developers. I give it a solid 9 out of 10.			"

												I really liked NS1 and enjoy NS2 even more. Admittedly the learning curve is very steep, but once you get into it it's really addicting. Contrary to other reviewers here I had only positive experiences with the Natural Selection Community. Generally everyone is very nice to each other because good team play in Natural Selection is even more important than in CS or TF2. There aren't as many servers as there used to be but it's still no problem to find active games with enough players. The game is 4 years old but the graphics still look awesome and the overall design is just timeless. If you are a casual player and just want an easy game you will be frustrated.

												The game is a mix of a First Person Shooter and RTS (of sorts), but in a good way. The teams consist of a single commander on both sides that will build structures whilst also, taking advatage of his top down perspective, trying to instruct and organize his Ground Troops. Of course the playstyle is diffrent depending on which team for the marine commander needs the Ground Troops to build the structures he placed whilsed the alien commander doesn't need his Ground Troops to do so. The objective is to take out all of the opposing team's Command Stations (Marine) or Hives (Alien).   Because there is only a single commander per team you will likely be spending a large majority of yoru time being  apart of your team's Ground Troops. -As the Marine Ground Troops you will have to communicate with your team to build structures set down by your commander and try to not be killed by the Aliens by trying to engage them at a distance. -As the Alien Ground Troops you will try to slow and prevent Marine progression and explansion by destroying Marine Structures and killing them yourself. The Marines have Machine guns that are very effective at killing Aliens at range, and as the Alien you do not have range a large majority of the time. This leads to creative ways to try and get to them, from Crawling into the vents to try and flank them to crawling on the walls to ambush them. *Keep in Mind that the things I just described are the very basics of both sides and the game has much more to it.Something really nice about the game I would like to note is that there are rookie servers that only new players can join where you can only play with other players that are also realitivly new to the game. So you will never really have this pressure in these servers. Yet when you start feeling comfotable enough to start playing on normal servers you will find many servers will have vey organized teams that create amazing games! It's a very nice system having freindly rookie servers and amazingly organized normal servers.The only issue I have with this game is trying to practice with commander. When I started becoming proficient with playing commander (online) I was locked out of the rookie servers. Normally this would be a good thing as the game deemed me with enough expirience to start playing on normal servers. Now in these servers you play with a large amount of veteran players, and this left me very little room to practice playing commander. Of course I'm not saying it's impossible to play commander because every once in a while you with find a team with no commander that is very supportive of you being a new commander and will help you do so. But most of the time on the normal severs I was contemplating either: ""A. Taking command and being inexperienced and slower and more than likely lose the game for our team because of this."" or ""B. Letting someone else take command that is faster and more expirienced whilst  be part of the Ground forces where I have the most experience in playing."" Either Way I find this game to be overall fantastic and a lot of fun to play. I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys playing with orginized teams to create amazing strategies and extensive engagments.			"

												Natural Selection 2: My Addiction, My AppreciationI've obsessively been playing Natural Selection 2 for the past couple of months now. After previously writing about not liking the online part of MMO's I've decided to write about one where it's essential and largely why I'm hooked. So what is NS2?Natural Selection 2 is a first person shooter (FPS) with real time strategy (RTS) elements. There are two teams, marines and aliens and the goal is to eliminate the enemies base (or bases). In each map you begin with a standard base and someone on each team elects to be a ""commander"". This commander plays the role of the RTS player and everyone else are the units who fight. Each map there are resource points you need to capture and gain more map control.Team work in this game is key, without it you lose. It's a simple rule.You have work as a whole team and as individual groups. Covering each other, helping build buildings and protecting them, listening to commands and constantly moving forward trying to secure more ground. If you venture out yourself you're most likely going to die unless you have superb aim, even then a well executed attack by a couple of enemies and even your aim won't save you. Because of this, a losing team could come back from the brink.I've played games where the whole map is lost to us and we have only our little base to camp in and through some amazing team work, quick thinking and some luck have turned the tables completely and I've had the same happen to me while on the winning team. That thrill of coming back or the shock horror of all of a sudden be losing is exhilarating. A game is almost never set in stone makes you play smart, always be on your guard and expect anything. To me this is rare in most games. This game relies on a lot of components to gain a win (a good commander, good players, map control, constant awareness, resources, etc.) that it's hard to have the upper hand on all of those which means by the virtue of so many facets, that it's usually a more balanced competition. On the other hand, with so much to juggle it's easy to be overwhelmed.This is the one thing I appreciate most of all from this game, the friendly community. It can take some time to understand how the game works and even longer to get good at it. I've seen many a player in a server with everything thinking ""what the hell is that guy doing?"" and for them to say ""sorry guys, I'm new"". In my experience in other games I've seen the person either be told off or ignored, in NS2 the majority of people have actually instead helped. They tell them what they're doing wrong, how to do it right and things to be aware of in between. This even happens with people new to commanding (with out a decent commander you are almost bound to lose) and people teaching them and being supportive throughout it all. It honestly makes me truly happy inside to see this considering where the community stands today.The gaming community can be a horrendous pit filled with anger and childish behavior that seems to be endless. This is where most of me grew up, gaming is something I love and I know most in this community out there feel the same way and it hurts to see the vocal minority who have nothing but vitriol to spit being the larger voice to represent us all. There is some of this in NS2 but there is much more kindness to balance it out.NS 2 is a small community compared to other games and maybe that's what guides it down a gentler path. There are not many of us so the more we push away the less of a chance the game we enjoy will stick around. So we try not be an ♥♥♥ and instead help to guide these and hopefully they'll do the same in time. That's something I can be proud to be part of.With a high challenge, the to and fro of games and an awesome community filled with decent human beings I can't help but to constantly jump back in to a game when ever I have free time.

												It's an RTS where the marines try to contain the aliens, although the commander of each team only has control of the structures and upgrades, because each unit is controlled by a player.Pros: There is a lot of depth. High replay value. 10v10 games where your actions matter. High skill cap.Cons: Large learning curve. A lack of teamwork can cause frustration. Excessive or negative chat can throw a match. Relatively small community. People with aim bot like skill can imbalance the game. "

												This game is definitely worth it and its usually on sale. There are 2 playable factions -humans and aliens and each have their own special units and abilities. The amazing thing about this game is that its very teamwork intensive. Each team gets 1 commander who pretty much gets an overhead view of the battlefield and instructs teammates on what to do/build. The game is pretty easy for humans but for aliens its a big learning curve. If you do get the game do not play commander without reading a guide/tutorial because it can be extremely difficult. The combat is very fun and you can do all types of strategies and builds each game, such as fast expand for aliens to get xenomorph or human fast expand with warp gate tech or harassing human extractors with skulks with aliens which is one of the best ways to get yourself back into the game as aliens.All in all 9/10 Very good game I would recommend.

												Some games are easy to pick up and play. Others require you to learn, improving and developing skills as you go. The multiplayer-only Natural Selection 2 proudly sits in the latter camp. The latter camp isn't for everyone, and that's okay. But as long as a game is designed well enough to allow you to learn, improve and develop, it's always great to see one push the envelope and not rely on the most tried-and-tested formulas. Often, these games end up being some of the most refreshing, the most celebrated titles around. Natural Selection 2 is one such game. It isn't the most accessible game on the market, but if you put in the time, this deep and complex strategy/shooter hybrid rewards you with plenty of engaging variety and lots of thrills.It's important to stress from the outset: if you're a first-time player, your initial enjoyment of Natural Selection 2 will be entirely decided by how prepared you are to learn new gameplay systems. There's no interactive tutorial; all the game offers is a series of lengthy demo videos. These aren't ideal, they don't open within the game interface, and it's a lot to take in should you choose to watch them all back to back before diving in. That said, by far your best bet in picking up Natural Selection 2 is to play Natural Selection 2. The way the game is structured makes it very easy to learn by doing. Certain servers (highlighted in green) are defined as rookie servers, providing a great place to get to grips with the game's many systems, ideally under the watchful eye of a more experienced commander.The commander's role forms the RTS portion of the experience. Here, one player controls resource management, base building, and upgrades. The commander directs units, issues orders, and tells the team where to go and what to do. The best rounds of Natural Selection 2 see the commander using full voice chat, communicating with the team vocally as well as through the interface. A good commander isn't the only thing that can make NS2 appealing, but having a competent leader goes a long way towards making the game more enjoyable.Thankfully, it's usually easy to find plenty of welcoming, communicative matches; after all, NS2 is very much a team game. There's absolutely no incentive to ostracize or punish teammates for a poor performance. The best commanders know that to win, communicating with and nurturing your team is key. The best way to learn how to play commander is by not playing commander. Take a hands-off approach, stick to one of the ground troops, and it's very easy to pick up what makes for a successful--and unsuccessful--commander. On top of that there's Explore mode, which lets you play around in the RTS interface with a vast amount of resources, and tool tips for each structure. A lone skulk, waiting to pounce. Clearly, it's been watching Alien.A lone skulk, waiting to pounce. Clearly, it's been watching Alien.The commander is just one role, however, and the rest of the players have a diverse array of options to choose from. There's a lot here, and chances are, after a bit of experimentation, you'll find at least one aspect of the game you really click with. The best way to approach the game isn't to think of it as having an overall learning curve, but a number of smaller spikes; focus on one aspect of the game, and you'll learn plenty by way of observation while doing so. Thankfully, the game's been designed exceptionally well to allow this. Every facet of both the Frontiersmen (marines) and Kharaa (alien) sides is important. It's very much like Team Fortress in that respect: every role has its place and purpose.The roles themselves vary considerably depending on which side you're on. The Frontiersmen are the more traditional of the two; rather than focusing on individual classes, weapon and equipment upgrades allow you to outfit your character depending on your playing style and the demands of the situation. Through the commander's resource management, new weapons are made available, including shotguns, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, and mines. Then there's the prototype lab, allowing the research and purchase of jetpacks and exos (think the loader from Aliens, but with the ability to punch and shoot). On top of that there are numerous other research possibilities. There's the arms lab that provides permanent armor and weapon buffs as long as the lab remains active, a robotics factory that allows for the creation of commander-controlled support units, and various individual objects such as teleports, enemy detectors, and sentry guns.Of course, nothing comes for free, and all these goodies can only be bought with resources. For both teams, resources take the form of team resources and personal resources. Team resources are used exclusively by the commander to build, upgrade, and generally get things done. Personal resources are used to buy the items on the ground. Both types of resource are generated based on the number of collection structures your team has put in place (extractors for marines, harvesters for aliens).Explore mode lets you test out the commander role without sending your team to their doom.It's unlikely your team will be able to afford every single bit of kit, so you have to choose your purchases carefully, and this adds a layer of strategy to all aspects of the game. A good commander will have a game plan, focusing on specific research and development to shape the team into a suitable side. Fancy building up a ton of defenses and sending a strike team to meet your opponent? Or perhaps aggressively expanding your base across the map, choking the opposing team and cutting off their potential resources?The Kharaa side, on the other hand, is a lot more focused on class-based progress. There are five alien types, with the skulk leading the way as the basic, free unit, and the rest requiring increasingly more personal resources to evolve into. You have the gorges, almost-cute hippo-like creatures that act as healing/support classes, who can also build hydras (sentries) and clogs (defensive walls). They can also powerslide around on their bellies. Then there are the lerks: flying units who specialize in precision strikes and utilize poison to get at their foes. Next up is the fade, the stealth specialist that excels in speed and rapid damage.Kharaa vs. Frontiersmen: Whoever wins, we lose (unless we're on the winning team).Kharaa vs. Frontiersmen: Whoever wins, we lose (unless we're on the winning team).Finally there's the most expensive unit, the onos, a huge rhino/gorilla-like creature with vast amounts of health and armor, capable of rampaging through even the most well-defended marine base. The onos is perhaps overpowered right now, and can often turn the tide of a match in a way that can occasionally feel cheap, although watching a team of skilled marine players rapidly take down an army of four onos is a moment of beauty. (Unless you're on the alien team, of course. Then it's the stuff of nightmares).Natural Selection 2 isn't without its problems, however. For starters, despite the fact they're large and well-designed, there are only six maps, although between free updates from developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment and community-designed maps, there's potential for expansion here. Then there's the barrier for entry; there's no denying that when faced with a genre mash-up comprised of a bunch of classes and no hands-on tutorial, some players are going to be put off before they get started.

												Got this game when it came out... it wasnt good back then and had loads of issues. Now however the game seems to have sorted out all the major and minor issues. The game is fun now and still looks good. There are still people playing with between 1-4 full servers every time I have logged on. Updates are still comming out. Decent amount of Commanders using ingame VOIP and better offline training stuff for new players to learn the game. Only negatives are that the fun is dependent on balanced teams and a decent RTS commander. Which isnt a given each match, but there are more than you would think. Balance wise the game seems okay, wouldnt call myself that qualified to judge, but maybe Onos (Alien tanks) are slightly OP mid game if the Marines have lagged slightly behind.			"

												This is an amazing game, don't get me wrong. Its pure awesome, its experimental, its fun and its complex. Saying that however, I would not recommend this game. Its an assymetrical alien vs human game with a mix of RTS thrown in, this is a team game, a very awesome teamgame, you won't find a generic shooter here.However Tthe playerbase declined severly many years back, and it wasn't its complexity or difficulty that killed it, not even close. It was the games performance and optimization. I haven't played this game in a long time, but it ran terribly, I know this has been largely fixed but this was an issue that plagued this game for FAR too long. I believe thats what killed the game, waiting for a few minutes to load into a match made the game infuriating for to play, it simply made people less eager to play it, thats why i stopped and thats why many of the people i played with, stopped. If you want to play this game check which servers have active players on the forums, I live in SA and its not possible for me to play without 300+ ping, so if you live in asia, africa, australia, south america or basically anywhere other than the EU and america, there are probably no active servers.This is an AMAZING game, but the solutions were too little, too late. This game needed some sort of massive promotion to renew interest, but now its simply faded to irrelevance. The devs moved on as well, they moved on to subnautica.So no, do not buy this game unless you know there are servers where you live, either wise you'd be buying a multiplayer game with nobody to play with.

												Despite it's age, NS2 looks very nice and runs beautifully, which wasn't always the case. The game is definitely the most stable it has ever been, in terms of performance.Despite showing some age, and having a pretty ancient netcode which results in many ""round the corner"" type deaths, NS2 is still a very enjoyable experience and a great game to fill up a night or two.However, the community has problems. First off, the game is dead. NS2 will host an average of 250 players daily, if it's lucky. This means you'll be playing the same people, which can be a good or bad thing depending on how good you are at the game, and your standing with everyone. Be friendly and try not to alienate anyone because of this, as you'll probably only have 2-3 servers at most to choose from. If you get banned from them, or make people hate you, you will literally be screwed out of playing this game ever again.If you are looking to pick this game up to play with friends, I sadly recomended that you reconsider. Once you and your friends reach level 5, and you are no longer able to play on the few 'Rookie Servers', you'll be pingeonholed into one of the two servers remaining - where everyone votes for ""skill based teams"" that will result in you being placed on the opposite teams than your friends.You'll go from having fun playing with your buddies on the team you want to play on - to having the game constantly dictate itself to you with it's constant restrictions and lack of care for your playstyle. You like playing aliens? Chances are you'll be forced marines more often that not and you'll have to sit through rounds of drudgery just to play what you wanted in the first place. By then, you won't even care.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is an independent (indie) crowdfunded multiplayer game from before the time of game crowdfunding at kickstarter.It is based on the the most played, non-commercial, Half-Life mod Natural Selection, which is a masterpiece!The two key features of NS are:1. Asymmetric teams!The aliens have several completely different, specialised classes, all of whom mainly rely on melee combat. To their aid the aliens have a wide variety of movement abilities and possibilities.The marines play like a regular FPS and are defined by their equipment.2. The game is at the same time an RTS!One player on each team takes the role of commander with all the traditional RTS elements, as top-down view of the map together with building placement, technology research, expansion and resource collection - from resource points spread out on the map which need to be controlled!As much as I can talk about the incredible depth of gameplay of NS1, this standalone sequel has gone a slightly different path, mostly for the worse. Nevertheless, this is one of the very few unique games out there with very deep and entertaining gameplay!For people who want to challenge the best, there is a big and very welcoming competitive/pro community!On the whole, NS2 (and NS1! requires HL1) is absolutely recommended to anyone who likes multiplayer first person shooters and wants something MUCH more than soldier vs soldier deathmatch!Practical considerations:1. Having a microphone is a big plus as a soldier and a lack thereof is a big minus when being commander.2. You need a good gaming computer to play this game enjoyably. The developer Unknown Worlds is continuously working on improving performance.Of the current generation, a midrange Haswell gaming CPU together with a midrange AMD 200-series or nVidia 700-series GPU.Of the previous generation, a midrange Ivy-Bridge gaming CPU together with a midrange AMD 7000-series or nVidia 600-series GPU.Of the next-previous generation, a top range Sandy-Bridge gaming CPU together with a  top range AMD 6000-series or nVidia 500-series GPU.

												THIS GAME SHOWS BRUTAL WHY TEAMWORK IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME.Game:  2 teams  -  aliens / mariens               are fighting for ressource points, controll over the map and             the final goal to destroy the mainbase of the other team to win the game.Marienside:Its great for fast fps player that like to avoid an attack by jumping back or strafe to left in the moment a alien is approching.Weapons for close combat and Weapons for long range combat every weapon is different and can be used in his own way. Moste times you dont want to go allone with a flamethrower because the single target dmg is not so high and you could easy be killed by lowlifeforms aliens.ALienSide:As a basic alien (you spawn like that called ""skulk"") you can walk on walls and use every conor ,dark room to hide and supprise the enemys from behind. Take care  to avoid big groups of rines try to sepperate one  or just go for the last one in line.Like the weapons on marienside, every alien player can evolve into other sorts of aliens.Some are flying, some are bigass tanks and some are dmg dealer that cant take much dmg but are fast as hell and bad to aim at.One bad thing i have to tell you all.The Devs try to ♥♥♥♥ up a big part of the community by making them non hive server.What? you asking .

Sloppy, permanently unfinished, no player base, hostile community, doesn't even know the meaning of the word ""optimization"" because it runs like dog doo, and has tons of bad gameplay mechanics needlessly invented since the first game. Sad I paid money for this, but I was there for original NS beta 1.0 and since around 1.3 or something it has been one epic slide downhill that they managed to somehow continue with a brand new game, against my expectations. Natural Selection II is why I stopped buying new games and crowdfunding unknown games. This was a known game, an easy victory, and it still failed.edit: I wrote this a long time ago and only just made the review public, but it's even more true in 2015. NS2 sadly went the way of NS1 -- Started promising, huge potential, but flamed out quickly because the development of the game pandered to an ultra toxic elitist community of total losers. Sad, sad, sad.			"

												I loved this game. But it's dead now. Truly dead.These late gameplay reworks and balance changes are just haphazard attempts to eek out a few more months of life.At least the rookie servers seem to have populations. I wouldn't know. The fact that there is more life on segregated servers for rooks than vet servers keeps it that way.The story might be different if you're EU or NA.But if you're an Aus/NZ player you are well and truly screwed.Essentially you either play on the one or two non rookie servers that give you 250+ms but don't auto kick high pings -while still being chewed out for a high ping- or you luck out for the 2-3 hours of one night a week where the Aus server sees more than 10 concurrent players.This game was fantastic. Rest in Peace, GG No Re.			"

												So i bought this game like a year ago and i played 10 hours over the course of a few weeks before deciding it just wasnt fun. Yesterday i decided to reinstall and give it another shot. After taking a few hours to get to grips with the mechanics and feel of the game i was totally hooked. Been playing solidly ever since.I was kind of worried that upon leaving the rookie servers everything would just feel cheap like in chivalry and id lose interest, but the exact opposite happened. Everyone works together really well and victorys feel hard fought and satisfying. Everytime i died it felt fair, and the large variety of weapons and playstyles avaiable in marines alone lends a ton of replayability.Its just so satisfying suiting up in a jetpack and having your manouverability increase  by like 500 percent. Zipping around like an angel of death blasting away with a machinegun or getting up close and dirty with a shotgun. Or if the situation calls for it whip out a flamethrower or grenade launcher. Maybe just dedicate yourself to accompanying the players decked out in giant mech suits repairing them on the go, while you save up for your own giant mech suit.This game is just insanely fun and the community isnt nearly as bad as some of the reviews here make it out to be. So far i havnt seen anyone get kicked let alone unfairy and the people using voice chat are fairly relaxed and possesing great teamwork. Theres always 2-3 full servers and at least one full rookie server. Maps are well designed and have decent if not overwhelming variety.I can easily see myself playing hundreds of hours of this game over the next few months, if this game cost 20 euro id say it was fair. For 10 euro its a freakin steal.			"

												Fantastic game blending FPS and RTS.  Not only that, but the teams use asymmetric tactics yet are pretty equal in their strengths.Marines focus on long-range combat and require a tighter degree of teamwork than the alien team.  This allows a team which works together well and have goal-oriented players to do far better than a team whose players focus on trivial things like KDRs or use disharmonous tactics.  Teamwork also allows Marines to effectively utilize powerful late-game tech like exo-suits which require support marines to repair them as well as concentrating the firepower needed to take down the Onos or Fades.The Aliens focus primarily upon melee combat, though there are exceptions.  Aliens can operate a little more independently than Marines in the later stages of the round when higher lifeforms like Fades and Lurks.  Onos usually require a gorge to heal them or a commander prescient enough to build forward bases and a team to defend them. The Marine commander is a bit more challenging than the Alien commander, too, due to the amount of micro-managing of support, but this also allows the commander to be quite a bit more effective than the Alien commander as the Marine commander does not need to build structures in order to heal Marines or resupply their ammo.  This is powerful early game, but forward bases are still recommended mid-late game.Overall, many, many hours of fun to be had with this game.  The only recommendation is doing some training before taking the commander's chair.			"

												This game has the worst comminuty out there, you'll get scolded for being new to the game, not to mention it's long learing curve.  Poeple constantly stack teams and most games don't get past the 10 minute mark.  You have to constantly bunny hop even as a marine, the mechanics of this game is horrible.  Also seems like a number of poeple are starting to use some sort of NoReg and the number of people doing this is climbing ( I personally blame the horrid mechhaics of the game for this ). Then you get people who never miss a shot on an alien no matter the situation any type of manuvering or avoiding or anything these people will still never miss, also these same people always play Marine, Humm I wonder why ?Save yourself the time, money and headaches.  In its current state it's a huge no no to anyone new or old.			"

												Get votekicked for being goodGet yelled at for not doing it the 'written' wayThis isn't a game, community is small which is not a problem at all, but these folk are mean and judgmental whimps who only care about winning and not having fun, so this isn't a game anymore.Gameplay is good though, if you have friends or find a niche community, or are a jerk like all the rest you'll enjoy this.The main problem is in that the 'Commanders' who are supposed to build structures and upgrade using resources, protected by their team, feel entitled to micro manage their team not just to a strategic view point but also enjoy horse whipping you. Basically, it's a work simulator. Work for victory, otherwise get yelled at by your drill-sergeat/commander for not being MLG.			"

In my twilight years I will reflect regretfully on the missed opportunities, and the life I wasted because of Natural Selection.

Like many online multiplayer games, if you can get a good team and minimize the idiocy, it is an incredible amount of fun. the gameplay is rich and varied and different than the normal FPSRPG sort of titles. While you do level up and improve, there is a distinct amount of teamwork needed. It's usually suicide to go running off by yourself.			"

												Symmetry is sexy… or so we’re told. We’ve been conditioned by eons of evolutionary pressure to equate a simple formula: symmetry=beauty. Our primate brains are built for symmetry, since a significant portion of our grey matter is dedicated to the detection of it. We can discern within fractions of a second whether an object is symmetrical or not. This has profound effects on civilization. Generally speaking, people with highly symmetrical faces have more self-confidence, get hired more easily, are judged by workplace superiors to be more productive and intelligent, get more promotions, make more money, get more… well, you get the picture.   And what does this teach us about ourselves? That we’re a society of shallow sycophants? Yes, but it also teaches us that we are hardwired symmetry seekers; that we can’t help but be blindly drawn to symmetry like moths to the electric bug zapper. *Pop*. Fortunately, us gamers have learned to subdue our symmetry seeking boner missiles, probably due to prolific internet pornography fappery; okay maybe not due to that, but whatever the cause, we’ve learned the hard lesson that perfect symmetry in videogames is boring.    Thus, most competitive multiplayer games have at least a little bit of asymmetry. The devs add just enough differences to the teams to produce faction flavoring, or they place the teams in asymmetric roles (i.e. assaulter vs defender, King of the Hill). All of this is just dandy, and we like to call it “gameplay depth”. However, treading too far down the wrong fork in Asymmetry Lane can lead to the developmental shantytown known as Balance Patch City: a dark domain in the midst of a constant process of buffing and nerfing that can leave the local player community distraught and burnt out, a community who’ve in turn been reduced a collective of fetal positioned, thumb sucking man-children babbling random strings of capital letter text that include phrases like “GAME=BROKEN”, “NERFPOCALYPSE”, or (Christian Bale’s favorite) “WHAT DON’T YOU ♥♥♥♥ING UNDERSTAND!?”  Thankfully, Unknown Worlds Entertainment has utilized their excellent navigation skills and have expertly trodden the full length of Asymmetry Lane. Aye, they’ve fought through the mines of Moria, passed the silvery towers Gondor, simply walked into Mordor, scaled Mount Doom where they threw a sheet of papyrus scribed with the word “symmetry” into the fires at the heart of the earth (a purely symbolic gesture, of course), and rode a disfigured gryphon all the way to Asymmetry Heaven. The end result of this epic journey? Natural Selection 2.  NS2 smashes head-on two opposing forces featuring polar opposite combat doctrines with an effect more dazzling than the quark-gluon plasma spewing forth from the Large Hadron Collider. Scientists are still baffled by its success. Within this game you will take on the role of the Frontiersman, a Trans-System Federation grunt in a future where a space-faring civilization has taken a little time away from mudane tasks like warping space-time and building Dyson's Spheres to produce something so incredible that it is rarely seen in Science Fiction: a recoilless assault rifle. Mind blowing right? What will you do with this deadly accurate weapon? Like any good Space-American, you’ll use it to shoot anything that moves during an extra-terrestrial first contact scenario of course! We wouldn't want such a relationship to get off on the wrong foot after all, so you’ll be using your stand-off ranged capabilities to create interlocking fields of fire while taking solace in the knowledge that the word ""questions"" was removed from the dictionary three centuries ago. Watch those corners, watch those corners!  Alternately, you’ll be playing as the Kharaa, a misunderstood biomass collective of intelligent bacteria that can morph into higher lifeforms. Since you hate being roasted by the wanton use of flamethrowers, you’ll be using your biomass to morph into savage creatures with hardened carapaces, regenerating flesh, and poison gas for flatulence. No, not the Addams Family. Your cast of characters will include such melee-expert heavyweights as Skulk Hogan, Lerk Skywalker, Gorge Foreman, Walker - Texas Fade, and the dreadfully hideous Yoko Onos. You’re built for the ambush, so dark corners and high speed maneuvers augment your offensive capabilities.  NS2 takes this first-person asymmetry gaming perfection and kicks it up a notch Emeril Lagasse style. You take ¾ cups of FPS and throw in ¼ cups of RTS and BAM! You’ve got a full cup of “omg I can’t believe this actually works, what sorcery have you conjured to mix oil and water!?” hearty gaming goodness. That’s right boys and girls, one of you maggots (term used figuratively if you’re a Frontiersman, but very, very literally if you’re an incubating Kharaa xenomorph) is going rise to the call and transcend your mere 1st person existence to actually take semi-omniscient command of this needless bloodbath. The rest of you… well, you get to play your favorite units from Starcraft; that’s right, the indomitable SCV and the expendable Zergling. So grab yourself a welding tool Jonny Rico and go build my resource extractors! (Welding just not cutting it for you? Worry not because the Mutalisk, Ultralisk, Goliath, and Firebat also make faithful but legally distinct appearances in this title.)  As the commander you have access to the full suite of typical RTS institutions. There's the top down view, resource management, tech trees, upgrades, deployables, the left click, and the all important right click. You'll have your hands full trying to wrangle the units at your disposal. Only now instead of your units following your orders with unconditional obedience, you'll have to guide them through the delicate process of helping them arrive at the conclusion that, yes, sacrificing themselves in a suicide assault is good for them. Look, ""Offensive Pattern Picard Distraction Phallus 8-D"" is good for you because it's good for the team. Oh you get it now? Good for you... now run along and die like a good little Redshirt. Kay thanks.  Fortunately for new recruits, there are players who've played 2000 hours of NS2 and can teach less experienced competitors superior movement skills, map awareness, and gameplay knowledge.  Unfortunately for new recruits, there are players who've played 2000 hours of NS2 and will stomp less experienced competition with superior movement skills, map awareness, and gameplay knowledge. Whoa, déjà vu. The point of that ""it's a good thing/it's a bad thing"" dichotomy was to highlight the fact that NS2, like almost all other games, has a learning curve. This one is fairly steep, so as a new player prepare to be overwhelmed. However, please unbind your Ragequit button and stick this one out; you need to keep in mind that you've entered a digital world that has never before been executed so flawlessly. No, not even the beloved Battlezone from '98 managed to mix FPS and RTS with this level of finesse (although, if you're looking for an excellent singleplayer version of this experience, that classic gem is a must play for you). You are now treading in uncharted territory never before probed by the gaming populace. With a little patience you too can navigate your way to enjoyable and memorable gameplay experiences.  My advice to new players: stick close to the guy with the shotgun. Unless your a Skulk, then run, run away from the gun with the shotgun! No! Don't stop to look behind you, HES RIGHT THERE! KEEP MOVING YOU IDIOT! The bottomline: if you haven't lived vicariously as an ankle-biting, wall-climbing zergling... then you haven't lived at all. Play this mother♥♥♥♥ing beast of a game!			"

												The twitchy gun play is off putting at first in NS2, but you soon get used to it. This game is very team based, and it's the best feeling when your team finally just clicks. Sadly though, a bad team can ruin the game play experience completely.  One player is given the role as 'commander', this play will play the game in an RTS view, giving out orders, building structures etc, the rest of the team will play in FPS mode.There is plenty of different weapons for the Marines, where as the Aliens transform into different creatures, ranging from a scuttling little dog like alien, to a giant rhino beast.The levels are perfect arena, the lighting and ambient effects make it feel even more realistic. The top notch graphics and a really good engine, Spark.Load times are absolutely terrible. Logging into a server took me five minutes each time. This is reported across the board. Apart from this, I had no technical problems. Zero lag in game, which is must given the twitchy gun-play mechanics. I really enjoyed this game, but one that has to be played on mic and with a team of people you know.			"

												The best multiplayer FPS experience that no one is talking about. Runs flawlessly on Windows or Linux, tested on Windows 7/8 and Ubuntu Linux 13.10. Natural Selection 2 is not your average Call of Duty or Battlefield game, and that's a good thing -- because different is good. You can play as either the humans or the aliens, and the aliens have some very unique gameplay, including flying and crawling on walls/ceilings. The team leader sees the game from an RTS-perspective, while everyone else plays the game from a first-person shooter perspective. You cannot win the day by charging off by yourself with guns blazing; teamwork and communication are essential. You develop your base of operations, and then you and your teammates can have access to more powerful equipment or alien species. Aliens can get large, mammoth-like beasts, while humans can get access to weaponized mechs. Team strategies will win the day in the end, so communicate well and follow the lead of others until you know what you're doing. As a new player, I had no problems getting into the game and feeling welcomed. I was never criticized or judged, though I can't guarantee your experience.			"

												A multiplayer experience that can be difficult, but extremely rewarding. My favorite thing to do is become a gorge and build stuff for the commander and defend/heal my teammates. It's rewarding to use in-game voice, and the community is a step above other gaming communities, rivaled only by EVE in my view.It's easy to pick up, easy to put down. The rounds can be insanely intense and enjoyable and is pure ecstasy when you're doing well. It could seem like it's the final moments for your team, and then a few people make good decisions and plays and the game turns around.. The game has extremely high highs, and moderately low lows.Rarely the experiences are bad, I recommend this game for most people. It's not just an FPS you shoot people in, there is a great degree of nuance, variety, and fun for both marines and aliens.The game is cheap ($10) and is very much worth the purchase, it is one of my all time favorite games.

You play either a soldier/alien (FPS) or the commander commanding your teammates, upgrading weapons, abilities and building new bases etc. (RTS).Basically the game is a fight between aliens and marines about ressouces nodes all over the map, to buy better stuff or evolve into better classes by the gained ressources.A pretty interessting point in this game is also that you loose all your bought stuff as soldier once you die, so you just don't want to die and therefor most ppl play alot more tactical than they would in any other games.Only things you should be aware before buying this game is that it needs pretty high specs to run smooth, that it requires alot time to learn and master all things, that it's hard to get into at first.If you are aware of those things i guarantee you alot of fun with this game ;)TL;DR:Pros:- Interessting Mix of RTS and FPS- Asynchron Teams (Aliens and Marines)- Alot Tactical Teamplay- Fast-Paced Action Combat- Devs are supporting game still after 1 year after releaseCons:- Steep Learning Curve (about 100-500 h)- Needs high specs to run smooth- Server Browser is missing some features- No real matchmaking (yet)			"

												Severely underrated and great fun with the right people. The concept is well executed. Some server communities are toxic and prefer to surrender before a round is even halfway over if there's even an inkling of losing the match which is a shame as the balls to the wall all out brawls to the end are the best rounds. Give it a go, the game needs more players.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is NOT as good as NS1. Saying that, it's still worth a buy when it's on sale. Be prepared to only play it multiplayer, there's absolutely no storyline or singleplayer. Furthermore, there's only about a dozen maps actively in rotation.Saying that; NS2 could have been a million unit game. The balancing is perfect, and it's probably one of the most fun, rewarding, and entertaining games out there. Sadly, the dev team went wayyyyyyyyyyyy too gung-ho on the multiplayer competitive front, (thinking CS), so unless you're an old NS1 pro like myself, you'll find games are pubstomp after pubstomp, (what happens is all the pro's know to join 1 team, and alternate sides every round. This creates really super fast 5min games).Don't expect there to be any additional updates; the dev team has already moved onto their next title. It's really a shame though; the team should write the book on atmospheric development on a shoestring budget, (they developed their own game engine, textures, models, etc with less than a million dollars. Trust me, this is VERY unique!). If you're looking for a balanced and unique online game, this is it. Yes, you're playing the same map, but RARELY does it get repetitive due to the hyper complex potential for the game. At this time, the game is 24.99. I can't recommend anything more than 9.99$ for this game. Yes, I've personally dumped 200 hrs into it, but I'm an old ns1 pro. I can see a new person spending 25$, getting into a game, getting IMMEDIATELY annihilated via a pub stomp, and then chuck the game in the trash. Lack of single player (no training!), really makes this hard to get into.			"

												Lets get the obvious out of the way, NS2 offers a unique multiplayer FPS/RTS experience that you will not find anywhere else. It's PC centric with none of the dumbed down console design plaguing 90% of games this last generation. While the heart of its addictiveness and its frustrations is the competitive nature against other human players instead of vs AI. If there's a reason you will keep playing NS2, it will be because of the players you will be sharing this unique gameplay experience with.But it also has two very major problems that everyone who has played NS2 has experienced at some point - Performance & Balance. Few people have a computer capable of running NS2 at a steady 60 FPS throughout an entire match; the Lua coding and the engine has had a long history of criticism. And the game requires hundreds of hours to master its mechanics, that were majorly changed as of build 250 requiring a renewed learning curve.Balance however has always been a topic of debate since the beta, the main problem with the way the game is being balanced is UWE's obsession with trying to turn it into a competitive 6v6 e-sports rivaling that of SC2. The small crowds at events and the low amount of views can be defined as very niche, yet this is what the game is being balanced for; NOT for public play or for the majority of people that quickly join and leave NS2 throughout its sales.My personal experience with NS2 is hard to define...the first 5 months I used a mic, tried 6v6 pugs, experienced a lot of a-holism from people and played on a 1280x720 resolution. It was stressful, I hated it and ended up quitting. 5 months after with a much better computer & mouse, I picked the game up again as build 250 came out. Performance and balance issues were still very frustrating, the game was basically an on-going beta. But playing with people I became very familiar with is the reason I kept sticking around, as well as the mastery we humans care deeply about.Do I love or hate NS2? Some aspects I love, and some things about it I can't stand. It's a bittersweet experience, the game has stayed alive because UWE keeps it alive with constant updates. However it's obviously not financially viable for them. So sooner or later NS2 will fade into obscurity if it isn't already.I think for me, NS2 might have been the pinnacle of anything coming out in the next 5-10 years that has made me invest as much time into it as I have. I think the only thing I might have spent more time playing, is StarCraft.Edit: As far as clarifying how I feel about this game retrospectively, NS2 had an amazing concept, one-of-a-kind; but the execution of the public multiplayer, the balancing and the decision of UWE to code their own engine probably doomed this game. And having played NS2 for 10 months, public games are 90% frustration and 10% balanced teams; same complaint I've heard from many whom used to play NS2.And it always had a small player base for a multiplayer game, exceptions were when thousands of players would be joining and then leaving within like 2 weeks of major updates or sales. Thus I'm pretty sure that the small size of the remaining active player-base, makes a match making system completely redundant considering you need to fill up 12-24 slots; and at down-times you're lucky to find one full server in EU.I regret wasting a whole year on a game that mostly brought me stress and contempt, but I have no regrets about all the experiences I've had with the hundreds upon hundreds of players I've met throughout all my time spent with it. Whether it be good experiences or bad, I have learned from them all and as a result; I have grown both as a gamer and as a person.			"

												This game is very under rated (not even, Steam has Very Positive feedback).  One of the original RTS/FPS hybrids (the sequel of anyways) with a unique Alien vs Marine gameplay style.  Aliens can climb walls, run through vents, fly, and expand their biomass throughout space themed levels, while Marines use assault rifles, shotguns, mines, and ultimately large exo suits to combat the infestation.  Different rooms on the map have power sources, and resource generators.  You can tell who controls the area you're in just by looking at it, as Marines require power so it will be lit up and look like a space station, whereas aliens will typically take the power out and darkness and emergency lights take over, and the alien hive spreads a visual infestation throughout the corridors, similar to the Zerg in StarCraft.For as great a game as this is, there sadly seems to be no more than a few hundred people at a time playing, whereas at one time (at least during the original) there would be thousands.

												NS1 was one of my favourite games that time. After that NS2 was a giant letdown. The whole gameplay concept was messed up. NS1 was a tactical/strategical game, where with smart tactics you could defend the base, and advance.NS2 is a no brainer, because the map layout and the lack of effective defensive capabilites make it impossible to secure an area with turrets etc. There are too many routes to reach a point so it is impossible to play defensively, turrets are to weak to make defensive blockades. So the only option is to attack agressively and research everything as fast as you can. From the smart and deep gameplay in 2003, we stepped back again to the level of Quake 1 in 2013.			"

												As I've often summed up (since the days of NS1), this is like the first person shooter version of a StarCraft battle between marines and the Zerg.In Natural Selection 2 it's not all about twitch reflexes (though this is faster paced than most); victory requires dynamic strategy, tactical combat, communication and team work.The strategic element to this game makes it a unique gem. It's far more engaging and complex than anything offered by Battlefield, Team Fortress, Counter Strike and similar games.The community isn't huge, but this game has no equal. Highly recommended.

												Excellent blend of FPS and non-symmetric RTS game, doing justice to the legendary natural selection 1 for half-life (1). Teamwork is very important and the game succesfully promotes this teamwork, so everyone can do his part and naturally will tend to do so. A failure of teamwork will visibly affect the game and immediately encourage players to cooperate in new strategies. The aliens and marines play very differently and have completely different tech trees and require different strategies. The graphics are amazing for this game's age, and the engine runs incredibly well (in alpha, it had some performance issues which are entirely resolved afaik). Lag is not much of an issue as opposed to for example csgo, the engine handles it very well. The game has quite a steep learning curve, but as the basic unit of each team you can definitely start doing your part and learn by following orders and watching others. Recently some very good tutorials were added also for the commander role. One of the few games that still features real teamplay, and while it allows for skill to be important, it's impossible to win a game on your own.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is much more than an online shooter with aliens flair, and that alone is enough to show what an exceptional title it really is. Getting started is hard and it will take time until you have discovered the game and understand all of its many subtleties but it really is worth it. At the end you will be rewarded with a complex, unique, and - assuming you have the right players on the server - incredibly exciting multiplayer experience that you can't find anywhere else.			"

												As someone who never played the predecessor, I can't comment on any similarities or improvements; what I can say, is that this game is one of the most enjoyable multiplayer shooty pew pew games I've played in years. First off, it looks lovely. Whether you're playing Aliens or Marines, the game has a very nice polished look to it and while the standard map rotation isn't massive, they are well balanced, which is something I have found to be lacking in a lot of similar team based games. The balance is more impressive when you consider that these aren't typical teams, either. Playing as the basic Alien species, the Skulk, gives you the ability to wall walk and hang onto ceilings, making you a perfect ambush predator. Marines can develop jet packs later in the game, allowing them to fly, but both teams have very distinct differences which makes the need for balance more important.NS2 is also a game which is very hard to 'carry'. Whereas in other games in a similar vein, you can have a random player join your team and absolutely face ♥♥♥♥ the opposite team with seemingly no help from you or your mates, who are in their minds probably sat with their heads up their arses. This is a game where teamwork is absolutely necessary to succeed, and when you do succeed, it is glorious. A win on this game on either team feels amazing, like you've worked your balls off to earn it.As with every other multiplayer game in existence, you will sometimes get a ♥♥♥♥ team. Sometimes you will be on that team, it happens. Other times you will be on the murdering death squad team and feel like you're a god. A lot of the time this responsibility rests on the team Commander. The Commander will sit in the Hive/Command chair, depending on the team, and will take on a top down view of the map. They are in charge of deploying resources and upgrading abilities/equipment for their team; they also direct their team mates as to where they should push or where the commander thinks they should push. Team synergy between the troops and the commander is vital, and I've not seen that nailed so well before as in this game.The NS2 community is also very friendly. The first time I decided to play Commander I was a nervous wreck, but I was guided and helped by my team mates and - shock horror - NOT screamed at for my lack of experience. I've been in the odd game where new players are given crap, but the vast majority of games I have played have been with very nice people who are endlessly helpful. Even starting out playing, other players will help if you ask and give you tips as to what to do.One downside I've found to this game, and it's a major one, is that the player base appears to be dwindling. This means that relatively full games are getting harder to come by, especially later on at night. Many servers are empty and it's a real shame, because this game is a bundle of fun once you get to grips with it, which leads on to my next point.NS2 has somewhat of a steep learning curve. When I say steep, I mean that it takes a while to get learn the benefits and playstyle of each Alien and also the Marine weaponry and equipment. I've personally found that this isn't a game where you can just pick a class and play however the hell you want, you have to know what you're doing with certain things otherwise you can be a bit of a spare part. For example, when you play on the Alien team, initially you will spawn as a Skulk. To play the other 'classes', you have to Evolve into them and this is done through your own personal resources which increase as you play, push and kill. The most expensive class, the Onos, is an absolute beast, but new players (and old) can sometimes be seen playing them and just rushing into Marine bases because at first glance you see your massive health pool and think you're an immortal juggernaut. Tactical maneuvres, organised by and with your team, are the key to success in this game and the solo warrior approach simply will not work.NS2 also offsets potential pitfalls presented by fellow players. Occasionally, you will get a complete and utter turd as your Commander - it happens. Thankfully, you can choose to Eject ♥♥♥♥♥♥ commanders, along with a plethora of other commands such as voting, signalling to your team mates and taunting, amongst others. Team communication is vital in this game so a mic goes a long way for those times when you're getting the ♥♥♥♥ shot out of you and can't type your predicament. Map pinging also helps brings sticky situations to your team mates' and commander's attention.Overall, awesome game. I only hope that the playerbase gets a revival, because it is a shame that more people don't get to experience the brilliance that is Natural Selection 2. "

												Natural Selection 2 is a FPS / RTS combo that has you playing in:The Alien team:Where you get to be a vicious Skulk who tears everything and anything apart, As a flying creature known as Lerk who spikes marines from a distant so you can go and close the distant for a deadly poisoness bite to finish off the poor unlucky marine(s), or you can turn in a monstrosity known as Onos, a behemeth who can crush a marine under, destroy Marines structures more quicked than other Alien Lifeforms.The Marine Team:Where you build structures for your Commander for him/her to upgrade your arsenal with weapon/armor upgrades, Shotguns, Grenade Launchers or even Jetpack's to catch those Lerks and keep the high ground clear and avoid the onoses hard hits.This game requires and actually courages for you to use your microphone to communicate and make tactical moves with your team so if you got a microphone USE IT, trust me you will need it.The game overall is pretty well done and looks pretty but there are some issues like in every game:-Net-code problems-Hit registration-Unbalanced teams AKA several veterans in the opposite team causing the other team to get entirely ""stomped on""But i recommend that you should get this game BUT only when it's on sale.11/24/2016 edit:Playerbase is slowly increasing but surely.

												Very good game. Has an rts and fps mix in it. Rts when you are in the commander/hive controller role and fps as a marine/skulk. Purely team oriented as your commander tells you where to go on the map in order to control it and win. Does have a medium-hard learning curve, lots of things to learn and remember. Once you get the hang of it tho, it is fun. Especially when you have a good team, you can spend countless hours battling just on a single map! This game does have that aliens vs marines feel and I recommend  to those that felt disappointed from them ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliens games.Not as many people playing as it should have (most likely cuz of the learning curve) but it has enough to find a few full games.Very underated game!

												I've read many reviews complaining about an update that moved server-lists to a different, clearly visible, tab.  I have to say that after purchasing this game I honestly believed that my experience would be mediocre at best:  Veterans calling out noobs, discouraging them to continue playing, etc.  Not once in my short period of owning this game has this happened.  (I'm willing to rule out that I'm lucky and just haven't been around 'those' people).However, I can tell you this:  As an achievement hunter, I was able to contact a developer on the official discord server (Remi, you're awesome!).  This person took the time out to help me join a private server full of veterans for a 'Captain's Night' (Shout out to TGNS, you folks are great and I hope to play with you all again!) and was nice about it.  Not only that, but the folks I played with were all immensely supportive of a 'greenie' being on their side.  Folks in the voice-comms were giving me tips, telling me to follow them around, and showing me some really neat tricks.I personally like small maps with 7v7 teams; it allows you to know the folks you're playing with (especially if they are in comms).  I've had a great experience so far.TLDR; This game is awesome and I highly recommend it for the experience and the community.			"

The only players that continue to play this game for long are very skilled and end up driving away less experienced or new players causing the community to continually shrink.

												Natural Selection (2) is a great blend of FPS and RTS action. Also called a mix of Counter-Strike and Starcraft, the game features two asymmetrical teams (the aliens or 'Kharaa' and marines or 'Frontiersmen') who fight for control of the playing field.Marines can use weapons to shoot the creepy crawlers, but the aliens with their messy spores, big teeth, slime and scythes can shred marines to bits when given the opportunity.Each team is led by a Commander who sits (relatively) safely in either a Command Station or Hive. The Commander has to lead his/her team to victory by giving instructions and orders, and by building and expanding a base.When every Command Station or Hive has been destroyed, the team who owned those structures will lose.This is a game that you cannot afford to miss, wether you like Alien-inspired themed games, shooting aliens or biting marines or like to give orders and work as a team.--------------------------More information...-=Gameplay=-Q: How is it played?A: The main objective in regular NS2 gameplay is to destroy all command stations or hives, depending on which team you're fighting.Joining a server will spawn you in a waiting room of sorts, where you will find portals that, when walked through, assign you to a team. The choices are aliens, marines, random or spectator.Joining and leaving a team can happen at any time during the game. When both teams have a commander (any player who approaches the command station/hive and activates it) the game starts. Other players spawn in the same room while the commander gets an RTS-style overview of the game. Soldiers have to move out to build or defend constructions and take down enemy buildings.Players are free to choose their own path, but have the best chance of success when following orders from a smart commander. The commander places buildings, researches upgrades and keeps lays out a battle plan on the go. The soldiers have to conquer territory and alternate between attacking to take over and defending their own rooms. Alien buildings grow slowly on their own, marine buildings materialise as transparent 3D blueprints and have to be built by the marines in the field.The currency of the game is simply referred to as resources (res). These are acquired automatically, slowly over time. Every player receives personal resources (p res) and the commander can spend team resources (t res). Players can spend p res to buy weapons and equipment or to change into more powerful life-forms and upgrade those. The commander uses t res to purchase and place (blueprints of) structures and to research upgrades as well as providing field support for his troops. Both teams must build extractors/harvesters to increase the resource income. The more resources you acquire, the quicker you can acquire upgrades and better equipment or life-forms.

												This game is unlike anything you've played, unless it's Nuclear Dawn.I bought this game due to the idea of being able to play RTS and FPS. Wasn't exactly what I thought it was as you can be either one or the other. It does allow for a commander in multiplayer mode and you have to actively work with your team to build new sort of ""buildings"" or stations. You issue the order, they physically have to go there and build it and possibly protect it. There are two opposing teams going at it at one time : humans and the parasites. Humans have their respective weapons, and you are able to choose what you would like to use from the ammo bin (once it's built)! Being the parasites takes a bit of practice to really hone control or get a kill. Parasites also come in variations as some fly, some are small and quick, some are used to build their own defensive systems. Unlike human upgrades (regarding weapons), beasts upgrade gradually when you choose to evolve them. You can get evolve points the more you successfully kill opponents. There are a lot of people saying the game has a steep learning curve (which is sort of does) but all the in-game players were more than willing to answer any immediate questions I had. The game becomes easier of course the more you play it. Do not be afraid to learn! Depending on who your commander is for your team, you can either have a great game or an okay game. One may ask who would I rather be, the beasts or the marines? To be honest, I preferred beasts at first due to the ability to climb about on walls and be invisible on creeps but over time I learned how fun it is to be a marine. Graphics are absolutely impeccable on this one. Sounds are appropriate for the world the dev created. Makes you nervous when you start hearing things and you know your about to be attacked.RATING : solid 8/10 - this is a must buy if it's on sale!Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BFor future Natural Selection games : maybe have a few vehicle options (or fixed weapons placements). I understand the concept of one person in charge of a team, but the problem arises that no one wants to be the guy watching instead of playing. Maybe allow for a real-time planner?ScreenShots : First person view puts you right into the mouth of the beasts  A continuation from the first screen shot... just to show if you stand still you can go invisible What the commander view looks like "

												Natural Selection (2) is a great blend of FPS and RTS action. Also called a mix of Counter-Strike and Starcraft, the game features two asymmetrical teams (the aliens or 'Kharaa' and marines or 'Frontiersmen') who fight for control of the playing field.Marines can use weapons to shoot the creepy crawlers, but the aliens with their messy spores, big teeth, slime and scythes can shred marines to bits when given the opportunity.Each team is led by a Commander who sits (relatively) safely in either a Command Station or Hive. The Commander has to lead his/her team to victory by giving instructions and orders, and by building and expanding a base.When every Command Station or Hive has been destroyed, the team who owned those structures will lose.This is a game that you cannot afford to miss, wether you like Alien-inspired themed games, shooting aliens or biting marines or like to give orders and work as a team.--------------------------More information...-=Gameplay=-Q: How is it played?A: The main objective in regular NS2 gameplay is to destroy all command stations or hives, depending on which team you're fighting.Joining a server will spawn you in a waiting room of sorts, where you will find portals that, when walked through, assign you to a team. The choices are aliens, marines, random or spectator.Joining and leaving a team can happen at any time during the game. When both teams have a commander (any player who approaches the command station/hive and activates it) the game starts. Other players spawn in the same room while the commander gets an RTS-style overview of the game. Soldiers have to move out to build or defend constructions and take down enemy buildings.Players are free to choose their own path, but have the best chance of success when following orders from a smart commander. The commander places buildings, researches upgrades and keeps lays out a battle plan on the go. The soldiers have to conquer territory and alternate between attacking to take over and defending their own rooms. Alien buildings grow slowly on their own, marine buildings materialise as transparent 3D blueprints and have to be built by the marines in the field.The currency of the game is simply referred to as resources (res). These are acquired automatically, slowly over time. Every player receives personal resources (p res) and the commander can spend team resources (t res). Players can spend p res to buy weapons and equipment or to change into more powerful life-forms and upgrade those. The commander uses t res to purchase and place (blueprints of) structures and to research upgrades as well as providing field support for his troops. Both teams must build extractors/harvesters to increase the resource income. The more resources you acquire, the quicker you can acquire upgrades and better equipment or life-forms. As your team becomes stronger, you'll more easily push the enemy team out of rooms and eventually back into their last base. Destroying their only remaining command station or hive wins you the game.-=Graphics, sound, experience=-NS2 is a decent looking game. There's been a lot of improvement since the first game.

												Really fun game. I love team games with an overarching ""economy"". Every kill or map position taken has inherent value and watching an enemy lose an Exo to a Gorge is satisfying. I would however mention that due to its less populated community and high skill cap commander position, it will be very difficult to get into as a newer player. I highly reccomend consuming guides and sources about the commander before playing as it is very crucial to the game flow. Think about how playing a support in a MOBA gets you yelled at.

												First a little description of the game. It's multiplayer only and there are 2 sides, aliens and marines. I'm quite honestly surprised how balanced this game is, there isn't an overpowered side winning depends entirely on you and your team (and how competent the enemy team is too I suppose).Both teams start out with a base and one resource tower, These towers provide resources for your commannder to build buildings and upgrades for you e.g sentries/better guns for marines or more armour and powers for aliens. The towers also provide each player with resources which they can spend on better weapons for marines or stronger and higher lifeforms for aliens.You expand across the map taking more bases and resource towers and fighting the opposing team, victory comes from there surrender or you obliterating there base. I prefer the latter.The only real downsides is that lobbies often become so one sided with all the best players sticking to one team the game is decided before it has started and ocne in a while you will get a commander who either doesn't know what they are doing or are trolling on purpose which gives you a very high chance to lose.9/10			"

												Is this game any good?On paper this game is great, asymetrical fps with commanders? sounds amazing!But I can say with confidence that this is the worst multiplayer game I've ever played, the amount of dissapointment I'm feeling right now is palpable.Where it falls down is execution, and where it falls down, it drops through the floor and into hell.All of the aliens have a problem where your FOV is inside of their mouth, again sounds great for immersion! but in reality the aliens bite things so attacking will block your field of view completely. Also so far as I can tell basic alien's bite works off of gun physics and won't hit anything you aren't aiming directly at. Either that or the hit detection is an *expletive removed* and just plain barely works.The game is designed around fast paced twitch gameplay with mostly melee and weak aliens vs marines with guns. However the resource system is designed around being really slow and punishing you for deaths by forcing you to play as a skulk for 90% of the game while you're learning.The game is abysmally unoptimized, so unoptimized that its not even funny, loading times are seriously minutes long, not even kidding. I actually have to turn settings down to run a bot server with the default amount of bots, and I bet you're saying ""OH well you should get a better computer!"" the truth is I can't, there is exactly one better processor and more powerful graphics cards do not exist outside of tri or quad sli setups.The commander job is fantastic on paper, really innovative! Ingame it is a *expletive removed* that overshadows the rest of the entire game. The problem with NS2 is that you are entirely dependant on your commander, and your commander is entirely dependent on you. In theory this is fine, in practice it makes learning the game a *expletive removed* *expletive removed* *expletive removed* pile of zit puss.Because the commander doesn't have much agency on their own, so nobody wants to play the commander for long, its a job that is nessasary but not engaging enough to be something that enough people actually want to specilize in to keep the game going. Its a core mechanic of the game and its frankly a janitor job, and only ""strategy"" in a broad sense, in a more specific and accurate sense its herding randoms on the internet around.Think about that for a moment, think about how many random people on the internet are willing to follow orders, and how many of them you would trust to give orders. Now narrow that list down to people who bought this game, are willing to sit in the commander chair, and are willing to attempt the massive learning curve for the alien side of things. Now throw in a team of toxic people who can grow impatient with a bad commander.Thats what I think is the biggest problem with natural selection since the player and commander are entirely codependent you need a good team to make things work and there is very little that you can do to help out a bad team. This could have been avoided by giving the commander something fun to do, like traditional ai controled soldiers to bring in more rts elements, or the ability to zoom out and see any decent portion of the map. Or something, anything to make the commander more interesting and easier to play in the face of their own incompetence or the incompotence of their team.As it stands your enjoyment of this game will depend entirely upon your tolerance for other players and your willingness to get stomped into the ground for an entire round anytime you have a subpar team.

												I recommend against the purchase of this game.I admit, I haven't given this game too much of my time.  And yet, I don't feel as though I am being unjust.<Quick Overview>pros:funfast pacedteam work basedcons:Game is possibly abandoned (no regular updates)extremely long load timesservers are empty (hardly anyone plays this game anymore)non stop yellingnot beginner friendlypoor balancing (aliens are superior)<Indepth Review>In Natural Selection 2, you play on the side of the Marines or the aliens.The two sides use a combination of RTs style structure building (the commander) and first person shooting (everyone else). The two sides have upgrades, structures, team work, and their brains to best the other side.This game is fun, It'll kill sometime if you're bored. However, it gets old very fast for a large number of reason.1) You can tell from the ""Christmas splashpage"" on the title screen, that this game does not recieve many updates. It is nearly February and we are still being shown Christmas images.2) The game's connection and loading speeds are awful. In order to connect to the ""tutorial"", I was subject to an unbelievably long time period. I was able to boil some pasta and prepare myself a nice carbonara before it was done loading.3) When connecting to the server list, one can see many servers. Unfortunately, there are only 10 or less servers that are actually being used. On average, the servers hold 10 people. This is a good indication that this game is dead and plaers have abandoned it for its many flaws.4)Advanced players of this game have no room for beginners. They will scream and belittle anyone who doesn't understand the game mechanics immediately. The only reason they won't kick you, is because there is strength in numbers.If you'd like a ""get yelled at"" simulation, then this game may be for you.5) Aliens have an advantage in this game. The aliens are capable of very quick movements. WIth how shooting is implemented in this game, it is disasterous for the marines. Therefore, everoyne wants to play on the alien side and you are left with an unbalanced team.<Conclusion>It's a fun game, but save your money. The many flaws of this game has led it to lose its player base.I'd consider it if it was on a great sale (75% off and up) and if I had many friends that were interested in playing.			"

												Unknown World's Natural Selection 2 is the second game in the hit science-fiction trilogy of the same name. Natural Selection 2 picks up where the first game ended with our hero Charles Darwin using his time machine to transport himself 1,500 years into the future. In the opening scene, players find themselves in a dystopian sky city of the year 3370 A.D. Players soon discover that all of the citizens who inhabit the game's world are devout creationists, and while the world starts off as beautiful and serene, the scene quickly turns dark when the characters in the world discover Charles' identity. Natural Selection 2 strives to call important issues into question which test our society today. For example, in one scene, the player is selected for a lottery where he or she has the choice to throw a baseball at a married couple comprised of an evolutionist and a global warming believer, or at the lottery host. Needless to say, NS2 achieves art status because of this powerful scene which serves as an analogue to the oppression of scientists in our very own twenty-first century and deserves a place in every steam user's library.

												Spent an hour in game.  May not seem like much, but it was enough honestly.  This game looks like it was really good, at one point in time after it was released, however, since then, I have no clue what happened.  I tried my best.  I played the tutorial, I played 2 separate multiplayer matches as both teams and multiple classes.  I gave this game every chance I could as a beginner, but I'm sorry to say, I uninstalled it after an hour.  This game is BRUTAL to any newcomers, with a steep learning curve and online players that seem to be training for MLG, and do not welcome newcomers, let alone give any help.  The gameplay is alright, but left a bit unpolished.  The graphics are very well done really, and the sound is alright, although the voice acting is horrendous.I just cannot recommend this game in it's current state.  Newcomers are essentially shunned, as are casual players or anyone looking for some simple multiplayer shooter fun.  You'll be ousted and forgotten by the players, and the game mechanics themselves will show no quarter.TL;DR:  Game has passed it's hayday and caters only to the competetive veterans whilst discouraging newcomers.

												This game is all about your physical aiming skill once you learn the basics. It gets worse every day, my review was positive before the updates.I was back from a 2 year break and couldn't get a good game in 3 freaking hours. Once ANYTHING goes wrong everybody just give up and vote concede. You wanna get a jetpack, onos or exo ? This will almost never happen.Developers had such a good game design ideas, but they were all destroyed by very high movement speed, bunny hopping, and super fast kill times. All you do is keep moving into and out of the player while jumping to mess up his aim. The worst part that commanders force everyone into this play style by not doing tactics/stealth-oriented upgrades, turning you into a mindless bunnyhopping zombie who swings his mouse left and right.

It is clear to most of us that this game is not for everyone. If you think it is for you, Then you better grab your rifle and kill some evil aliens.			"

												I have played many many hours with Natural Selection 2 and for the most part, I have greatly enjoyed my experience. My feelings about it are very complex, as it's a bold and innovative step in FPS multiplayer, has excellent developer support, and a pretty good community to boot. There are frequent updates and gameplay balances, and a new map is released roughly every six months or so. The two opposing factions are assymetrically balanced and gameplay is varied and interesting. So much so that you don't mind playing the same few maps over and over again countless times. In some respects, this game has pretty much everything going for it. Sadly, I simply cannot recommend Natural Selection 2 for one very specific reason. The game's greatest strength is its ability to seamlessly blend the RTS experience with the FPS experience, and when you have a team that works well together, under a commander who knows the ropes, this game offers one of the most fun multiplayer experiences available. It is this same strength which is also the game's greatest flaw. Very often - almost always - your experience is entirely dependant on the person in the command chair. To begin with, no one ever wants to be commander. You will sometimes spend as much as 10 minutes waiting for someone's patience to wear thin enough that they finally get into the command chair, at which point you are at their mercy. Sometimes you will even spend longer waiting for the commander than the actual game lasts. If this person happens to be you, your command experience will go one of three ways: 1) You will do an excellent job and everyone will love you for it, in which case your game will likely be over very quickly. 2) You will do an excellent job and everyone will hate you for it anyway, because you didn't build X thing at Y time. They will complain at you for arbitrary reasons, even though you are winning the game. 3)You will do a bad job and everyone will hate you for it, likely resulting in you being kicked from the command position, ostricized, and ruining everyone's fun. Additionally, while the game is quite expertly balanced, it takes very little to upset that balance. A bad or good commander can mean everything in a game, and very often the fun and enjoyment of as many as 24 people hinges on that commander's ability to play the game. It's not uncommon to spend hours going from stacked game to stacked game because teams just can't seem to turn out right. And then, when that magical golden ratio finally occurs, and the game looks like it's going to be a long, bloody, brutal fight to the death, someone rushes your base and the game is over before you have time to check the map. So, while I have had some real fun with Natural Selection 2, at the end of the day I just can't recommend a game with such a massive, fundamental, and irreversible flaw. The average player just has to put in way too much effort and patience to squeeze the fun out of this game. But I do admit that if you manage to do so, you will be in for quite a treat.			"

												The good: - innovative and almost unique game play with RTS-commander, lots of weapons, abilities and possible strategies - two totally different yet balanced teams - the developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment is very committed to the game and has published several free content upgrades since launch - shiny and polished graphics - small but stable and very committed communityThe bad: - some players report performance issues - the game stands and falls with its players/potentially frustratingCounterstrike meets Starcraft: Some people describe this game as a shooter with a supporting commander for each team. It is not! It is a fully grown RTS with real players as units. This is important to understand if you want to have fun with it. I've seen my share of marketing claims asserting game X would really endorse team play. They all lied. Not so with Natural Selection 2. It doesn't ""endorse"" team play, it simply makes it a requirement for victory. You need your team, your team needs its commander and the commander needs the team to follow his orders. It's a symbiosis. This is the strongest part of Natural Selection 2 and it's the feature that sets it apart from other games. In a way it could be seen as a game about leadership, and at the end of the day, when everybody knows the tech-tree and how to deal with opponents and the commander has learned the ""best build order"" and the countless possible strategies there is still work to do. Sometimes the biggest challenge seems to be to keep the team's morale up. This is where communication comes into play, an important part of the game. It is incredibly rewarding to overcome a worthy opponent and there are no achievements or unlockables in this game. Winning itself is the achievement. And if there's no teamwork? Well, that's when Natural Selection 2 gets incredibly frustrating. Especially veterans can often tell how a game will end after 30 seconds. And it's always YOUR fault. See that NooB over there? YOU need to talk to him and make him follow you. It's impossible for the commander to take care of every single player. If you just want to casually shoot some Aliens, this is probably not your game, but if you want to enjoy team play and are willing to commit to a degree: don't wait any longer. It's regularly on sale for €2,49. There is hardly any reason to not at least give it a try!			"

												I put off doing a review on this title for a long time. Not sure why, but I probably just forgot.The RTS genre is dieing out, if it hasn't already. So instead of developers cranking out RTS games, we are starting to see a new trend of FPS-RTS hybrids. Nuclear Dawn is an example of this, and TF2 could have been the same way (see developer commentary). I used to be a big fan in many regards, but there just doesn't seem to be any good classics. EA over milking their acquired IP such as C&C has lead to disappointment, and reason as to why they were voted the worst company 3 times in a row.Many describe Natural Selection 2 to be like Counter-Strike in many regards. It's true for the most part, as realism isn't the focus -- competitive play is. Updates seem regular enough to resolve problems which is nice to see.While it's unfortunate that the developers scraped using the Source engine, it is certainly nice to see people try and release competing engines. One of the certain draw backs to releasing a custom built engine has to be the increased work of maintaining not only the engine but the game. After I don't know how many updates, the developers continue to ignore the hull sizes of models. Could it be caused by an oversight in development? Certainly, but for how long it's been with the game, it's ridiculous. When I refer to hull sizes, I'm talking about the collision ""mesh"" which detects where things can fit. The tanky alien unit ""Onos"" fails in this regard, being able to fit (and let alone jump) to places that don't make any logical sense. The outside parts of the model just pass through solid objects, which can really infuriate marine players.Part of competitive play has to do with teamwork. While new fronts have been opened in regards to making the first time experience more inviting, some work needs to be done else where. Even with the dynamic loading of textures and models, it just takes way to long to load maps. Servers still seem to be single core based, so GSPs will not be jumping at it because server processors tend to be clocked lower.While certainly pressing new ideas into the industry that lacks a lot, I wouldn't want to rush at this game.7.5/10			"

												This is probably the best asymmetric RTS/FPS hybrid of all time, but there really aren’t that many of them so that really isn’t huge deal. More importantly, this is probably one of the best games of all time as it contains a mixture of unique gameplay elements that no other games has. It definitely is my favourite game which actually sounds a bit strange to me when I think about it.I find that strange because I never really enjoyed FPS games a great deal. Prior to NS2 I played mostly strategy titles (RTS and turn based), and I believe what hooked me into this game was the gameplay elements of deep strategy, blended in with teamwork and individual skill. All these aspects of the game are so important that it is really not clear which one of them is more important in this game. Possible concerns: This game is niche title, with an active (albeit small) community where you really shouldn’t have any trouble finding a game. If you are worried that you “missed the boat” I don’t think you have anything to worry about if you are interested in this game. I don’t think it is likely the game will outright “die” as it fills a gameplay niche that is very difficult to get right like NS2 has. For the best experience find a server/community you like, help them seed a their server and you’ll have fun. The game isn’t particularly expensive and even goes down to 5$ at steam sales.Most people who have an issue with the game don’t really have huge issues with the game itself but with their perceptions of the community and health of the game (see discussions). However, despite these issues the game is still very much supported by the developers and has a dedicated community so their should be no reason why you shouldn’t give the game a shot if you are at all interested in the game. The servers/communities are fairly diverse and I suggest you look into all the different communities (make sure to also look in the arcade tab in the server browser) to find one that suits you before you make any judgements as a whole.Edit: Anyone claiming this game is full of hackers is full of it. I've ran into maybe 1 or 2 people I was fairly sure were hacking in my >2000 hours of NS2. NS2 is under VAC protection and hacking for this game is rare. Take anyone with <100 hours who claims they've seen a hacker without sufficent proof with a grain of salt. Honestly they likely ran into people who are just likely much better than them, and their egos couldn't take it. Gameplay: This is a RTS/FPS hybrid so it can be difficult to describe what the gameplay actually feels like in a short summary.On the field (where most of your time is spent):The game can be very fast paced, requiring good twitch reaction skills to be good in traditional combat situations. Thus, it might feel like the game is initially just like any other FPS where for the most part it seems like winning is about out-killing your opponents. However, the goal in the game is actually to economically starve  your opponents (via territory/map control) and to ultimately kill their last command structure. Everything else in the game emerges from that. This means there are other game elements unexpectedly sprinkled in, like stealth elements, tactical fake-outs, secret backdoor rushes, baiting, distractions, and sometimes killing yourself intentionally (to respawn at base or to kill a critical structure). Thus, having a keen strategic mind to spot and exploit opportunity, even if you aren’t a commander, is an asset in this game.Commanding:If you want to try commanding it cannot be understated how important the role is, but not in the way you might think. Commanding can be fast paced, like a game of starcraft, but feels different from a traditional RTS as you cannot directly control your core “units”. To win, team cooperation is the most important thing. Each core “unit” has a mind of their own and if you do anything to demoralize them by doing things they don’t understand or don’t commonly see when playing other games this can basically make your time commanding unbearable. To mitigate this, you need communication (to explain what you are trying if someone questions you), and need to show that you have an understanding how the game works (requires watching games/commanders or playing on the field a while).Concerns relating to the high skill ceiling of the game:There is a lot of talk about how hard the game is as relatively high skill veterans make up a large portion of the persistent player base. If you play past the rookie stage you will play against 1 or 2 these guys and I’d imagine it can feel like you can’t do anything against these guys. I’m probably almost one of them at this point, but I do remember a time when I wasn’t, and a key thing to remember is that this game is actually a strategy game and getting kills on your opponents doesn’t matter as much as you might think.For instance, when I know I can’t out-skill/kill the other team, I instead focus on thinking “what is the most productive thing I can do instead”. In NS2 you don’t need to kill the enemy team’s players to win, so worrying about your KDR is mostly not productive. As an alien, if you can’t win straight up fights realize that you don’t even need to always fight. Get past the enemy lines and hit unprotected resource nodes (you can crawl on walls silently and vents exist for a reason). For new players who find the combat difficult, just being aware of what is happening around the map (flashing red things) can be much more of an asset then being able to obtain a high KDR.You will get better at the game, in the meantime, try to compensate in other ways. There are some skill limit servers (e.g. Dungeon Gaming <1800 hive) that you could try to seed to minimize your exposure to high skilled players. Finally, I almost feel bad saying this because it is open to abuse, but in the worst case scenario if you don’t feel ready for non-rookie servers and your time is up - Make a family sharing account and play on that to get rookie status again if you need it. Remember, rookie servers are for people learning the game, please don’t abuse it. Overall, after you get the basics from a few rounds on rookie servers and the tutorials I strongly encourage learning the game in depth in non-rookie servers to learn the game faster.			"

												Everything runs great on GNU/Linux. The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is just amazing! This game has the most emergent teamplay I've ever seen, even better than in TF2! Also, it has no hat-cancer (just donors badges and minor skins which are purely cosmetc) and no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of guns focusing on balancing two completely different factions instead. You play RTS as a commander directing your brave troops or as a mighty alien/marine fighting your way to the enemy's base and helping your commander to build and defend structures.You always have to cooperate with your teammates, playing solo leads to dying all the time even if you buy a heavy unit like EXO or Onos. You can be strong but not almighty if you don't have your back covered. The game also requires listening to the environment so don't play with any music turned on (except the in-game one). Hearing enemy movement can save lots of your buildings and comrades.			"

												Certainly *the worst* developer here on Steam. It's no surprise that Steve Miller Band's ""Take the Money and Run"" is UWE's theme song.They banned users from their forums for reporting bugs and completely dropped development not more than a year after release, only to use all the funds (raised from duping loyal backers, offering expensive 'supporter' packages to ensure 'proper development') for another game. They constantly feigned how little money they had and sob stories on how they could barely afford water (while renting an office in San Francisco and giving themselves handsome salaries). They just dropped development and left the community to fix all the issues (essentially free workers to improve their broken game, which they still sell and offer no compensation to community devs).The funny thing is that when UWE secretly decided to completely drop development, they made several last money-grab-and-ditch efforts through sales and 'supporter' skins/items packages, offering forum badges, etc. and giving people the false impression that development would continue. Users on deals sites called them out on it, repeatedly, while it was all going down.UWE would be able to teach wallstreet a few tricks, had they any brains or any less integrity.In sum: These guys are complete scumbags - they make DigitalHomicide look like Ghandi.

Even solo can be a challenge to find a decent and balanced game, since the commanders skills can ruin everyones game. Also standard price is bit to high for what (how much) you're getting. 6/10			"

												My beef with this game is that it rewards only those who understand the glitches and overpowered techniques in this game. For example. Using a skork unit and trying to ambush a skilled marine will result in the marine hopping out of sight and into the air while doing a 360 turn midair, while reloading, then shooting you once with the shotgun and you are dead.Forget about the 10 minutes it took you to sneak up to this player. Attacking someone in the back will result in the human jumping in to the air and dodging all future melee attacks. It takes up to 4 melee attacks to kill a marine. this makes it so that you cannot sneak attack players and be rewarded for your stealth. The only time sneak attacks will work are when you attack a noob marine.This is why I quit the game because stealth is not rewarded and only those players who have been playing this for ages will win the fights because they know all the ridiculous glitches to come on top of a fight no matter what you do.I also think that late game, these massive units appear in the game where players control a mech or a giant dinosaur rhino, kind of ruin it completely. Things look really arcady and cheesy sometimes. Especially when all the marines hop around jumping higher in the air than the actual aliens.			"

The two teams are not just asymmetrical, they are outright unbalanced.  So much so that a single, high tier player is all it takes to decide the game.  There is just no way to deal with how crazy some of their aiming capabilities are or ability to dodge as aliens.  This fact along makes the game a chore to play, add in the learning curve and the fact that UWE has never been good at balancing the gameplay.  The original NS had significant imbalance issues that took practically the entire development of that mod to finally iron out, by then it was desolate of an active, teeming player base.  Natural Selection 2 is a game with great setting, art style, and technical chops.  It is a shame the core gameplay can be so lopsided and difficult to work through.  Add in that the developers have for all intents and purposes abandoned the game to the community.  That is the death knell of a game, from here on out it is just running on the original steam from its release.			"

												Amazing fast paced FPS game, Amazing community, And overall they all taking serious in a ranked match and also it has a ranked system. they maded rookie servers for people who are new in the game. If you searching a good game with RTS and FPS remixed together this might be for you, Cause it has No Micro. (♥♥♥♥ing i hate microtransactions) So that means your lucky! you can use your mic to plan a attack and many more trust me im a League of Legends gamer and i played NS2 more than that, the overall experiance of the game is amazing i mean it has a good graphics for it, you can also buy some skins in Market for you Marine or Alien and it has a nice price point for everybody, i mean decent price point for skins and game itshelf, So as i said Fast Paced, FPS & RTS remixed together, And also it has a great community to help you out. what could you ask more? go get the game you gonna love it.BUT...It has also its negative sides.. -There are more Rookie servers than Normal Ranked servers so sometimes its hard to find a empty place for yourshelf. -Somtimes if you play a ranked match and if your in a good team the other side (Alien Side) some players will leave cause of a bad commander (CC) and there will be bots in the place of a Player and they will hit you really really good i mean the bots are a bit OP.. -The servers has sometimes a overload (Highly Ping) so it lags like hell and its nearly IMP to play your match..But overall i recommend to everybody, I mean give it a try its worth it.8/10(Some spell faults maded Sorry!)

												It's a very cool concept in theory, but don't expect much time in game. At the time i'm writing this, there are about 60 or so total players, enough to fill two servers to max with a handful scattered between the rest. the player base for this game is small to the point that i couldn't find much of a chance to play this game to it's full potential, entering lobbies with maybe five others, not nearly enough to get some fun out of it.Unless they can up the number of players, Consider playing something else.

												Natural Selection 2 (NS2) is a multi-player, team oriented video game which combines first-person shooter and real-time strategy rules. It is set in a science fiction universe in which a human team fights an alien team for control of resources and territory in large and elaborate indoor facilities. -WikipediaNatural Selection 2 is a vast, team-based FPS-RTS hybrid in which you as the player can choose whether to play as the aliens or the marines. The marines ingame and refered to as the ""Frontiersmen"" and the aliens are supposedly a race known as the ""Kharaa"". The basis of the game is fairly interesting, as is the concept of achieving victory. To achieve victory in NS2, you must destroy all of the opposing team's base structures. For the Frontiersmen the main base structure is the ""Command Chair"" and for the Kharaa the main base structure is the ""Hive"".It may sound easy and simple to just waltz right in and destroy the enemy team's base, but it is unfortunately for you the complete opposite. Each team has their ups and downs and one of the downs of being a marine is that you have very little armor to keep you alive in the beginning unless the commander researches it. A down side of being an alien is that you get no good upgrades such as ""Leap"", ""Carapace"", or ""Celerity"" to increase your survivalability until your commander decides to grant it to the team. However, don't become too upset with the commander because he is the one who has to place down resource extractors/harvesters and he cannot do this without your assistance. Resources are crucial to both you and your team's commander because the resources are the only form of currency allowing you to buy weapons/upgrades. Remember that Natural Selection 2 is a team-based game and so you should treat it like one.The Commander sees the battlefield from a point of view similar to that of Starcraft. He is looking down on the players in his team and can click on a convenient menu to spawn in buildings, base structures, turrets/whips, weapons, helpful items for the team, and armor. He has to count on you to achieve his goals. If you are not present to defend a resource extractor/harvester then he will have nobody to defend it and therefore he will not be capable of a gaining a resource tower. This will hurt your team because, as I have previously stated, you need resources to obtain everything you need to beat the enemy team and if you are at a loss of resource towers - the other team probably took those resource towers from you and now their team has the resources that your team failed to keep. If that team with the most resource towers is the Kharaa, then expect to see a slight increase in the Onos/Fade population. If that team with the most resource towers is the Frontiersmen, then expect to see a slight increase in the amount of Exosuits/Jetpacking Marines on the field.Anyway, this is the perfect game for people who enjoy playing team-based games who also love the thought of aliens and humans at war with eachother. This game may be expensive when it is not on sale, but in my opinion it is worth the money. Others may have their own opinions and I have my opinion.			"

												It's not perfect, just like any game, but this is one of, if not the, best game in my library. It's a multiplayer shooter/RTS hybrid, as in; if you're the commander, you have a top down view and can build structures, order troops, and more. Although the two teams, (alien and marine) are completely different, it is balanced better than any game in existence that offers aesymmetical gameplay. The marines are more like your standard shooter, but there's no aim down sights, like many of the best tactical shooters such as CS, but the aliens are the most fun, with their in-mouth view. With the aliens, you can evolve to different species, you start off as a skulk, then, (in order of cost) Gorge, the healer, the Lerk, A flying Creature, The Fade, with it's deadly claws and blink ability. Then there is the Onos, the tank. All these are brought with resources, which you get for capturing res towers and holding them. It's the best multiplayer game I've ever played.			"

It has a few flaws in randomizing teams because one side can get stack very easliy.~Updated Review as of 6/5/2016~Developer are really going into town with their updates and fixing a lot of bugs and making better changes to the change with more customization, more maps and dedicated community to help out.New players are coming in but I recommend the brand new tutorial to grab the feel before jumping into the fray of things.I believe this is really fun MOBA to play with since it doesn't deal with X character having Y powers but more freedom on player's to choose their setup and playstyle.Not all good thing have without it's flaws. There are some annoying spots in certains maps can be very annoying to the other teams. Also Ghosting and hacks are prone here as well. Happy hunting.			"

It has it's problems, it had many more in the past but it's come a huge way performance wise.  The community b***** oft about this being a broken game, but in it's current state it suffers less plaguing issues than many good multiplayer titles period.  I very highly recommend it if you can take the time to look up things on commanding, listen to good players and just learn.  Check out ensl.org.

												Natural Selection 2 (NS2) Is a First person shooter real time strategy  (FPSRTS) game (multiplayer only) It is a game designed for the more hardcore gamers and the learning curve of this game is steep,  however, once you get to know the game and how the mechanics work it is one of the most addictive games around. It is updated reguarly There are tutorials in this game that will give you some of the basics but it is a lot to take in and it will take about 20-30 hours of playtime to get the basics in. Not to worry though, there are plenty of rookie's like yourself out there and there are server designed to help out new players. The game requires an up to date computer with a high-end graphics card to play the game in all it's detail, but even with my GTX660 while playable in the highest settings I prefer to set it on low to gain this extra FPS for aiming. If you're a bit of a hardcore gamer this game can be your next addictive game for a long time, but if you're a casual players and don't have much time to invest, this won't be the game for you. Pro's - Great gameplay combo- Good Graphics- Great community- Price, 2,29 when 90% offCons- Steep learning curve- Requires a fast PC with high end Graphics card "

I still play it and dev's are alway's updating and fixing bug's.8/10would of been 10/10if it was not for the massive hacker's that hit NS2and the dev's where not doing anything about it.			"

												A very ambitious game, one of the coolest team based concepts I've seen in a while. However, be weary of server availabiity in your area! I put this game down quite a while ago. I recall some optimization issues, mainly long load times. I can also recall just being genuinely impressed, so I have to recommend it!			"

												Game seems pretty complicated and time extensive to learn, but it actually isn't, as long as you play as anything but the commander (RTS mode). Community seems more mature and intelligent than you would find in your garden-variety first person shooter, but I only played for a few hours, so could have just lucked out. I've had a lot of fun in this short period of time and I reccommend checking this out if you like co-operative shooters.			"

												The game was good until UWE got back into developing the game, leaving community developers out of the loop.  With each new patch there would always be bugs, from lag and red plug to hits not registering, and lighting changes making rooms too dark.  Invest resources into helping the community developers work towards making a game that the small gaming community that is left would like to see instead of coming back after years to break the game and the community.

												This is a great game. But the community is dead. You will see less than 50 players on at any time on ALL public servers combined. I would reccomend it on solid graphics and gameplay. But it's so hard to get into a game with decent ping, play with people who will listen to your commander, and not play with a narcisistic smurf. Save your money, because this is a game where you think a bit. And mostly people would rather play a WoW faceroll than be challenged. As a result with no hyperbole this game is effectivly dead.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a amazing concept and makes for amazing game play especially if you have friends. A lot of people complain about the community being “Too Veteran” or “God-Like” and that makes it hard for new players. I say that this is true, but they can't help it if they have played the game for so long. If you are completely new, I recommend Bot matches against the computer even if others don't recommend itBot matches are not designed to be challenging for veterans, but if you are new they are very helpful. They allow you to explore the games systems and try-out everything. Things that may be too expensive for you to risk buying in a real match in fear of screwing up. The hardest difficulty Bot matches actually are challenging for new players so don't listen to people who say “Playing Bot matches will ruin your skills forever” or stupid comments like that because they are not true.Once you are ready (which can take a load of bot matches to reach), try a easy multilayer match and see how you go. Even if you lose you can learn from the experience.Don't fall into the trap of buying the game, getting really exited, immediately joining a multiplayer match, get totally destroyed by other players and then stop playing the game because its “too hard”. If you are desperate for some multilayer action you can try to create a server (if you know how ;_;) or join a empty server and invite your friends. Really great game! Just don't be surprised about the difficulty level. It is a hard game!			"

												This is my very first review on Steam and, unfortunately, I will not recommend to buy this game. I purchased the game some time ago but I had problems with my NVidia + Linux combo until a few days ago when I updated my drivers. The first experience of going through a training is pretty OK-ish, but when it comes to the multiplayer, the game can be thrown away.Constant timeout errors prevented me from connecting to ANY of the game servers. I have NEVER had any problems with OTHER online games. This game requires a VERY SPECIAL treatment for the multiplayer to work. I am not kidding here, the official support forum actually has quite a lot of posts on how to tune/configure your routers to be able to play this game. Have you ever seen anything like that? You need to configure your router to be abler to play a game (i.e., to workaround problems of poor software design and implementation of the multiplayer components of the game).Considering that the multiplayer is the main backbone and the main problem of this game, I can say - this game is unplayable. Considering the size of the NS2 dev team (9 ppl), the amount of patches (200+) they delivered on Steam and the fact that the problem is still (after several years) not resolved, I can say - the problem will not be resolved (i.e., it will require resources that the dev team does not have since they already in the maintenance mode and money are not coming anymore).To summarize: the game is broken, dead and abandoned. Do not buy it.			"

												Fun to play, but game quality varies for each server. Commanders are often verbally assulted if they do not play up to par. I would recommend playing as a foot soldier to allow for a more stress free play. If you like RTS games then the commander chair is for you. Be sure to do some research on it before you play, because it can be overwhelming for first or second time commanders. While the first few games can be confusing, once you get the hang of it the game becomes pretty entertaining. Learning the hotkeys for pings and audio chat would be useful as well to ease communication between you and your team. Overall fun game, and can be really fun for a long time.			"

												NS2 is a great game for what it is, but be prepared to; A: have a decent computer to play it on (I recommend a minimum of a 3.6GHz processor, 6gb RAM, and a GeForce 780 2gb or newer; B:  be prepared to spend a fair amount of time overcoming the learning curve.  You will need to practice practice practice if you want to get good, even just playing it 5 hours a week would likely only leave you ""okay"" for a long while.  The game rewards accuracy, twitch reaction speed, strategic playstyles, and teamwork.  With the exception of the twitch reaction speed (I have a fine motor deficit that makes twitch speed hard for me) , I find all of these things to be good things.  You will find the two team types to be fairly well balanced, though at lower skill levels the Aliens may seem a tad more powerful (even then it is by very little, I think I averaged 58/42 Alien/Human when I was learning the ropes), but the humans tend to take a few more games in the higher skill levels (with the midground being fairly well 50/50).  The humans get enough cool weapons and gadgets to let you find a playstyle that fits you (though make sure your Commander knows any specific things you want researched or you may not get your prefered loadout), and the Aliens all play differently from each other with their own set of morphs that serve as battlefield upgrades.The only reasons I would tell someone not to buy this game is if they don't have a beefy enough system to run it properly, the person doesn't like sticking with the team and wants to run off to fight solo (this will almost always end in a quick death for said player), or you just won't be playing regularly enough to grow in skill (you need to have at least 2 hours every week while you are playing, in my opinion, to ensure that you are not stuck being a target to more skilled players all the time).  Other than that, if you like cooporative squad tactical shooters, this is probably going to be right up your alley.			"

Marine is great if you love your FPS, movement is fluid, weapons excelent and exos great fun. Aliens are what makes this game its own, incredibly fun to play, easy to learn yet hard to master. Buy this game if your over the same old FPS games doing the same old things and are ready to rack up some serious hours. Majority of the community is very welcoming towards newbies and are more than willing to help, but as with all games you can find one or two ♥♥♥♥-heads that will remain to be ♥♥♥♥-heads.

												Counter-Strike meets Starcraft. Marines have ranged weapons, explosives and siege artillery. Aliens have teeth, claws, speed and excessive maneuverability, and range in size from cat to rhinoceros. Marines structures require power to function.Alien structures build on infestation and slowly die when it subsides.Each team has a commander that manages sturctures and upgrades via a top-down view.Natural Selection is the single most thrilling, most competitive first person shooter I have ever played since the release of its Half-Life 1 mod in the mid 2000s. Sure, Battlefield delivers large-scale modern warfare in life-like graphics and SFX, but it fails nonetheless (like any other FPS I could think of) to implement half incredible teamplay potential that Natural Selection does! Basically, you have a team of marines on one side of the map and an alien Hive on the other. The alien Hive is where the eggs spawn, and the aliens will aim to optimally build three or more Hives to unlock all their upgrades and reach full strength. It's up to the marines to eliminate the aliens before the situation spins out of control. The game goes by controlling the map's resource nodes (scattered evenly between the 8-12 rooms that make up each map) in order to unlock higher weapons/lifeforms and upgrades faster, and ultimately kill all the enemy's command structures (the alien Hive or marine Command Center). And what makes it so full of heat is how quickly a single move could change the tide of battle! Both teams have structures made for quick commuting: teleporters for marines and underground tunnels for aliens. If used correctly, your entire team could be in the enemy base in less than 20 seconds. Normally, the marines have to set up and DEFEND teleporters at Hive entrance chokepoints to suffocate the aliens by constantly teleporting in and damaging the Hive while preventing the aliens from scattering all over the map. The aliens on the other hand are better at sneak attacks; eliminating lonely marine resource nodes and setting up ""sneaky tunnels.""When the aliens successfully lay a tunnel to the marine base undetected, their whole team could be in the marine base in less than 15 seconds! And then it's up to the marine commander to trigger the Distress Beacon to teleport all marines back in time or else the base would be overrun. But even when the base is defended successfully, the aliens will usually utilize this mass relocation of the marines to eliminate their structures somewhere else on the map!The aliens also have the choice whether to destroy the marine structures in each room or to aim for the power node, which, once broken, conceals the room in pitch black darkness and disables all marine structures in it. Up until the red emergency lights come online, the only thing any rines in the room can see is whatever crosses the thin strip of flashlight that they have.			"

												Great on paper but a buggy, glitchy, obtuse and convoluted game overall. What's the point of a shooter if the shooting ain't fun and exciting to begin with? There's barely any satisfactory gun feedback. The enemy animations are risible and the way they attack/charge at you from like 5 meters away it's just silly. NS2 features one of the most unnecessarily intricate level designs I've seen in my entire gaming life for these type of shooters, there's no flow to them, it's a chore to travel back and forth between rooms, it's a labyrinthic mess. The engine, as far as I know, it's not based on UE3 so 'featuring' texture pop-in -that takes even minutes to load- it's even more bizarre. The performance is terrible overall, very unoptimized and it doesn't look that hot to begin with, the pictures are really misleading. Add to that the extremely long, annoying load times -even for a training match with bots-.A shame really, it looked like it could have improved on Aliens vs Predator and delivered what Colonial Marines didn't on the MP aspect. Good thing I got it on a Humble Bundle for cheap. But don't listen to Bixby Snyder, don't buy this even for a dollar!			"

												Ideally it's a good game but practically it's impossible to play. There are about two servers in this game always full of players  +4 spectators waiting for the next round to join and if you're lucky enough to play inside, you get 999 ping and the game crashes. Other servers are empty and obviously wont start until there are two commanders in both teams so you basically have nothing to do in this game. It's online only team deathmatch where in total there are about 48 players and unstable servers.			"

												By far and away the best multiplayer experience I've ever had for an FPS and its a strategy game!.. The dynamic between commander / marine and aliens is beautifully balanced in this alien vs marine-esk universe. Nothing is more thrilling or terrifying than an alien hunting you down... the organic feel of a human controlled alien that is hunting you online is irreplaceable and at this point in AI technology cannot be replicated.BUY this game, the DEVs have done an outstanding job with it, just as they had done with NS 1. The game gets updated frequently even after 3 years of its release. 9/10 (a 9 only because the learning curve can be discouraging for new people). Otherwise 10/10			"

												NS2 is a PVP shooter unlike anything you have seen.It doesn't need recoil and spread to make shooting an enjoyable challenge as marine.As Alien you can dodge bullets like neo or stealthily surprise attack an unsuspecting marine from aboveboth sides are a real test of your reflexes and mindplayand if you just want to manage everything you can play Commander, place buildings, unlock weapons and skills: you control how your team should play.Aliens and Marines have dozends of skills and classes that change the way you play dramaticallybecome a swift winged beast or a rhino like killng machine, grab a jetpack and shotgun and never miss a shot in the heat of battle or control a mech walker with huge guns and armor. or just support your team with heals, repairs, constructing or building smaller support structures without needing to command.There are many ways to individualise your playstyleThe game is to this day being patched and balanced by people from the Community, so it is a very bug free and fair experience (if your teams have comparable gameplay experience of course).if you are not sure if the game is for you, you should mark it for later, it has been on -75% sale quite often so far. and cheap keys from sales are being sold on other sites as well.

												So you start a game, you spawn as a Marine. You get eaten by gorges. You spawn again. Your commander shouts. You somehow kill a piggy. You are eaten by a giant. Take a break. Have a coffe. Spawn again. The commander still shouts. You repair with one hand you shoot with the other. You have no more hands. You have enough. You spawn as gorge. You chill out on a vent, biting some Marine @ss from time to time. Vents are cool. You make friends, you evolve. You get bigger till you look like a freakin rhino who f.cked an elephant. You dont fit in the vents anymore, but it's okay, NOW YOU CAN STOMP! Love the game!			"

												A great Teamoriented Multiplayer-only RTS/FPS-hybrid with asymmetrical teams. A game where teamwork is a must to win and a mic more or less mandatory. I have had a blast in this game even though I have primarly played with random people. Everyone I have encountered so far is polite and taking the games serious. The game is kind of hard to explain but you could say it is like a FPS-version of StarCraft, where you can play as the commander or the footsoldier. The best way to understand the game is to check out a couple of video reviews. But I strongly recommend this game!Shameless update: Because of the Steam Awards I have nominated this game in to my category ""The most underappreciated Multiplayer Game"" because...well it is. I am still having fun with this game 4 years after release even though I only play it every fortnight. And it's better than ever.			"

												This game is a fantastic blend of RTS and FPS with the players choice dictating how they play. The Alien and Marine teams aren't exactly equal as the Marines have more ranged weapons and the Aliens have melee and close ranged attacks along with two or three ranged attacks and also have a greater utilization of the map as they can climb walls and enter vents. The commander plays it like an RTS yet each unit is an actual player. It's a fantastic game that requires some team play and lets you really get invested in each match. You will soon find the team and weapons that suit you and you'll fit comfortabley right into the game. If you ever played Tremulous or Gloom, which are amazing mods based off the same concept as they were the first to try this split team dynamic, then you will certainly enjoy this updated version of the classic style of FPS.

How does the multiplayer, well, play?It is actually quite a nice blend of strategy and first person carnage, each team has a commander, it’s up to the commander to distribute orders for both buildings and troops and also upgrade their soldiers to be the best they can be in a battle. Now this does take a bit of skill, a dash of map knowledge and a whole heaping of luck, to get a good team of experienced players that is. Sounds a bit intimidating doesn't it, stop being such a baby, there’s a very instructive tutorial you can play through before you jump into the action for both Alien and Marine commanders and also their infantry counterparts.Speaking of the infantry, they're pretty fun to play as also, at first the gameplay will feel a bit hectic, the map is bigger than your usual CoD map and there are a lot of different angles and vents the Alien horde can come at you from but once you gain a bit of map knowledge and you learn the ropes a little you'll be murdering hundreds and hundreds of Aliens that for all we know might just be expressing their need for a cuddle or a wingman to go to the club with...

												Natural Selection 2 is a very fun and highly addictive FPS/RTS, that is practically a combination of Counterstrike and Command & Conquer. There are two teams, the Kharaa and the Marines, who each have a single leading player known as the Commander. The Commander's purpose is to construct and support the team's advance toward the enemy through upgrade researches and structures. The Commander can also ""call-the-shots"" by coming up with strategies for the team, depending on how well they communicate. The other players on the team are the combatants. They are the ones carrying the weapons, making good use of their commander's upgrades and helping to construct structures their commander has placed down. Surprisingly, Natural Selection 2 requires quite a large amount of effort from players in order to effectively defeat the enemy. From my experience, it is near impossible to make every bullet count, or to land every bite into the enemy, despite how effective one would be in a different game, such as Counterstrike. In contrast, the players in NS2 are moving around quickly and constantly in all possible directions, making certain situations very confusing. Nevertheless, practice makes perfect, and the goal of the game is to have fun, not to become the best player the game has. Natural Selection 2 is a great choice for anyone who enjoys alien versus soldier strategy games.			"

Immense multiplayer replayablility as you learn the game mechanics and how to play each facton (Aliens & Marines) and class (Skulks/Gorges/Lerks/Fades/Onos and LMG Marine/Shotgun Marine/Advanced Weapon Marine/Jetpack Marine/Exos). Learning to be a Commander on each side makes the game even more addictive. Dedicated Rookie friendly servers are usually very helpful to noobs. You get to know the people on your preferred servers and how they play. Expect tons of enthusiasm and triumphant yells over the in game voice. I was initially a little skeptical of buying as I hadn't heard of it before, and FPS's are not my usual genre. But then I was blown away at how good the game actually was. Definately a 10/10 game.

												I didn't have any clue what I was expecting when I bought this game from the summer sale and the only thing I knew of this game was from trailers a few years ago. When I began playing this game I realized I had no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clue what I was doing, even after playing the tutorials, since the tutorials leave out a lot of finer details that everyone should know. When I started my 1st multiplayer game I was incredibly confused, I tried to play it like aliens vs predator, just trying to rack up my kills and I thought that was the way to win, but I soon realized killing things is just a side objective in the game as everyone respawns very quickly and you wont get far by just killing aliens and marines. After I realized that the game plays out more like a RTS game where the main targets are your enemies structures I actually began to contribute to our team by playing as a support class. After that initial haze of confusion I began to have a lot of fun with the game itself. Most of the mechanics are very well polished and balanced, although if your team has a poor commander prepare to lose, since the commander is the person who orders you to push, builds structures and assists you on the ground. Therefore it goes without saying teamwork is a huge part of natural selection 2. You have to communicate with your team and you need to coordinate your attacks, otherwise your team will be a complete utter mess, you really can't go solo'ing in this game like in most games, since you will be annihilated in most situations if you do.Both of the teams are very well distinguished, in both combat, buildings and overall gameplay. So you really have to develope new techniques depending on wich team you are playing on. There is also a fairly large community of players playing this game around the clock so you wont have any trouble finding company either. It is really a great game as long as you have a mic. I have olny played it for 20 hours as of now, but I am sure it will provide many, many more hours of entertainment.As I am writing this the game is on a 75% discount, which is an absolute bargain for this game, get it now!

												I believe Natural Selection 2 is a masterpiece of a game, that represents the perfect blend of FPS and RTS game play. It is one of the few games where teamwork and individual skill are highly rewarded. On top of that, the community is accepting of new players and offers a friendly hand to educate those who are new.Due to the fact that Natural Selection 2 is a hybrid of FPS and RTS game play, it allows for very competitive play in that the deciding factor of victory and defeat involves the long term decisions of a commander and/or the quick reactions and overall skill of the individual combatants (whether shooting aliens, or stalking marines). Due to this style of game play, games can very well last over an hour and yet feel very ""tight"" throughout the entire match.However, as of now, there is a lack of a ranked match system. The fact that the average game easily lasts over 20 minutes, and longer games tend to last for at least an hour, a very serious deciding factor of the winner is simply how many players leave and join the game. I understand that this is not really a game breaking problem, however due to the fact that players do not have much ""loyalty"" to their respective team, and the fact that the average match is rather lengthy, if a number of ""pro"" players join or leave the match during the middle of the game, it could drastically change the fate of the match instantly. I believe that having a sort of ranked match system, like that in Counter Strike: Global Offensive, will serve a very competitive game like Natural Selection 2 justice. Having ranked matches will also remove the occasional ""newb stomping"" matches, where there is a skill-based team stack.The game features asymmetrical teams with very different game play styles. This provides for a different style of FPS game play, and not the traditional shooter vs shooter like in most FPS games. I believe that because of this asymmetry, it expands the average gamer's experiences about FPS games in general. However, in Natural Selection 2, because it is also an RTS hybrid, a player could choose from essentially four game play experiences within one match alone which highly increases the game's overall learning curve. These four game play ""roles"" are: Marine commander, Marine player, Alien commander, and Alien player. Each type of ""role"" presents new strategies and information upon which the player has to know, and ultimately, having a sense of all the 4 roles is the minimum requirement for being ""decent"" in the game. Overall, having asymmetrical teams can interest those who are tired of the same-old shooter vs shooter, and because Natural Selection 2 is an asymmetrical FPS/RTS hybrid, such game play increases the overall learning curve to become fully understanding of every aspect, tactics and counter-tactics within the game.Do not let the lack of a ranked match system and rather difficult learning curve stop you from playing this game however. The lack of a ranked match system simply means that Natural Selection 2 is always going to be played on a ""casual"" game play setting, which many FPS games have. The difficult learning curve is also easily passed if one simply spends about a good 2 hours playing in a sandbox training server by themselves, learning all of the abilities, techniques, tech-trees, map-knowledge, weapons, and life forms to get that ""full"" understanding of the 4 game play ""roles"" I mentioned earlier. Furthermore, if you still need further clarification and help, the overall community in Natural Selection 2 servers are kind, vocal, and willing to help those who ask.I believe that Natural Selection 2 marks the standard for all asymmetrical and even symmetrical FPS/RTS hybrid games in the future. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, especially those with a background in playing other FPS and RTS games as they could easily apply their knowledge of both game genres into their Natural Selection 2 game play.

												On one hand Natural Selection 2 is a fast-paced tactical shooter that relies heavily on teamwork and communication. On the other hand it's an intense asymmetrical real-time strategy game where being able to micromanage your units is just the beginning. These lead to intense gameplay scenarios where every player has a drastic impact on the outcome of the game. Natural Selection 2 represents a unique genre and does so extremely well. You have to try this!			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a very fun and highly addictive FPS/RTS, that is practically a combination of Counterstrike and Command & Conquer. There are two teams, the Kharaa and the Marines, who each have a single leading player known as the Commander. The Commander's purpose is to construct and support the team's advance toward the enemy through upgrade researches and structures. The Commander can also ""call-the-shots"" by coming up with strategies for the team, depending on how well they communicate. The other players on the team are the combatants. They are the ones carrying the weapons, making good use of their commander's upgrades and helping to construct structures their commander has placed down. Surprisingly, Natural Selection 2 requires quite a large amount of effort from players in order to effectively defeat the enemy. From my experience, it is near impossible to make every bullet count, or to land every bite into the enemy, despite how effective one would be in a different game, such as Counterstrike. In contrast, the players in NS2 are moving around quickly and constantly in all possible directions, making certain situations very confusing. Nevertheless, practice makes perfect, and the goal of the game is to have fun, not to become the best player the game has. Natural Selection 2 is a great choice for anyone who enjoys alien versus soldier strategy games.			"

												I didn't have any clue what I was expecting when I bought this game from the summer sale and the only thing I knew of this game was from trailers a few years ago. When I began playing this game I realized I had no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clue what I was doing, even after playing the tutorials, since the tutorials leave out a lot of finer details that everyone should know. When I started my 1st multiplayer game I was incredibly confused, I tried to play it like aliens vs predator, just trying to rack up my kills and I thought that was the way to win, but I soon realized killing things is just a side objective in the game as everyone respawns very quickly and you wont get far by just killing aliens and marines. After I realized that the game plays out more like a RTS game where the main targets are your enemies structures I actually began to contribute to our team by playing as a support class. After that initial haze of confusion I began to have a lot of fun with the game itself. Most of the mechanics are very well polished and balanced, although if your team has a poor commander prepare to lose, since the commander is the person who orders you to push, builds structures and assists you on the ground. Therefore it goes without saying teamwork is a huge part of natural selection 2. You have to communicate with your team and you need to coordinate your attacks, otherwise your team will be a complete utter mess, you really can't go solo'ing in this game like in most games, since you will be annihilated in most situations if you do.Both of the teams are very well distinguished, in both combat, buildings and overall gameplay. So you really have to develope new techniques depending on wich team you are playing on. There is also a fairly large community of players playing this game around the clock so you wont have any trouble finding company either. It is really a great game as long as you have a mic. I have olny played it for 20 hours as of now, but I am sure it will provide many, many more hours of entertainment.As I am writing this the game is on a 75% discount, which is an absolute bargain for this game, get it now!

												Natural Selection 2 is a great game, it can be hard to learn, hard to play at times, but once you get through that barrier then you will see how much of a great game this is, All the Negative reviews lately comes down to some users not liking some changes being made by the Dev's - They now support Large player count servers 42 players etc. as a game mod called NS2 LARGE,Before UWE did not support them, with these users they Threatened to give only Negative reviews of this game until that change is reverted, as they feel this killed their server. Just one server. That was only moved to another server mode filter.This is a great game, and these recent reviews are damaging enough for any new players looking at them, IF you are looking for a new game, something challenging then this is for you, you won’t notice any of these recent changes as they will all be still new to you, give this game a go, you won’t regret it.

												Realy fun game, once you get the hang of it.A match can last from 2 minutes (poor balanced teams) to ~45 minutes (good balanced teams), but stands on an avarage of ~30 minutes per match. Before joining a NS2 match everyone should know that this is no deathmatch or tdm. This game mode is a combination of tactical and strategical gameplay.The key for victory in this game is communication between the team, even if you are a bad shoot.Beeing aware and knowing were and when to go can make the difference between win/loss and kill/death ratio.For my part I enjoy the alien lifeforms most, which rather rely on speed, stealth and clever gameplay with different playstyle.But the Marines do not stand behind with nice gadgets, like jetpacks, flamethrowers or exosuits with miniguns or railguns.But there are some things to learn before anyone can think of having a nice K/D ratio, so I recommend watching some basic tutorials.Even more I recommend using the ingame voice chat to ask questions if you are having difficulty in understandig the game or don't know what to do.The differention of rookie servers(marked green) and experienced servers(marked white) is a nice feature, and asking for help understanding the game is never wrong.

The plentiful maps combined with the role of the commanders make for both interesting and dynamic gameplay. I have only 2 complaints:1. The map can become very busy and ambigious especially when first playing the game.2. Commanders, especially those with German accents tend to shout an awful lot for not following orders.

												This game excels at merging the FPS and RTS genres. It is thoroughly enjoyable that also rewards coordination and teamwork. The plentiful maps combined with the role of the commanders make for both interesting and dynamic gameplay. I have only 2 complaints:1. The map can become very busy and ambigious especially when first playing the game.2. Commanders, especially those with German accents tend to shout an awful lot for not following orders. You are a gamer, not Heinz Guderian.			"

												This game is a true competitive FPS. Natural Selection 2 is an extremely underated game. It combines FPS action with RTS elements to make one of the most unique games you'll ever play.  I've sunk in nearly 800 hours so far and I can honestly say every round I have played has been different. Rookies tend to get discouraged at first because of the steep learning curve, but stick with it for a couple of hours and you will NEVER want to play anything remotely similiar to CoD or BF. I could sit here and go on and on about how great this game is and how it deserves much more attention. Instead I will throw a couple of negative things out there to be fair.The optimization is pretty bad. You don't need a super computer to run it or anything. Personally, I play on a three year old laptop. i7 2.3 Ghz8 Gb Ram660M GTXI can still normally run games on at least medium settings, but not Natural Selection 2. Even on mostly low settings, I only average 35 FPS. Another problem seems to be hit registration. There have been many times where I've shot lifeforms point blank (and see alien blood) yet I ended up doing zero damage. Other times, I'm an alien WELL around a corner and I'm still taking bullet damage.Those are my only two complaints. Do they keep me from playing? Obviously not. Is it gamebreaking? No. Should you get this game? No question.			"

												An team based FPS (and an RTS of sorts for your commander) where you fight over terriotry and resources. The game sports one team of human marines who rely heavily on their technoloy and weapons, and another team made of a gaggle of aliens each with their own strenghts and weaknesses and the ability to mutate which can drastically change gameplay. The game has quite the steep learning curve however there are tutorial and the ocmmunity can be very helpful. it stands to mention that the team behind this game has been releasing DLC free of charge and thats something that should be commended.

												This game is my absolute favorite of all time. But first I must warn you that this game have a HIGH learning curve! So please take your time to learn the game. Watch some tutorials. Play some games. Ask for help! I usually view anyone with less than 100 hours as a rookie. But just stay on the green servers for that time. And do not feel discouraged if you don't get many kills in the beginning. This game is not about killing. It's about team work! Once that is said. Then I can only recommend this game. Knowing that it isn't for everyone. But there are many roles that needs to be filled in this game. So there are plenty of room for whatever you like. Buy it. And have fun :) Or work your way up to the competitive players.			"

												I don't normally play First Person Shooters, but this is an exception! Natural Selection two is a First Person Shooter/Real Time Strategy game. There are two sides: Aliens and Marines. Both sides have unique elements that separate them from the other faction. Each faction has their own commander. All of the players, aside from the commanders, are essentially playing a FPS. The commanders, however, are playing a RTS. The commander, as the name states, tells the other players what to do. The other players are not forced to do what the commander says, so this is a very team-oriented game. The commander also researches upgrades for the other players and can build structures. Being a commander requires a lot of knowledge about the game, so I wouldn't recommend being the commander until you have at least a general understanding of the game. The goal isn't to get as many kills in a certain period of time; instead, each side needs to destroy the other's base. Most games last 30-50 minutes, and there are no penalties for leaving early. Players can also join a game mid-way through. In my eyes, this is a pro since I don't always have the time to play an entire game. I feel like this game was exceptionally well done and offers a unique concept that keeps me coming back for more.			"

												A very well put together RTS/FPS Hybrid in a sci-fi setting with 3D-printed people, railguns and one hell of a bacterial infection. The game features asymmetrical combat between the more traditional marines who play as you would expect with typical shooter fare such as LMGs (the defauilt gun), shotguns and grenades. Reliant upon squad tactics and logistical support the marines may be more familiar, but require solid aim and awareness.The alien infestation are worlds apart, with a mix of disposable skulks, dog like aliens very similar in play to runner aliens from the early AvP games; through to Fades and Onoses, much more specialised lifeforms that are important to keep alive. The aliens are build around hit an run tactics and guerilla warfare; breaking supply and picking off isolated pockets to keep the marines on the defensive.The RTS aspect is really what makes the game special, there is macro and micro required. Commanders (limited to one lucky person per side) placing Resource Towers to allow marines to get new weapons and upgrades and aliens to evolve, and also being able to provide more direct help to his footsoldiers by dropping medpacks, ammo and scans.The game is very slick without being dumbed down, and is based on team work and strong tactics without being clunky. The game looks beautiful, but that has not been at the expense of gameplay.The one thing I cannot account for is the community, whilst I have had mostly positive experiences the game relies upon teamwork; thus, people not working as part of the team or following the commander's suggestions will be dead weight, something that will get on everybody's nerves. Rokkies are flagged up, and the developers have tried to encourage a forgiving environment, but trust me when I say there is one golden rule...Do as you are asked: you will have a lot more fun that way.

												OK, So i am editing this after a long hiatus from the game. I have played this game more than most other people.I tried to introduce some new players to the game recently, and i don't believe either were sold on the game, with the main complaints being : ""its hard to aim the guns cause the targets move so fast and are so small."" and ""its hard to understand the strategy in the game, cause its so complicated.""One experience which really led me to the conclusion that the strategy is hard to grasp, is the frequency with which i was the only one on my team who realised we had just lost, or won a game.My opinion is that they released this game too early, at a time where to get decent FPS during combat a PC of ridiculous spec was required, most people had a bad time playing the game at this point.These days, it is well optimised and running on machines that didn't exist when it was released, it is an incredibly smooth play, i get a buttery smooth 144fps.Because this game was released in an unfinished state, MAJOR changes were made to the game after its release, which completely destroyed any chance the game had. The addition of gorge tunnels was particularly irritating to me personally (as it made the teams less diverse).There were other major changes, i have to admit i wasn't a fan of this chopping and changing, because i have put so much time and energy into maximising the efficiency of my strategy, only to have to start over from scratch on the next update.This, was what eventually led me to leave the game, near the introduction of gorge tunnels.After a couple of years break from the game, i have come back. The game is well optimised now, the combat is snappy and enjoyable, the strategy hasn't been messed with. I could play this game, if there were enough other people playing it! This is a VERY GOOD GAME, I don't think there is a skill ceiling for the strategy and combat, if there is, i haven't reached it !This game trains your aim, hearing, and combat sense. After playing in this game, go and play counterstrike and see how much easier the aiming seems.If you like games where you have to have incredible aim, and a deep understanding of strategy, this game is for you! Oh, and also get a microphone, or don't buy the game :)			"

												This is an amazing  game in every way. If you're willing to invest some time and patience into learning and mastering this unique playstyle and all the different aspects of it, you'll be blown away by the incredible gameplay and fun that's waiting to be had with NS2.The graphics and art are beautiful, sure there are some better looking games out there (not that many) but everything in this game was crafted with attention to detail and immersion. The environments feel ""lived in"" and tell a story. The dynamic lights and assets (such as infestation) will allow you to visually see and feel the progression of a match. You will get fully immersed and invested into each match.Even the best looking games out there do not tell a story with their graphics the way NS2 does. This puts it in a league of its own.See for yourself:http://imgur.com/a/ZP9QV(those screenshots aren't even on the highest settings)The gameplay is demanding and intimidating for newcomers. You might feel disinterested or disconnected from the game at first, simply because you can't contribute much to the experience. This is something you just have to deal with for a few hours. Find good servers with friendly people, ask for advice and listen carefully, let them know you're new and eager to learn.Once you're over that initial hump, you will find yourself in a world with seemingly endless possibilities and strategies. I suggest you make some friends, play with the people you feel comfortable with, join servers and teams with them. A lot of the experience and the fun comes down to working as a team.Hardware requirements:I see a lot of complaints about endless loading times and poor framerates. Alright, this is not THE best engine ever made. But it is FAR from being bad. Let's keep in mind this is an indie game, made by a few people with no budget. Considering that, I think the engine deserves nothing but praise.Yes the loading times are somewhat long and even high end systems can be pushed to their limits, but there are good reasons for that. This is an insanely complex game, to be honest it's more like 2 games wrapped in one!The maps are huge and detailed. All those complex mechanics mentioned above need to be processed in real time. You simply cannot compare the performance to other FPS games, its a whole different beast. Thus the high system load is more than justified.Furthermore, 90% of those complaints are highly exaggerated, these people are either used to cheap CoD like console ports or have hardware that should sit in a history museum.Final words:NS2 comes down to what YOU do with it. It's a lot like giving you the keys to the Lamborghini. You can go and crash it, or learn how to drive it and unleash its full potential.			"

												Kinda just my thoughts on the game right now. Gonna try to play it again, havent in probably half a year, but yeah...I love shooters and I love rts games. This game is basically the child of those 2 genres. I like shooters with strange or different movement styles and melee combat, which this game has, but I also like the occasional pew pew rifle or pellet gun.The marines - I think the gun play is great, even if at times you are just gunning down a rhino gorrilla. The meat shots on the shotguns, when you can hit them, feels amazing. Direct hits on smaller aliens with the grenade launcher also gives me an erection. The flamethrower, when you just don't want to aim. And then there are the mech suits, the hulking  pieces of armor that attract...too much attention, even if they can gun down tons of aliens, they can still be overrun. The aliens - I liked starcraft 2, and zerg was my favorite race. These are like them with some changes. Skulks climbing on walls and ceiling waiting to ambush the cautious marine, the gorge just supporting and being cute, the lerk being an annoying birb, the fade drive-bys, and the onos just coming in and killing anything in its path, that is if you stay in its path.This is one game I couldn't play for about 2 years due to the fact my old PC wasn't strong enough, and even when I first played when there wasn't much of a community left, it was still fun. It was probably harder to learn, since most people that still play have played longer than i have, and they are more likely at a higher skill level than I, but I still was able to learn slowly but surely. That is one thing, though, that may shy you away from trying it, but if you are willing to learn the game it will get fun.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a beautifully designed game, and one of the original reasons why i got into pc gaming. There is so much to offer in this game, beautiful visuals and a overall fun playing experiance. The game can be difficult for new players but it does not take that long to get accustomed to the maps and how to play, being there is a certain amount of strategy involved in this game, you cant just go run around as a lone wolf team work is needed. But overall this game is a large amount of fun and is worth the 6 dollars to buy i would even say its worth it at full price being you can put hundreds of hours into this game and rarely ever get bored. They are also still updating this game adding newer content. Get it when its cheap! :D			"

												Could have been a great game. But the user base got destroyed by making it too complicated in some aspects and too shallow and simple in others. Also the many blowout sales made it near impossible to play it for weeks since the server got flooded with absolutely clueless nubs horribly unbalancing every game. And on the other hand the devs catered only to top and veteran players.So that's what the game is lacking mostly at the moment: balance.And in due time it will lack the other important factor: players.I lovedthis game and it's sad to see it die for no good reason.

												One of the most fun and interesting multiplayer shooters.

Playing as aliens is nothing like playing marines. Moreover, commanding makes the game actually a Real Time Strategy with other players as your units!

Nonetheless, there's a lot to enjoy in this game when played as FPP too. Not only because every unit (as aliens) and every different weapon (as humans) changes the style of the gameplay, but also because the game is quite intense and atmospheric (this is probably the best looking game I have ever seen too!).

It's very tactical, matches take long if done right and it's pretty balanced.The problems are: it runs pretty bad, it's not very accesible.Make sure to watch some introductory video's !! not just play the tutorial !!This game is hard to learn.I give it a 7/10 (better than CS:GO)			"

												this game is onestly one of the most amazing team co-oparation games you can buying in 2016, because unlike other types of games, this game doesn't use microtranactions to make money or add a large amount of dlc, instead they use skins, which do no imapact effect on the gameplay (well the Reaper Onons is something you would'nt want to see uncloking right in front of your face!)this game is saidly losing it's players fast and the only main way you can find a full server is by looking for almost full ones or joining other lanuage based servers.mastering the aliens and understanding the commanders on both sides is also just as fun as been two shot via stalkers at the start of the game.this game has a lot more potenial, but the gameplay makes it a bit of a boring game, sure it's fun but over time the only way you can get the most fun out of it is by playing with friends, all on the same server on the same/different teams on a skype call. (also the lack of weapons is annoying, because in the trailer a marine has a grenade launcher attachment on his rilfe, so that makes me think that they need to add more content onto this game, such as turret upgrades, more marine upgrades,more aliens and different hive parts and so much more)but over all i would recomend this game if you like real time games and no recoil gun games or pogostick alien simulators!

												This was a game I was extremely excited about when TotalBiscuit review it with the game developers a few years ago.It was really fun too, for a while.But as time went by, a lot of veteran players started almost bullying new players.It's not a noob friendly game, is what I'm saying.Your teammates are way too bossy at times, nobody lets you do your own thing, do you own decisions.No you have to do what they want you to do.""Don't hang around there. What are you doing that for?""Even on ""Rookie Friendly"" servers you don't get a break.I'm all about being taught, but when I try to learn being a Commander, I don't learn from people calling me ""♥♥♥♥ing Noob Commander"" and countless votes to eject me from Command.Maybe, I had some bad luck a few games, so if you think you can handle stuff like this, then go ahead and buy the game, if you wanted it.Let me just warn other Swedes looking at it, there are very few servers to play on.I saw maybe 4 [Swe] servers up.It's not like Team Fortress, where you click Quick Play and you get sent to a server that works.NS2s ""Quick Join"" option only sends you to your last played server, which it will drop you from if it's full.Again, maybe I had bad luck with my games, if you have a highed stress tolerance, then go for it.It can actually be a fun game when you find the right people to play with.

												Natural Selection 2 has a  learning curve like al wall, which is tough. However, if you climb over that wall, or power through it, you are rewarded with a game that has all the elements of an epic gaming experience: Team play, Tatics, shooter skill. The fact that the teams are asymetric is an opportunity to master two sides of combat, having that great experience twice. And then there is the commanding position to learn. All these experiences added up make this game on of the best deals on Steam!			"

												I purchased this game back when the mega pack was on sale in November last year. It looked very interesting to play with the fps/rts elements within it. Back THEN I could log-in, load the server list up, pick just about any server I wanted, and then play. Siege was a lot of fun and kept me coming back for a couple of months. However I can't recommend this game I bought less than a year ago because: 1. Player population dropped significantly.                2. 80% of the games servers are completely empty.                3. Nearly every server nowadays is literally in the 200+Ping redzone.                4. They got rid of Siege gamemode and mostly favored making the game more difficult for an already tough game.I enjoyed it greatly, the community at the time was fun to play with. People strategized and worked together at the time, but unfortunately those days are gone.I do hope the server populations increase, the game gets better balanced, and siege comes back. But other than that this game is literally un-playable.			"

												One word to describe NS2: unique. So what does it offer?- hybrid FPS/RTS (the only other game I know about that does the same is Nuclear Dawn, but ND has been abandonned    by its devs and is pretty much dead)- two completely different teams with different upgrades, tech trees, weapons, etc. encouraging different strategies- a lot of room for in-depth teamwork- each match is different, even on the same map = high replay value (btw maps are awesome)- unlike most RTS, NS2 allows for surprising comebacks (too many careless mistakes by players with high value classes/equipment can cripple the winning team very hard)- high skill ceiling (play with people of same skill or you'll be frustrated)- constant updatesMany of the old negative reviews do not apply anymore, as the game now puts you against people of same skill. I got this game when it was on sale for 5€, but to be honest even 10€ is a joke. Steam is full of ♥♥♥♥ games which are more expensive and don't even get close to the amount of content and replay value that NS2 offers.Don't get confused by the DLC, as I did. NS2 is not pay to win, everything is unlocked in the game. The DLCs are only skins, and most likely they will disappear soon anyways (one already did) due to the new NS2 item store. So expect more customization possibilites in the future. If you think about buying this: do it. There simply is no other game like this.			"

												Its not bad, certainly refreshing to see a bit of RTS added into a FPS. With multiplayer you really do need a good commander on your side otherwise you will lose, its that simple. I came here from an article on PC Gamer - wasn't familiar with the title of the game but me and some friends decided to purchase it cheap and give it a go.Great game for teamwork, and also nice to see that Comms is widely used so you'll find most people are there to help. I did feel Marines were useless until the Jetpack mod upgrade, personally the Aliens feel alot stronger at the start - maybe with the correct commander you can earn the Marine capabilities quicker and turn the battle back around. Was nice to be able to play and will be stored in my steam library for more future plays.			"

												This Game Sux. There is no mode that is fun and well put together. there is no Solid single play mode with options and the multiplayer is burdened by horible pings making the select fue people that actually play this with good pings win constantly. You know when you get hit by an aim botter that kills you instantly before you can react to them well thats what pvp is like in this game eccept its the garbage net code that makes it feel like that. There is about 70 people at most playing this at any one time spread scross aprox 3-4 servers and there usually full so geting into the server that has the best ping for you is usually impossible. also the comunity is toxic, always bickering, arguing, and just being all round jerks. A fue are deacent people. This game would be fun at lans but across the internet I would absolutly pass on it.			"

												I haven't played this for quite some time (A few years maybe?), there have been a number of updates I've not seen. So instead, I'll point to the overall mechanics of the game.Assymetrical gameplay is a very brave thing to attempt in a game, even some games that attempted it (e.g Planetside) later flattened the playing field substantially. Playing as an alien in NS2 is fun, traversing vent systems, clinging to ceilings and pouncing on marines is pretty immersive. It's quite interesting to see gameplay from the perspective of 'the alien menace,' when so many other games are about marines etc. hunting down aliens.Marines... I didn't enjoy them so much for personal reasons. If you wandered too far from your teammates you could be cut down very quickly by an even vaguely coordinated pack of skulks. Also quite immersive in that regard. This isn't really a balance issue, it's more about the ability to cooperate.Some of the issues I've read about in other reviews, such as uncooperative teammates, is unfortunately a common gripe with multiplayer. Unless you play together with a group of friends and use TS, someone is always going to ignore the commander and do what they like.When I played at the time the 'Rookie System' didn't seem to do very much. You could join a server that was 'rookie friendly' and still find players much more experienced than you playing there. At the same time,  no one wanted the responsibility of commanding, but were very good at back-seat commanding if you made a mistake.At the time, there was no tutorial. I imagine that's changed, or at least I would hope. There was a 'tutorial' where you could run around a map and had little hud markers explaining what cysts were, power cells and other upgrade structures, but it didn't really explain HOW to play the game. As a result, I feel a lot of people probably didn't pick up competency very quickly and became disenchanted with it.Lastly, there are a number of negative reviews which mention a toxic community. I haven't really had much experience of this myself, but this is going back years now. You should definitely heed those warnings, they seem fairly consistent. Many also reiterate that the game is dead.To summarise; the gameplay is enjoyable, immersive and an interesting step in game design that hopefully will be used as a reference for how to create assymetrical gameplay enjoyable, in the future. However, the community is apparently a small group full of toxicity, so put on your thick skin.I can only recommend this game to people who could convince maybe 20 people to play it with them occasionally. Otherwise, you will probably be disappointed.			"

												Game used to be extremely fun, but over time it got worse and is dead now. Developers pushed the eSports angle pretty hard with balancing, despite the competitive side of it never getting big. So the game was balanced for 6v6, despite most of the player base being in 24+ player servers. When rounds had teams that where evenly matched, the game was fantastic, your team could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat if played well. The only problem is that happened very little, most matches played where just one sided stomps or had one team voting to surrender within the first 5 minutes of the match. New players are treated poorly in servers and they wouldn't get any help or tips from other people.The developer forums were also a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ place in general where asking questions about balancing or game development decisions would be met with a passive aggressive ""Thread locked :)"" from moderators.

												If you start Rocket League, your goal is simple: Get the ball in the other team's goal by bumping it with your car! Everything else is a small accessory to that goal.By comparison, just knowing the basics of Natural Selection 2 is a catacomb of logic. It makes you realize why games like TF2 and even Battlefield now focus on the idea of just having single-objective maps; diverting your focus between the five things going on at any time is often near-impossible. This is combined with very precise control requirements for each of the characters involved. For a marine, a skulk can jump across 30 degrees of your vision in less than half a second, and as any alien, having a constant arena awareness to make use of mobility is an immense challenge.This does two things. The high skill floor causes a massive divide between skill levels. For instance, a bad skulk will get 1 kill in an entire game, and a good skulk will be undefeatable even to basic enemy marines. Second, it causes any team failure to become heavily compounded. If you've played a TF2 game with just one team member AFK, you tend to notice it. In NS2, just having someone not doing 20 things a minute as a commander can screw everyone over.The pressure to perform well moment to moment has, sadly, turned the community pretty sour, much like a game like League of Legends. Even simple failings of the team like failing to act quickly in the face of overwhelming amounts of information (for instance, constant references to named map locations) can cause commanders to exasperate ""Geez, we might as well forfeit, we have NO teamwork going on"". Worse, if the team doesn't vote to concede, a completely lost match will drag on for half an hour with no map change. (Unlike a game like League of Legends, there's just no opportunities for comebacks - the entire resource system of the game encourages the ""rolling wrecking ball"" mentality)Perhaps this game would be fun with months of practice, played solely with players who have similar amounts of experience; but even if you can get that first goal you'd likely just become one of the aforementioned commanders.

												Asymetrical multiplayer shooter.One team plays as marines, similar how marines in 'Alien' universe look like, and they prefer ranged frontal combat and their building require powered rooms (with lights) to function.Aliens on the other hand, prefer melee combat and deception to kill the marines, they use guerilla tactics and try to sneak up on marines in order to kill and expand their base around the maps. Later in the game, marines get to unlock big mechs with huge firepower, while aliens can evolve into huge behemoth lifeforms called Onos.You can also play as a commander in both factions, and that gameplay is more like RTS, where you control the expansion of your base.Overall, it's a fun game, there are special server for rookies if you are new.

												Re-writing a review to remind everyone how awesome this game is.To those who are going to buy it: no, it is not that kind of a shooter where you get the game basics in an hour after your first launch. No, this is not a game where you will be a all-killing badass as soon as you log in. This game has a very complicated mechanics, with a plenty of stuff to learn and even more stuff to master. Prepare your lips as you will suck a lot. After all those hours played I still die ten times more often than I kill.I love teamwork - this game is unplayable without it. Mosty I play because of the great teamwork.I love tactics - hide or charge that is the question.I love biting stuff - still can't do it properly, but it is fun!I love drama - get lost and hide in a corner hearing enemy steps somewhere aroundI love cute animals - gorges are gorgeous!I love green slmey stuff - you can spread it here!Some people complain that community is awful - it is but only on a newbie's servers. There are a lot of kids and russians. Get used to the game a little and jump to a non-rookie server.			"

												Starting as a mod for HL1 that I have played for hundreds of hours, this has evolved into a terrific game. A team of aliens plays versus marines, each having a commander that controls their team from above in a RTS style gameplay making this team-shooter a unique game with a unique gameplay. The gameplay is very quick, especially when playing on the alien side due to the high movement speeds, but still strategy is paramount to win in this game. Some points I especially like: + Completely different gamplay, based on which side you are on + Offers possibilities for slower/more relaxed players (Use the Gorge form as alien - building structures, supporting your team; Welder as marine - repairing structures/armor of players) + Succesively unlocking new items in the tech tree diversifies games + Having a commander gives the game a special ""feel"" + Teamplay is encouraged + Huge choice of upgrades/weapons + Playing as commander is absolutely huge and an excellent experienceThere are also some things I don't like but they are negligible towards the positive points: - Finding someone to play commander on your team is often difficult on public servers - The success of a game depends heavily/ultimately on the skills of your commander - Overwhelming the marine team after a long game as aliens can be very tedious and lengthy, even after the whole map apart from one base is under alien control. Marines are able to easily defend a single base.I think this game is a worthy purchase and I can only recommend playing it. Thank you, Unknown Worlds.			"

												A challenging gem gaming, this sequel to the original Half-Life mod Natural Selecton brings loads of new content and a new game engine to dive into. The aliens and marines are very well-balanced in this command-based first-person shooter strategy game, pitting two polar opposites against one another with the simple goal in mind of destroying the other's base. Seems simple, and it is. However, it is loads of fun as working with teammates to achieve a goal feels very fulfilling and at the same time electrifying in intensity. If you are into combat, there is a combat mode as there was in Natural Selection 1. In that mode, one can level up his or her character while unlocking all the features you get to unlock in the default mode. Exhilarating and also a breath of fresh air from the standard game mode.

Natural Selection 2 has moments of beauty, where it’s easy to get wrapped up in the intense fighting, but other times it shows its low-budget roots. Marines, and the various forms of Aliens, all look like clones of one another. The environments are also pretty similar looking, though it’s hard to notice when you’re fighting for you life. I’ve also encountered a few issues where it locks up after failing to load a level properly. Even more frustrating is that there’s no way to group with friends to go into matches together, nor is there a way to see how far along a match is before you join. Smartly, though, the team has integrated mod support into the main menu, and it’s great to see how active the community has been in implementing new skins and the like into Steamworks.  "

												Plays like the game you imagined making when you were a teenager.  The biggest issue with this game is that each side requires a commander, usually decided by who jumps in the command module first.  A bad commander can cripple your team, and be really frustrating.  From it's humble origins as a nod NS2 has grown into a respectable franchise. Don't play if you rage easily! 4/5			"

												If you like first person shooters and real time strategy games, Natural Selection 2 is the best attempt at bridging the gap between the two genres. Asymmetric sides, which aren't balanced to perfection but the striking differences creates depth and allows you tatics that just haven't been seen before in games. So the question is do you want a casual experience? If you answered yes, then you should probably go somewhere else.			"

												Re-writing a review to remind everyone how awesome this game is.To those who are going to buy it: no, it is not that kind of a shooter where you get the game basics in an hour after your first launch. No, this is not a game where you will be a all-killing badass as soon as you log in. This game has a very complicated mechanics, with a plenty of stuff to learn and even more stuff to master. Prepare your lips as you will suck a lot. After all those hours played I still die ten times more often than I kill.I love teamwork - this game is unplayable without it. Mosty I play because of the great teamwork.I love tactics - hide or charge that is the question.I love biting stuff - still can't do it properly, but it is fun!I love drama - get lost and hide in a corner hearing enemy steps somewhere aroundI love cute animals - gorges are gorgeous!I love green slmey stuff - you can spread it here!Some people complain that community is awful - it is but only on a newbie's servers. There are a lot of kids and russians. Get used to the game a little and jump to a non-rookie server.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is the first game for a long time in my game list, that does not require grinding weeks to get something usuable, does not offer achivements, or level up or pimp-my-♥♥♥♥ possibilities. Yet I enjoy it.It needs good teamwork, needs good players with simple gameplay.Also, I have never met such mature/aged community in such a high ratio. Never experienced mic spamming, whining, if enemy gives up the match after it is obvious they lost it, noone rages.Pros: Simple, nice looking, good community, highly moddable game, devs are still expanding the gameCons:(Compared to today's game) Lack of content, no candy systemIf you find the 23€ too much for this game, I recommend you to buy this game on sale.

												The Half-Life franchise has bought the gaming community many things, setting standards for countless others. Modding has been a big part of the attraction with games like Counter-Strike and Black Mesa spawning from the series. Hidden amongst them was a game by Unknown Worlds called Natural Selection, a cross between FPS and RTS. It was publicly released in late 2002 and was well received.Development of a sequel was announced back in 2006 and Natural Selection 2 was released very recently, keeping all key aspects from the original. The game focuses on two races; The Frontiersmen and the Kharaa.  The Frontiersmen are your classic space marines wielding guns and mechs. Kharaa on the other hand are microscopic life forms that spawn the units.On each team there's a ""Commander"", although slightly different for each team their main duties are coordinating the rest of the team, building structures and for the Kharaa, spreading infestation.As for the FPS elements, playing marine is everything you are used to with any other shooter. There is a ""shop"" system to acquire the new weapons and the mech as you play. The foot soldiers have to physically build the structures the commander plans and thus communication is vital.On the flip side, playing as the aliens is slightly different and more complicated. There are five ""Classes"". Everyone spawns as the basic skulk, a quick dog-like alien capable of climbing on walls and ceilings and being able to utilise ventilation systems as a quick way around the map. Their only form of attack is a bite. Once you have played for a short while you will be able to evolve into the other classes. Gorges are a support class, able to build walls and healing teammates. Then there is the flying Lerk, the stealthy Fade and the enormous Onos. Each have specific abilities such as flight, Blink and Door ramming respectively.The core gameplay is solid, it's heavily teamwork based and it has a good built-in communication system which makes it easy to work together. The engine was built from scratch for this very game and so it works as intended, I notice no bugs during my play time and the teams seem to be well balanced. The Kharaa seem to be more fun to play as but that may just be the greater speed and the unique traits of each evolution.The graphics look great and with a reasonable amount of customisation allowing for lower end computers to run it smoothly. There is a nice little rookie system that tells people that you may be new to the game and might need a little bit of help.It's not all great though, during a routine game playing as the Kharaa, a number of our team decided to leave. At this point, any other game would use matchmaking to fill the gaps however the game was abruptly ended giving an ""Aliens Lose"" message due to our lack of players. Something I wasn't expecting and it made me question the stability of further matches.The levels all seem very similar and finding your way around can be tricky. It's all set inside spaceship type corridors and rooms; I suppose to allow for the infestation spread. I found myself running round with the map overlay on just so I knew where I was going. I mean, It looks nice for spaceship hallways and the spread makes the landscape dynamic, and one I had been playing for a bit the map seemed pretty familiar.The loading may be painfully long but that is an issue that the developers are working on because it is due to a bug, but apart from that, getting into a game is very simple.Overall I really enjoyed the game, and it's something I see myself playing a lot of in the future.

												NS2 is a good old aliens vs humans game, with the aliens being feral creatures that want to spread their hive over the map.  This game involves you and your team trying to kill the other team (duh) while captureing reasource nodes and command stations.  Each team has their players who play in a first person perspective, either be the Marines who use their guns, jetpack, mech suits, or the Kharaa (aliens) with their abilities to run on walls or ceilings, spore rooms, and much more.  Both sides need a comander who plays from a bird's eye view leading the team, building, and reasurching improvements.  Overall this game is about team work and depending on teams, matchs go from 5 min to 45 min.  *Warning this game has a steep learning curve.""			"

												It's certainly not the multiplayer experience everyone is after, and with no single-player component whatsoever, Natural Selection 2's appeal entirely depends on your desire for a complex, deep alternative to the usual immediacy of modern online shooters. There's potentially more balancing to be done when it comes to certain classes or abilities being slightly overpowered, but that's a matter of fine-tuned refinement rather than a vast overhaul. Right now it's an excellent game that taps into both the FPS and RTS markets, with plenty of varied builds and playing styles on offer. If competitive multiplayer gaming is survival of the fittest, then Natural Selection 2 is certainly fighting tooth and claw to reach the top tier.""The humans are farting,and the monsters are barking!""

												A very well-made game. It reminds me a lot of Starcraft - particularly the alien side. There's a learning curve, but it isn't too steep - just don't expect to learn all of the mechanics in your first match. The two very different sides makes for some interesting action. Natural Selection's biggest flaw for me is the requirement to play with other people, though admittedly that's a flaw for me of every single multiplayer game out there, so take it from where it is coming. I can't say very much good about the community, as there are a lot of rude people who will waste no time in berating you for making rookie mistakes (despite the fact that you are a rookie as indicated by your name being written in green on the player list) . I personally have a low tolerance for crap like that, but if you can ignore it  and are lucky enough to get involved in balanced matches (without douches) there is some serious fun to be had.			"

Sadly the community is slowly getting smaller and smaller. This game does not deserve it, it looks and feels awesome for being a 5 year old game. The small community is what really kills the game for a lot of people and I don't blame them.Overall: This game is a blast to play and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes this style of game. The small community does suck though so keep that in mind of you buy it. I want to give it a higher rating but with the small community it's hard. Overall I'd give this a 8.5/10.			"

												Date of Review: 04.2016Playtime ~600hrs (Actual play time according to Hive Stats)NS2 is a blend of strategy and shooter. I will not say ""unique"", since the word seems overused nowadays. What they tried to implement are two 2 factions that actually have very different playstyles while still staying moderately balanced. It is also uncommon in the way that the development team keeps the game updated and running, partially relying on community effort to do so.Within the game the Marine faction represents the standard FPS gameplay of tactical movement and long range engagements. The Marines move slower through the map, but have a distinctive firepower advantage and can set up outposts a lot more quickly than the aliens. The Marine commander will have to juggle a lot betweeen setting up bases, maintaining resource income and supporting frontline troops. Marine field players will need to coordinate with the commander and each other in order to hold as much ground as they can without spreading their forces too muchThe Alien faction has many lifeforms that have short range attacks and low hitpoints, especially in the beginning of the game. They rely on stealth and synergies between their abilites to ambush and overwhelm marines or sneak behind enemy lines to quickly destroy key structures. The Alien Commander can focus a lot more on supporting his team and can even leave his position in the Hive vacant for some time to assist in attacking or defending. Alien field players need to pick wisely when to invest resources in higher lifeforms and balance between doing the most possible damage and keeping their valuable lifeforms alive.As an advise for new players I recommend to visit servers with a lower playercount first. The game is designed around teams with 6-8 players, which further increases the steep learning curve on some of the high playercount servers. Also, I advise them not to be afraid of trying to play aliens at first. While playing as marine may be more familar to many, there are many things to learn and keep in mind at once that simply do not matter for alien players. Going for a high skill server while learning is okay, however keep in mind that on servers with a high average skill the atmosphere can become a bit competetive.Strenghts: - The game has a strong emphasis on teamplay and tactical gameplay. While personal skill is also important the team with the better coordination, even if it just by a part of the team, can have a big impact on the outcome.- Both sides have a unique feel and playstyle to them, and a variety of weapons to cater to different preferences of playstyle. - A very unique atmosphere that is supported by map design and faction design alike.- Different map designs encourage different approaches in playstyle, both personal and as a team.- The ""community development team"", hired by the developers to maintain the game, produces regular patches in coordination with the community to fix performance and gameplay issues.Weaknesses:- The Netcode could need some serious improvement, with long range weapons facing against short range weapons differences in latency can have a huge negative impact when playing. I recommand searching servers with a latency (ping) of less than 100 (my experience suggests less than 50).- The playerbase is stable, but small. There is a number of well populated servers, however it is possible you come online at a time where all the ""good"" servers are full. With your ping in mind, try out for yourself whether you want to wait for a slot on a server in your region or try your luck on one with a higher latency, or with more/less skilled players than you.- For a new player, the amount of things to learn can be overwhelming at first, especially on marines. There are a number of gameplay mechanics that are not immediately clear to the player and need to be learned. Be not afraid to ask, even if some of the experienced players may sound harsh, there is always someone who will be willing to help.- The same goes for commanding. There is a lot about commanding that is not immediately apparant, so you might not want to try it right off the bat. However, messing around in offline sandbox mode might be good to get an idea of ""what that commander is doing"" while you are out fighting, even if you are not interested in commanding.I recommend NS2 to anyone ready to invest some time into learning the game before actually having fun. There are a few initial hurdles to overcome if you want to play successfully. However once you become more accustumed to the mechanics this game can be fun and challenging to skilled and less skilled players alike. Also, my personal experience with the players in NS2 is that there are quite a few helpful ones that you can get along with very well, although you may need to take the initiative talk to them first. Many players are not used to the amount of communication NS2 requires for both teams, so this factor might also require some effort from the side of the new player.			"

												Does FPS finally meet RTS in a balanced amazing mix?This game is really interesting to me for two reasons:First of all it's a really solid FPS with tight and responsive controls.Secondly it's a really solid RTS with interesting upgrades and fun base building. Now that the meld of the two genres is out of the way, let's talk about how it works.The game is centred around two asymmetric teams; the aliens and the marines. Each team has a commander who will be playing the RTS game while the rest will be the ""grunts"" on the battlefield and play the FPS game. As you can probably imagine this requires a lot of teamwork and communication to work properly and give an interesting, fun match. The commander definitely has the most crucial and stressful job here, where the ""units"" won't necessarily follow orders. That certainly never happened in traditional RTS's.The asymmetric teams are really well balanced and the whole outset of the game just works flawlessly. The aliens are creepy and surprisingly varied in their different evolutions/classes, able to give the marines some great jump-scares by jumping out of nowhere as the invisible Fade or the many airducts scattered throughout the level.The marines are much more homogeneous, changing weapons and armour but of course staying in the same humanoid bodies.If you have fond memories of the Alien vs Predator franchise this might just be an amazing experience for you. The alien team can of course crawl on walls and ceilings as any proper alien creature needs to do, and the marines have large and loud weapons... by my descriptions you can probably tell which I enjoy playing more.The first couple of games are going to be incredibly confusing, so I'd definitely recommend watching some gameplay videos beforehand.

												This is a very fun and addictive game, and the graphics are fantastic. My only problem with it is that there are not many options available to reduce draw times, for lower end PCs like mine, meaning that I rarely get a slightly decent framerate of even 20 frames per second on my machine. I can't complain because the developer's aren't to blame for my PC being terrible, but I would have liked to see more features able to be adjusted like texture quality and geometric complexity, since reducing the triangle count would certainly speed up draw times and make the game a lot more playable for people with less expensive machines like mine. Anyway, with that issue aside, the game is still very impressive and if it's on sale, I'd say go for it if you've got a nice GPU.			"

Natural Selection 2 has moments of beauty, where it’s easy to get wrapped up in the intense fighting, but other times it shows its low-budget roots. Marines, and the various forms of Aliens, all look like clones of one another. The environments are also pretty similar looking, though it’s hard to notice when you’re fighting for you life. I’ve also encountered a few issues where it locks up after failing to load a level properly. Even more frustrating is that there’s no way to group with friends to go into matches together, nor is there a way to see how far along a match is before you join. Smartly, though, the team has integrated mod support into the main menu, and it’s great to see how active the community has been in implementing new skins and the like into Steamworks.  "

												Re-writing a review to remind everyone how awesome this game is.To those who are going to buy it: no, it is not that kind of a shooter where you get the game basics in an hour after your first launch. No, this is not a game where you will be a all-killing badass as soon as you log in. This game has a very complicated mechanics, with a plenty of stuff to learn and even more stuff to master. Prepare your lips as you will suck a lot. After all those hours played I still die ten times more often than I kill.I love teamwork - this game is unplayable without it. Mosty I play because of the great teamwork.I love tactics - hide or charge that is the question.I love biting stuff - still can't do it properly, but it is fun!I love drama - get lost and hide in a corner hearing enemy steps somewhere aroundI love cute animals - gorges are gorgeous!I love green slmey stuff - you can spread it here!Some people complain that community is awful - it is but only on a newbie's servers.

I love what they've done with the sequel and it's definitely my #1 game. Why? It has great Alien vs. Marine 1st-person gameplay unlike anything I've seen, and it has a fantastic RTS element where one player on each team has to be a commander and is basically playing Starcraft with his real-life players.

You swing it at a wall for a coupla minutes before realizing that you should probably contribute to the team against the Bug Boys. Absentmindedly you smack the ""need orders"" button. ""Hey, go follow Sheckley to the server room, scout out the area,"" the commander says. Right on. You follow Sheckley down the twisting hallways, hoping that you know where he is going. Occasionally you hear scurrying behind you, but a stern look and a couple of warning shots keeps the lone spook away. For now. You and Sheckley are in the server room. The commander highlights some blue thing on the wall, and you use your buildy gun thing to build some machine that does something. You aren't sure what. ""Contact!""

There's guns, flamethrowers, robots, wall-crawling aliens, fat piggy aliens, and much more! It can be complicated and it has a steep learning curve, but a few youtube tutorials and a little patience will get you going strong and explain some of the finer points of the game ( I suggest TychoCelchuuu).

												Good game. It's full of combat and stratagy, both teams are unique and playing as the 'Commander' gives an intense stratagy view on battles.The game is quite basic, find the enemy base and destroy it. But it's not that simple though, the learning curve is HUGE. As you'll try to figure out how to kill a certain alien type, or how to evade different marine weapons. Communication in this game is a huge need though, as good communication can save your life or win the game.But... The game is slightly 'Dull' sometimes. I'm a bit disappointed with the Bot AI, if you set one team member to Commander, they'll eventually leave after 10 minutes and rely on you to command your team. The Marines need a bit more work, they need more weapons to buy. A form of a Pulse Rifle would be a nice addition.All of the maps are inside bases or ships, all inclosed areas. I hope in the future they'll add some 'outside' maps to add to the gameplay. But, to sum it all up: Good Game			"

Wish I had more time to play but at least I have something to look forward to when I do.  As a veteran Unreal Tournament player I am quite happy with NS2.  Fun to play first person with nice focus on strat at the same time.  Great game!			"

												I'm a 30+ yr old gamer. I have been through quite a few games and systems in my day. I started on Pong. Fell in love with PC gameing in 1999. This is the most bad ♥♥♥ game I have played in a very long time. My first loves were Starcraft and Counterstrike. One of the things I love about this game is that you can jump right in and play with the same advantage as your opponent. You don't have to put in hours upon hours to upgrade your player with traits, guns, etc. All upgrades come in a single game. Everone starts from scratch. This game is intense. Picture this. You're having a nice stroll through crossroads when all of a sudden....BAM... You've just become the meal of a alien skulk (wolf like creature) with the upgraded ability of invisibility (when he's still). Better yet. You are the skulk. I've never seen anything like this game. I absolutely love this it and hope you will bite the bullet and give it a try. Both FPS and RTS elements are integrated. Choose to play whichever way you feel comfortable. I played the original Starcraft when I was younger, then got into FPS like CounterStrike. This game is the best game of all time in my opinion. Before you play, I recommend you watch some tutorial videos on youtube. There are tons. Ask questions while in game. Most people in the community are pretty friendly. Please, buy a freaking microphone. Yes, there are some voice overs that you can choose, but the key to teamwork is communication. Without TEAMWORK, you will not suceed. Above all else, make some gamer friends. This game is where it's at.			"

												I've followed this game since it was a MOD for Halflife 1, and been part of the beta from the start, and this game has a very interesting gameplay which is very beautiful and very dynamic due to the freedom the players have in developing their tactics. Each team has a commander whom handle the team resources, which is used to buy upgrades, buildings and abilities. Teamwork is a must in this game since both soldiers/commander are dependent on each others performance. You might be all hot and cool at shooters, but that doesn't mean you are gona win.So, if you like munching marines or firering at poor aliens in small vents, this is a game for you.			"

												That's interesting. Extreme. Addictive. Balanced. When you play as a commander, you open the game with a completely different side.But there is one drawback. Beginners hard to play against other players. REALLY hard. But, may be, it's because I did not pass the training? ;)			"

												I have played this game for about few hours and so far, what can I say about this game other than it really took me by surprise. The game seamlessly blends RTS and FPS elements which ends up producing rounds that have isolated, but intense firefights in the beginning, followed by all out team fights later in the rounds. Playing either side, marines or aliens, proves to be balanced and fun given all the different unit customizations the game offers. The game randomizes where the players start in the beginning, which makes for increased replay value since every round plays out differently. However, the problem i had was technically when it's your first time playing the game. Game crashes for about 3-5 times during loading screen, first game map loads about 7-9 minutes but afterwards download will only take 2-3 minutes and. On the brightside, there is no Lone Wolf crap, requires a lot of teamwork, it's better to use voice communication as a commander, Overall! It's a nice fresh combination of RTS and FPS. You'll love this Game if you enjoy FPS and RTS.Rated: 8.3/10			"

												I actually think this game is crap. The humans are extremely under-powered compared to the aliens. Aliens just have to jump around and hit things, humans have to shoot a lot to kill a minor alien. Hit detection isn't all that great. Worst $25 spent, and I have gotten some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things in my life.			"
