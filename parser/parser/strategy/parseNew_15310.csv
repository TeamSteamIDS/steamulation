												Not a very populair game, the Settlers: Heritage of kings is a classis city building game, set in the old times. In this review I'll talk about a few things:- The story- The gameplay- The graphics- Online play- Pros en Cons in general.The story:The story starts with out hero, Dario, chilling alone under a tree. His village gets attacked and mostly destroyed, the only thing that remains is the castle. After you fight off all the attackers, it's up to you to rebuild the village. Once you've succeeded, you're going to move on to a different place, this happens after every city. There are 15 main missions in total, which are all about building villages, making armies, and defeating other villages.The gameplay:The Settlers: Heritage of Kings is a strategy game. You start off each map with atleast four serfs, and with atleast one hero. A serf is a worker, they can build the buildings you need to evolve your village. New serfs can be bought in the castle, which is your main base of operations. The hero is a special kind of soldier, they have special abilities, there is a total of 6 heroes for you to play as.As you start the map, your serf can only build a few buildings. Mines, houses, farms, and schools. In order to make more buildings, you will need a school to research, after that new buildings will be unlocked. To unlock more things to be researched, you will need higher leveld buildings, it's a various circle. The graphics:This game is from 2004, so the graphics aren't really the best. It's not minecraft level where it's all blocks, but it isn't far cry 3 either. You'll be able to tell which building is which and what it does, same goes with the heros, soldiers, and archers. Online play:Despite the game being this old, there is a multiplayer option.The only thing availible is LAN play, so if you and some friends are in the same house, you'll be able to play together. There's are a lot of maps to play together, which each player being a colour. Mulitplayer games do NOT have a hero. Pro's:- Fun gameplay- Good music- Different types of missions.- Voice acting- Free playCon's:- Gets old after a while- Repetitive voice acting- You have to wait a long time for some resources.- Enemies have ridiculous large armies.Overal I'd give this game a 7/10, a good buy for 10 euro!

												The Settlers series are one of the greatest strategy series i've played when i was a little kid.Recently i thought i would take a look at the series again and buy a few games that i used to play for a couple 100 hours but sadly enough steam only sells a few games of The Settlers series. When you buy this game play atleast 6 campains before you decide to stop since the first 3/4 campains have a lot of explanation about the game and it goes pretty slow without a lot of fighting against big armies.Heritage of Kings is a strategy game that plays in the middle ages.The game tells you the story about the caracter called Dario, as he attempts to regain his land and regains his rightly trone. As a lost prince of the campain story he has to prove to the settlers that he is a good prince by defeating the evil forces. In addition to the spearman, archers, swordsman, calvery and cannoners he can recruit , he can also have company from certain heros later on in the game. Dario, Pilgrim, Salim, Erec, Ari, and Helias all have special ability's where they can fight with one can call bandits the other one can throw down bombs or even heal people etc.You start up a campain with atleast 1 hero and 4 serfs. The serfs can build and repair buildings or can mine anc cut down threes you also have the option to give them weapons to defind your castle when you do not have enough troops.There are 5 resources in the game wood,clay,stone,iron and sulfur there is also a currency.Aside from wood to gain resourses you have to build mines on top of a deposit. Now you have new settlers working for you, you also have to build a place for them to eat and sleep else they will leave your village. You can also research in a college so you can upgrade your buildings and make new buildings where you for example create a army.Pro's - Great graphics for an old game- Great storyline- Fun game- You can do whatever you want with a few guide linesCon's - No multiplayer besides Lan- repetitive voice acting - It's not a game that you play hunderds of hours - Sometimes you have to wait a long time for resourses			"

												Not even an hour played but I have a pretty good grasp on the game. I spent 20 minutes on the prologue/tutorial, 10 minutes on the campaign and then another 15 minutes loading all the different custom maps.The tutorial teaches you 60% of what you need to know. From my time in tutorial I released the key points of the game. Its like your typical army building/population building game, areas to explore, enemies to destroy, people to protect and resources to gain. Also, everyone needs to eat and sleep too!I love the fact you can zoom right in to see buildings and people up close. Also another thing i love is the options in recruitment. You can recruit a captain who automatically arrives with 4 troops of whatever solder type you trained him in (archery, spearmen, swords etc). The other option is to recruit soliders INDIVIDUALLY, i find this a great way to combine fast recruitment with the option to recruit singles to help the struggle with population caps.Something Im not too keen on is the population cap, its like Battle for Middle Earth, so far ive only seen the cap at 75 max, everyone you control counts toward it.On the lines of population, something im not too keen on is the auto training of certain civilians. If you build a college to research some upgrades, as soon as its built, 5 scholars arrive. All they do is research, eat sleep. Thing is they all still count to the population cap.I was worried about one major thing. I was assuming you can only do what the missions tell you. Wrong, that is only the case in the campaign and some custom maps. I did find 3+ custom maps that allow you full control with no set objectives.All in all, I definatly reccomend it, and I super reccomend in while its on sale! "

												The Settlers heritage of kings is another installment of ""The settlers"" game series but still stands out to me as one of the best. With a fully fledged campaign both challenging and rewarding it really gives you something to build up to and really try to work and finish. This game not only has that element but has many scenarios to play against AI and also the ability to play a LAN game with friends (Only steam copies work with other steam copies, sadly).Overall although this game may be over 10 years old it still stands out to me as challenging as it is interesting to play. Great game!			"

												Though this game has quite outdated graphics, I quite like it. I didn't play it in my childhood like most people who would buy this, but even without nostalgia it's a really good game. The only thing that irks me is that you can't speed up the game, and you have to sit around waiting for resources to come in quite a lot because of that.I'd still give the game a 7.5/10.			"

I have played a lots of games and heard lots of soundtracks, but this game's soundtracks are so beautiful, I really enjoy it.			"

												Played this game ages ago and decided to finally buy it on steam during the summer sale. Graphics look okay-ish for what you can expect from an older game and the zooming function adds a decent ammount of good looking material to the game. You can play it with a friend which is always nice, and as for me an ideal game to play with my girlfriend who isn't as used to strategy games as i am, and this game provides a decent ammount of fun for us ;)I played this game (solo) like i always used to, relaxing and taking my time to clear every resource and map every tiny place i can get to. The pacing of the game allows you to play so, and as such i found myself tied to my pc quite a few evenings. In all honestly though, the campaign can be easily done in 30 hours or so, and even then you're playing in a slow tempo. Aside from the campaign there isn't a whole lot of stuff to do; random maps are pre-made and you can't really get a difficult AI to face you and test your limits. The game is quite okay as far as it goes. There's a decent (or low, if you've played games such as Total War, Anno, or the previous Settler games) strategic need in some maps. Conquer some keypoints and defend it, or slowly building your towers and thus expanding your territory to name a few. Other than that, there's not a whole lot of planning needed, neither for your in total 16 techs nor your 'city-layout'. Tl;drThe campaign tells a nice story and the scenery is quite okay in the introductions as well. Even though i've probably played the campaign a few times before, i still enjoyed to run through it again. All is all it's a good game to buy if you're new to the whole citybuilding strategy game type, although it falls short if you want some more depth to your games. 10 euros is a decent price i'd say, for the content and great story you're getting ;)			"

												This is a fun new game in the settlers series with some cool features like heroes, great graphics, and great use of weather in the story.There are also some sadly missing great attributes of the settlers series that I hope they bring back in the next version. Missing are carriers, trails, and the complex economy where you start with some bricks tools and have to build up industries relying on different foods, etc. The real fun of the old series is in the building of the economy, bounded and measured by the famous carriers. The use of carriers made sure that you had to make good sensible cities or they would end up horribly inefficient.The new game has fun things too. The heroes bring a lot to the game as they have some character and special abilities and handle a lot of the fighting and leading of fights. Weather is used in an amusing in fun way - you have access to an inventor who can create a weather machine which freezes the lakes and opens up new avenues of attack.There no longer seems to be an on-line community to create maps that allow the game to be replayable. This is one of the biggest missing features. There is an online section that does not seem to be connected to anything.Overall I like this game but I hope that the designers consider bringing back the old favorites for their loyal fanbase and mix them with the new great ideas. I would buy it again if they did.			"

												The campaigns are very nice, however, I cannot recommend this game to others, since its replayability as RTS game is very, VERY poor. Once you complete the game, you have nothing left to do - literraly. There are few skirmish missions, however there is NO skirmish AI, or generated maps/encounters - each mission is heavily scripted, and keeps on repeating simple tactics.I really loath a good skirmish mode in this game, but there is none.Also, none of the expansions are available via Steam.

												I have fond memories of this game from years ago. It was disappointing to discover it wasn't compatible with my Windows 7 computer (yes - it's that old a game). Being a big Settlers fan, I decided to buy it on Steam ... and I really wish I hadn't. Some good memories should stay exactly that - good memories. Now, it's not a terrible game - far from it - it's just really showing it's age in graphics and game-play. I'd forgotten how long it takes to do anything in this game (gathering is especially long-winded), or how intensely annoying the voice acting is. On a modern computer with a snazzy graphics card and a decent wide-screen monitor, the game looks blurry and finding an acceptable aspect ratio is frustrating. After 20 ,imutes of play, your eyes will hurt from the fuzzy image and your brain will hurt from the frustration of trying to do anything.I would say that if this game was priced at £1.99, it would be worth having, if only to see how RTSs used to be made way back in the ancient mists of time. Settlers 6: Rise of an Empire is a far better game than this. If you are looking at both games and can't decide, go with Rise of an Empire - you won't be disappointed. If you already have Rise of an Empire and wonder if this will be as much fun ... it's not! Save your money.			"

Not really an rpg or a rts... it was just a sim, but it was really well made and a hell of a lot of fun. THIS GAME IS NOT IT. This game is fun for about... mmm... 30 minutes... may be 10 to 15 minutes more, but after that... its done. The game is pretty but shallow and when there is no depth to something... well... you know how far Paris Hilton got in Hollywood? Same ♥♥♥♥in thing here: this game sucks. Its not a deep enough sim to even scrape the surface of ""fun"".			"

												First, let me state the goods:  great models and animations, ambient sounds, and core mechanics.Now, the bad.1.)  It is altogether obvious in many situations that this is an English port, and a poor one at that.  Stilted language, missing narrations, bizarre unit acknowledgements (one unit actually speaks for a full 15 seconds when clicked on!), and other artifacts let this be known.   For instance, ""quit game"" quits the mission you are on; it doesn't actually exit your game.2.)  The game is excruciatingly slow paced:  building a decent economy takes well over 15 long minutes, and you'll need one before you can really do anything.  As such, every near mission requires long bouts of waiting just to start.  Once you've got it rolling, you're good, but it is still terribly slow.  Many missions take around 45 minutes to complete, the first 15 of which are waiting, and the other just cumbersome.  3.)  The soundtrack during game only has one track that it plays over and over.  4.)  Single-player campaign is insipid and dull.5.)  Clunky UI where it feels you can't zoom out enough.THIS ISN'T A ""BAD"" GAME.  It is, though, slow and dull.  I got about 6 missions in before I just quit, not because of difficulty, but because the fun to work ratio was not high.  The game lacks polish, and the single-player campaign just feels like it is a collection of fetch quests.  I feel the Stronghold series did what this game was attempting to do better.			"

												The Settlers®: Heritage of Kings is a great game. Why doesn't Steam post the expansion?You should, it will sell.			"
