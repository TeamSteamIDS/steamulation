												The big question: just how much like XCOM is this game?Very similar, but in some refreshing ways, different.  This is based on about 8 missions of the game (I have, however, beaten Enemy Within and am an avid fan of TFTD and JA2, so I have a decent basis for comparison).+The game is turn-based, with turns broken into two actions for most character types.  An action can be either a move, an attack, ect.  Sound familiar?  HOWEVER--  they have improved it by making it possible for any character to either move twice, attack twice, move then attack, or attack then move without requiring any special skill.  It makes the game feel a little less ""gamey"".  Attacking twice sounds appealing, but there is a decent range of damage for most weapons, making it no sure thing that you will kill or hit with both shots, resulting in more retreats and reloads than in XCOM.+The tempo is different.  Whereas with XCOM you have the pop-in enemies that will literally drop from the sky, the maps for FS have pre-placed enemies only.  It does have the ""activation"" upon discovery, however, so turns have to be carefully budgeted with units in reserve when exploring (just like in XCOM).  Where it diverges is that the enemy can also take 2 actions of any type and there are more, smaller bands of aliens that you encounter, making you budget healing items more carefully, as it can be more of a marathon in some maps than the 3-4 batches you have in XCOM.+Your squads are composed of classes, with scouts=snipers, beserkers=heavys, combatants=assault, spiked kid=support.  Their overall functions are logically similar to their XCOM equivalent, HOWEVER, they seem to have improved it by making a larger number of levels (more choices) AND by allowing you to purchase skills that you passed up on level ups using FOOD (an in-game resource).  This means it isn't necessarily a choice to have A or B, but will cost you if you want to --change your decision for that character later on--.  Only the first selection in that block is free with your level--with resultant changes costing food. (UPDATED, tested and is a either-or, but can be switched back and forth for food cost, allowing you to RE-spec fighters for skills that you prefer).+You have a base that allows you to research new gear, repair your squadmates, plan your next attack site, and manage your squads.  Again, it has been improved by removing silly half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥base building (go X-COM: UFO DEF style or go home XCOM!) and instead making each pre-set base facility have its own associated resource and developments.  The medbay has new healing and recuperative unlocks that you spend med supplies on, the mechanic has weapon/armor/ammo upgrades you unlock with scrap, and the armoury has squad and recruitment options you unlock with food.  This seems to be a more logical and ""realistic"" approach than the generic alien resource trope.+When selecting missions, you will have several sites to choose from, HOWEVER those that are not time-essential remain on the map, allowing you to send a squad after them on following missions.  Missions also list the objective, reward (food/scrap/meds/personnel) that you will get, allowing you to make informed decisions and plan your upgrade path.  There are also gathering/recon missions that you can send a single soldier on each turn to get 100 of each resource, if successful (this is similar to the EXALT missions in XCOM); soldiers gain XP for these as well and it is a nice way to get recruits trained into a specialty.+Individual soldiers can be customized, but here is where the budget shows: there aren't many options apart from pallete changes for each class.  Classes do have variation in voices and gender, so repeats aren't as telling.+Inventory options are similar, but you have more options than those in XCOM.  Each weapon can have upgraded ammo types and personnel can have either pistols or shotguns as secondaries (berserks can also have rocket-based heavy weapons).  Armor and ammo do not have to be built at cost each time, but has a one-time investment and X-number of missions before being available in the loadout screen.+The UI is extremely similar and contains pertinent information in an easy-to-digest manner.  If you've played XCOM you'll be able to pick it up without a real tutorial.  Some objects use SPACEBAR to activate in-game (doors, resource caches, bombsites), but it responds well and is intuitive.  No frills.+Animations and sounds are a little simplistic, but have fewer ""twitches"" than in XCOM when using cover.  Gunfire sounds hollow, but mods should fix that in the coming months.  Models are functional and resemble their show counterparts well, with the exception of the main characters, who are more caricatures of their real-life counterparts.On the bright side, this means shorter load times and smaller installs.If you enjoyed XCOM, but would like something a little different, give this a go.  If you did not like XCOM, there are a few tweaks that the devs have made that I found extremely welcome, as they irked me in Firaxis' offering (the doom track, terror sites being a roulette of options, and other artificial ""gamey"" limitations).  At $40, it might be a bit steep, but I can't say yet if you will get that value from it.  Further play will be required, so stay tuned if you're on the fence, and I will update this as I can.  So far, so good.==UPDATE 20141002==+Additional notes: Haven't been able to play as much as I would like (work has been crazy this week), but here are a few more observations:  +You can enter buses!  Not a huge deal, but a cool element for urban maps!  Sniping from the bus interior feels more organic than just climbing it.  +There are a greater variety of missions (investigate crash site, sieze location, rescue individual, escort individual, bug hunt, plant explosives, scout site) that helps to break up the formulaic approach a bit.  You will still use similar tactics, but it keeps things somewhat fresh.  -Difficulty still seems a bit too easy on Normal.  Will experiment with hard, but veterans of XCOM might find it undaunting on lower difficulties.  There will be close calls if you are careless, but if you take your time, use overwatch and bounding movements wisely, the early game can be a breeze.  -Movement is calculated as X number of spaces from a unit, so you might be able to reach certain things even though the path your unit takes might seem circuitous and longer than the number of allowed spaces.  This works both ways, so give enemies a wide berth (skitters can close pretty well and climb walls...).  +On my first play-through, I'll admit that I have a ""one more mission"" kind of compulsion, lending me to later nights than is perhaps condusive to my work schedule.  The missions are quick enough and load extremely quickly, making this a perfect ""after work"" game for me.  Playing it does not seem like a chore and without having to worry about losing countries or interceptors, it makes it a less stressful, but still tactically satisfying game.  Again, I will continue updating this to note any change in sentiment or perception.			"

												I am an original XCOM and Jagged Alliance veteran and have been playing XCOM EU for over 500 hours. I needed a fix until the next update for the Longwar mod comes out. In order to get into the mood for Falling Skies, I watched the first episode of the TV series, which I had not followed yet. I have now played about 5 or 6 missions.Falling Skies is just not fun to play. I am still continuing because I hope that it gets better over time, but this game, compared to XCOM, does not require much strategic thinking because:- There is no general overwatch function. (Only one class can use overwatch.)- The enemies I met so far do not use cover, except for the controlled humans, which are zombie-like and not a threat at all. I guess those mechs I see on the screenshots will not use cover as well.- From what I heard, elevation has no effect on hit probability (except for the sniper class).- The enemies do not move on the map, before you spot them. You therefore just walk a few steps and kite a few enemies back. You seem to be completely safe when there is no enemy in view, so you can take as long as you want to reload or heal your squad. Each single fight will be the same as the previous one: Full ammo, no bleeding, no special conditions. In XCOM, in contrast, I feel the pressure, with some soldiers running out of ammo, some panicking, some bleeding to death, while the next pod of enemies just found me and starts flanking my soldiers.- The special bomb or search missions do not give you any feel of urgency as the bomb missions or the MELD mechanics in XCOM do, because there is no timer.- You basically do not enter buildings. It is like the original DOOM, where each location has only one single elevation level and you will never have one soldier inside a shipping container, and another one on top of it. If, like in some cases, you can enter buildings, the roof is off limits.- All elevated positions have lots of access points from all sides, so that there will not often be a situation that a combattant has to think about the safest access to a fortification.- The battle music is a boring tune and repeats forever.- I found no bugs except for the problem, that whenever I click a command like ""hunker down"" at the bottom of the screen, the game starts to scroll down, so I need to manually scroll up after every soldier's turn.- This game is like XCOM half a year before release, before the fine-tuning. Everything is there, but the spirit is missing. I admit, if I would not know XCOM EU, I might like this game.I feel that this game could be nearly as interesting as XCOM Enemy Unknown if only a few design decisions were changed. Falling Skies' programmers did a good job. The setting (an underdog setting compared to the-high tech organization called XCOM) is interesting, I do not miss XCOM's base building or air battles. I will continue playing this and hope I get hidden movement patched in, and that cover and elevation will play a larger role later in the game.			"

												I approached this game with no real preconceptions about the subject matter – I’m aware it’s based on a TV series but it’s not one I’ve seen.  The reason I picked it up was purely down to the similarities between it and XCOM EU/EW.So, is it any good?After playing it for a couple of hours and completing a handful of missions I’m happy to report that I’m actually enjoying it.  Significantly more than I expected to as it happens.The tactical element of the game should be immediately familiar to anyone who played XCOM EU/EW and it’s obviously licenced the XCOM “engine”.  So that’s a positive.  The key differences are as follows:•  All characters (enemy and player) are able to take two actions in any order – so fire twice, fire then move, move twice, etc.  Whether this is good or bad is a matter of opinion.•  Enemy characters have levels too, so a level two Skitter will be tougher than a level one Skitter.  I see this this as a good thing as the game should scale better as your characters/gear improves.•  I’ve seen very few one shot kills (something that happened a lot in XCOM), again whether this a good thing or not is down to personal preference.•  Most characters don't have the ability to carry out overwatch - only the fighter class does.  I personally find this quite annoying but provided you take it into consideration it doesn't really cause a problem.The Base section is fairly basic and doesn’t have any of the building elements of XCOM.  Essentially there are a handful of areas to visit between missions (armoury, infirmary, etc).  Each of these allows you to purchase upgrades using one of the games three resource types (food, metal and meds).  So rather than research all upgrade processes are similar to the Foundry in XCOM.On the subject of resources – each mission will reward you with a specific number and type of resources.  This encourages you to choose which mission to take based on what upgrade you’re looking to unlock next.One other thing significant deviation from the XCOM template is that timescales on everything (upgrades and healing) are measured in X number of missions.  So there is no setting fast forward on and skipping tactical battles because you want your favourite soldier back in action.General observations regarding the game:Graphics are OK.  There is nowhere near as much polish or detail as XCOM and some of the animations are a little suspect, everything does the job though.  On a side note there are also a lot fewer customisation options for your troops than XCOM (this is purely cosmetic so makes no difference to gameplay).Sound is probably the weakest area.  All of the guns I’ve heard sound underpowered and some of the unit acknowledgements get tired fast.  Also blow up a car – you’ll wonder if it just exploded or backfired!The AI makes use of cover and tends to focus fire on an individual soldier (from what I’ve seen) but there is nothing revolutionary here.  I’ve also not seen any of the flanking behaviour XCOM had.So overall would I recommend it?  Yes – yes I would.  However I do so with the caveat that it should be approached know that it’s effectively a poor man’s XCOM.  That said I’m a massive XCOM fan and I’m still enjoying Falling Skies: The Game (so far – I’ll update this review once I’ve played it a bit more if that feeling changes).			"

												Very similar to XCOM EU in game mechanics, but its not as engaging. In game technological  advancements are in very small steps so each game seems much longer than an XCOM game.   The weapons change appearance as they advance, but your character is always dressed in shabby clothes no matter what armour or other advanced attachents your wearing.  The music in this game is very depressing and the voice overs and ""acceptance of orders"" replies are un imaginative compared to EU.  It has enough bug crashes to make you wonder why the makers never put in an auto save after each move, as it does get old redoing missions that crash near the end.  Its also gone old school with spawning mobs, they are all in static positions and triggered into existence by proximity.  therefore caution always pays off and they have no real answer to sending in a character to spawn them and then pulling them into your well defended positions.  This limits your tactical options as to negate the mobs disadvantage in this area all mobs have more hit points than any of your characters can deplete in one turn. Therefore keeping your squad together at all times always pays. There is no tech tree, air defence or ant farm, but I actually enjoyed being free of those particular aspects of XCOM.  I did miss the absence of the enemy capture facility which was a big + for EU. This game was not as good as XCOM but playing through this for the first time was more fun than playing through your 30th game of EU or EW.  They should have teamed up with the blackguards crew who know how to make lower tech games interesting and fun, by excersising a corny sense of humour.  There are absolutely no laughs in this game it takes itself far to seriously.  I'm going to recomend this game but only for XCOM fans who need a day off.			"

												Heard negativity about game almost didn't buy it.  It is very (new-age) XCOM type game.    It isn't the same though. Things work differently. I like some of the strategies you can implement now.  I actually am able to use melee attacks if I set things up which I never got to do much in Xcom.  I have enjoyed many of the level designs but I am usure if missions maps  are static or randomly generated.Overall I am still having a lot of fun. I never watched the show but I guess I will have to go and watch it now ;)It isn't XCOM but very similar.   Different strategies are actually fun to try out.  It did take a lot from XCOM but that is ok with me. I like having another XCOM like game.I have seen the game error out once but nothing that has caused any lasting issues.I see myself playing this for a good long while and if the missions maps are random, I will be replaying more than a few times.

												i will not recommend this game for the following reasons: 1. Its obviously a console port made available with as little effort as possible by the devs2. Graphics are no more then ok3. You HAVE to play through the tutorial ,there is no skipping it (even if its not your first time)4. You can't skip the ingame cutscenes5. The AI is not very good6. There seems to be no consideration of the characters height compared to the enemy (they seem to hit you even when you are above them and in cover while you cant hit them while they are out in the open below you7. no more overwatch for everyone (it's a class specific skill)  - simply unrealistic8. no base building or improving like in XCOM just little upgrades to weapons and healingOne good thing i did really like is the amount of different missions you have to choose from so theres thatand so its not recommended at least not at the price of 39$			"

												Great tactical/squad/cover/turn-based game.  Yes, just like XCOM.  It follows the formula of XCOM and very similar mechanics for combat and base management.  The soldiers have the same type of leveling and upgrade tree to give them extra perks and flush out the different roles that they are randomly assigned once they are experienced.  The perks and options for soldiers in combat are similar, but not exactly like XCOM, as only 1 class, soldiers, can use overwatch.  In XCOM I got used to move once and overwatch for most of every mission, so this now forces you to think more about placement of your guys.The base is for picking missions, upgrading weapons, soldiers and medical.  It is nice that you have a map with multiple missions that you can pick from instead of being linear and reacting to one at a time. Graphics are not top notch since it seems like it was first designed for last gen consoles, but gameplay is more important to me and for the distance most of the fighting takes place at, it looks good.

												This is SOO much like XCOM I have to wonder if they purchased a license to use the engine! You have a base which you can build upgrades costing metal such as flash bang grenades and armor. You have a barracks which can use to purchase recruits and buy upgrades to increase the default squad size from 4 to 5. looks like it goes all the way to 6 squaddies. The med bay can research new equipment like paddles to save squaddies from dying out. There are different classes which have a skill tree very similar to XCOM. They even have a Bureau feel where you can send your lesser trained units out on side missions to gain experience and resources. One you get a few a few missions in you start having a choice of missions with different objects that each give you so much of the 3 different kinds of resources. All pluses in my book. Some of the battle maps are large, with interesting layouts. On reflecting on it more its really got to be a licensed engine. Units behave similar, the same red bars for the edge of the map, and lots of other similarities that just make it hard to imagine its not the same engine Now the downside. Reaction fire is only allowed by the Fighter caste. The voice overs are nice, but just as weak as the show. The art direction is terrible. The say they have a auto save system, but its actually a traditional multiple save and reload when you want (the only bad side was I was mislead, but was actually glad for the surprise and being lied to considering I like saves I control). The keyboard layout is locked and *really* should have been more xcom in its layout if they cared. It just doesn't have the polish of XCOM. For me, I'm glad I got it. However, if you expect XCOM quality or don't have a burning need for more even if its a little less, you will be disappointed.			"

tldr:I wanted very much to rate this game UP, and if I'd written this review earlier, I would have.  To that effect, I posted in a still-active thread in the (mostly dead) game forums, named something like, ""Is there any reason at all to buy this game?"" and there are some good points worthy of mention, should you want to read that new-player, positive review.  That was at 6 hours into the game, which means I got twice the time compared to the base cost, which to me is good value.The hard rating based on price point: for $3 it's worth messing around with, but I was bored looong before finishing the game (which I never did).  Short term playing = thumbs UP at the full price, and I don't feel like I wasted either time or money here.On the decided plus side, in 22 hours I did not experience a single game crash of any sort.The Longer Version:In terms of game mechanics, it's very much like Shadowrun or XCOM, given the exception that one can make 2 attacks in a single character's turn (each action counts as one action; all characters have 2 actions per turn) whereas in XCOM an attack typically ends that character turn.  Combined with the lack of an overwatch ability (it's a skill that only 1 of 4 classes will ever get, but all members of that class get it automatically), this is an interesting game mechanic, the experience of which is worth playing for.Sadly, this game is just boring.There's not a lot to do in your base except some research projects in three fields: medical, workshop/armaments, and squad upgrades/recruiting.  Every mission rewards certain resources that fit these three categories in varying amounts, and you can see what rewards will be earned for any mission before undertaking it, but that is the extent of the crafting and upgrade system.As to missions, it quickly becomes evident that you'll need to use your high inventory class (spiked kids) for combat medics/grenadiers, your fighter class for overwatch, berzerker class (think heavy weapons) for... uh, unlimited rocket attacks (though you do have to reload, you never run out of ammo), and your sharpshooters for high speed movement, since weapon ranges are (mostly) short enough that the enemy can usually close to melee in 1 turn from behind cover.The movement system is a little wonky: you have a template of movement, but when you move, you run there (as opposed to climbing a fence, for example), even if the route is twice as long as your movement, and sometimes into uncharted territory.  This isn't crippling since you can see the route you'll run, and it's a great way to trigger and reveal enemies, but it just doesn't feel right.  Chalk it up to game engine mechanics and that's probably an accurate reason for why it works the way it does, but it's a poor implementation when the actual movement you see is literally twice as far as the total movement available to that character, and will activate enemies as if you'd moved into their area in a legit manner.Otherwise, emotionless is a good way to describe this game, though the voice actors don't necessarily sound bad; sometimes it's just... too relaxed for the circumstances, or there's an assumed solidarity after a tense briefing when Pope (a notoriously loose cannon kind of guy) snatches a map and loudly declares that he's going to go solve something and a cut scene ends with everyone else standing around.To sum up, this is a fantastic effort for an indie studio and I give both Taurus Games and Little Orbit all props for carrying through into a production release, but I wouldn't send friends here other than for the experience and to see the difference in game mechanics as compared to higher profile games.  I hope to see more from both TG and LO in the future, and while this game is NOT a stinker, it's not a game I'd recommend without a disclaimer.			"

												Most of the negativity surrounding this game seems to come from people who are directly comparing it to XCOM and saying that it is just a worse version of XCOM with the ""Falling Skies"" name slapped on it. Maybe, from a strict game mechanics perspective, that is true...But, I love the Falling Skies television series and I am thoroughly enjoying the game. So far, the story is pretty good and the missions seem to be in line with the types of things the 2nd Mass engage in on the show. They even got the show actors to do the voice work. It is definitely one of the best television series tie-in games that I have ever played. Also, I picked it up for less than $5.00, so I can't complain.			"

												I've thought long an hard about the thumbs up or the thumbs down thing.I like the squad based, turn based (too many based's?  Feel free to use a better word) genre.  This is both squad based and turn based.  And as such I should love it completely.  I don't hate it.  But it needs to put out before I declare my love.It hasn't so far.I confess, I'm not very far in.  But or a full price release, I kinda compair it to other full price releases.  And as such I feel hugely cheated and would advise you to avoid touching it with anyones bargepole.I'm not saying that it completely sucks.  It doesn't.  I had fun with it.  But the clunky interface, the rather embarasing lack of guidance (tutorial/what am I doing?) and the fact that when I sent one of my guys into cover, he ended up floating in space and unable to... well, do anything really.I would feel OK spending £10 - £15 on this game.  Like I say, it doesn't completely suck.  But £30?  Don't.  Trust me, just don't.  (If you are not in the UK, feel free to work out your own comparitive prices.  I'm not gonna spoon feed you)NOTE - I have not seen the series that the game is based on.  I've not even heard of the series that the game is based on.  So my opinion is purely based on the game.  And I still say that you can find better things to spend your money on.If they half the price, it may be worth a look.  But if they don't...			"

												My experience with Falling Skies has been mostly positive. After 70+ hours of play, I've now experienced a few crashes, but they are quite infrequent. On average, I'd say approximately 15 hours of gameplay per crash, which in my opinion is acceptable for a $3 budget title. Honestly, a great many AAA titles out there (including XCOM itself) have occasional crashes and freezes. Anyway, the crashes are 100% predictable and manageable -- the game does NOT just crash randomly -- but more on that later.So, what is Falling Skies? Falling Skies is a tactical turn-based game based on the TV show of the same name. Gameplay is similar to a ""lite"" version of XCOM:EU. Many of the same game systems and mechanics are present in Falling Skies, but generally without quite as much depth as XCOM; Hard/soft cover, targeting, and movement are basically the same, for example. New tech can be researched, fresh troops can be recruited, soldiers can level up and be equipped with various weapons and gear, etc. Units can be cosmetically customized to a limited degree, as well. Again, none of these systems are extremely deep -- but they work well, and are ""deep enough"" to give a satisfactory sense of progression as you complete missions.A couple of game mechanics in Falling Skies can even be considered an improvement over XCOM:EU. As in XCOM, each unit has a movement and a shooting phase during their turn. However, in Falling Skies, you are free to shoot first, then move, if you want. Also, you can choose to have any unit sacrifice its movement for a 2nd attack or action. Quite useful! Skill trees also work a bit differently. At each level gained, just as in XCOM:EU, you are given a choice between two skills. In Falling Skies, however, you can later spend resources to go back and rechoose those skills. It's expensive to do so, but can be worth it if you make a bad skill choice early on, or want to respec a character for whatever reason.To be fair, Falling Skies has its positives...but also its negatives. The whole game feels rather unpolished. The textures, menus, models, and overall graphics are...adequate. Not terrible, but definitely not great. The controls are a bit clunky (although you can get used to them pretty quickly). The voice acting was done by professional actors from the TV show, but much of it feels rather 'phoned in'. For me, these are all minor issues that I can shrug off and still enjoy the game. Your mileage may vary, depending on how tolerant you of such things.As for those ""100% predictable crashes"" I mentioned earlier? The 1st crash is rare, but can happen during the pre-mission screen when assigning squad members. It's usually triggered by quickly spamming the add/remove squad member buttons. So don't spam the buttons.The 2nd type of crash is very situational. It can occur during combat when you activate an ability, with multiple targets to choose from, and then cycle between enemies which are in close proximity to each other. It's RARE for this to cause a crash, but it can happen. If you find yourself in such a situation, with two enemy targets right next to each other, then just save your game before you activate an ability. Overall, I recommend Falling Skies to fans of the tactical turn-based genre. Is it a perfectly executed AAA game? No. Is it as awesome as XCOM, Jagged Alliance, or Silent Storm? No. Is it a decent (if flawed) budget-quality title worth $1.49 on sale? Hell yes.			"

												Falling Skies from Torus Games continues their long line of cheap, shoddily made TV/Movie franchise shovelware. I always approach games based on TV show and movies with low expectations, but as a fan of Falling Skies, and Firaxis' XCom game (which this is heavily based on), part of me wanted it to be good.


YouTube™ Video: Falling Skies: The Game - First Impressions 

			Views: 551		

			A first impressions from approximately 5 hours into the PC version of Falling Skies: The Game, by Torus Games. Find me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/UnstableVoltage Find me on Facebook:...		

Poor graphics, bad sound assests and mixed quality voice acting. The game's tactical squad based mechanics are relatively solid, building on the XCom engine from Firaxis, with a few tweeks and changes. The strategic management portion of the game between missions is very basic and serves little purpose other than to select missions and research some very basic upgrades. The alien models are nicely done, and pay good tribute to the show. Human models are less so, with very bad facial animation and laughable lip-sync. Human characters are just about accurate enough to recognise them as characters from the show, but overall look very cartoony.The AI is pretty bad and predictable. Even if the enemy forces do manage to hit one of your soldiers, the chances of losing one of them, or even failing a mission is low. While there are a few different mission objective types, they all feel the same and soon become repetative to the point of boredom.Actors from the show reprising their character roles for cutscenes and some unit barks are a nice touch. Sadly, story based missions and cutscenes only happen once in a while, and the game is padded out with random and repetative side missions where you only get to take random soldiers who have nothing to do with the show. This makes the game feel very generic and disconnected from the TV series.If you want a decent tactical squad based shooter, go and buy XCom from Firaxis. Mechanically it's the same game, but more in depth, more polished, better graphics, many user mods - and not to mention cheaper.I'd normally say that a mediocre TV tie in can still be a worthwhile purchase if you're a hardcore fan - but as characters from the show and story missions only make up a very small part of the this, it is hardly even worthy of carrying the franchise title.

												a poor mans clunky x-com.This has the x-com feel but navigating maps are a bit hindered. you can scroll the view up and down but you can only view from 1 of 4 right angles. that mean no top down or strait on views. some object do vanish a bit when you mouse over them but this does not help as much as you'd wish and all this makes looking around the map a choir. if you watched the series and want to play as your favorite character you only get 1 at a time on select missions.it mostly feels and plays like a bare minimal x-com with some changes obviously.  i say bare as in only 4 classes + a unlockable medic class (i guess based of the 4 series characters in the picture) and a few different character skins that you need to hope show up as joinable recruits as the only thing you can change about them is what color there face, hair, pants, and shirt are. what if they have a head scarf or hat you ask? well you're stuch with whatever color it is when they join. in fights characters are given 2 action each turn where they can atack/move, attack/attack, move/move, and a class ability that lets you do your max movement then attack. others have noted there is no overwatch, well its here just its now linked to one of the classes as an ability so only that 1 class can learn it though its like a level 2 ability. you are also not stuck with an ability after you pick it and find out its not working for you. you just need to spend some food to get the other ability. sadly you can not just make any class. you have to start as a recruit and as they hit level 2 they will be randomly given 1 of the 4 classes. thankfully you don't need to use them in combat as you can send someone to scavenge once before each battle. i think you get less supplies but it worth not leveling them just to see what class you get. if you really need a x-com like game that's not x-com or maybe liked the show (i've never seen it) its only $3 right now so why not. just know though its playable you're going to have to overlook some flaws. as others have said if they fixed a few things this would be a great game but right now its just passable.

												To be honest this isnt a bad game, most of the reviews are basically hating it because its a lot like xcom enemy unkown which I admit is true in many ways however this game does have different quilties and is still very fun I played a few missions in it and was very satisfied, now its not as great as the show but I say for the 5 dollars was totally worth it			"

												Tactical turn-based sqaud combat against alien invaders that plays different than Xcom:* Once you get past the frustration of camera angles, terrain tunnel vision, and slightly clunky initerface, you start to enjoy a non Xcom style of play in taking on invading aliens ... Vive le Difference ... just ignore the unpolished cutlery* I first hated the fact that only one certain type of soldier could do overwatch (and not even the sniper)... then ... I devised a strategy of having two on overwatch while the rest of the squad shook the bushes* Not having the sniper be able to overwatch was compensated by sniper movement speed and firing accuracy* The berserkers being too slow was made up by their devasting RPGs (with reloads) and Heavy Machine Guns* Research (& Medical) is basic not as intense & nail biting like Xcom but serves to direct missions for winning upgrades* The experience skill tree doesn't necessarily wow you like Xcom abilities but does a good job of basic improvements* I do like how much easier I can get my rookies advancing in experience and thus be more productive than in XcomI do not say the following lightly ...* I bought the orginal X-COM: UFO Defense for full price in the very 1st week it hit the shelves in 1994.* Tactical turn based squad combat against aliens combined my love of wargames and science fiction into gaming reality.* Once I shed my Xcom skin and expectations for Falling Skies, I started to love its simplicity in delivering a fun experince.* Instead of grumbling about its unpolished approach, I reveled in figuring out how to kill invading aliens with gusto.* Sometimes you get more saitisfaction finding, overcoming, and taming a diamond in the ruff.* Don't get me wrong, you will be frustrated at first but then you will laugh while killing the b@st@rd alien invadersA hardy toast to all the trurn based games dedicated to killing b@st@rd alien invaders,DuneWarrior			"

First Impressions:I don't think this game deserves the bad rep. This is a GOOD game.Put it like this; in this genre you can count the GOOD games on one hand;Jagged Alliance 2XCOMShadowrunWasteland 2XenonautsThen there have also been some 'decent' games;BlackguardsSilent StormMarauderPlanet AlcatrazIn my opinion 'Falling Skies' is another GOOD game. Another welcome addition to one of my favourite genres.The combat may look like it is similar in style to XCOM but it is not the same, there are slight differences. If you want it exactly the same then you might be disappointed. Personally, I like that this game is doing things a little different.This game has alot going for it; Strategic team based/turn based combat. Rescue and Accumulate survivors for your base camp. Collect resources and upgrade items/base. Scavenge for resources. Interesting story/theme based on TV series with familiar characters, voices. Change name and appearance of standard characters, plus change weapon loadout for all characters, etc. Characters gain a Class and you can upgrade your characters levels/skills. Characters can die and are then added to a memorial. I am probably not covering everything..The graphics are ok; not as polished as XCOM. On one hand this is a bonus because I can turn everything up to maximum and it runs like a charm. XCOM on the other hand would bring my PC to it's knees. So, this game should run well if you have a weaker PC.I'm playing on the hardest difficulty at the moment and I find the gameplay quite fun.The only problem with this game is that it is not 'new player to the genre' friendly. The game doesn't really explain how everything works or what to do very well. It really helps if you are already comfortable in playing this genre of game.So, if you are a fan of this genre then I recommend you give this game a try.			"

												The game is not bad, but also not good. I keep on getting fatal errors on 3 different devices with different operating systems on. And that hapens aprox every 15-20 minutes. Not to mention that about every 5 min it keeps on freezing the screen for a while. The Tv-series was OK , the game looks ok but very buggy.			"

												Liked the show and as a fan of xcom, was excited about the game.  Sadly there are just too many bugs to make the game playable.In short, i found a way around many bugs that would crash the game by using the keyboard shoortcuts rather than the mouse which would CTD.  As a result i enjoyed about 70 missions or so maxing out my entire team skills and research trees but then stumbled upon a fatal bug.Missions show up as red (story) and yellow random and you play through each story to complete the game.  However at some point the game stops spawning the red missions and just countless yellow ones, meaning you end up in an endless loop of missions, max out all the research trees and cannot end the game.  Yes, its that bad.As a completionist, i tried my best to complete this game and like it, but the developers really just didnt give a damn.My advise is stay clear.			"

												There is nothing _terribly_ wrong with this game. But everything I'e encountered in my first hour has 'B class' spelled on it. Graphics are nowhere near X-Com, but they would have been okayish... But the animation both in combat and in cutscenes made me cry.Gameplay is somewhat... generic TBS. The ability to just hold your ground and make two shots in one turn makes up for the lack of overwatch, but doesn't really call for much maneuvering. Also, the results of my actions seemed to be more randomized than I expected, but that's probably just me.Base management is oversimplified for me. There's not enough tactical depth as is, so I would have liked to get more things to manage, or at least better, more gamey ways to manage them.All in all, you *might* enjoy it, expecially if you get a bargain price. I didn't.			"

												Look at th priced.  For that (£6.99 as I write) you have to give it a go if you are an x-com fan.  I didnt really like it much at first but that is because I had Xcom in my  mind.  Get over it do at least 20 missions and then it will become easier to like.  You can do it all at once or like me just keep coming back to it to get your squad based tactics/xcom fix.  I now like the way it is not like Xcom!  It can become repetitive hence I say you can keep coming back to it but the idea of getting supplies by going on missions is useful different to various nations giving you money.  Overall if it stays cheap worth giving it a go.			"

												The game is a quite nice simplified copy of XCOM Enemy Unknown. If you liked XCOM but got bored with small number of missions and items, Falling Skies is a good choice.The game focuses on tactical missions, there is no base expanding etc. The only strategic-like view is choosing a mission from among a few available. Because of that the time is measured in missions (soldiers recovering in infirmary, building upgrades).Soldiers with each level up receive one new skill which you have to choose from two available. What is nice comparing to XCOM is that you can actually change a selection later (for a fee). There are four classes (sniper, soldier, heavy soldier, scout) and you can later unlock medic class.There is either a lot of different maps or they are randomly generated. Having played for 20 hours on over 50 maps I haven't seen two the same yet.The most annoying is lack of overwatch - it is a class specific skill available at first level. However on 10th level using overwatch will also give it to all other soldiers (regardless of their remaining action points).The game is overall very easy (I play on normal difficulty). I have never lost a soldier and never had to reload the game. Wounded soldiers do not go to infirmary unless they lose at least 50% HP. The game starts at easy so you can safely fight with one soldier vs one enemy skitter (In other UFO-like game, you need four rookies to stand a chance against a single allie), however later it becomes more difficult and sometimes having 3 soldiers against one alien is not enough.Enemies do not move on the map until you see them. So as long as you haven't spotted any alien, you can take your time in the middle of the street to reload, heal, wait for skills cooldowns etc. You don't need cover because no one is going to come for you.Animations of soldiers moving, reloading etc. cannot be skipped and you cannot issue new orders for another soldier when one soldier is moving - slightly annoying. Similarly when selecting next soldier via keyboard shortcut you have to wait for the camera to move, luckily clicking on the soldier directly doesn't trigger any camera movements.""Technology tree"" is very unclear. After some missions just a new technology/upgrade appears in infirmary/workshop and you have absolutely no idea what was its prerequisite. As a result, after each mission you have to visit infirmary and workshop to see if there is something new available.Some aspects are slightly unrealistic, e.g. you can poison a mech or kill it using knife. Also there are sometimes some minor ""line of sight"" bugs, but it's not any worse than in XCOM.After about 40h of gameplay and reaching soldier's level 10 you can unlock one more level called ""Elite"". This gives boost to all stats and allows to buy very powerful skils such as:- ordering all soldiers to shot the target (it consumes only 1 AP of the soldier who used the ability)- a sniper rifle shot with 100% chance to hit and 500% damage- empty a clip of the weapon into the enemy with 100% chance to hit- mind control a mech for 3 turns- give immunity to all damage to all soldiers in short range for 1 turn, or to one soldier for 2 turns			"

I got this for a pound so I can't feel ripped off. I just feel so disapointed that a show I liked and a clone of a game I loved is this bad.If you want to test your patience then this game is for you. I geuss XCom super fans could enjoy this as well. Otherwise it is a good way of increasing your game count by +1 for no reason other than attempting to fill that hole in your heart (good luck with that).			"

It looks like it could use a little more polishing on the way it looks. The mission system has a lot of diversity to whats going on in between the main story missions. i got this on release day so i could live in the world of falling skies. BUT, i recommend to to wait for it to go on sale becuase i do not feal that it is worth the 40 dollars. all in all i give it a 7.5/10 not the best but not to bad if its on sale.			"

												Not terrible but feels like an amateur attempt to copy XCom's great mechanics and gameplay.  I find the controls annoying most of the time and feel that they could be polished up a lot more.  Transitions between areas of your base are annoyingly ""wooshy"" -  the camera whips in and out and around so fast it almost makes me feel nauseous.  I don't like the interace in or out of combat either.  It's poorly conceived and feels clunky.  Combat is okay but I'd prefer a better interface and sometimes it's hard to see where you want your units to move - terrain features like trees, boxes, etc. can get in the way.  It's hard to tell if you'll be able to fire on an enemy from any given position.  The combat areas feel too cluttered, whereas very similar maps in other very similar games, ... okay, I mean XCom again, don't.  Obviously it's a lot like the new XCom, however it pales in comparison despite some interesting ideas, such as being able to purchase the second upgrade at any given rank with resources.  WIth a bit more work this could be a great game.  I only have a few hours play time but have to say that without a bit more effort from the devs in the form of a few patches I can only say this is a mediocre game that I want to like more than I do.  Hear that devs?  I believe you can improve this game.  I really do.  I'm not just saying that.  Fix it.			"

												Normally I do not write any reviews for games, but here I definitely want to give my opinion.Beside the fact ( and general discussion ) if this is an X-Com clone etc., boring music, soundeffects etc.there is one fact which is in my opinion actually a general showstopper.This game has more bugs in it as the namegiving series.There are now several known issues with the game as crashes during target change, certain researches ( assault rifle magazines and painkillers ), animation freezes during actions etc. etc.At the actual build the question is not ""will i master the mission"" but ""will the game survive one mission without crashing""If those issues will be handled by the programmers there is some potential in this game ( even if it may be not as good as X-Com in the opinion of many people ), the research tree is very straight on, but nevertheless bears some improvement.The different character classes bear some strategic possibilitys.So in the actual build I can NOT recommend this game ( despite if you love the falling skies logo during the startup ;-) ),if the issues will be adressed it could be an alternative to the 200st X-Com playtrough.

												I purchased the game after reading the reviews, so already did not expect ""the X-com experience"".Purchased when it was discounted to 5 EUR.Played first 6 missions.FYI, I am a strategy and X-com fan, played X-com Apocalypse, Enemy unknown, Enemy Within.After playing through both EU and EW, Falling Skies is a disappointment, because it has same battle mechanics as EU, grapic is worse, and lacking an ammount of common sense (Striking a melee attack through building walls because it is ""adjacent"" tile? Seriously? Combat Knife, okay, but this is ""too sci-fi"").So, considering all relevant non-extremist reviews, Falling Skies seems to me as a TV series game adaptation built on X-com:Enemy Unknown, adding some just-the-must user experience kit, not including advanced turn-based combat mechanics, and sold it straight out. I will play through, because I like all alien hunting games, storylines, and turn-based strategy in this theme, bit that's all.			"

												My review from www.yourgamesource.com where anyone can be Gaming Press!Falling Skies: The Game is from developer Little Orbit who specialize in TV/Movie Tie in games. That should really be enough right there to tell you all you need to know about the game. But if you are still interested, it is a turned based SRPG in the vein of Valkyria Chronicles, X-com, and the upcoming Operation S.T.E.A.M. game.The game is obviously based off the Falling Skies TV show, which I do not watch, so this review is from just a game aspect, not from someone who likes the show as well. There has yet to be a ton of info that I feel like I'm missing out on because of not watching, and other than cameos from named characters, I have yet to see a draw besides the title of the game.Being a turn based SRPG using guns, you can be quite tactical. Each turn you can do 2 actions, typically from Move, Attack, Defend, Reload, and then skills. So far I have seen only a handful of classes (Beserker, Scout, Fighter, Shield Kid), and each has a few skills that are quite nice. Sniper gets a 10% accuracy boost every 2 other turn, for one of your actions, Shield Kid can take in extra items which is great for healing items, Fighter has a counter attack when enemies are moving in range of them, and Beserkers have suppression. If you have watched any of my streaming, you can see I tend to use Suppression as often as possible. There are more skills as you level each character up, but Those are the big ones so far.You move around a map, that has fog of war, and enemies littered randomly around it. All your characters take a move, then the enemy takes theirs. I tend to move my units as a group, so that I hopefully don't run into too many enemy units at a time, and can pick them off easily, or use suppression to keep myself from taking damage. Enemy has humans which like you use guns, and these alien things (from the show, but I don't care for their names) which seem to be heavy melee units.The graphics are completely lacking. Faces are extremely bad, and sometimes I can not tell if a character is male or female without looking at the name. Graphics are not a huge issue for me, but I do need to point out that they stink. To go along with that, physics of the game are extremely bad as well. Sometimes an enemy on the ground, can you shoot you while you are on the roof of a 2 story building, in the middle of it, not on the edge of it. Takes some getting used to, after playing games that have a much better line of sight check.Each attack has a max amount of damage, as well as chance of hit based on distance, obstacles in between, and if the defending unit is in cover. The line of sight is a sometimes affected here, but typically only if you are on the same level of terrain, any shots up or down do not seem to change if you get a better angle. Some units do have bonuses for being on higher ground, but it is a skill, not a given.Your base game, consists of 5 areas, all available after the 2nd mission. Your HQ to basically decide which mission you want to do The barracks where you can recruit new members, and change out their weapons, ammo, armor, and item(s). Need to upgrade a weapon, armor, or ammo then you should head to the Armory. Wounded squad members go to the Infirmary, which you can also upgrade to get faster recovery and better items! Last is the memorial, which reminds you of your dead party members, which I have yet to let happen (admittingly one of the freezing games I was likely going to lose someone), so I don't know if it is just the name, or if the avatar is shown too.As for the story, which these games should use to drive you to keep playing, it is quite lacking. After the first 2 mission of the tutorial, you really don't get much of a story except for the mission statement, which is less than a paragraph in most cases. I kept having the feeling of why am I playing this game over another game in the genre? The lack of a story (which should be a TV tie-ins best feature!) so far has really left the game fairly dry.Biggest problem I have with the game is that it crashes. During my 3 hours of streaming (found here and here) I crashed out a total of 4 times. Twice it was a hard crash with an error message that sent me to my desktop, while 2 more times the game just froze waiting on the enemy (under suppression fire) to take their turn. Reading the steam forums for the game, there are other bugs that cause the game to crash as well. Some people are crashing after viewing a specific cut scene, others have an issue where the game wont load after doing specific weapon upgrades, and then of course the issue I have with suppression fire. Hopefully there is a patch incoming extremely quickly, and some Q&A testers getting reamed out hard.Overall the game is just what you would expect from a TV tie in. Dated graphics from over a decade ago (ive seen better looking PS2/GCN games), game play ripped from other genres (thankfully the best part of this game), and game breaking bugs due to lack of testing from a small studio. In the form it is in, I'm going to give the game a 5 out of 10, mostly due to the bugs and the lack of a story so far. *IF* they patch the game in the next week or two, and fix the bugs, the game could easily move up to a 7. I will likely play this game a bit more, rather than just be done with it, but only if they fix the bugs, as crashing every mission is fairly annoying.			"

												If you live in a Yurt in outer Outer Mongolia and aint heard of XCom but on your last visit to Utaanbaatar you saw Space Invaders for your very first time  and thought hey that looks cool  you might just think Falling Skies is ok. Perhaps..  Ok I ignored all the people who said this game  straight out sucks compared to any of the Xcoms various.I  thought it's only the cost of a cup of coffee and a bun I'll give it a try.It could be  an afternoon's  fun and games.    The voice acting is bad,very bad in this.It is a serious contender for Worse Clunky  Controls 2016.. Seeing what is going on in buildings where your troops are is deploreably bad.Graphically it's not pretty,and trying to work out what you are supposed to do next is beyond silly.The music is strident .Maps are small.Yes, I don't like this game much.  This is a cheap,poorly made product  but, hell, do what I do and take absolutely no notice of negative recommendations.What do I know? Go for it but be aware a cup of lukewarm coffee and even a pretty plain old bun are much, much, better than Falling Skies..			"

												Poor graphics, lackluster, phoned-in voice acting. A sub-par, rushed XCom clone. I can't reccomend this. Thank the Gods Steam allows returns now!			"

												C class game that seems to be more garnered for a tablet.  Basic graphics. Crude interface with not much thought put into it. Really want my money back on this one.			"

												while i can see it has merits and why some people enjoy this game it is very similar to the very similar XCOM and personally i would say you are far better off buying that if you enjoy this type of game			"

												This Game is a Turd! It had some potential but this game is too clunky and it crashes like crazy. If you want an Xcom like Game play Xcom this is not going to satisfy. The developers should be ashamed rushing this title out in this condition.			"

												Graphics and sound effects that would have been good 10 years ago, stiff and limited character animations, clunky and 'too-large' interface and badly paced gameplay (even for a turn based game)... But it does seem to be fully voiced which is it's only plus...Despite it looking like an XCom clone (even a complete ripoff), it's simply not... All of 20 minutes was enough to realise that Falling Skies is just a shoddy title with a game-play system that is loosely based on XCom, which is a shame as I really have enjoyed the show and, being an XCom clone, the game could have had so much potential...Something that requires special note, the in-game shots on the Steam listing look remarkably better than what I saw in-game, this is despite running the game at 1920x1080 and with all graphics options turned on and set at high where applicable - given this, they border on being false advertising as they are not the graphics to be expected in-game (at least not in the earlier stages of game-play)...

												It`s so not like XCOM. It`s so simple, so boring, there is no story at all, you just acomplish missions which look the same over and over again. I`ve bought it, played for 3 hours and I literally fall asleep during a mission. In the middle of a day. Serious. Don`t buy it if you are not the tv series ultimate fan. Hell even if you are don`t buy it :)			"

												I havn't played the gamefor long, BUT! Graphics could be a lot better, similar game play to xcom but xcom is much better, wait to see some more reviews before paying £30 for it, i will update this review shortly. PS  love the tv programs.			"

												OK, so it clearly invites comparisons with Xcom and it clearly isn't in the same league.  Nonetheless, its enjoyable and different enough to warrant your attention.  These days it can be picked up for near Poundland prices and if you approach it as a cheap and cheerful budget option it's fine.Oh, but the animations are an insult to anyone with eyes in their head.  Whoever reviewed and passed the cut scenes should take up cold call PPI sales instead.			"
