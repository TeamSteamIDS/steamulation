												I originally bought this game as a hard copy so my steam account hasn't logged the probable 100+ hours of game-play I've had from this game.A fan of the old Command & Conquer games, this appealed and did not disappoint at all.Firstly, the game play can be picked up very easily and the campaigns are a great way to get to handle the more in depth details as you play through the game and also the factions.This game, however, came into it's own with the Skirmish option. Single player is always fun to pass the time and release stress by pummelling several opponents into dust. BUT for maximum enjoyment definitely has to be multi-player.Once my friends and I hooked this up through a network (internet also) say goodbye to a decent nights sleep. The battles were epic, the scale was huge and most games started out as build a HUGE army and just slaughter your friends.This does get a little overpowered at times but with the options to ban certain units/grades, etc. Then the battles became more interesting.A friend would attack, you'd figure out a good line of defence, they go back and try work around that defence, you attack your way, they figure out another defence, etc... it was♥♥♥♥♥for tat battle that kept your ideas and strategies rotating and constantly developing.In the years I've owned this game, it's never lost it's appeal. The graphics are nice & finely detailed, controls are very easy and bulk unit commands are simple, way points & patrols are easy to set. All in all a great strategy game BUT I'd highly recommend multi-player for a long lasting experience.(After SupCom, I'd purchase C&C 4 and was very disappointed. Thinking about it, I've not played C&C since but instead gone with the SupCom expansion and SupCom2)			"

												I have now bought this game three times. I bought it on release for full price, lost the disk, rebought the game on disc a few years later, thats been lost forever, and i bought it a THIRD time and i still feel that i havent spent enough money to justify all the entertainment i've gotten from this game over the years. That tells you all you need to know, this is one of the best RTS games of all time. I've always thought Total Annihilation was the most underrated RTS ever made, and this spiritual successor does it even better. I will play this game in 20 years just like how i still play Total Annihilation even to this day.You didnt come here to find out how the game plays, you want to know if its worth it or not. Well, this game has been out for a long time. All the info is already there for you. If you are a casual RTS fan, love giant robots and armies, enjoy building gigantic sprawling bases and high level strategy, all mixed with a decent to solid single player campaign, and great balance, you should definitely get this game, especially on sale.Forged Alliance, the expansion, is also great and has the most players playing multiplayer. But to me the original will always hold a special place in my heart. Plus it seems more stable and the 4th race never quite felt as fluid or fun as the original three.My third favorite RTS ever after SC:BW and DoW: Dark Crusade / Soulstorm.UEF for life10/10			"

												I've only put an hour into this game as of recommending this, but I have to say, I'm definitely going to enjoy this game. The problem with many other games is that making a sizable army can take forever, and it never really feels like a true large scale battle (the only exception I can name that I've enjoyed being Battle for Middle Earth 2, when you can have 5+ barracks sending wave after wave into a battle zone).This game takes large scale strategy warfare to a whole new level, even introducing artillery that can fire for seemingly kilometers right into the enemy base, bringing a hint of objective gameplay into multiplayer matches, where you may be forced to take out the enemy artillery to protect the integrity of your base.I have encountered issues launching this game on Windows 7, however, but that was solved by launching the game in Windows XP Compatibility mode, so it's not a major issue.To keep it short, hell yes, I recommend this game.

												Years ago, I found this gem in the bargain bin in Wal-Mart and instantly fell in love.  For an old game it still runs well and was one of the few games (even today) to be optimized for four cores.  It needs that power to run because you will have awesome battles of an epic proportion. Each player can have up to a thousand units on the field at any one time.  Even for an RTS game with thousands of units being rendered at the same time the units are well detailed and animated.  Sup com is also the only game I have that supports multiple monitors, which is nice.  It is too bad that there is no longer any supported multiplayer, but Sup Com Forged alliance does have multiplayer with Forged Alliance Forever, which is run by fans of the game around the world.  The fans of Sup Com have even added support for mods and up to 12 player games, which is astounding with the fact that each player can have a thousand units.Great Game, I recommend getting both Sup Com and Sup Com Forged Alliance. For $3.74 it is a steal and even for full price, it is worth it.  I do not suggest getting Sup Com 2, which was developed by a different company and the multiplayer is truely dead. "

												An awesome game. I like to take my time, fortify my base, build up my forces before i take on the enemy. Something i find this game encourages. You do not want to rush things, because once the map shifts you could be facing a new enemy from a new direction. And if you just lost most of your fleet or aircraft taking that earlier objective in a rush, the enemy will whittle you down. They might not get you on the first wave, but by the 5th they'll be through your defenses lighting your factories on fire, taking away your ability to rebuild the army you had. But if you took your time, that first army can hold the line, while you build a second to tear the enemy a new hole.It's not a visually pleasing powerhouse, but it renders the units and explosions nicely. The story is fairly standard, as such games go. Pick a side and fight the other sides, who are evil. (off course pick an other side and you're old side is just as evil to them) Eventually leading to a climactic battle.			"

												I bought Supreme Commander so I could play another Real-time strategy other than Command & Conquer or Sins of a Solar Empire. What I found is that this game is what you would get if you mixed the two. Supreme Commander has the Epic scale and resource management of Sins, but the Micromanagement and the strategy of C&C. Gameplay - Able to run at Full graphical quality on even today's entry level cards, this game is set for the future, as it was one of the 1st games to boast Multi-core support. The attention to detail n this game is amazing, being able to zoom in to your smallest units and then out to see an entire army, then to the entire battlefield is a concept only seen in Sins.Graphics - The Graphics are okay for a game from 2008, which is probably why it runs so smoothly.Soundtrack - The soundtrack is only really noticeable on the menu and in battles, as every other time you are concentrating on building a massive armyIf this game is  on sale, it's a good offer, so if you have nothing else to buy, this could be a good choice.

												Why you should play this game:-This is Total Annihilation on steroids. Except it is fatter, better, faster, stronger. -Puts the word Strategy into RTS. Really teaches strategic thinking. Allows planning logistics, which is very useful, as you will move thousands of units across insanely huge maps.-Big fat tech tree, with big fat city-sized units at the top of it. -Multi-screen support. -Picture. Looks great in 2014, and this is a 2007-made game. "

												       Most epic RTS I've ever played. Where games like Age of Empires and War Craft 3 added more ""Emersion"" and games got smaller scale, SupCom blew the boundaries off zooming in/out on large scale warfare. Command up to 1000 land/air/sea units AND buildings in 4 tech tiers. Massive base building (no limit on individual unit types other than 1000 max cap) zoom in to near 1st person and hold space bar for a rotating close up higher detail cam view of battles, or zoom out past the clouds to see the entire MASSIVE map shrunk down to minimap scale and watch a sea of little enemy lights blink out. Even in 2014 it's a beautiful game, does not look out dated. Not quite as pretty as Tiberium Wars maxed out settings, but plenty of eye candy. Very replayable, different strategies, different races. If you've played and liked any of the other games mentioned above and the like, your collection is not complete without SupCom 1 and Forged Alliance, I've dusted off both many times.    Games include the entry: Supreme Commander, a standalone expansion pack: SupCom- Forged Alliance, and Supcom 2 - which is a Square Enix takeover and is a dramatic change to the game. Highly recommend Buying Supcom 1 and Forged Alliance as a package deal.			"

												My favourite strategy game, especially the expansion that made this jewel of a game even better. The story is well written and the voice acting is up to the standard. The campaign is full of well executed missions and the cutscenes are well done too. It is the kind of commitment I see in every detail that most games nowadays are lacking. I can hardly comment on the multiplayer in steam version. I own the original release and activated the game in steam. The olden game had this gas powered games hosted multiplayer lobby system that worked excellently. As I've gathered the service has been ran down.  Leaving the steam version with only direct ip multiplayer. Which as consept sounds oh so very crippled when compared to the excellency that was the old multiplayer.Only thing I could think to complain of ( in steam version ) is the lack of manual. Proper one existed for the non steam version of the game, however it has not been added to the steam version of the game. Not so terrible I suppose. I found it problematic because the game has well mapped hotkey controls.  It is much easier to control  your air units if you know that ctrl+a selects all air units.  The key mapping was only present in the game manual. So the steam owners might find it bit more difficult to organize their army than people who have the manual.			"

												Supreme Commander is an RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game with Land, Air and Sea units.  There are video tutorials explaining all the basic controls, structures and units.  The Graphics/Sound/Voice/Music are good and the game is well put together.  It is easy to play, but will take some time to master.  The game is fun to play and has plenty of re-play value.  There is more complexity than commonly found in most RTS games.  There are enough customization options to keep any player happy.			"

												Let me just start off by saying that I love this game, but the standalone expansion ""Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance"" offers more bang for your buck. With that being said, if you want this game for the campaign then you should get it. If you want the game just for multiplayer and skirmish matches, then get ""Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance,"" as it outshines the original in that regard. It isn't a matter of this game being bad or unlikable, it is just that Forged Alliance offers more skirmish and multiplayer content for your money. If you're looking to play both then just get ""Supreme Commander Gold Edition,"" as it includes both Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.(edit): People seem to be confused by this, so I'll say some more about this below:Forged Alliance is a standalone expansion. You don't need the original to play it. Forged Alliance offers a new story and a new faction. It has all of the original maps and units, as well as some new stuff on the side. Forged Alliance also has a somewhat active modding community. If you want to play skirmish and/or multiplayer, Forged Alliance is a better buy. If you want the original story, Supreme Commander (the original) is a better buy. If you want both, get the ""Gold Edition"". I've seen it for as low as $5 on Steam. Also, I thought that I should let you know that there is no more first-party multiplayer support. If you want to play multiplayer, go here: http://www.faforever.com/ "

												An excellent RTS that doesn't have many equals. It does have a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's just massive and super fun to play. Can be challenging but in a very good way. Being able to have up to 1000 units in your army is pretty neat. If you're a true strategist, this won't disappoint. There are multiple ways to go about how you want to attack the battle field. If you're a fan of heavy micro and macro managing, then this game is for you. But don't be fooled, the game can appeal to even the casualist of gamers. Trust me, I know. When it comes to RTS, let's just say I'm mediocre. But this game has what I need to waste some time. In a good way.			"

												As I mentioned in my review of the Forged Alliance expansion, Supreme Commander is the spiritual successor to the old Total Annihilation RTS. Both games involve creating large armies of land, air and sea vehicles to defeat your enemies, but Supreme Commander takes it a step further. Not only by having large maps and large varieties of units (even though they're mostly similar between the 3 factions) but also by adding experiemental units such as massive spider walkers or artilleries that have virtually infinite range or battleships that double as naval factories.

												Supreme Commander isn't your usual cup of strategy game. It is more like the big hairy uncle of yours that think bare knuckle boxing teaches character. Supreme Commander takes everything you'll find it in your standard RTS and supersizes it. From the very first mission onwards you will be overcome with a strange new feeling as you get thrown into a game with an almost unprecedented scale. The maps are not simply bigger than what you are used to, they blow everything previous to oblivion and the maps are not where this massive scale stops. Not only do you control massive armies and giant bases with humongous defensive networks but the units and buildings themselves are beyond what you usually find in an RTS game. Giant robots, massive spaceships and artillery pieces that can throw shells from Monday to Friday. If this game was a car I'd say the owner was compensating for something. Various design mechanics are hard at work to keep it all from overwhelming you. The zoom function allows to you go right down to group level and all the way out to where you can see the entire map. Instead of having to build new tech every so often everything has an upgrade function allowing old factories to produce the latest and greatest in units, your defenses to stay effective and your resource gathers to not fall behind. The entire game and the buildup of power and technology that happens throughout a game is a very fluid process and only rarely do you find yourself having nothing to do.Something that shouldn't be ignored either is that Supreme Commander, despite it's scale and the massive amount of units that can appear in a game manages to not only run really well, it also looks good.Supreme Commander is an RTS on steroids. It's like nothing we've seen for a very long time and it does everything it tries so very well.			"

												This review covers Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. Get both!One of the greatest RTS games of all time.If you like commanding hundreds of sea, air, and land units please read on.Don't let the low hours on Steam trick you. Eight of my friends and I bought this game on CD years ago. We would reoutinely play 6 to 8 co-op or multiplayer (free for all) games on LAN before the Internet speeds really got fast. I've got at least 1000 hours in this game with all the weekend LAN parties hosted at a bachelor pad.This game ruined my RTS experience by introducing or near perfecting some techniques.1. Virtually unlimited queueing of orders (patrol, move, etcetera). I've never hit a limit. I would reckon that I have had at least 100 orders queued without any issue to tens of different unit groups.2. Large scale battles. Each side can have hundreds of units (we've had 8 sides in one large battle).3. Mouse zoom in/out. I can't explain in words the many ways this feature is plain useful and should be the standard in RTS games. You can zoom into a low level (one unit) and out to see the entire map and units are then represented as particular icons (easily identifiable). You can issue any command or select any unit from low to high level zooms. It's plain awesome.4. True faction faction and unit differences. Big difference between tier 1, 2, 3, and experiental units.5. Interesting upgrade paths for commander with multiple paths (Builder, fighter, stealth, etc).6. Short cut keys to do same thing as mouse.7. Four factions that look, feel, and really behave different.8. True land, sea (above and below), and air units.9. Transports (air or sea) with fantastic transport queueing/ferry options.10. Graphics look great, even for an old game.11. Replayability (different campaigns as different factions, co-op, multiplayer, maps)12. Experimental units.13. Game balance. Almost every unit has a counterpart. Want to nuke people? Want to build anti-nuke system?14. Automation of engineers (patrol duty) to clear battle fields of wrecked metal or terrain.15. Massive selection of buildings and units16...I'm sure I'm leaving stuff out.I'm trying to convince my wife to let me buy five more copies when on sale for my children. There are a few potty words in the campaign (hell, damn, etc) so I'm not sure if I can yet. I started to play this game again after years of playing other games. This RTS set the standard in so many areas that is effectively made me a critic of other RTS games that could continue the standard and improve it. None have.Note: I am playing with Windows 10 64-bit operating system with Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance executables set to Windows compatibility (Windows XP SP2). If I do not set this, then game crashes between levels. With it set, I haven't crashed yet.Updated April 2017: Got new computer and installed Supreme Commander (still Windows 10 64-bit) & game launches. When I changed resolution & applied it screen goes grey. I used Task Manager to logout of Windows 10 (could not kill with Task Manager). After logging in I launched game a second time and new resolution got applied.			"

												Total Annihilation was brilliant compared to the other RTS games in its day, and Supreme Commander just takes it to the next level. I'm rather baffled by some of the comments here about the graphics (my graphics card and I beg to differ) and the intricacies of the gameplay are astonishing. I've played Command & Conquer since I was in 2nd grade, but C&C was just never as flexible or as epic in scale as Supreme Commander is.			"

												I have always loved and enjoyed playing real-time strategy games, and Supreme Commander satisfied my hunger pretty well.If you like real-time strategy, alien/futuristic themes, and challenging gameplay, you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very good, with nice special effects for the different weapons and units. There are 3 factions, each with a fairly large pool of different units to choose from (land, air, and water). The music and sound is decent.The controls are typical of an RTS-game - lots of hotkeying and keystrokes if you are familiar with this type of gameplay. The learning curve is moderate to challenging - especially if you are unfamiliar with the RTS genre. The tutorials are very helpful and recommended if you want to get a quick grasp of the game. There are a number of difficulty settings when playing agains the AI (I always start of with a skirmish against the AI whenever I first try a new RTS).There are two types of resources, energy and mass, and managing/balancing your upkeep of both is critical to being successful in this game. You can actually hit a standstill if you try to build/produce too many things at once and run out of resources. I still have not been able to find a way to cancel/delete buildings in progress, however, you are able to pass construction to free up resources.The feedback in the game is very good - health bars over each unit, a +/- number indicating how much of either resource you are gaining/losing per second (you can switch this with an efficiency %). There are tabs for each research level when you are trying to build structures or train units. There isn't much detail on each unit type (I am used to seeing things like attack damage, defense, etc). From what I've seen, you are only provided with the unit/building health, type (ex: attack submarine, spy plane), and amount of time to train/build.The story is pretty interesting, there is a nice cutscene in the beginning of the game that paints the setting for you. You have a commander unit who can attack, build, and reclaim resources. This unit must survive, and you lose if he is defeated. To give a quick boost to resources, you can use your commander (or any engineer/construction units) to reclaim/absorb materials from things like buildings, forests, and destroyed structures/units. The commander unit can also upgrade his components (chest piece, left/right arm piece, back). For example, you can either give the commander a resource boosting arm (for when you use him to relaim material) or a weapons boost on his left arm (you can remove pieces if you wish; upgrading your commander is very expensive and usually done later in the game).Gameplay is similar to many RTS-games I've played like Red Alert and Tiberian Sun series - there is a faction with cloaked units (radar sensor building to counter). A lot of the battles are decided by rock-paper-scissors mechanics (bombers to destroy buildings and/or slow-moving artillery, fighters to destroy bombers, anti-air to destroy both, tanks to destroy gun emplacements, etc). I do like the versatility of your commander - you can upgrade him to be more of a combat specialist or a building expert.Overall, I think you should give this game a try if you are interested in the theme or RTS-genre in general, however, the sequel is out, and for a cheaper price too. That being said, I would still give this game a playthrough - especially if you are an RTS-buff/junkie.Recommend!			"

												This game is amazing, no doubt about it.I first discovered this game when my dad gave it to me as a gift, he had never played it so he though I might show some interest in it. I booted up the game from the disc and played campaign, after the first mission I fell in love with it instantly. I learned the controls and fucntions pretty easily and played for hours on end; making planetfall, constructing a base and an army, and took down the opposing commander(s). Although games can be pretty long and tedious to complete, it is still fun trying to protect yourself from onslaughts of planes, ships, and tanks while trying to create your own army. Multiplayer is just like campaign/skirmish: great gameplay, great fun, and with real people to play with or against. It is sad that this game doesn't get the credit that it deserves and that it isn't as popular as It should be, because this game has been a fantastic experience playing.1000000/10 Would always recommend			"

												2006's underrated game that should have gotten more recognition. In 2006, console games dominated the gaming market over PC, but Supreme Commander is the only exception. For the first time ever in a RTS game, you can actually build and control 500+ units to dominate your foes in the universal battlefields throughout the galaxy. You can build your ground forces, naval, and air forces in one map and is one of the greatest RTS games has to offer. If you play RTS before, then this should be more interesting. Though this game is barely known in the PC Gaming world (and aged), I strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS.			"

												If you liked Total Annihilation, you will like this one. It's more or less the same game, but it has 3 factions which are actually different from each other. The campaign spans 6 missions per faction on ever expanding battlefields. This makes the missions fluid and you have to adapt to new situations on the fly.Apart from that it's still ""build mass extractors and energy generators to supply your constant building of army units"". Yes, this game is not about micro, but macro management. Your units don't cost ""money"" per se, but each building and each unit cost a certain amount of resources/second. If you're spending more than you're generating production slows down considerably. Different builder units and production facilities also have different outputs. To build an army quickly you will need to use builders to speed up production. It's a big old turtle and siege game. Whether you use artillery supported by main battle tanks, anti aircraft units and mobile shield batteries or different navy ships or a combination of bombers with fighter escorts and perhaps some gunship strafing runs, it all comes down to who can cripple the enemies economy better. Since there are no finite resources a skirmish can practically go on forever and end in a stalemate.Luckily there are also super units and long range nuclear and artillery gun emplacements to potentially kill the enemy. After all, all it takes to win is to kill the enemy commander, which can happen almost instantaneously in the late game. That's also why rushing in this game isn't very effective. The command unit will take care of most Tier 1 units pretty quickly, unless you have a ♥♥♥♥ton of them.To be honest, unit control could be a bit more precise. Often your units will simply clump up and die one after another. It's a big grind fest. Especially naval and air units are problematic. Air units told to resupply will often just circle the resupply pads for ages, despite being ""done"". Naval units need too much space where none is available, so in a group of 10 ships it often happened that only 1 moved to the destination... Also unit information when selecting an actual unit and not just with mouseover would have been cool. All in all it's a neat little macro strategy fest though with clear rock, paper, scissors gameplay: Break base with artillery, protect artillery with tanks, protect all of them with anti air and add some shielding into the mix. Done.			"

												When I first bought this game as an adolescent, my dad and I couldn't play it. We spent MONTHS finding the proper graphics card to install in our computer so that we could actually play the damn game! But when we finally got the graphics card, we fell in love with the game. Buying it on Steam gave me a trip down memory lane and a nostalgic feeling that was intensified by the fact that I could actually finish the game for once! The game itself is amazing. It has a resource system based on positive and negative income, the story and plot were immersive and rich for each different campaign, and the gameplay was and still is incredible. A friend of mine complained about the pathfinding for the units and they were mildly correct. Moving large amounts of troops is frustrating and a pain, but that frustration can be swept away as you watch your T3 units plow through enemy defenses. SupCom was, and still is, a game that I enjoy and I definitely recommend it.			"

												7/10. The game could of been improved in many ways. The campaign was fun......in a few cases. Most missions took a long time, were frustrating at points and were just plain boring. The only massive point that makes this game fun, is the strategy needed in some missions, and in Skirmish. For example. A horde of enemy units are incoming to your base. What do you do? Build a load of bombers and send them to those units? Quickly build some extra turrets and a bit of artillery? Nuke them!?!? Another example. The enemy is amassing a massive group of High Tech Bombers, that could EASILY wreck your defences and base, and leave you open to an attack or re-run from the bombers. What do you do this time? Build more Anti-Air, attack the Bombers? Nuke them (Like before)? Be all ""Come at meh, bro!""?Either way, Strategy and Thinking is needed to have the most fun in this.So if you just want a game that you could just have a game of Strategy with enemy AI's that you can choose the difficulty of, this is the game for you.

												One of my favorite RTS games of all times. Normally you're limited to around 24 units due to food cap and stuff. This game however, is about having a MASSIVE army. Furthermore, the story is AMAZING, and I mean REALLY amazing. The controls and playstyle is a bit different from normal RTS, and it takes a bit to get truly comfortable with, but when you get it, it's even better than normal RTS! An example would be that you control a primary unit called the ACU, which is your primary builder. This unit can be upgraded in many ways, either to be the ultimate fighter, or the ultimate builder. It represents you on the battlefield. There's smaller builders such as engineers, support ACUs, etc. All in all a truly epic RTS game with more ways to play than there's brilliant units to build (and there are A LOT of units!).			"

												If you grew up playing Total Annihilation like me, then you will feel comfy here.  Supreme Commander is a good game.  When it came out it was known for being a resource hog, but computers have caught up to it now.  The successor SC 2 actually runs much better than this game.  Anyways, it is a fun game that allows you to create hundreds of units for massive battles.  My favorite thing is to cover my base in shields and build tons of long range artillery installations, then build a giant mass of aircraft to take out any stragglers.  The multiplayer is fun, but it is implemented better in 2.  The single player campaign is ok, the story is pretty lame, but oh well.			"

Although there are a few bugs, that should be mentioned, and already have been in the forums.But the bugs are quickly forgotten about when you are in the heat of the battle, i personally have not been annoyed enough by them to care. But please watch a few guides and gameplays online before you venture into multiplayer, the learning curve is steep.All in all, a recommended game if you are in to RTS.			"

												If you're looking to play it multiplayer with friends, go for the standalone expansion pack Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance and download FAF and whatnot (refer to my recommendation on that game). You do NOT need this game to play the SupComFA expansion pack.If you're looking at this for the story, by all means dig in, especially if you find it discounted.			"

												Supreme Commander:  Everyone who thinks of themselves as soft, leave now.  Every body whothinks of them selves as strategic stay (also note spoilers).  This game is very good and allows you to think about the big picture (like Genaral Patton).  No this game is not a first person shooter but you are the overall commander.  It does allow multiplayer or single player.  you do have energy sources like mass and energy and if you run out then it can take a very long time to build one thing.  The time for each building varies.  You start out as an ACU (short for Armored Command Unit) and if it is destroyed it results in a nuclear meltdown and if the gamemode is on assasination you lose.  there is three teams, Cybran (my favorite), UEF (United Earth Fedaration), and the Aeon. each have personalities.  the UEF is the main and is balanced in all air, land, and sea.  the cybran are strong in numbers. and the Aeon are good in bad situations.

												I can tell you one thing about this game, it's so time consuming you won't even realize the time is gone.But that's one of the problems though, is that the game can literally go on for 7 hours.It takes about 40 mins to build one of the Tier 3 things, and you either make like 50 engineers to work on it, or you wait an hour to get something built.The combat however, is fun. You can make a crap load of troops and just have a massive battle. It feels like a real war, and it isn't like AoE where you can only have about 200 troops total. Unit diversity is key here. Unlike AoE 3, you cannot win by having a massive spam of the same few units.  ( AoE 3: 50 Skirmishers, 50 Uhlans, 20 Falconets and the rest musketeers )This does make early combat VERY boring though, as several base turrets will mow down hundreds of your troops, which take about 7 seconds each.There's LAND, AIR, and NAVAL combat, all in one. ( Some maps don't have water )The actual involvement in combat is very little though, there isn't much to do, formations don't really matter, and it's hard to get a proper battle formation, because of the way the formations work. There aren't any abilities or anything either, and you can't really do much micro-ing, because everyone can just turn around and shoot while running, so there isn't really any point. Units die extremely quick anyways, so having a small army is meaningless unless they're high tier.The 3 factions in the game don't really add any diversity whatsoever.I think it's to balance the game, but it kinda makes it dull. The only difference is the way the look.The game is buggy on every OS that isn't Windows XP, so make sure you use a service pack or something.There's a LOT of building required in this game. You have to probably build bases that are 1/10th of the map (By the Tier 3) I feel like there's too much focused on construction. I think I'm just building stuff 80% of the time.I can't find anyone to play multiplayer with, but when I look at it there were some pretty cool things. You can switch sides, and ally with people and stuff, just like AoE 2. You can also share resources if needed.Overall, I think it's a worth while game, but only for people who really want to play strategy, otherwise, it can be hard to get into.			"

Posted: July 24, 2014
												My First Steam Review:First things to point out: Don't let my Time on this game fool you I am very much knowledgeable on this game-Back Story:So I was recommended this game by a friend on Xbox Live, he more like nagged the hell out of me to get it. Even though this game disapeared off the shelves before I could snag it on Console, and since I prefer RTS on PC (Obvious reasons). For years he would Nag and I would always say: ""I still can't find this game in stores, nor on the Xbox Live Marketplace"" and then I found it on Steam. All I have to say is this is a beast of a game and is definitely worth every penny you pay for it, and if you don't like the Classic RTS then you can get the Second one which favors rushing tactics were this game makes that difficult or if not completely impossible.-Debate:Now I am aware of the HUGE debate on which is better the first or second, let me just settle that here: The First game(s) are more for RTS with emphsis on the S (Strategy). The second one is more for the newer people to RTS it is less complex and is much more fast paced. You can say this is better in which you are right as a RTS but for people who want to start or try a RTS the second one if for you.-!WARNING!-My friends used to play this game ALL DAY LONG and I wondered why and I found out it was a huge time consumer. If you buy this and play it expect to spend atleast 30+ minutes in a game, as I am writing this review I was up till 4 AM Playing the second I think campaign level it lasted 4 hours legit. However those four hours were the most intense four hours I've ever had in a game.-Gamemodes:If you are anything like me, you won't buy a single RTS unless it has a Skirmish mode or some sort of Scenario mode were you fight AI as this mode is were this game shines- Skirmish - 1-8 Players/AI 1,000 Unit Cap for all on massive maps as one of the three factions and is highly customizeable- Campaign - Restricted version of Skirmish where you only get certain units (I'll go in depth later) with objectives thrown in from time to time and smaller unit cap- Multiplayer - Same as Skirmish but with Players/AI (Haven't touched multiplayer yet)- Sandbox - It allows you to test out units as you want to test them for all factions all at once-Graphics:(N/A) Lol, really? You shouldn't really care about this since it is a RTS game but graphically it looks like a HD RTS, it doesn't look dated at all to me and it can be set to look equivalent to the sequel. Some of the models however look really ridiculous in my opinion compared to the newer looks in the second.-Sound:(10/10) Excellent sound track it fits so perfectly and it changes depending on your Status, the sounds of units are typical of RTS with some older RTS annoyances absent.-Gameplay:(9/10) In comparison to both the first and second they play identically, other then progression were this game utilizes the Tech system while the Second utilizes the Research system. The amount of units you deal with is truely massive and it is kind of required to use atleast 100 units to do most of the campaign missions. This game is brutal to strategies as you have to execute them perfectly in order to achieve victory and that is due to the double edged sword that is how forgiving this game is. You can easily fix a mistake in this game but it will make the game last longer and the AI aswell as other players benefit from this. However when you play this game they make it feel underwhelming dealing with the mass (Pun intended) of units you deal with, which is actually very beneficial. The big issue this game suffers is the polished Strategic view in the second game and requires more micromanagement then the second, but the AI for this are not stupid and won't blindly follow orders like they do on the second. You win by Killing the Enemies ACU (Armed Command Unit) who then explodes into the most rewarding nuclear fireworks show ever nothing is more satisfying then this and even the campaign does a slow mo Zoomed in view during this. However most of the game units feel more like cannon fodder in comparison to the second where all units can be made effective via researching. Building and researching is a slow process it litterally tells you how long it takes to research something or build something and they usually range in the 3 minute section (You can speed this up with engineers). -AI:(7/10) The AI are no push overs, and WILL AND DEFINITELY WILL ADAPT TO YOUR STRATEGY and counter it (This is why games take so long). They will rebuild, make defenses and play EXACTLY like a player would difficulty does nothing but give them abilities to cheat. Teammate AI however is a Joke and they will almost never assisst you and will always try to expand even into your Territories regardless of your needs and take what they want.Now the Unit AI is a big problem in this game even more so then the second one: Units can be stuck in the most stupid situations and they usually cannot be recovered or they will not follow your orders at all.-Balance:(9/10) In terms of Balance all factions are literally EQUAL and no faction is better then the other unlike the second were they favored certain playstyles (However those Aeon Morter anti unit cannons kill wayyyyy too quickly in my opinion). Until you get to the endgame (Experimentals).Strategies are equally difficult including Rushing.-Economy:Resources are infinite but runs on a resources system absent in most newer RTS's, in which economy management has to be done such as: Shutting down factories, Supply and Demand, and Constant expense of resource. If you play smart you will never run into this problem unless you need to do a 180 on your strategy.-Strategy:This is were the first shines in its many ways to win:- Cold War -- Weapons Race -- Nuclear War -- Ground war -- Turtling -- Rushing -- Sabotage -- Economy Crashing - Unique to the first game- Assassination -Just a few different ways/strategies that can happen in game-Tutorial:(9/10) The tutorial is pretty good at covering everything, but doesn't teach you anything, and I did NOT notice any learning curve that people been complaining about.-TL:DR-(10/10) If you played RTS games that are old, you'll like this game (Your anti-virus won't however). If you are new, you should still give it a try it is not as difficult as people say it is or try the Second then return here young one. Even if you aren't interested in this game it is definitely a must own for any Hardcore RTS player like myself.- Troubleshooting -Oh you are reading through the reviews and you cannot get the game to run? Well I had a few issues and I will clear up a few here.- Compatability: This game is Compatable with Windows 8.1 unlike what most people say, however it isn't with anti-virus software.- Trojan Virus: This game is Not a virus despite your dumb as hell Anti-Virus program would like to say, and your anti-virus will cause it to bug out and crash and corrupt its files^ How to fix ^1.) Go to your anti-virus software's Fire Wall settings;2.) Go to Allowed/Ignored/Whitelist3.) Click add4.) Click browse or find the program listed then click allowedYou'll find it in C:\ProgramFiles(86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\SupremeCommander\Bin it will be the Supreme Commander.Exe make sure you also add the other executables in the bin too as I found that makes it not happen a lot lessPro Tips:-Never Launch this game at start up as your Anti virus may freak out as it is still ""Waking up"" and will cause it to delete the executeable- Executed Executable: Missing your Executable? Heres how to get it back1.) Go to Library on Steam2.) Click the Game go to options on it until the options submenu opens3.) Now find the option that says Verify Cache and run it4.) Wait about 10-30 minutes for it to fix deleted files*5.) Re-add Supreme Commander.exe to your whitelist on anti-virus software			"

												Supreme Commander is one of the granddaddy Real Time Strategy games from the era of Starcraft 1 and the Command & Conquer games. Like its predecessor Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander is all about huge battlefields and hordes of units running around. No need to worry about building pylons or supply depots to increase your build limit, just mass produce your favorite units from your half dozen factories and overrun your enemies.According to the game’s opening cinematic, the Earth Empire spread out over the galaxy and eventually fractured into 3 factions. The UEF is the “old guard” faction that is probably closest to modern day United States. The Cybran Nation / Symbionts were born from a fusion of human brains with computers to create enhanced artificial intelligence. And the final faction Aeon Illuminate is kind of an enlightened (or cultish) group who follow an alien religion called The Way (even though the aliens themselves were wiped out long ago). Each faction has their own single player campaign to conquer the galaxy, and even though they cross over each other, they have mutually exclusive endings like Command & Conquer. They don’t all form a single story, like Starcraft. At first glance, Supreme Commander seems to be built around the ACU (Armored Command Unit) which is a giant human shaped robot that strides across the battlefield blasting enemies and building structures. In reality though, the ACU is more like a mobile command center. Other than being a really tough builder unit, the ACU doesn’t have too much going for it. It can’t build the more advanced structures and it’s not such a great fighter. However, if you lose the ACU, you lose the game. If you’ve played the Command & Conquer games, you should be pretty comfortable starting up with Supreme Commander. For one thing, fixed defensive buildings (turrets) are extremely hard to kill, so turtling in is a really effective tactic in the single player campaign.If you’re used to playing real time strategy games, Supreme Commander’s build system may seem counter-intuitive. You don’t need to have the money up front to buy units or buildings since everything is paid for “over time.” As soon as you start building something, the mass supply (your money) starts being drained a certain amount per second. If you run out of mass, the build pauses, but since your mass is also gained over time (not in little clusters like Starcraft), the actual effect is that your build just gets slowed down (as soon as your mass goes up +1, it gets drained for the building). This means you can start building your entire base at the start of every level, but you should probably let some of the buildings finish first, like power plants and mass extractors (money makers). It sounds weird when I try to explain it, but it makes sense when you play.Probably the biggest difference between Supreme Commander and a lot of other real time strategy games though, is the size of the level maps. The maps are so large that you need to use your mouse scroll wheel to constantly zoom in and out at different locations to see what’s going on. There’s no mini-map in the corner of your screen. The “tech levels” for Supreme Commander are also unlike many other real time strategy games. Your engineer (builder unit) can only build structures up to its current level, and the engineer cannot be upgraded. For example, a level 1 engineer can only build level 1 buildings. If you want to build level 3 buildings, you need to build a level 3 engineer. Every production building also upgrades tech levels independently. So if you have 2 land factories and one of them is level 2, only that factory can create level 2 buildings until you upgrade the second land factory. Honestly it seems like a waste of time to me, especially if you like to build large numbers of factories at once to really pump out the units.Pros:+Huge maps with room for massive battles between armies of units. The Air, Land, and Sea are your battlefield, and along with the expansive area, there’s a huge variety of units to choose from. There is a unit cap, but it doesn’t seem to be explicitly stated anywhere. If you just set all your factories to autobuild units, you’ll reach the cap eventually.+Artillery! Long range bombardment is probably my favorite weapon in real time strategy games. You can have mobile missile launchers and even fixed artillery launcher buildings pounding your enemies. There are also strategic missile launchers (nukes) but the enemy can build strategic missile defense structures that automatically counter your nukes, so I don’t really see the point.+The game is quite long, so if you are enjoying yourself, you can kill over 30 hours just playing through the 3 single player campaigns. There only seem to be 6 levels each, but they’re not straightforward “kill everything” missions. They usually expand the map several times each level (complete an objective, boom the map doubles in size and you’re now surrounded). Fortunately, Supreme Commander has a “speed up time” option that increases the rate the game plays. You can play at up to 10x normal speed, but you should really only do this if you’re waiting for your buildings/units to finish construction.Cons:-The game can be hard to get used to, especially the formations of troops when you have a large army. The naval units especially take multiple commands to get them to form up how you want them. The game’s tutorial is not in an obvious place in the main menu. It really should have been either part of the “campaign menu” or right above “campaign” at the start. Instead, it’s kind of in the middle of options. -Since you’re constantly zoomed out on the battlefield to get an overview of the map, you really don’t get to see much in the way of graphics. You mostly just see dots firing more dots at enemy dots. Granted, the game is pretty old so you shouldn’t be expecting top notch graphics as the main draw.Overall, the game is fun for people who enjoy real time strategy games. There are no steam achievements, so if you just want to see the story you can set the game to easy and slog your way through. Yes, even on easy mode it will take quite a while to beat the game because of just how massive the levels are. Remember to build up your base defenses, and the computer will crack its head open on your turrets. "

												Supreme Commander is a very fun RTS game, you can play as 3 factions; UEF, Cybran, and/or Aeon. This game takes off of its precursor Total Annihilation, another RTS game that came out in 1997 by Cave Dog, Sadly Cave Dog is no longer around to make RTS games, but Chris Taylor and his company as well as Gas Powered Games came out with the Supreme Commander RTS Game. I recomend this game for anyone from the the ages 9 and up due to complicated game play.Rank;  10/10			"

												A shining example of pure RTS, though does not have the appeal of mass-market RTS as it is today. Not many people will like this - and chances are you probably won't if you're reading this - but I loved the hell out of this game and would recommend it to anyone seeking a truly epic RTS.			"

												Great RTS. Just when you figure out how to stay alive the map unfolds even more and adds new challenges while still contemplating the original objectives. Missions do take many hours, so not for the casual coffee break gamer. You will get your money's worth and then some.			"

												My First Steam Review:First things to point out: Don't let my Time on this game fool you I am very much knowledgeable on this game-Back Story:So I was recommended this game by a friend on Xbox Live, he more like nagged the hell out of me to get it. Even though this game disapeared off the shelves before I could snag it on Console, and since I prefer RTS on PC (Obvious reasons). For years he would Nag and I would always say: ""I still can't find this game in stores, nor on the Xbox Live Marketplace"" and then I found it on Steam. All I have to say is this is a beast of a game and is definitely worth every penny you pay for it, and if you don't like the Classic RTS then you can get the Second one which favors rushing tactics were this game makes that difficult or if not completely impossible.-Debate:Now I am aware of the HUGE debate on which is better the first or second, let me just settle that here: The First game(s) are more for RTS with emphsis on the S (Strategy). The second one is more for the newer people to RTS it is less complex and is much more fast paced. You can say this is better in which you are right as a RTS but for people who want to start or try a RTS the second one if for you.-!WARNING!-My friends used to play this game ALL DAY LONG and I wondered why and I found out it was a huge time consumer. If you buy this and play it expect to spend atleast 30+ minutes in a game, as I am writing this review I was up till 4 AM Playing the second I think campaign level it lasted 4 hours legit. However those four hours were the most intense four hours I've ever had in a game.-Gamemodes:If you are anything like me, you won't buy a single RTS unless it has a Skirmish mode or some sort of Scenario mode were you fight AI as this mode is were this game shines- Skirmish - 1-8 Players/AI 1,000 Unit Cap for all on massive maps as one of the three factions and is highly customizeable- Campaign - Restricted version of Skirmish where you only get certain units (I'll go in depth later) with objectives thrown in from time to time and smaller unit cap- Multiplayer - Same as Skirmish but with Players/AI (Haven't touched multiplayer yet)- Sandbox - It allows you to test out units as you want to test them for all factions all at once-Graphics:(N/A) Lol, really? You shouldn't really care about this since it is a RTS game but graphically it looks like a HD RTS, it doesn't look dated at all to me and it can be set to look equivalent to the sequel. Some of the models however look really ridiculous in my opinion compared to the newer looks in the second.-Sound:(10/10) Excellent sound track it fits so perfectly and it changes depending on your Status, the sounds of units are typical of RTS with some older RTS annoyances absent.-Gameplay:(9/10) In comparison to both the first and second they play identically, other then progression were this game utilizes the Tech system while the Second utilizes the Research system. The amount of units you deal with is truely massive and it is kind of required to use atleast 100 units to do most of the campaign missions. This game is brutal to strategies as you have to execute them perfectly in order to achieve victory and that is due to the double edged sword that is how forgiving this game is. You can easily fix a mistake in this game but it will make the game last longer and the AI aswell as other players benefit from this. However when you play this game they make it feel underwhelming dealing with the mass (Pun intended) of units you deal with, which is actually very beneficial. The big issue this game suffers is the polished Strategic view in the second game and requires more micromanagement then the second, but the AI for this are not stupid and won't blindly follow orders like they do on the second. You win by Killing the Enemies ACU (Armed Command Unit) who then explodes into the most rewarding nuclear fireworks show ever nothing is more satisfying then this and even the campaign does a slow mo Zoomed in view during this. However most of the game units feel more like cannon fodder in comparison to the second where all units can be made effective via researching. Building and researching is a slow process it litterally tells you how long it takes to research something or build something and they usually range in the 3 minute section (You can speed this up with engineers). -AI:(7/10) The AI are no push overs, and WILL AND DEFINITELY WILL ADAPT TO YOUR STRATEGY and counter it (This is why games take so long). They will rebuild, make defenses and play EXACTLY like a player would difficulty does nothing but give them abilities to cheat. Teammate AI however is a Joke and they will almost never assisst you and will always try to expand even into your Territories regardless of your needs and take what they want.Now the Unit AI is a big problem in this game even more so then the second one: Units can be stuck in the most stupid situations and they usually cannot be recovered or they will not follow your orders at all.-Balance:(9/10) In terms of Balance all factions are literally EQUAL and no faction is better then the other unlike the second were they favored certain playstyles (However those Aeon Morter anti unit cannons kill wayyyyy too quickly in my opinion). Until you get to the endgame (Experimentals).Strategies are equally difficult including Rushing.-Economy:Resources are infinite but runs on a resources system absent in most newer RTS's, in which economy management has to be done such as: Shutting down factories, Supply and Demand, and Constant expense of resource. If you play smart you will never run into this problem unless you need to do a 180 on your strategy.-Strategy:This is were the first shines in its many ways to win:- Cold War -- Weapons Race -- Nuclear War -- Ground war -- Turtling -- Rushing -- Sabotage -- Economy Crashing - Unique to the first game- Assassination -Just a few different ways/strategies that can happen in game-Tutorial:(9/10) The tutorial is pretty good at covering everything, but doesn't teach you anything, and I did NOT notice any learning curve that people been complaining about.-TL:DR-(10/10) If you played RTS games that are old, you'll like this game (Your anti-virus won't however). If you are new, you should still give it a try it is not as difficult as people say it is or try the Second then return here young one. Even if you aren't interested in this game it is definitely a must own for any Hardcore RTS player like myself.- Troubleshooting -Oh you are reading through the reviews and you cannot get the game to run? Well I had a few issues and I will clear up a few here.- Compatability: This game is Compatable with Windows 8.1 unlike what most people say, however it isn't with anti-virus software.- Trojan Virus: This game is Not a virus despite your dumb as hell Anti-Virus program would like to say, and your anti-virus will cause it to bug out and crash and corrupt its files^ How to fix ^1.) Go to your anti-virus software's Fire Wall settings;2.) Go to Allowed/Ignored/Whitelist3.) Click add4.) Click browse or find the program listed then click allowedYou'll find it in C:\ProgramFiles(86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\SupremeCommander\Bin it will be the Supreme Commander.Exe make sure you also add the other executables in the bin too as I found that makes it not happen a lot lessPro Tips:-Never Launch this game at start up as your Anti virus may freak out as it is still ""Waking up"" and will cause it to delete the executeable- Executed Executable: Missing your Executable? Heres how to get it back1.) Go to Library on Steam2.) Click the Game go to options on it until the options submenu opens3.) Now find the option that says Verify Cache and run it4.) Wait about 10-30 minutes for it to fix deleted files*5.) Re-add Supreme Commander.exe to your whitelist on anti-virus software			"

												Supreme Commander is one of the granddaddy Real Time Strategy games from the era of Starcraft 1 and the Command & Conquer games. Like its predecessor Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander is all about huge battlefields and hordes of units running around. No need to worry about building pylons or supply depots to increase your build limit, just mass produce your favorite units from your half dozen factories and overrun your enemies.According to the game’s opening cinematic, the Earth Empire spread out over the galaxy and eventually fractured into 3 factions. The UEF is the “old guard” faction that is probably closest to modern day United States. The Cybran Nation / Symbionts were born from a fusion of human brains with computers to create enhanced artificial intelligence. And the final faction Aeon Illuminate is kind of an enlightened (or cultish) group who follow an alien religion called The Way (even though the aliens themselves were wiped out long ago). Each faction has their own single player campaign to conquer the galaxy, and even though they cross over each other, they have mutually exclusive endings like Command & Conquer. They don’t all form a single story, like Starcraft. At first glance, Supreme Commander seems to be built around the ACU (Armored Command Unit) which is a giant human shaped robot that strides across the battlefield blasting enemies and building structures. In reality though, the ACU is more like a mobile command center. Other than being a really tough builder unit, the ACU doesn’t have too much going for it. It can’t build the more advanced structures and it’s not such a great fighter. However, if you lose the ACU, you lose the game. If you’ve played the Command & Conquer games, you should be pretty comfortable starting up with Supreme Commander. For one thing, fixed defensive buildings (turrets) are extremely hard to kill, so turtling in is a really effective tactic in the single player campaign.If you’re used to playing real time strategy games, Supreme Commander’s build system may seem counter-intuitive. You don’t need to have the money up front to buy units or buildings since everything is paid for “over time.” As soon as you start building something, the mass supply (your money) starts being drained a certain amount per second. If you run out of mass, the build pauses, but since your mass is also gained over time (not in little clusters like Starcraft), the actual effect is that your build just gets slowed down (as soon as your mass goes up +1, it gets drained for the building). This means you can start building your entire base at the start of every level, but you should probably let some of the buildings finish first, like power plants and mass extractors (money makers). It sounds weird when I try to explain it, but it makes sense when you play.Probably the biggest difference between Supreme Commander and a lot of other real time strategy games though, is the size of the level maps. The maps are so large that you need to use your mouse scroll wheel to constantly zoom in and out at different locations to see what’s going on. There’s no mini-map in the corner of your screen. The “tech levels” for Supreme Commander are also unlike many other real time strategy games. Your engineer (builder unit) can only build structures up to its current level, and the engineer cannot be upgraded. For example, a level 1 engineer can only build level 1 buildings. If you want to build level 3 buildings, you need to build a level 3 engineer. Every production building also upgrades tech levels independently. So if you have 2 land factories and one of them is level 2, only that factory can create level 2 buildings until you upgrade the second land factory. Honestly it seems like a waste of time to me, especially if you like to build large numbers of factories at once to really pump out the units.Pros:+Huge maps with room for massive battles between armies of units. The Air, Land, and Sea are your battlefield, and along with the expansive area, there’s a huge variety of units to choose from. There is a unit cap, but it doesn’t seem to be explicitly stated anywhere. If you just set all your factories to autobuild units, you’ll reach the cap eventually.+Artillery! Long range bombardment is probably my favorite weapon in real time strategy games. You can have mobile missile launchers and even fixed artillery launcher buildings pounding your enemies. There are also strategic missile launchers (nukes) but the enemy can build strategic missile defense structures that automatically counter your nukes, so I don’t really see the point.+The game is quite long, so if you are enjoying yourself, you can kill over 30 hours just playing through the 3 single player campaigns. There only seem to be 6 levels each, but they’re not straightforward “kill everything” missions. They usually expand the map several times each level (complete an objective, boom the map doubles in size and you’re now surrounded). Fortunately, Supreme Commander has a “speed up time” option that increases the rate the game plays. You can play at up to 10x normal speed, but you should really only do this if you’re waiting for your buildings/units to finish construction.Cons:-The game can be hard to get used to, especially the formations of troops when you have a large army. The naval units especially take multiple commands to get them to form up how you want them. The game’s tutorial is not in an obvious place in the main menu. It really should have been either part of the “campaign menu” or right above “campaign” at the start. Instead, it’s kind of in the middle of options. -Since you’re constantly zoomed out on the battlefield to get an overview of the map, you really don’t get to see much in the way of graphics. You mostly just see dots firing more dots at enemy dots. Granted, the game is pretty old so you shouldn’t be expecting top notch graphics as the main draw.Overall, the game is fun for people who enjoy real time strategy games. There are no steam achievements, so if you just want to see the story you can set the game to easy and slog your way through. Yes, even on easy mode it will take quite a while to beat the game because of just how massive the levels are. Remember to build up your base defenses, and the computer will crack its head open on your turrets. "

												Supreme Commander is a very fun RTS game, you can play as 3 factions; UEF, Cybran, and/or Aeon. This game takes off of its precursor Total Annihilation, another RTS game that came out in 1997 by Cave Dog, Sadly Cave Dog is no longer around to make RTS games, but Chris Taylor and his company as well as Gas Powered Games came out with the Supreme Commander RTS Game. I recomend this game for anyone from the the ages 9 and up due to complicated game play.Rank;  10/10			"

You should definitely buy the gold edition because the Standalone Add-on Forged Alliance is in many points better than the original but they are both worth playing. This game is also predestined for mods to increase the difficulty level by adding more and harder difficulties. Also, new units can be added. Check it out, it's a little masterpiece :)			"

												nuked small civilization 10 times within 30 seconds, just to be sure they were all gone. 420/69 metascoreSerious Part: Used to play on Xbox and haven't touched this game in ages and recently got it (for free) after buying a new Radeon card, and after reading other reviews, I believe they are being harsh.I have both Supreme Commander AND Forged Alliance, so I am trying not to be biased.  Both games have pros and cons, but I honestly prefer the original SC over Forged Alliance, and here's why:Yeah, FA has all the DLC and everything, but it's not the same.  AI seems to be worse, and from my experience I can't stockpile resources nearly as well in FA, as from about 2 minutes into the game, even on easy bots, you begin undertaking a lot of strategic bombings by the bots and if you don't stack AA then you get screwed early game.The hud, I must admit, is much better in FA however you can get used to the bigger, more blocky HUD in Supreme Commander 1 very easily. IGN rating: 10/10, Horrible.PROS OF SC ORIGINAL:-Easier stockpiling-Campaign Mode-Seems to run a bit smoother-Better AI (opinion)-More 'splosionsCONS:-Big hud that takes up some portion of the screen-Graphics fall behind the polished FA edition-Doesn't have all DLCI say try out Supreme Commander, if you like it, then buy Forged Alliance.That is all :D			"

												I haven't played Forged Alliance yet, so this is just for the base game. Being a MASSIVE fan of TA, this game is familiar and different. The tutorial is stupid and almost useless, and finding all key definitions isn't possible in game, so use the internet. The interface in game takes a bit getting used to, but works just fine. The only gripe I have is when laying out multiple build commands, its not as streamlined as TA at all... should have kept it the way it was in TA, much easier. You'll find yourself deleting a huge set of commands and starting over from scratch just because you misplaced something by one tile.OTHER than that, this game is FUN. Strategy up the yin-yang!

However, it's also completely possible to win any game with the most basic of units. No matter your play style, this game has something for you.Build line and line of defenses and make a fleet of artillery launchers / nukes to snipe your enemies base or quickly build up a basic army and rush your enemy before he's ready. You will have fun with this one.			"

												If you want to play an RTS with hundreds if not thousands of units; This the game for you.If you like just looking at dots move and and destroy other dots; This is the game for you.If you love Fractions having their own unique super controllable doomsday mech that annihilates entire armies; This is the game for you.If you like maps that are so big it makes Battlefield 4 look like a Call of Duty map. This is the game for you. KIdding aside. Just get the game if you haven't found an RTS of epic scale to scratch that itch.			"

												so far - best known strategy since release.and its really STRATEGY. not puny/childish Tactical games, tend to brag about ""strategy"" or being ""RTS"" all the time.the only missing pieces is working lobby(GPG was shutdown and all 3 third-party things didn't support vanilla game), 64-bit binary(game become memory hungry with lot of players on HUGE maps and/or over time) and better multi-core support.so if wargaming.net decide pack it(64-bit binary, multi-core/asynchronious engine & lobby) into package and reinforce engine with some more cookies(ie bit pumping textures, geometry, introducing tesselation, improving HDR, SSR, SSAO, etc.), optionally - im in for purchase queue :).

												All in all, if you disregard the Mass- Problems, its a very good Game. Of course the Multiplayer is way better than the Singleplayer Campaign. Sure the SP has its moments, but the Stroy is a bit flat, and theres no real challange, where you need big skills in playing strategy gammes.But this doesent matter, because the Multiplayer is very good...

												I never played this when it was first release, but i can see why it was so well recieved.Mind you, i only play single-player campaigns and skirmishes in games like this so keep that in mind if your a multiplayer addict.I wasn't too impressed the first hour i played it, but i stuck with it and kept coming back for more. I finished the QAI campaign and quckly started another. But once i got going it seemed like more of the same, not much difference at all at least not enough, so i'd rather look for another game. But i'd love to play more campaigns and expansions if there were some.Cheap and good, despite being an old geezer. If you like RTS games go at it, but i'm sure multiplayer is where it shines at it's best.			"

												At first this game was a bit... overwhealming. I know I tend to go for an all out game everytime I play any stratagy, but I guess that's one of the major fallbacks to the game. There's a lot of things to be concerneed with at once but that's nicely balanced between the two supplies needed to do everything. Campaign missions (with the amount of effort I put into them) literally take 4 to 5 hours a pop. While I'm doing all of this constant work, I just end up wasting time and preparing for an ending that doesn't quickly happen. So for me I need to find a new way of playing RTSG's if I ever want to complete this god damn campaign... To sum up the first point: There's not much variability for the gameplay. There's a specific way the game must be played for an efficient match. (So the balance isn't really 'just right'). Next are the glitches involved during gameplay. I'm not a glitch geek or really know any unique or cool terms to throw around... I do know that sometimes me units have a buffer and it can be quite annoying. It also happens for the AI. And the Commander has some patchy building movements.  Anyhow, there are glitches - and there wont be an update, so whatevs...Lastly is the multiplayer. There none! I swore when I first played this there was, but there's only LAN really. Kind of annoying. Pretty much get it if you like what it looks like and you have an adaptable way of playing RTSG's. (Or have millions of hours of freetime)			"

												What can I say?  I love Total Annihilation, Planetary Annihilation is an abomination, and I wanted a TA-like RTS.  This is how you do it, a gem by Gas Powered Games and THQ (now replaced with Nordic, who moved the game to Steamworks servers).  It's got a great artstyle, three exceptional campaigns with intriguing and well-executed stories, and a small but dedicated and polite online community.There's literally nothing I can say against this game.  Total Annihilation, Age of Empires II, and Red Alert II remain my all-time favorite RTS games, but this game has completely replaced TA on that list.  It crushed my nostalgic love for the game with full 3D visuals and fantastic gameplay, an accomplishment that should never be overlooked.Whereas most RTS's fall apart in the singleplayer department, this game's campaigns stand the test of time with quality writing and great missions.  While some lack proper multiplayer-ing, this game's netcode gets the job done well, now under the eternal watch of Gaben and the Steamworks serverlistin the clouds.  It's also very compatible with modern hardware and runs well on a variety of systems.  There's plenty of lasting value with three campaigns and factions who all play differently from each other and an active multiplayer scene.I seriously can't recommend this game enough, it's one of the best RTS's I've ever had the pleasure of trying.  Ever.  Simply put, you need to buy this and Forged Alliances as soon as you can.  You're doing a disservice to yourself by not giving it a chance.			"

												Even though I gave this game a thumbs up in my original review, now that I've played Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, I realize that there is absolutely no reason to play Supreme Commander 1.  Forged Alliance is better in every respect and it's a stand-alone expansion, so just play that.-----ORIGINAL REVIEW-----------------------------------------------------------------------I would recommend playing Supreme Commander - at the end of the day it's a really fun game, and it has its incredible moments.  However, this game did not live up to its legendary reputation for me.  Granted, I don't like playing RTS multiplayer because I don't find it fun spending hours optimizing every mouse click, so this is based on my experience with singleplayer.This game puzzles me because some aspects are mind-blowingly cool, and others are absolutely moronic.  Examples of the mind-blowingly cool stuff:- Battleships that grow legs and walk on land AKA the most radical amphibian assaults you can imagine.- Giant artillery guns that can fire on enemy bases continents away.- An incredibly deep economy based on ""Mass"" which is used to produce things, and ""Energy"" which is consumed while you produce things.- Experimental units AKA GIANT LASER SPIDER ROBOTS WTF!!!- Tactical nuclear missle launches....and the list goes on.  But then you get to the moronic crap:- Units and Buildings share a unit limit - if you build too many units, you can't build anymore buildings.  HUH?!?!?!?- Tutorial is basically ""Welcome to the tutorial!  Here is a button that opens the in-game 20-page manual.  Thanks for playing the tutorial!""- Units have no sense of self-preservation and make no attempts to escape enemy fire - if a unit cannot fire back at the attacking enemy, it will just sit there like an idiot and let itself die.- No unit formations (that's kind of basic for an RTS).and also (and this is absolutely infurianting), all your land units act like distracted people at a stoplight.  When you give them a move order, the ones at the front will wait a second, then start moving, and the remaining units will not move until the ones in front of them have moved.  Imagine giving a square formation of tanks an order to move into an enemy base - that nice tight formation will spread itself out into vulnerable line, and instead of a wall of firepower overwhelming the enemy, your tanks will end up entering the enemy base one at a time politely letting the enemy defenses individually pick them off.This is unacceptable.  I don't know if it's intentional, or if there's some way to prevent this I don't know about - but in a game that's all about large scale conflict, it's unacceptable to give a large group of units a move order and end up with some of them still at your base waiting for their turn to move while the front of the column is already at the enemy base getting killed because they have no back up.But like I said, at the end of the day, it was fun to play and the cool moments this game provides are worth it.  I just don't think this is the RTS masterpiece that everyone claims it is.			"

												Why is it when I first purchased Supreme Commander from ""Steam"" it worked perfectly, then after the ""MANY"" updates that ""Steam"" required to continue playing the game that it STOPPED working? This game was one of the old classics I played when ""Windows"" was still in it's infancy. Now it seems all the games on here are being ""updated"" out of existance. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SELL A GAME MAKE SURE IT WORKS ON YOUR SYSTEM !!!!			"

												Annoying bugs: sound never works properly, and cinematics sometimes cause the game to crash. Neither are gamebreaking, but they cause enough frustration to tip this mediocre game into the negative for me.The story of the campaign is pretty interesting, and the visuals are attractive for the game's age, but the gameplay itself is pretty shallow. Unit control and movement isn't conducive to micro, and the enemy AI usually has a pretty even mix of unit types so strategy doesn't play much of a role. Most fights are just a wars of attrition.

Although having a giant mech as your base is a novel concept, the units were relatively generic and I couldn't for the life of me find of view of the map that felt comfortable.  Perhaps this would be better suited to someone into Total War or another large-scale title.			"

												Sadly this game doesn't follow on from its roots (Total Annihilation), it instead follows the current trend in RTS games of taking the 'S' off the end of its genre (Real Time Strategy) and making this just a unit overload game. All you do is build as many units as possible and then keep on building them! Even when your attacking with your huge army, keep on building because if you don't you'll find your self completely outnumbered!If you’re a lover of the old greats of this genre (Command & Conquer, Red Alert and the already mentioned Total Annihilation etc) then just stay away, this isn’t for you, or me!

												I don't recommend this game unless you really enjoy turtling.  It has good ideas, but they are poorly implemented.  Painfully slow build times on units and structures, mass fabricators destroying any need to control the map and the resources scattered across it, and incredibly powerful defenses turn this into a painful slog.  The ability to control and upgrade the commander who represents you in the game is neat at first, but they quickly become the big can which sits in the middle of its defense riddled, mass fabricator clogged base and never leaves.  Because if the commander does leave, it runs a good chance of dying and losing the match.What the game offers:  The BasicsYou play as a commander aligned with one of three factions which can build basic structures.  The factories let you get fabricators which build even better structures.  Upgrade the factories to get better fabricators for better structures and units.  You also need to balance production with your resource income, so make sure you're building mass pumps, power generators, and mass fabricators to meet your base's growing needs. When it comes to crushing the opposition, you are given many options, and your three starting ones are land units, naval units, and air units.  At higher fabricator tiers, you can get long range artillery, stealth, experimental units, and strategic missle launchers (nukes).  Of course, all of this can be countered easily at lower cost by defenses.  In order to defeat an enemy, you need to either catch their commander while it's exposed or have an overwhelming advantage to push through their defenses.Mass pumps provide the most mass at the lowest energy cost, but they can only be built atop mass deposits scattered across the map.  Ideally, the game would become a battle to control and defend mass pumps for a production edge over the opponent.  Sadly, mass fabricators destroy this by allowing a player to acquire all of the mass they will ever need from the comfort and safety of their own base, often at a faster pace and at less expense.The factions are almost entirely aesthetics, with their only major differences being what experimental units they can build.  They all have the same unit classes and structures which do the same jobs.  There are small bits of fluff like ""Aeon bomber does damage over (a very short) time, cybran bomber does slightly less damage over a slightly larger area, and UEF is a typical bomber with a large explosion and good damage.""  But ultimately the differences are minimal.Three CampaignsThe story is decent in each of the three races' campaigns, but the basics makes them a slow mess.  Even the first map in the campaign takes at least forty minutes to finish simply because of how long it takes to build everything and amass enough firepower to win.  And it only goes down hill from there.  Expect one to two hours for each campaign map.Skirmishes with AI'sThese often take just as long as the campaign maps, although tech rushing (spending all of your resources on obtaining max tech units and structures as quickly as possible) can end an AI opponent quickly.  It is impossible to beat the AI at spamming mass fabricators, so be prepared for a long slog if the battle isn't ended quickly.  The AI skirmishes also seem to be buggy and occasionally crash to desktop for me, so beware.MultiplayerAs other reviews have stated, look at Forged Alliances if you want an active online community.  I haven't tried it, but from what I have read online, expect cheese.This game may be worth buying on sale.  If you're really liking some of these ideas, I'd recommend Planetary Annihilation when it is on sale instead if you don't mind its lack of a story filled campaign.  It uses a large number of the same ideas in Supreme Commander, but is a better tuned experience overall.			"

												This game really had me disappointed since I was looking forward to playing it. Had good reviews but is a major time consumer. To get through a mission you need to create a bunch of units and a basic task just takes a whole lot of time... Between one and two hours per mission is just too much and the story just isn't worth it.			"

												This game's Story mode feels like it falls pretty short and feels pretty terrible. All you had to do was build some defense so their small attack forces couldn't touch your base. And then build a small force of artillery and a little bit of front line tanks and destroy their whole base from the distance while they did nothing about it. The good part about the story is that the missions were pretty long in length so each battle felt like there was more to it. The multi player seems to be LAN and then you can join people hosting if you had their IP? I'm not actually sure, but this is pretty bad unless you find some community who host regularly but I personnaly don't like fighting the same people over and over in an RTS.			"

												Supreme Commander is the spiritual successor of Total Annihilation. Which was one of the better Sci-fi RTS made. Supreme Commander tries to update it. But doesn't do a great job at it. The graphics are update, but are a bit soulless. It has the famous new camera zoom and you can use your second screen for the mini map. But the rest of the UI is bad and unintuitive.The campaign is rather boring. The world created in the story is uninteresting. The Multiplayer is where it gets interesting, but that is better in the Forged Alliance stand alone expansion. I would recommend to just get Forged Alliance for the multiplayer.			"

												Not very fun in my opinion. Units are very slow and it takes massive amount of units to defeat an enemy. And when I say massive, I mean MASSIVE! You also have very minimal actions, and when you click a group of your units to go to a specific area (after taking forever to get there) they spread ot in a huge circle instead of being very close to eachother to help defend. This makes it easy for the enemy to pick off your units one by one. I feel this game comes no where close to the Command & Conquer games. Mayeb the sequal is better and has fixed these issues plus more. But I dont see myself that curious to find out anytime soon.			"

												I used to play Total Annihilation back when a Pentium 2 was a fast, unaffordable machine. Despite claims to the contrary, SupCom is a 100% remake of TA. Really - it is the same game. No innovation whatsoever, unless you count the pointless super-zoom-out as innovative. The game is about extreme amounts of tiny units clashing on huge battlefields, as it always has been. But I find it rather surprising how badly this is done here. With so many units doing different jobs, it is completely impossible to micromanage all of them in a meaningful way. And yet, that is what the game expects you to do. No AI scripts you can employ (Warlords Battlecry and Dark Reign had those more than 15 years ago), no platoons or even the most basic combat formations (like Earth 2150 had back in the 90s). Without any kind of aid, managing your army is a tedious chore. Once you get into actual battle, it is an exercise in frustration. I fail to understand how seasoned developers could ♥♥♥♥ up so badly. But they did, and this game sucks.			"

												I played Supreme Commander 2 on the Xbox 360 and it was really fun but RTS games always tend to be better on PC. So I bought this game thinking it'd be even better than SC2 and its not the case. I told my army of units to go to an area on the map and they did but for some reason they all get in a long line that almost spans the entire map. Issuing orders to them after they all line up is useless they wont move or attack or do anything and if you cant move your units then its impossible to play the game. All that being said I do not recommend this game.			"

Sweet! now i can finally play this game (Which i feel like if its on steam it should be optimized to run without 30 minutes of troubleshooting) so i start up my first skirmish cuz why not jump right in there. uhoh another problem although windowed mode allows me to see my pointer i can no longer scroll around the map by moving the pointer to the edges of the screen arrow keys must be used! WTF i mean really this is so broken its pathetic but i try and suffer through and build a few buildings but alas in spite of all the work to get this far i am severly underwhelmed.... thank you steam for your glorious return policy.

Yes, you can navigate around the menu and figure it out, but while you do this your units are being destroyed on the main front. Another sever defect is when you attempt to select masses of units and instruct them to move. Some do, most do not.  The result is an overwhelming number of your units move in a slow column of a few units directly into the jaws if a numerically inferior enemy and are killed one by one.  Ugly, outdated graphics that are ugly by 2007 standards top off this poor attempt at a RTS.			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game. total Annihilation is one of my favourite games/RTS of all time. That game came out in 1998 and it seems to this day RTS games can't even come close. I was dissapointed by the units. It seemed very lacking. Maybe I'm used to TA, whic had hundreds of 3rd party custom units. I'm sure you can with this, but also the battles didn't seem satisfying. Maybe I'm missing something, I want a decent RTS, will try Ashes of Singularity but after that I give up.All in all I couldn't help but compare to TA which is a miles better game. I also recently played the Warhammer Dawn of War franchise, which couldn't hold a candle either. "

												This game just isn't my cup of tea. The graphics are decent and the game plays quick like a hardcore RTS should. But be prepared to have to read the manual (I know, right) before you dig into this one. The tutorial isn't all that. In fact, while I eventually figured out how most things worked, it wasn't exactly fun doing so. I also must be missing some feature that allows you to speed up the game to get through the mind-numbingly slog of time wasted on building ships. I swear I tried every button to speed up this feature or perhaps I'm missing something on how to upgrade my ships.. either way, it led to frustration since the game doesn't explain how to do this.

Big mega experimental units, long range artillery, shields, resource generation/storage buildings, beautifull cutscenes and fantastic online.Command and conquer (Dune2), thanks for creating the RTS genre with your simple approach and small scale warfare, but supcom is your daddy.

												Amazing RTS, that seems to have pulled me deeper than the starcraft series. Whenever I start a campaign mission so far, I seem to lose track of time for the time that it takes to (slowly) beat one.A decent chunk of this game is economy management, and you can see all the numbers. Exactly how much mass that factory is using per second, how much energy that unit is drawing, and so on.I'd reccomend this to those who like to play non-rush RTS; Rushing really doesn't work too well.

Each player can recruit/fabricate up to 1,000 units. And considering there are 4v4 maps, that can get really huge.The system requirements for this game are quite beefy though. You gotta have a powerhouse computer just to play it on the highest settings.Overall, 9/10. Get it when you can.			"

												One of my favourite RTS's by  one of my favourite people, enough said.Not really: Supreme Commander is to this day an RTS whose scale rivals even upcoming projects such as the MMORTS Novus Aeterno. It doesn't get much more full scale than this. Each player commanding a thousand units is a common occurrence, as is an entire map scarred by artillery and nuclear bombs. Destructive environments, submersible tank-factories, beautiful graphics even for 6 years old, and a very solid if simple campaign make this game one of the best possible $15 buys in the RTS world at this time, please do yourself the favour of getting it.

												This is my all-time favorite RTS game. I really dislike having to micro-manage units at the level that games like Starcraft II require you to (are my soldiers that stupid?), but in Supreme Commander, macro-management is king and overall strategy is more important, as well as economy management. Check out faforever.com to get a free multiplayer client that receives regular updates (support for the official multiplayer servers was discontinued).The depth and awseomeness of this game is off the charts. I can't even play RTS games without strategic zoom anymore. Definitely worth a buy!			"

												How to play Supreme Commander in proper way:1. Build as many bombers as you can afford2. Fly through the enemy territory3. Ignore about enemy's anti-air defense, that's why I told you to build much bombers!4. Drop the bombs to the desired target5. Enjoy the massacreProtip: Hear a music called Flight of the Valkyries by Wilhelm Richard Wagner to improve the immersion.10/10 would bombing run again			"

												Absolutely love this game.  I have played it for years prior to getting it on Steam.  Anyway, just here to let people know that if you're a die hard fan like me, you should get the BlackOps Mods.  You can always just turn them off in game if you don't like them, but I doubt that will be the case.  They are: BlackOpsACUs, BlackOpsEXUnits, BlackOpsNavalBalance, BlackOpsUnleashed.  - These Mods are extrmemely well done, to the extent of not even being able to tell where the original game ends, and these Mods begin.  Highlights include new units in every tech level which alter play strategies, and new experimentals which balance the races.  About half of the new experientals are superior to the orginal games experimentals.  My favorite addition though is what they did to the ACUs.  Through a massive restructure, you can upgrade commanders through each tech level up to experimental level.  Ever want your ACU to stand toe to toe with a colossus? Well, now you can. I would also recommend getting Sorian_AI_Mod_2.1.2. - This almost doubles the amount of AI to choose from when selecting which AI to fight against in skirmish or multiplayer missions, and at its peak, adds a level of difficulty far superior to the original game, guaranteed to challenge even the most veteran players.

												As far as the top-down building games go, this one is a classic and one of the best. Tropico, for example, is more of the sandbox variety whereas Supreme Commander has epic battles. It's easy to learn all of the options because the game keeps that simple. If you want upgraded units, you simply have to build the level 2 factories. Real simple but the trick is mastering your empire. It's great fun and should run on midrange computers. Higher end PCs could allow for more total units. The AI in this is excellent, playability excellent and for some (like me) it can be addictive! It's worth the money. Especially when it's on sale!			"

												Back when i got this game in a box from target, it introduced me to the gnere of RTS. With its big battles and complex strategy, i thought of this game as the standard of all RTS games. After trying other RTS games like Command and conquor and Empire Earth, i realised how exceptionaly amazing this game really is.Supreme Commander lets you make and take control of your own army while trying to destroy someone elses like all RTSs. But while most RTSs let you control a few units to make armies, this game lets you use hundreds of them, giving rise to situatons of ""how do i defend agaisnt their 500 bombers while not losing my factories?"" or ""Wheres the best place to attack with my 700 gunships and what to do with these nukes?"" and minutes later ""HOW DID THAT NOT WORK?"" (NOTE: do not try to use nukes in combination with gunships, gunships are not nuke-proof) The game has a resource system based on 2 resources that are required for everything. Every little bot you build for your armies of mass destruction will cost mass and energy to build, bot of which are easy to obtain and require little maintenance to keep up with your production unless your opponet destroys them. The game also has 4 tiers of units from the basic light tanks of tier 1 to the experimental lazer eyed and nozed colossal sized bots of tier 4 ( also called the experimental tier)I thought the game was better from the box than from steam as some of the units are borrowed from Forged Alliance here. (Forged Alliance is better than the original Supreme Commander and totaly worth the 5 extra dollers in the gold edition) Not that the units are bad, but the gameplay changes when one faction has suicidal bombers. The game also tends to crash a bit when you get 8000 unit battles going but i dont know any computers that can handle that many units and their animated shells and rounds too.If your getting this game for the campaign, just a warning, the plot isnt the best ive seen and the AI is a bit annoying reminding you to complete your objectives every few minutes. However, any game that lets you carpet nuke an uninhabited part of Hawaii is worth the annoying AI. (no offence Hawaii but the only missions on Earth featured part of Hawaii)			"

												Just re-bought this (lost my CD key for my old DVD copy), and yes, it is worth it. Hundreds of ways to play, and to me, this feels like a sci-fi version of WW1; defensive tactics, gaining ground by inches, and wave tactics with infantry and tanks. Air cover is only as good as the lack of air defenses allows, and offensives are bloody, attrition-style affairs. Resource management is very important, and who controls the best industrial base wins. Buy this, and play it. The epic scale of the battles alone will stupefy and amaze.			"

												Great way to deal with resources (one of the most tedious aspects of all strategy games), makes you focus on the real thing: STRATEGY. The unit/building limit is another way to stay focused on what's important and not. In addition to the variety and levels of units and structures, the game builds up and evolves very naturally, make you switch between tactics as you get new units, tech levels or scenario modifiers.The story flows in parallel for each faction, this means that the first faction you play will give you insight of the perspective of the scenario, making the next faction you play a little more predictible (as you now know where the enemy is, and from where it will come). Not a bad thing (if you like to take advantage of this) nor a good thing (if you wanted a linear story, one episode after the other).In a nutshell: you must think out of the box, it's a new and better kind of strategy!

												I can't belive i havn't written a recomendation for this game yet. Supreme Commander is one of if not the best RTS of all time. At it's heart it is a reimagining of Total Anihiliation, a very old RTS. The thing that makes SC so special is the scale of combat. Your not using 2 or 3 dozen units, you are using hundreds, the normal unit cap is 250, but can be increased to 1000. The maps range from 2 player close encounter maps, to giant maps that can easily fit 8 players no where near the other. This leads to a type of scale in the game that you just don't get in other RTS. 2 of the interesting things about SC is that resources generated are a steady stream, not ""collected"" or gven in ""chunks"" like most games, and your starting unit is a commander, a super powered unit that can easily take on any other unit (or even swarms of them) for quite some time. If you like RTS games buy this.			"

												Back when i got this game in a box from target, it introduced me to the gnere of RTS. With its big battles and complex strategy, i thought of this game as the standard of all RTS games. After trying other RTS games like Command and conquor and Empire Earth, i realised how exceptionaly amazing this game really is.Supreme Commander lets you make and take control of your own army while trying to destroy someone elses like all RTSs. But while most RTSs let you control a few units to make armies, this game lets you use hundreds of them, giving rise to situatons of ""how do i defend agaisnt their 500 bombers while not losing my factories?"" or ""Wheres the best place to attack with my 700 gunships and what to do with these nukes?"" and minutes later ""HOW DID THAT NOT WORK?"" (NOTE: do not try to use nukes in combination with gunships, gunships are not nuke-proof) The game has a resource system based on 2 resources that are required for everything. Every little bot you build for your armies of mass destruction will cost mass and energy to build, bot of which are easy to obtain and require little maintenance to keep up with your production unless your opponet destroys them. The game also has 4 tiers of units from the basic light tanks of tier 1 to the experimental lazer eyed and nozed colossal sized bots of tier 4 ( also called the experimental tier)I thought the game was better from the box than from steam as some of the units are borrowed from Forged Alliance here. (Forged Alliance is better than the original Supreme Commander and totaly worth the 5 extra dollers in the gold edition) Not that the units are bad, but the gameplay changes when one faction has suicidal bombers. The game also tends to crash a bit when you get 8000 unit battles going but i dont know any computers that can handle that many units and their animated shells and rounds too.If your getting this game for the campaign, just a warning, the plot isnt the best ive seen and the AI is a bit annoying reminding you to complete your objectives every few minutes. However, any game that lets you carpet nuke an uninhabited part of Hawaii is worth the annoying AI. (no offence Hawaii but the only missions on Earth featured part of Hawaii)			"

												When I started playing this game I wondered how well it would hold up.I was not dissapointed at all.The economy is simple but can also destroy you from the inside,Awesome battles (Went to 20000 units before my game crashed) And a improved stand alone DLC.Do not get the sequel to the game however for its quite dull compared to this one.

												This game is pretty damn good.  It has aged very well, and has a fricking _AMAZING_ community supporting it still.  There is an entire eco-system of mods and online play arangements called ""FA Forever"" supporting it.  Check it out!The single player campaigns are quite decent if you aren't into multiplayer.  In that case I'd recommend getting the FA add-on as well, as it adds a good deal of extra content.			"

												Probably one of the greatest RTS Games since Total Annihilation back in 1997, Supreme Commander takes RTS to a whole new level. The campain is refreshing too, since it can be played from 3 differing factions, giving a nod to the original Dune 2, and the Multiplayer options just add limitless replay value.10/10			"

												Gameplay- SUPREME COMMANDER is an amazing game which startles with its ease of execution of global conflict and easy to get into user interface while still offering a challenging thought provoking ai to go up against. At first i thought i was going to end up with a very chugging along slow grand scale war situation like the old gargantuan wargame from the early 1990s UMS (UNIVERSAL MILITARY SIMULATOR). Instead i found something that played with the massive variety of units of TOTAL ANNIHILATION and depth of such old time classics like BATTLE ISLE and THE PERFECT GENERAL done in real time with stunning movie like battle visuals. It was a eerie scary sight to see a huge enemy frigate when destroyed actually roll over on its side and sink like something out of a old time war reel. Plenty of time will be spent on building bases and units but you are free to acttack or do recon missions etc at any time. Building bases is alot of fun with plenty of upgrades which one has to invest heavy resources of mass and or energy to make possible. Graphics- Very immersive with plenty of visual detail when it comes to things like air units going into and dive and crashing with 3d depth not to mention the consequences as the explosion from the crash can damage any nearby structures and or units. Everything is done in layers of depth and mass so all that wreckage on the field will actually get in your way the cool thing is you can get it out of your way by salvaging as resources or in the case of one of your own buildings being wrecked you can rebuild the same building over the wrecked one taking half the time it normally would to build it. There are plenty of video popups of the other commanders friendly and enemy reminding you your not alone on the battlefield and you have objectives to complete. The enemy on the other hand is sending plenty of threats and taunts your way which enrich the war mood of battles. Sound- Excellent use of sfx making everything seem like you on another world in some futuristic time with sci-fi weapons designed to deliever devastation to your enemies and your own units if your too close when they explode in a raging fire storm of nuclear death. Sum Total- A must buy sci-fi wargame which really delievers. If you have not played it yet now is the time with the beefy computer systems of today and the past year that can easily handle its beefy overhead. Thank you Chris Taylor and company for the fantastic satisfying work :D "

												A strategy game, that used giant units, and 2 types of resoucers, mass and energy..graphics 7/10the game is pretty old, but the graphics are perfect if you dont zoom in too much, in wich case the textures show some pixels.gameplay 4/10 (for sp)i.. i tried playing the single player of this.. its ♥♥♥♥ing boring.the game is slow, the events happening in the game are slow, the unit ""unlocks"" are way too slow. I played only the first two missions of the UEF campaing because of this, so i guess i cant really say the other campaings are the same.The missions in said campaing are the usual very boring ones: protect X, destroy commander YAnd that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.music (7/10) and soundFX (2/10)The music is orchestral and classical, and nothing can go wrong with that, ever.Its quite catchy actually.the voice fx is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, the voice acting is almost as bad as just cause 2.OVERALL VOTE: 6/10 BUY ONLY IF ITS VERY CHEAP, AND IF YOU REALLY LIKE STRATEGY GAMES.

												If you've played Total Annihilation, you'll know the basics of how this game works already. And yet, this spiritual successor improves upon its unique RTS formula in almost every way possible. The price was worth it just for the single player campaigns, and I haven't even touched multiplayer yet.There's a simple hierarchy of 4 tiers and gives you so many options in combat. Unlimited resources (in a manner of speaking) lets you do more than other RTS games would. Even though Starcraft 1 and 2 are my favourite RTS games ever, this game is very refreshing in comparison with the freedom you have. You can turtle effectively with an impenetrable base and use long range nuclear missiles or artillery battery to destroy your opponent. You can send a swarm of 200 gunships to take them out. Or use an army of Tier 3 siege bots and AA bots. And you can use aircraft, land units and naval units. Then there's the unique, experimental units which take a lot of effort to build but are very fun to watch wrecking things. And let's not forget the ability to zoom out or in to almost any degree you feel like.The main campaigns are good and fun, even though the pacing could be a little better. I'd like to use the tier 3 siege bots, battleships and gunships a bit earlier. And you don't get to use the experimental units until halfway through the last mission- which is a little disappointing.There are only a few things I would say are bad about the game. Compared to Starcraft, it feels a lot slower. You need air transport to get your engineers anywhere other than your main base in an acceptable time fashion. Queing orders when selecting multiple units sometimes results in them repeating builds that have already been done, wasting precious time. The campaign also has an annoying unit limit that applies to buildings as well, and there's no quick way to delete units if need be. A simple ""delete"" command would have been nice. Commanding armies has advanced controls but the units themselves still bump into each other and not attack as a clumped group (like Starcraft 2 handles very well). Projectiles operate in an immersive way, with bullets or missiles homing or not depending on the unit, but some units are nearly impossible to kill efficiently without transporting engineers and building defenses (tier 3 air superiority, ugh).The graphics are very impressive considering how old the game is, and I still like zooming in to inspect all the high tech lights and power networks I construct.My life for the Aeon Illuminate!

												Supreme CommanderI have to say that Supreme Commander is a very fun RTS game, which is probably the first one to ever have a unit cap of more than 200, heck, it goes up to a 1,000!In Supreme Commander, your a commander of robotic armies of mass destruction, trying to conquer the galaxy for ultimate supremacy.In campaign, 3 factions fight for ultimate supremacy for the galaxy, like I just said. The war has gone on for I believe over 1,000 years, making the World Wars look like small skirmishes.Supreme Commander has a wide variety of units, and is more complicated than its sequal, Supreme Commander 2.Although the down part is that the matches can be SUPER HUGE and possibly super long, and with the addition of possibly 200-1000 units for each player, the game can get Pretty Sl-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ow-w-w-w...Despite that, the game is great and fun.Do I recommend this game?1. If you are going to get this game alone, I recommend getting it on-sale. It's usually 80% off. (3 bucks)2. If you get the game AND the expansion, go for it. But I also recommend getting on-sale. It's usually 5 bucks for both.3. If you get the expansion, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, let me repeat...HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting Forged Alliance Forever (FAF).*NOTE: FAF is not compatible with the vanilla game, Supreme Commander, only Forged Alliance*FAF is a community made for Forged Alliance so you can play matches with others online.TL;DR I recommend this game if your an RTS fan, but get it on-sale, it's more worth it.But I HIGHLY Recommend you get this and the expansion for the story mode and get FAF for multiplayer.

												This game is one of the best RTS in the history or Games. It has probably everything you want: Tanks, Robots, Airplanes, Jets, Spaceships and even Nuclear Bombs! The campaign is awesome, giving me loads of fun. If you don't wanna play campaign, you can play skirmish with friends via LAN (You need Tunngle to make it work properly). The skirmish with friends is LOADS of fun and even if I have 3 hours in the game, I will still play it in the future.The gameplay mechanics are realistic, making you feel strong when attacking an enemy's base. Graphics aren't the best but you don't need ""aesthetics"" to play an amazing game.If I had to choose between Planetary Annihilation and Supreme Commander I'd Choose Supreme Commander since Planetary Annihilation recently released an expansion pack PA: TITANS (38$ on Steam).Get this game and play it while you can, Lieutenant! :D			"

												Steam ""lies"" on the number of hours I've played this game.Add, I dunno, a guess of 100 to whatever Steam says...Bought this on DVD years ago and fancied digging it out my cupboard to play again, then realized that I could register the DVD's cdkey with steam and add to my Steam lib.This game, along with it's expansion Forged alliance, make up my favourite RTS game to date (April 2012)I highly recommend this game.The game takes advantage of multiple cores and during my first playthrough of this, I only had a single core machine, now a quad core, it's silky smooth.Excellent resource management, great units covering land, air and sea. Big mega experimental units, long range artillery, shields, resource generation/storage buildings, beautifull cutscenes and fantastic online.Command and conquer (Dune2), thanks for creating the RTS genre with your simple approach and small scale warfare, but supcom is your daddy.

												The original most epic Sci-Fi RTS ever built.  The voice acting and the story missions are a little week but the platform is solid and the sides are well balanced.  A must play for anyone who's enjoyed RTS games.  The resource system of streaming resources and the need to maintain the incoming resource levels are a very cool way to build your army compared to the hoard approach of other popular RTS games.  The number and variety of units you can construct is impressive.			"

												Looks great and plays great, but is a little bit too complicated. You have to build something all the time and there is really no time to think different strategies. Just build and build. Maps are huge and that's a problem because you have to jump a long ways between your builder unit and battlefield. I think this is great for hardcore RTS gamers but casual like me should try it before buyig.			"

												If you love complex strategy games and large scale combined arms battles this game is for you.I highly recomend it and even now visuals looks sharp and clean (which was main drive behind desing I guess) and it still looks awesome when you send hundreds of bombers accompanied by nuke and carrier subs while your main attack comes from cloaked base in enemy radar blind spot :)Strategies are endless (almost, for even more fun take Forged Alliance stand alone datadisc)			"

												First of all let me say that I love Real-Time Strategy games and consider myself kinda an authority on them.  If you like futuristic RTS, then you’ll love all 3 of these games, I've beat the campaign on all of them at least twice :)(I even love the Total Annihilation games that these are based off of)I used to play SC & SC:fa all the time, then bought them all again when it was on sale here on Steam.  They are simple to learn, yet difficult to master.  The number of units can be intimidating; I’d recommend doing a little homework to find your favorite FACTION and UNITS that will fit your play-style.  I used the website: http://supcom.wikia.com/wiki/Complete_unit_list "

												One of my favourite games of all time finally comes to STEAM. About time! I'm not really good at it, but thoroughly enjoy every game. GAMEPLAY: This is single player / LAN / WAN strategy warfare gaming goodness. Collect, build, defend, attack... water, ground, air. Standard stuff, but it does it so well. BEST FEATURES: The zoom in and zoom out anywhere on the map is a great plus. So too, the multi-screen feature where having multiple computer monitors allows for more detail on one screen and a bigger perspective on the other. HARDWARE: This game loves a powerful multi-core CPU that multi-tasks really well. Your graphics card is a secondary concern.			"

												I have been playing the Total Annihilation series since I was young. Though it doesn't have the bells and whistles of todays RTS's, Supreme Commander has taken a long forgetten classic and gave it a breath of fresh air for those who need something pretty to stare at to enjoy. I am sure the community is on it's last legs if not gone, but highly recommened firing this gem up for friends looking for an RTS game that doesn't require you to study it like it is your next proffession.

												If you were a fan of the classic robot armada strategy Total Annihilation you will be right at home with Supreme Commander.With land, Air and Sea battles, constant attacks, limited resources and vast battle grounds there is plenty of warfare to be had. At times the pace feels slow, particularly when setting up your initial base on a large map, however, when you find yourself being hammered by endless hordes of your opponents forces, almost in a panic trying to grind out a force good enough to repel the attacks, all the while desperately defending your resource production line, you will at times miss the slower pace of the base building phase.The story is somewhat shallow and is really just a hook to guide you from world to world, ultimately leading to that all important end-game battle, but you didn’t come here for the story, did you? Multiplayer is the most fun aspect of this game. It is even more enjoyable when you play locally and can hear your opponent scream and curse you when you expertly execute a fast air attack, taking out metal production and temporary shutting down his unit production. The matches can be long arduous events and occasionally the victor might be determined by someone giving in, rather than a skilful victory, but still there is much fun to be had, just choose the map according to the intended game time.With all that said Supreme commander is a lot of fun and well worth your invested time and energy.

												BTW: hundreds of hours on pre-steam.So, you're looking for an RTS to play, and this one has popped up in the list.You've played a fair few RTS games, and certainly most of the mainstream ones.This one claims to be different, better give it a look.Now, there are reviews that have gone into far more detail than I'm going to offer you, but what I will say is very important.There are a few games where economies are progressive for units - that is, the resources you have amassed drain away as the unit builds. Now, you'd think this method would be used more wouldn't you? Well, it's hard to balance properly - you've got 3 unit factories building units, and then you run out, so all of them stall, wasting more time than if you had built one at a time right.What Supreme Commander does is sort out those balance issues, and expand on the progressive economy aspect.Units, buildings, upgrades, super weapon use... all of these things are linked into the economy almost 100%, with time being the only real drain on that percentage (super weapons take a proportionate amount of time to build etc).Building thirty different buildings including factories, defences and superweapons as well as running 12 different factories and existing artillery/superweapons and out of resources? Simple! Pause production on a few of the factories and some of the superweapons production.Not enough? Stop the artillery from firing, maybe even turn off some shield generators or resource converters.Sounds simple, but it's on such a large scale that it feels like running a proper future war economy.Now, maybe you've decided that you REALLY need to get some of those buildings built. Ok then, convert dead units into resources. Not enough? Convert functional units into resources, or maybe one of the buildings you don't really need?Haven't got the time to convert things into resources? Ok then, build your buildings over the destroyed remains of the same kind, that'll cut the time and resource cost by up to half!Or hell, you could go full city planning mode and arrange your resource-consuming buildings next to your resource-producing buildings.Why do that? ""Does the electricity not have to go as far, so therefore it's more efficient?"" you might smirk and say, but yes actually.Building like this puts in place what are basically powerlines between the buildings. This synergistic effect is incredibly noticeable almost immediately - a building produces 20 of a resource, or produces 20 of a resource and reduces the cost of the same in another building by 1%, and you can fit 20 along the sides of the building?This actually adds another element of risk though, big resource producers take a lot of synergised buildings with them, and those that survive take pretty hefty damage, which is what you'd expect - energy substation just got blown up, it's going to take some appliances down with it.And on top of all of the above, on top of all the super weapons you'd expect in an RTS, there is the commander unit.A core engineer unit isn't anything new to RTS games, but have the same potential for hilarity.Ever rushed an enemy with SCVs in StarCraft just to mess with their heads?What about rushing them with a veritable super weapon that unleashes a thermonuclear explosion when it dies?Not even Michael Baysplosion could hope to top that.

												This is the best non fortress type game where you can take your time, build up massive forces, and conduct large organized attacks. Where as Forged Alliance might be better for those who like the faster games (maybe?). If you have A.D.D., and/or like more fantasy mage like laser shows and nuke grenade launchers mounted on tigers with lots of icing, then you might pass on this one.However if you're like me and savour a prolonged process of building a base and army and using it to make deliberate attacks all while defending against manageable attacks, then this is the best for that, that i know of, to this day. I also felt the graphics are very good, and the units (i only played lately and remember the 'humans') are cool and realistic looking with scale being dramatic and impressive. Having played the first C&C when it came out to Starcraft 2 and everything in between, this is my personal favorite RTS for the reasons i described above and a bit more. There are better im sure, with more fancy options and glitter, but when it comes to about as long as you want drawn out defending and attacking on a massive scale, it's the best out there.			"
