												Achron is a very interesting concept for a strategy game. If you like seeing entirely new mechanics for games, Achron is definitely something to pick up. However, obvious pitfalls make this game incredibly...tiresome.The Good:The time mechanics in the game are interesting, and mostly intuitive. Travelling throughout a 7 minute time period (5-6 minutes behind, 1-2 minutes ahead), you can see things that have happened, and can actually change the events that have happened. If you have problems with understanding, ""What happened with that group?"" you can just rewind to see why that occurred. The interface is also intuitive enough so you can understand when some things happen. Movement, orders, and normal actions doesn't deviate from the norm in top-down strategy games, so a player that plays other top-down strategy (Supreme Commander, Command & Conquer, etc.) will not see any kind of problems getting into this game.The Bad:The interface needs some serious tweaks to understand your actions, and what your actions in the timeline are affecting. Its also extremely hard to tell when your changes are getting propagated to the present when it has nothing to do with unit on unit combat. If you (or another time traveller) jumps back to the past, makes a change, and you (in the future), could see a change that doesn't exactly make sense (such as a building or unit not getting built). While you do have the ability to jump into the past and see the changes why, the user interface incredibly lacks when, why and how things are getting modified. Pathing in this game is also a joke. Most games, you can just right-click the location and they will path around obstacles. However, in Achron, if you right click on the right side of the map, and in the center is a one-entrance gully, which they have to go to the North or South to avoid, they will enter the gully, and get stuck on the eastern edge of the gully and stop, without trying to repath. Also, groups have hard times keeping together, since formations do not exist. Friendly ""nudging"" to get out of the way of a building being built, or a tank trying to get through a line of friendly soldiers, does not exist. Even with this garbage pathing, one unit can only have five orders active at one time.The unit creation queues are also a joke. You can manage it once its in the queue effectively, and the queue is hard to understand, with health bars on the queue for some odd reason. Its hard to tell if something is made for a purpose or not, and the creation of buildings with the wrong unit mentions ""at a higher cost,"" but fails to tell you how much it costs. Also, if you place down one building, that area is not ""reserved"" for other friendly units to not build buildings on that spot, so you'll run into the issue that you might build where a building is going to go.The fact that you can't stop Major characters from moving to repair/help build unless they are leagues away annoys me considerably. I can't count the times in which the main characters (that aren't supposed to die) broke formation to heal a front-line unit, and ended up getting killed, requiring me to go back in time to tell them run away.Teleporters are also really terrible. Rather than teleporting units as close as possible to the specified point, they are teleported anywhere within a 20 block radius from the chosen point, creating problems that units end up on top of impassible terrain, or in the middle of canyons, unable to get out, even with a nearby teleporter.The game also takes control too early for major objectives, using the simulated ""future time"" (1-2 minutes in the future) to determine when an objective is finished. Because of this, it causes major characters to die because the computer takes control of the characters and moves them out of formation, requiring you to go back in time to rectify it after the unskippable cutscene ends. Also, unskippable cutscenes (which doesn't pause the game while doing it) in game.The Ugly:Its evident that they worked on the time-manipulation system for 90% of the time. Maps are built incorrectly; they have impassible 85 degree inclines with textures that resemble a rock formation rather than walls that are textured properly. The large walls, which are blended together with the floor patterns, make the inside of ships and buildings look like outside with just really steep walls.Voice acting and story, I would say that its really dumb. Okay, that's being generous, the storyline is probably one of the weakest things in the game. Game introduces Tyr, an AI, but people talk to it like a person when it comes out, makes it confusing when Tyr is introduced as an AI later on. When you encounter another AI later on, everyone treats that same type of AI as the enemy, despite Tyr being that same type of AI. Events in the game occur in reasonable order, instead things happen that suit what the storyline needs at that point in time. Even when a chapter switches, which makes you go to another race and control it (ala Starcraft), is disjointed, problematic, anti-climactic and dumb. Character moods are inconsistent, and flat. Voice acting is lifeless, and I find myself skipping cutscenes just so I don't have to listen to characters that I don't care about drone on and on, making me more sleepy than when Ben Stein is talking.Overall:Achron is a great and new game element into a game that would be great as a concept game, but fails to excite with lackluster AI, UI, Storyline and Voice Acting. 3/10.

												Used to I thought it couldn't get any better than Star Craft in terms of RTS and certainly C&C made Time Travel look sluggish by comparison - This RTS game has Real-Time Multi-timeline travel. With Archon you can literally see the future or the past of the battlefield in real time and you can actually effect that battlefield in the past or future. Further just because you've been defeated doesn't mean the game is over - if you can travel back in time and alter it you can literally ""undo"" your defeat. There is a limit to the amount of time you can travel and the number of orders you can give, but overall the battlefields of RTS have never seen this scale of Time Travel. You don't even need a TTC. Lemme go over the Pros and Cons real fast:Pros:+Time Travel on the battlefield like nothing you've ever seen in RTS.+Easy to pickup, Hard to master - You'll be on the first few levels of the campaign for hours, but you can play ""skirismishes"" or ""multiplayer"" in a cinche, most of the campaign's difficulty is in how to overcome the handicaps in the first couple of missions.+Pause/Slow/Fast Forward The Current Time-line while you issue orders - but don't mistake this for turn-based because the time you can ""pause"" is limited (excludes full system pause, which cannot give orders) and the time-line continues on in the present.+ Send your units backwards OR forwards in time using a ""Chronoporter"". BYOR (Bring your own Reinforcements)Cons:- The Campaign is a poor place to start in this game Your better off playing a few rounds against AIs in Mock-multiplayer rather than trying to start cold-turkey into the main story.- The ""level editor"" is like trying to learn ""blender"" backwards (ie the 3d Studio Program)- The Game isn't really upto modern Graphics Standards, but for RTS fans the graphics aren't as important as the gameplay.- I can't really speak for the multi-player experience as I'm not much of a multiplayer kinda person but, if the AI is anything to judge by the time-line can get really warped with Humans going at it.- There are a few bugs, mostly annoying - less critical more like ""I wish that mission objective would stop replaying it's sound/text every 1/2 second"" but I've only encountered that one on the second campaign mission.

												How to describe Achron?It is is a pseudo-religious experience where you play the part of Kronos, the ancient greek titan with control of time. In this game you try to do things that mere mortals cannot comprehend while affecting the past, present and future without knowing what exactly you are doing. Such an experience is a marvel and a privelige to play, leaving me in a near comotose state of realisation and wonder.I would highly recommend adderall and migraleve to be left next to your computer while you undergo the life affecting powers of this game.11/10, actually posted this 2 years ago aiming for it to be posted now.

												Time travel RTS. Do I need to say more?The RTS part is not the strongest. Frankly: without the time travel, it would be a rather lame game, I suppose. Lots of units without a real point. basic list of buildings and very basic economy. The engine is Warzone, so raaather old. But the time travel is real time travel! You can change events, which already happened, send units back and forth in time and your opponent will do so, too! The time travel is so well thought through, that there won't be any 'paradoxon' and even though you have the power to time travel, there will be an end to any conflict. But prepare for headaches!

												Cool concept attached to a terrible sub-par RTS. Do not recommend, even if the concept allures you. It did me too, but it wasn't enough to save the game. The pathfinding is gross, the unit animations are practically nonexistent and the units feel no different from each other.			"

												Are you looking for a strategy game which involves intense tactical action across time? If you are, then you can keep looking, because this isn't it.Interestingly enough, the main issue with Achron is the time travel mechanics themselves. In theory it sounds about right: Use future knowledge to plan your strategy, or fix past mistakes. It worked well enough for Prince of Persia. Where could it possibly go wrong?Time waves. That's where it first starts going horribly wrong. In theory, you should be able to jump to the past, make a few fixes, and then jump back to the present and see the results, right? Wrong. You have to wait for the ""time wave"" to hit, and erase the incorrect present. And how long would that take? Well, as long as you've jumped back. The time waves only move at double speed compared to normal playing. During that time, you have to play in the past, at double speed, or at least re-watch it.You can't keep playing in the present, because as soon as the time-wave hits, many of your orders will actually be wrong for the situation, if they remain valid at all. And that's assuming that the units to whichyou need to give orders even exist in the present. You can't just wait, either, because the present doesn't stop, and by the time the time wave reaches that ""future event"" to which you were reacting, it is already, itself, far in the past. So, even if you only make one change, and let everything else play out without interaction, you still have to play in the past just to continue from the same spot that was previously the present. It probably wouldn't be so bad if time waves moved at 5 or 10 times the speed of normal play.Most of the time, it's best to just play in the present, or even a bit in the future. If you need to ""undo past mistakes"", save games work much better than time travel. Of course, this all goes flying out the window once you have an achronal enemy. The AI seems to thrive on playing in the past. And every time the enemy makes a change, you have to go back and re-watch the whole thing, because it's enough that one of your units moved 3 inches left for most of your future commands to not work. And there's nothing more annoying than taking out the last of your enemy units, only for a time-wave to hit and suddenly your whole army is gone and you don't know why. Be prepared to watch the timeline UI VERY closely, because it's not too obvious when major changes occur. And, of course, if you notice it only when it hits the present, then it is far too late to go back and fix things, since, as said before, time waves are VERY slow.Once you get past the idea of having to replay or at least review the same section of time over and over, you're hit with chrono-energy. In a time when most RTS players pride themselves on their click-rate, you get a game that actually tells you that the number of clicks you have is limited, and horribly so. Forget micro-managed tactics, it'd be too easy for the enemy to screw them all up by changing one tiny thing, and it would cost too much chrono-energy to undo and redo them when that happens.It probably wouldn't be so bad if you were just limited to not making too many CHANGES to the past. But, as noted above, you are often forced to play completely in the past, unable to jump back to the present, so you're actually being limited on the number of actual practical things you can do throughout play.But the worst part isn't in how little control you're allowed, but rather how the game tries to compensate for it. It seems like decades of RTS evolution were thrown down the drain, and instead you get a control scheme that is worse than what Dune 2 had. Since group commands cost as much chrono-energy as individual commands, you're supposed to organize units into ""hierarchies"", where giving orders to ""the leader"" gives that order to the rest of the group. As tedious as it is to arrange these heirarchies, it becomes even worse to control them. Beside having to keep track of ""whose the leader"", be sure that a command asking them all to move to one place will send them all scattering in all directions.And yeah, by the way, if going up against an achronal enemy, you can be sure your leader will be targetted back in time, rendering all of your commands invalid. Sure would have been easier to spot major time waves if the ""advanced timeline UI"" had an indicator for ""given a command to a dead unit"".The units also have individual AIs so that you won't have to give them commands to do every little thing. Too bad the AI is horrible, forcing you to waste tons of chrono-energy trying to tell your units NOT to move. Too bad there's no ""stop"" command. There's an ""idle"" command, which basically means ""stop doing what I say, and go commit suicide instead"". I'm not asking for Supreme Commander level of unit AI and control here, I'd just settle for my units following orders.And all that is AFTER you've the ""undo"" command - the command you are going to be using the most, as you repeatedly replay the same section of events.Once you take away the utterly broken time mechanics, what you're left with is a rather poorly balanced strategy game, with really poor controls. There are a few units which are clearly more powerful than anything else, and they aren't significantly more expensive to create. In fact, some of them are actually cheaper than other units. A group of 5 octoligos or twin MARs can take out most anything. Except for an army of MCBs or black birds. Units with self-repair tend to have the most broken balance, as they are neigh-invincible, so long as you can convince them not to move too far from each other (See: Horrible controls). I guess that's the reason only the humans have them. I spent most of chapter 3 just making sure the one MCB I had was free to join the fight, since it was usually a game-breaker. Oddly enough, I got an achievement for it, even though it was the most obvious thing to do.If you're thinking of creating mixed armies of aerial and ground units with anti-air and anti-ground, you can forget it. It would require too much micro-management to use these properly, and that, as noted before, gets screwed over fast, thanks to the time mechanics. You'd think the per-unit AI, given that it's probably intended to reduce the need for micro-management, would do something useful, like targetting aerial units with anti-air and ground units with anti-ground, but it seems to more often do the exact opposite. Fact is, it's better to just have a large enough all-purpose army, which can simply be told to go from point A to point B and destroy everything in its path. That tactic works WAY better than it should. Probably because, no matter how many times the enemy replays the battle with the overly large army, there is nothing it can do to prevent the resulting annihilation.The main counter-measure the game offers to the ""large enough army of all the same unit"" is limited resources. And most maps sure do limit resources. Of course, there's nothing like using every last resource to build a huge army, destroying all of the enemy's units, and then getting a surprise mission to ""build this and that"" with resources you no longer have.So, having covered how bad the game is all on its own, let's get started on the bugs. And this game sure is rife with them.Let's start with the simplest one: Windowed mode does not work. I mean, it works, but the graphics are scaled based on the total window size, including the title. This makes the top of the screen be cut off. Too bad that's exactly where your resources are shown. The thing is, this should have been the first thing that should have shown up on even the simplest QA. It's like no one even tested if the game manages to go to windowed mode.There's more I'd like to say, but it seems I'm out of room in this review (Why is this limited?). Suffice to say, there are worse bugs, but not enough space left. You have been warned.			"

												This game shows a highly innovative, I'd even say genius mechanic of time travel in a real-time strategy - something no one has done before or since (up to 2015). In short, you can give orders to units in the past and in the future, and there are ""update waves"" which travel at about 3x faster than normal time. Also you can teleport units across the battlefield with teleporters and into the past/future with chronoporters. So, basically, you can do tricks by sending units into the past to help their older doubles and so on - use your imagination. This sounds like an amazing game decades ahead of its time, but sadly its poorly designed tutorial and heavily scripted missions will turn off most players and make them drop the game in frustration. I heard good things about multiplayer but you won't find anyone thru the lobby, only thru forums of this game's fans, which are in short supply.I could endure only the demo and 3 missions, even restarted the game and played them once again to understand the mechanics better. And though I did understand how this game works with some effort, I doubt many gamers even would.Too many units are introduced too fast. The tutorial popups ask you to do stuff but don't let you do it before you press OK which actually hides the instructions about what you need to do. The scripted events take control off from you unexpectedly, place new units and give orders to other units, creating even more confusion than the already complex time-traveling system. While the control is taken away from you, characters are talking and the battle goes on. This feels like a nuthouse. Sometimes you aren't even sure if what has just happened is a bug, a scripted event or a game mechanic in action.I found the story trashy, though if you have nostalgic feelings for Star Wars (I don't), you may find it ok, as even the main character has the name ""Luke"". The 2D art is amateurish and, together with this Star Wars-like setting gives this game a ""trashy"" feel, like it was a school project done by teenagers - while the ingenuous combat system of this game deserved so much more. The 3D units are hard to tell from each other. The ground is covered with big uniform textures taken from some free online libraries, with strange lighting and huge, almost unit-sized bumps and long black shades in which smaller units get lost. The huge low-polygonal terrain objects look ugly next to tiny, much more detailed units. The air units hover so high above that you can't see where exactly they are located in relation to ground units (and their shades are shifted) - and where you need to bring your anti-air units so that they could fire at those air units. The controls are clumsy, the GUI is poor, with too few tips. The music is pretty good though.The game introduces an interesting mechanic of grouping units with hierarchies of command - which also allows you to save on orders while giving orders in the past or the future (the number of orders you can give is limited by ""chronoenergy""). But hierarichies don't work well, as units following a leader don't have a fixed formation, tend to spread and walk in ever expanding crowds which leads to edge units getting killed with no one helping them because the rest of the formation is out of range and won't come to assist other units in the formation.Save files get corrupted and don't load, so if you fail (e.g. in the very first mission 8+ marines must survive in a fight which comes unexpectedly) you may have to restart the whole mission. Missions are long and heavily scripted, sometimes the instructions are given while you are busy fighting and fail to concentrate. Voice acting is amateurish and lifeless, as if the actors were bored/annoyed with the story as much as I did. When you click on the timeline (an innovative tool to show the battlefield's states up to 5 mins ago and after), it takes the game 1-2 seconds to load the state of the battlefield at that time point which makes the whole thing feel clumsy, especially when you are already stressed by struggling with this complex game and its heavily script-influenced mission objectives.Btw I bought the game some time in 2014 and it had all graphics glitched on my laptop  (AMD Radeon HD 7670M video card), but it finally ran on my new desktop computer which has GeForce GTX 970. I think the devs need to try a Kickstarter campaign to get funding for Achron 2 and make a proper game on the same concept this time.			"

												This is the kind of game that will either be a big hit or a big miss, depending on your taste. Almost everything you do in normal rts games to win, may not grant you a win in this game. You absolutely must pay attention, keep in mind every move you can do at every point in time. Your not just playing the now, your playing the past as well, and a little of the future. One move most people don't know how to counter is when your enemy sends their entire army to the past to mess you up, the best way to counter this, is to stop your opponent from having that building. This requires heavy 4th dimensional thinking and is not for the faint of heart.			"

												Don't be fooled. This game might look interesting with its time travel mechanic, but that's precisely where the interest ends. It might be interesting if an actual good RTS used these mechanics, but instead we have this. It's as if the developpers spent all of their time working on the time travel mechanic and simply ran out of time to make the rest of the game up to par.However, if you are interested in video game design, then I would in fact recommend this game as a learning experience. Pick it apart, see where it fails, come up with a better system to utilize the time travel mechanic, possibly.			"

This game is great.... so much so, that the featured a quote from my review on the store page.That review can be found at the link or below. http://www.gamersdailynews.com/article-3013-Achron-Review-PC.html(note... logged 30+ hours oustide of steam)First, there was 2D. Then 3D. We even have 2.5D (3D models in a 2D world). Could it get any better? Achron thinks so, and they have added a new dimension to gaming. The 4th Dimension.... Time.Achron - Adding the fourth dimension to real-time strategiesThat’s right, Achron is the first game that allows you play in the past, present, and future.... simultaneously. Self-described as a ""meta-time strategy"", Achron is essentially a mix of a Real Time Strategy game and a Stephen Hawking book. Now I know that sounds complicated, but surprisingly you pick up on the gameplay and strategy rather quickly.Achron: Time Travel Let’s be honest. Nothing I say about this game will be understood, until you first understand the time travel mechanics in the game. Like most RTS games you have the same basic controls. Unlike other RTSs, the bottom of your screen is filled with a time line and an energy meter. The time line allows you to see when a skirmish is taking place. Any changes that you make to the time line in the past require Chrono-energy. The bigger the change, the more energy required. This keeps things balanced by keeping people from exercising God-like power, and encourages good strategizing in the present.When changes are made in the past, a time ripple will pass by and you will see the battle shift on the timeline before your eyes. But be careful that you don’t move units into an occupied location in the past. The result is what the developer calls ""chronofragging"", where only the strong units survive (though with substantial damage)Achron Single Player The single player campaign tells the story of the human race. As they explore space, they are faced with an enemy that seems to be unstoppable. That is, until scientists stumble on technology that allows you to not only teleport units spatially, but also chronoport them through time. Equipped with this newfound technology, it is your job as an Achron (someone who can see the whole timeline and make changes to the past) to lead your Marines to victory against an enemy who seeks to destroy you.When I started playing the SP campaign, I have to admit, gameplay felt incredibly slow. I am primarily an FPS gamer and the reduction in pace tested my patience. That said, I fully understand the reasoning for the initially slow gameplay. Hazardous Software is introducing an entirely new concept to games, and this slow introduction was necessary to prevent a steep learning curve.All in all, the SP campaign was solid. At times, I had the feeling that I couldn’t lose because of my time manipulation abilities, but the developers compensated for this by making your allies self-centered and self-preserving.I would venture to say that it is necessary for everyone who tries this game to play an hour or so in the SP campaign to familiarize yourself with time manipulation and tactics.Achron requires careful thought and time line trackingAchron Multiplayer Starcraft, move over. You finally have some competition in the RTS genre. After familiarizing myself with the 4th dimension, it was time to play some multiplayer. Everyone knows that multiplayer is what makes or breaks an RTS game, and Hazardous Software has delivered a winner.Starting out on a multiplayer map, the only learning curve that you start with is learning the new names of some traditional units you have in all RTS games (like the resource collecting unit, building to research new technologies, etc). Within 45 minutes, I had it nailed down.When I felt like I had enough of an army built up, I proceeded to attack my opponents. Boy was I wrong. My enemy had massive forces built up and proceeded to destroy me. In most RTS games, the match would have been over quickly. But don’t forget, time is on our side. Before it was too late, I chronoported my forces back in time, and stopped them from attacking an enemy that was too powerful. Laughter ensued as I heard my friend on team speak shout ""What the? Your guys are disappearing!?!""The only logical response was for my opponent to go back in time as well. Which I responded to by moved into the future. The rest of the match was cat and mouse until squad by squad, my death became unavoidable.Hanging on to my last 10 units, I ran for my life, back and forth through time. Upon going back in time, I noticed that I had about double the units. Excited, but seeing my inevitable demise, I pushed for one final assault. As I began to attack, I noticed different characters disappearing suddenly. Then it all became clear to me!!!! The units that I thought were extra were actually the same ones that I already had! They were disappearing because I moved them into the past. I had become a victim of a TIME PARADOX!Achron Final Thoughts Achron is a game that will keep you begging for more. This is sure to become a LAN favorite across the globe. Plenty of thought, plenty of laughs, plenty of head scratching as players disappear and reappear before your eyes.This game is a must buy for any fan of the RTS genre, anyone intrigued by time travel, and everyone with a keyboard.GDN Silver award "

												You use real, actual time paradoxes as weapons, and use time itself as a 4-dimensional battlefield.  It's one of the most innovative games I've ever seen, a new genre in a sea of Carls on Duty.  Too bad it's a clunky, poorly optimized, mediocre game.			"

												Buggy from time to time, but that one mechanic brings this game more strategy than Starcraft! By this I mean you can send your entire army into an unwinnable battle just to see what is in he enemy base, then go back in time and cancel the attack. That, by the way, is called Echo Scouting and is one of the most basic achronal strategies in the game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game's concept is great, but the game just isn't finished.The graphics are extremely unoptimized since it uses a custom 3D/game engine.Moreover, the tutorial goes way too quickly: rather than introducing the elements of the game one by one, it just throws everything it's got at you right away. The game does nothing to explain how to make effective use of time manipulation mechanics (e.g. why you should never stay constantly 1:30 from present), where buttons are, what they even do, an introduction to the game's story, etc.Supposedly, the campaign broke in a patch, so hardly any singleplayer except if you want to play against bots.That said, this game isn't really worth buying/playing if you never understood it in the first place.

												I haven't played this game since it was back in pre-super-mega-ultra-alpha for only the coolest people who decide to spend $40 on a game that might not even be made like me (p.s. you are not as cool as me) but back then this game confused the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. You know that episode of Star Trek Voyager where Red Foreman was trying to destroy time from his phase ship or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that? Remember how Red thought that time was taunting him by preventing him to getting his wife back? Achron is basically that, and you are Red Foreman, and the computer is time, and the computer is smarter than you, and you are confused as high ♥♥♥♥ due to the causal loops you and your enemies have created. And remember that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where the Enterprise (C that is) comes through an anomaly into the future which royally ♥♥♥♥s the timeline up? That has nothing to do with Achron, it's just a ♥♥♥♥ing great episode. There was some hot Enterprise-on-Enterprise action going on.			"

												Look at all the reviews!  Save yourself!  Don't buy this game!Such a great concept, but such a bad game.  Starts off slow, and you will be too frustrated at the game to figure out if it picks up.  It seems like a time travel game would have amazing amounts of freedom to beat each level however you would like.  But not this game.  You must click exactly how it (very vaguely) tells you.  Don't exactly understand how you were supposed to click?  Then you can wander aimlessly for hours, because you aren't going to beat the level until you move your troops exactly where it told you.  The second level is best described by the constant beeping (a bug that constantly checks to see if your units are in the right spot, and beeps if they are not), and slow wandering of your troops around the map.  Also included are two unavoidable deaths so you can learn the game mechanics, one painfully slow click at a time.  I was really excited about this game, but now I am just frustrated that I own it.

												Its a RTS game that utilizes time travel as a major gameplay mechanic. At any one time, you are actually in control of about 7 minutes of time and are able to influence the battle from the past, future, or present. While Single player in this game might be lackluster, the multiplayer aspect is one of the best I have seen in this genre. If for no other reason, get this game because its cheap and there is no other game like it.			"

												This is a fantastic game. The production behiend, and attantion to detail in the mechanic excuition is impressive. The ammount of time forward and back you can go is limited, but still has impact with even potientally slight changes. It's like chess, if you and your oppoent could counter eachother at every turn without any sign of one dominating the other untill the final blow is dealt(in most situations). While the graphics do suffer, that isn't something that you should deter you from this game due to the overwhelmingly astounding, and processor intensive, gameplay.

												The English language lacks the proper tenses to describe this game. It is an RTS where moving backward and forward in time is the central mechanic. If a powerful army is destroying your base, go back in time to prevent it from being built. Need reinforcements? Why not send your army 5 minutes into the past to meet up with itself, doubling your forces? You'll end up with complicated statements like ""If I will have had been building here, then I could be will have having been defended against that attack that will soon have had happened."" Without proper 4-dimensional tenses, the vocabulary of time travel will escape us, and hurt your brain. But in a good way.			"

												Pros: For those seeking an RTS with a mind-melting game mechanic look no further! This game delivers an amazing new way to play and think about an RTS; it is truly in a category all its own. I've stayed mostly in the campaigns but the game seems to have some unique settings such at 500% game speed, a key toggle for showing the mini-map 4 times larger, and the ability to zoom way, WAY out. Also IMHO campaign storyline is engaging though there clearly wasn't the budget for cut scenes!Cons: The amazing game mechanic comes with some strong drawbacks, especially if you are used to the distinct, polished, instant gameplay of StarCraft II. The game has some considerable glitches from time to time (nothing a save and reload hasn't fixed yet), my favorite being that the in-game voice overs are tied to game speed so playing at 200% game speed turns everyone into unintelligible chipmunks. Pathing is mediocre and quite delayed, though maybe that is intentional. Units favor traveling in the coordinate directions rather than going diagonal. Anyone who is used to unit micro will be sorely disappointed; the pathing and response is far too slow to allow for stutter step tactics and even something simple like moving a damaged unit out of combat is very hard to do. Because of this it seems to be a very macro oriented game. Overall: Amazing game, though unpolished with a steep learning curve (even in the campaigns). Absolutely worth it though. This game requires a-typical thought patterns and is NOT a button spamming APM/micro oriented RTS. The game mechanic forces a limited number of commands to be issued and thus rewards the player for thinking carefully rather than fast (after all, what does fast even mean when you can travel back in time!). I hope one day there will be an Achron 2 (or even just updates to Achron) which will be more polished; if there is BUY IT because that will be the greatest game of all time.			"

												The first time I played this I sat there for 6 hours working my way through the campaign. I stopped when I literally got a headache. But I was hooked. It plays about as complex as you might expect a game with time travel to play. It manages it with a timeline you can view 5 minutes forward or back or anywhere in between. You click back 30sec and you change an order, then click back to the present and everything is the same. But then time waves come into it, they move slightly faster than the passage of time and wash over the timeline from start to finish and collect and propagate changes from the past to the future. So that change you made 30sec ago, you would see a wipe go over your screen in about 20sec and if it was a large difference in orders then things would change. This opens up unique solutions to problems...-Create 5 units, skip ahead in time 30 seconds to when they are finished and send them to a task. Skip back to the present and continue your base preperations.-Attack fails on an enemy base? Go back in time and build more units to send. When the time wave propagates then you will see a successful attack. -Theres a rock/paper/scissors weak against/strong against thing happening with units in this game. So if you find yourself being decimated then you can jsut go back and change the composition of units in a squad and sit back and enjoy victory. -Enemy attacking you? You will see which direction they came from. Go back in time a minute, build more troops, and send troops in their direction to intercept. Your base is saved. But your enemy also has access to this time manipulation also. -Your troops find a large group of enemies and are outnumbered, go back in time and send more. You win. But with the next passing timewave you notice your troops sitting unharmed doing nothing. Your enemy went back in time and canceled the order to send the troops out so now you found nothing. -You attack and destroy an enemy base. Your enemy goes back in time 1 minute before this happens and sends air units to destroy the factory that created the units that will destroy your base. When the time wave propagates, you notice your attack suddenly is failing (all your units that were made from that factory no longer exist). You go back in time and cancel the attack to keep your troops near to defend the base. Your enemy goes back in time and cancels the air unit's movement as there is no longer a need to destroy the factory.Does your head hurt yet?You will be glad to hear there is a limit. As you use a regenerating resource called chronoenergy to send orders to troops in the past or future. Go back too far and one order takes more than a full bar or chronoenergy. So that is the logistical limit. You have hierachies so that one order can concievebaly control 30+ units but there is a hard limit.Want to hurt your mind more? Yes I thought so.You have heard of teleporting. Which is in the game by the way. But what about chronoporting? This is the process of sending units forward or back in time. Which creates deliciously complex solutions to problems....-Oh god the base is being attacked! You only have 5 tanks and no time to make more units. Go to the chronoporter and send all the units back in time 15 seconds. Time jumps back 15sec, you now have 10 tanks. The originals and the time clones. Just make sure to protect the original 5 tanks, as they must survive the battle in order to go to the chronoproter and go back in time. Aaagh-Send back 10 units one minute. Have them in a hierachy beforehand. Then assign them to an existing squad. You will suddenly have unprecedented firepower for that stage of the game. But you gotta weigh your options. Is it worth pouring all those resources into the early game??? Aaaagh-Out of the three races, one can chronoport without using a structure. They do it on a unit basis. This is the most mind boggling feature in my opinion. You can actually avoid conflicting forces by chronoporting back in time a minute right before you begin your attack. If you chose the right spot then you will begin your attack before you first arrived at the base. AAAAAGHSo you need to study before this game is fun. It is not quite dwarf fortress diffuculty curve but it's up there and a clear reason why it was not as popular as other RTS games. Another thing that contributed to that is it was a bit buggy at first and the pathfinding took a lot of updates to make right. It completely changed the way I play any other game. I sat down for a game of age of empires and after an unsuccessful raid I began looking to reverse my action and bolster my troops. I felt the mentality bleeding into my life and in an uncanny moment I snapped back into the realization that I live within time. Any game that makes me lose sense of reality, even for a bit get the big thumbs up from me. I'd highly reccomend this game to people who want to think and can see through complexity to do so.  "
