												I'm no Dominions veteran. I learned about Dom3 just a week before Dom4 came out but what I learned about it in that time was enough to buy this game for 30 euros on bloody Desura. And that was 1st time in years when I bought a game outside of Steam.Are you getting bored by your 10th Crusader Kings' world conquest? Have you conquered whole Europe as Palatinate in EU4 ironmode?You wish Rome 2 was less graphic and actually some content?Then Dominions 4 is clearly a game for you.You can tell it's 10 years of constant development. With 70 different factions, thousands creatures and spells ou guys are in for a treat! Single player and AI leave much to be desired but they are just a training ground for great multiplayer experience. There are few more gratifying things than fighting seasoned veterans of this title. Especially since community is very helpful and welcoming allowing you to survive learning curve with just a few broken limbs.Dominions 4 multiplayer is like a chess. If chess had 3.000 diferent units instead of 7 and could be played with few dozens people.And was cool.And had dragons.And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of spells.If you are into all that just buy it. It has best $/content ratio you can find.			"

												This game is too close to perfect 4x of my dreams, so I hardly will be objective in this case. I think, I will stick to ""good/bad"" parts instead, to show what is there.So, my pros:- Game is complex. Scalable complex. You can blindly research everything, and throw masses of your troops to win; or you can tinker with initial placement and orders; or you can plan anything - from right artifacts equipped to expert armies assembled - everything will work in single player... for some extent, of course. (Multiplayer requires good knowledge of game, so it will be complex by default).- Game is vast and diverse. I cannot remember another strategy with at least 4 significantly different races to play (and no, 3 units and 2 advancements doesn't count as ""significant""). Dominions 4 have dozens of races, and most of them requires different approach. Sometimes vastly different. There are hundreds of researcheable spells - and it's real, significant spells, not another ""Fireball III"" type of things. There are dozens of craftable artifacts too - from simple helmets and boots to unique Holy Arc or Staff of Mages that can be only one per game. And there are whole lot of magic sites! And random events too! You got the picture.- It have planned orders, and what more important - turn-based AI-controlled battles with initial order queue! I think, it's most realistic turn-based scenario: in real battles it's local commanders who matters, not warlord - after initial plan developed, of course.And now contras:- Graphics. Poor pixellated graphics from 90s. I still believe that good pixel artist could vastly improve visuals here - but, well, I am not the author, and forums thinks that graphics not matters. Oh, well.- Interface. It greatly improved since first installation, but still can be very unintuitive here and there. And many commands accessible only via hotkeys. And no filters and sorting for statistics. And not very elaborating reports for everything that are not battles... Oh, well, it definitely could be much better.- No diplomacy. No pacts, trades, unions or anything. Last part have ""minions"" system, but it not matters much for single-player, given you AI-controlled armies - and that's all. I think, MP-games more affected by that, but I am not a big fan of multiplayer.- Limited exploration. You can see whole map right from the beginning. Of course, you cannot see province details, enemy armies, and all magic sites still must be searched individually - but still, in my dreams it could be better!- Realms-based gameplay. I like to be free, with vast territories, journeys to foreign places and founding cities where I need them. Well, not that game, obviously.But regardless of described flaws, game remains one of most big, and complex, and elaborate 4X-strategy on market. I love it. Strongly recommended.			"

												I love strategy games. LOVE THEM. My favourites from the last twenty years include (in order) Age of Wonders III, Zeus: Master of Olympus, Crusader Kings II, Seven Kingdoms II, and Warlords III. Strategy fans will know that that's a fairly ecclectic mix of strategy sub-genres. Well, three days after purchasing Dominions 4 I can safely say that it has a place somewhere near the top of my list. I can't stop playing this game.I'd heard whispers about the Dominions series down through the years. Legend had it that it was the most hardcore of the hardcore. In all honesty its reputation was rather intimidating. The ancient sages were right: I was baffled for my first three games. However, don't think that it's a project to merely get into Dominions 4. It really isn't. The appropriate phrase is, ""easy to learn, difficult to master."" That's Dominions 4.The supreme god who brought order to the universe has disappeared, leaving it to a bunch of pretender gods to fight it out for His former position. You are one of those pretenders. Your first decisions will include what faction you want to control, which age of time you wish to play in, what physical form you'll take in the world, and how your influence will impact the lands under your dominion. The depth behind these choices alone is awesome.Once you've chosen one of the many pre-made maps (or generated a random one) and have customised the scenario settings to your liking, it's time to conquer the world one province at a time until you've claimed the required number of Thrones of Ascension. Though even the victory condition is customisable.In the process of doing this you'll command mighty armies, raise glorious heroes, spread the truth of your holy word, cast powerful spells, quell uprisings, contend with the fickle hand of fate in the form of random events, forge magic items, manage the economics of your realm, and a whole load more. This truly is one of those games that makes it impossible for you to keep track of time while you're playing. You may think that the graphics are simplistic (and they are), but trust me, after five minutes I don't see pixels anymore. All I see are my Atlanteans (or ""Atlantians"" as these developers have it) emerging from the ocean to crush all before them. I can't remember the last game I played that was so immersive. Your expectations would be better adjusted by considering Dominions 4 a board game with animated battles.One thing that made me hesitate to buy the game were the number of reviews (positive ones) that cast a negative light on the single-player. This concerned me since I never have any interest in multiplayer whatsoever and only buy games for solo play. I'm very glad I decided to take a risk because the AI is a worthy opponent even on ""Normal"" difficulty. Looking through the updates I can see that a lot of work has been done on the AI since the time of release which probably accounts for the earliest reviews complaining about it and my experience towards the end of 2015 being totally different.By this point in my review you'll probably already know whether or not this is the game for you, but let me share some of the cool elements in Dominions 4. You can rename not only your pretender god, but also any of your commanders. The factions in the game (there's loads of them) are all totally unique and change depending on the age you choose to play in. Those factions are all based on mythology from around our world, meaning you can live out your Arthurian or Atlantean fantasies (you have them too, right?) Your heroes can get wounded, which may involve losing one or more limbs. Characters will age and can weaken as they get older before finally dying, however some species live longer than others. The combat is detailed to the point that each unit not only has specified methods of attack, but does particular types of damage too. You can fight on the ocean floor, and some factions are aquatic. The music is wonderful.In conclusion, Dominions 4 is one of those games that you come away from with a thousand hilarious and tragic tales to tell. It's perfect for emergent storytelling. In terms of being a strategy game, yes it's highly complicated and very deep, but it doesn't put a brick wall in front of you. With each game you play you'll utilise the latest thing you've learned until at last you understand the dynamics in play. This discovery process doesn't make you groan at the prospect of facing it; it excites you and makes you want to learn more. You'll be thinking about potential strategies as you lie in bed at night. The fact that the entire Dominions series is created by just two guys (under the company name ""Illwinter Game Design"") makes all the great aspects of the game even more amazing.On a final note: I've ordered the physical manual available from the game's website. Doing such a thing is unheard of for me, but Dominions 4 is so good it's worth it.			"

												This is, no kidding, the deepest strategy game you may ever buy on Steam. The manual - and yes, you will absolutely need to read the manual old school style - is 295 pages, with the tutorial being about 24 pages of text and images. It's a complex, fiddly game, with a very dedicated community of players. If you can get a good group together, multiplayer is fantastic. I will warn you that the game's UI is obtuse as Hell and the graphics will really put your dedication to ""gameplay over graphics"" to the test. If you've never played a Dominions game, then be prepared to go down the rabbit hole of strategy.			"

												If i had to describe Dominions 4 to someone who has never played before, i would for sure use dangerous words as Risk, Civilization and Heroes of Might & Magic. Among the turn-based heroic fantasy strategy games (sorry), Dominions is the ugly guy that no one is talking to. If you dare to speak to him he'll give you access to an amazing world. But not before 3 quests:- Overcome ugliness: Dominions 4 is ugly, the screenshots dont lie! Units are 2D sprites, poorly animated and there's a good reason for that: content. I dont wanna go into numbers but with so many units, spells, magic items.. you can't expect a shadered 3D model reflecting the sun through tree leafs. Try to imagine the map as a a real map someone just scrolled in front of you asking: how are we going to make those guys believe in you? About the battles: it's somehow poorly animated (but everything is visible i.e units/spells/damage) but i can't find the words to express how i felt in front of my first 300vs300 battle, spells going on from both side, oh man that was awesome.- Provide a proof of imagination. What is going on in Dominions 4 is the rise&fall of your God in a world where Gods are in competition with each other. This is your story and it's even more funny if you can put yourself into it. There is a large background (descriptions for each races, heroes, units...) to help you with this.- Get ready for complexity. This game is deep, really deep. The learning curve is slow & long but not frustrating. You'll be amazed how detailed things are. Last game my god got killed cause one of my sorcerer casted an armor spells which explode on death, guess who took the blast? Not mentioning my 1 armed/1eyed Heroic centurion commanding the largest part of the empire's army. The interface is strange, but i can't say it's bad cause i got used to it after a couple of hours, and you can play with the mouse only. There's also a huge 400 page manual (27 pages for tutorial) to explain everything.Heavily recommended "

												I was on the fence about whether to get this game for awhile, partly because of the price and partly because of quality concerns, since obviously a lot of time wasn't spent on making the game graphically pretty. I purchased the game on sale, but after having played it I would recommend it even for full price to anyone who's looking for a deep, complex strategy game.Dominions 4 plays like a highly advanced fantasy version of Civilization or similar turn-based games. That's not to say that it's super difficult to play - the basic mechanics are pretty simple once you get the hang of the somewhat odd control scheme where LMB is used for most things where you'd normally expect to use RMB (RMB is always used to get more info on something, instead of giving orders). I was able to feel somewhat competent without any tutorials, having only watched some brief gameplay on YouTube. However the game reveals layer after layer of complexity once you really start getting into it, and it definitely follows the ""easy to play, hard to master"" philosophy. There will be a learning curve once you get beyond the basics - the manual is almost 400 pages long.So, what can you do in this game that makes it worth the time instead of just playing a Civilization?* Choose a faction and a pretender god as its leader from just about any mythology and creature you can think of. Dragons, wizards, lizard men, frost giants, weird fungus monsters, sea serpents, cthulu, you name it.* Recruit a general for every one of your armies, with his own name (given by you), stats, equipment, and experience.* Separate your armies into formations and give them orders to follow in battle (you still don't need to micromanage the battles themselves; they play out between turns)* Sacrifice virgins to your blood god and use the power to summon demons or forge magical artifacts.* Spread your icy dominion to freeze over rivers so your armies can cross it.* Call forth an army of undead and march it into the sea to surprise your enemy or control undersea territory.* Cast a spell to plunge the entire world into utter darkness.* March huge armies over all the land, then suddenly lose the game because no one believes in your god anymore (yeah, that happened to me).So if you can get past the graphics (yeah, I know, it takes a lot to get past the graphics), you'll be rewarded with a rich, cerebral, highly replayable game in Dominions 4.

												Have you ever tried board games such as Warhammer or Confrontation ?Now forget everything and take characters inspired of mythology/legends and stories from the whole world, a huge variety of units (with 3 new factions, the game has more than 1000 different units!!!!) and a deep turn based strategy... and you have Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension. Behind its aspect rought around the edges, Dominion is an extraordinary game capable to be a true competitor against table games such as Warhammer and others.You start by choosing a culture and a pretender god. This character will lead your faction through the game and keeping him alive is extremely important even if you can bring him back after a while. You can customize his appearance (around 20 skins per faction) and his skills to suit your gameplay: Will you be a terrible fighter relying on massiv armies, a talented spell caster focused on searching and summoning powerfull spells or maybe the both and wait few turns until he awakes from his dormant state ?Dominion is a turn based strategy game where you, the pretender god, have to exterminate every other factions or sit on  one of the Thrones of Ascension to reach a new plane of existence and became the god above all other pretender gods.You start with a main fortress with different bonus and buildings depending on what kind of faction you have choosen.As an example my favourite faction is R'yleh: Fallen star, inspired of Lovecraft's Cthulhu, this faction has a portal named the ""Void gate"" where you can try to summon new creatures by using a competent summoner.Even if you can get some of the most dangerous units of the game, the void gate can bring hostile monsters capable to kill your wizards.Like for every factions, everything has its price, thinking and planning carefully are keys for victory.All factions are different and quite a lot of them forces you to learn an other way to play the game.As an example R'yleh is mainly based on brainwashed magical units and when you need to use humans or humanoid troops, you will be forced to get new commanders and divide your army because magic beeings can only be lead by a magical commander. Add to that the moral and the supplies your army needs wich can affect their health or worst, to be more encline to fail against the enemy dominion and run away.Dominion is an other great aspect of the game. It represents the spread of the culture and the religion of your faction.Each pretender god can boost its dominion to give malus to the enemy or bonus to his land.And it's where the game is clever because quite early you will have to choose if you rush into the battle with spells or try to stay back and research in new magical disciplines to summon many things or affect enemy dominion, ect....The game is quite open and give you the ability to enjoy quite a lot of strategies. The A.I is really powerfull and has always, ALWAYS, a way to get the upper hand. The screenshots you see on the store page are the recordings of some battles.As a turn-based strategy game, you have to plan everything, from the spell your wizards will cast in the battle, to the actions/ movements your squads will do.You can even choose a formation with bonus and malus. Will you trample the infantry and rush to these coward archers ? Or let you wizards/ range units rain hell upon enemy heroes ?There are plenty ways to manage fights even if you can't act during them.But be ware ! You can enable events wich can affect you on every tiles of the map or everybody and sometimes things turns really bad...The most important aspect in Dominion is magic wich is related to an enormous tree of research.You can summon creatures, structures, cast world wide spells, teleport your units, bless and give tons of abilities to your troops such as invisibility, the gift of underwater breathing or flying, ect...You can even forge magical items to give to your commanders !Every spells must but prepared and choosed before each fights or you can let your commander decide but you won't get all the subtleties of magic.Each school of magic is related to a mana gem that you can gather on the map or with special events. Some kind of currency between your units, you have to manage and give them to you commanders before they go to war. The more you have the better, some schools of magic need slaves for sacrifices and of course give powerfull spells but reduces the stability and the population of your regions. Some factions are even unable to recruit units with gold, so you will have to spare mana gems for the invocation of new troops or commanders !But i will stop here for the gameplay because nobody can deal about every aspects in a review.This game is unforgivable and has a slow paced learning curve as many said the game manual has 400 pages...400 PAGES ! (Thanks to Niky 45 because I was wrong about the  number of pages)So you understand why it can be so hard to talk about everything this game has to offer ^^As an  example my last game session: after few hours (22 hours !!) of fail attempts to master Ry'leth and the map i've choosed (the game has quite a ot of maps with different strategies, to master one is allready a prowess...),  I was beaten by and army from a corner of the map (hate thoses war elephants !!!)  capable to  trample my best commanders and units  and with spells I've never seen before !I had an army of arround 2000 or 3000 units and Ry'leth has covered about 2 tiers of the world after having slain 6 pretender gods.My pretender god, Kraahaul the Void Lord, died in a miserable fight against this suddent powerfull new enemy...And you know what ? I want more !Even if you can't build much structures ( only labs, temples and 3 types of castles with their upgrades) and affect your population ( a research tree about the dominion itselft would have been great), or use diplomatic skills between factions (you are at war with everybody) this game is really good.In fact the perfect strategy game would be a mixt of Dominion, Total War and Warhammer.I hope to see the day when this kind of game will come !If you are not scared about a very hard/deep strategy game and simple graphics try Dominion 4: Throne of Ascension.You won't be disapointed...And i put you to the test to master R'yleh: Fallen star and spread the void and the tentacles of the Starspawns on all over the world !MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !This is why i love this game ^^N.B: i've forgot, this game has a multiplayer. Yeah i know i'm a coward... because i haven't tried it !Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension is a game for men, be ware !			"

												I've read a couple of negative reviews and comments presenting objections to them before writing this. I think people criticizing this game are not to blame. The problem is that game is horribly NOT for general audience, who ""fans of Civilization and HOMM series"" and don't intrested in wargames as a genre. It's not a casual game, it's developed by very small team for very specific type of player, to those who value very complex game mechanics more than anything else. Those people don't care about graphics so much. These are the same people who play SS13, Dwarf Fortress, Steel Panthers and the like in 2014 and don't understand why those games appear ""outdated"" to someone - they still have unrivalled mechanics as of today. And that's the only thing that matters.Criticism of PBEM MP in this game is baseless. Actually, it is THE MP format best suited for such type of games. After game session progresses beyond initial expanding and settling stage, some turns can take literally HOURS of thinking and trying different solutions. In bigger sessions with bigger maps it's uncommon to have turnlimit time set to several DAYS, so no one would feel pressed by it. Do somebody intend to wait hours while his opponent tries to figure out his best plan for this turn, like, at the keyboard? I don't think so. We actually played it like this in Dom3, and after first 10-20 turns it becomes just too painfull to endure all the waiting. It's much better to play this in PBEM. That is, it's so for any turnbased wargame.The criticism of lack of tutorials and not so convinient UI is at least acceptable. The problem with first is that the game is so complex behind the curtains, that to write some good and all-embracing HOWTO is nearly impossible. One can go to fan forums and check for himself that for every of several dozens of ingame races (I'm takin in account three different Ages existing in the game, so one race, if present in all three, can feel substantionally different depending on Age) there are several - sometimes totally different - aproaches, which many times will depend on whom you are facing in this particular game session as an enemy and a friend. The problem with second is that development team is quite restricted in terms of resources and try to focus on more important (for the audience of such games) things, related to game mechanics.The combat's design stems out of those peculiarities layed out above. They tried to do it the way somehow predictable and transparent, as you won't be able to correct it in real time. Still I'll give it to haters that it's a little oversimplistic, but hopefully will be expanded in years to come (in Dom4 they added formations, for example).Basically, those reviewers didn't even have a chance to peek behind the curtains of simplistic looking UI to discover the indisputable variety which comes with magic system and different Pretender's/dominion's types strategies, which really make this game shine.

												People have said a lot of things about Dom4, with the top ones being statements like ""I'm sending my race of lavamen led by a sun with arms and bird wings against giant Jewish cannibal wizards led by a sentient blood fountain."" They've also probably said things like ""if you love spreadsheets, you'll love this game."" Both of these statements hold truth. Here's what you'll find in the gamePros:- The largest variety of choices I've seen in any video game.- Over twenty races, each radically different in a way that still tends to balance itself out.- Three eras of play, each radically affecting said twenty races. Changes range from shifting their focus to turning them into different nations entirely.- Weird and wonderful lore everywhere.- A robust and well-crafted magic system.-Most of the actual micromanagement is under the hood, and a lot of things can be automated, allowing you to spend your time on the more important stuff.- It'll run on a potato.Cons:- Said choices are shoved in your face up front, and even with the handy tooltips, it's hard to get what they all mean.- Unless you read the doorstopper of a manual, you will be confused. And even then, it takes experimentation to actually know what every number means.- The wrong mistake at the wrong time can send your entire civilization kicking and screaming into the abyss.- Multiplayer is plagued by a meta nearly as bad as DOTA 2.- All that important stuff you micromanage? It's still a lot.- It has the kind of graphics you'd expect from a potato.Don't be scared by its price tag, either. It's 35 dollars, but it's already given me more replay value than nearly any game I've spent 60 bucks on, and it's definitely given me more content. But if you're really adamant about saving money, wait till a sale. You won't regret it.			"

												About twenty hours in now and I truly love this game.  It's complex.  It's frustrating as hell.  The learning curve makes me want to claw my eyes out in frustration as I figure more and more of the game out.  Today I was trying to take out a line of enemy fortresses.  Somehow they have enough troops to throw hundreds and hundreds of soldiers at my army who mercilessly slaughter them over and over again.  Two, three, four times until finally after a fifth or sixth time my massive siege army of apes falls to an army of men.  I scream in frustration at the monitor.  My girlfriend is beside me and looks over saying ""Honey, why don't you play something else for a bit? This game is obviously driving you nuts.""  But she doesn't understand.  Nobody truly understands the perfect homeland I am trying to create for my race of mega-apes.  What a lack of vision.10/10			"

												My impressions of Dominions 4 (~15 hours) is that Illwinter has come up with another winner.  Be warned though, this is a game for folks who really enjoy turn-based strategy games (TBS), especially multi-player TBS (Disclaimer:  I have not tried Dominions 4 MP yet, but Dominions 3 MP was tremendous).  But if you are looking for high-end graphics, a gentle learning curve, hand-holding tutorials or a casual strategy gaming experience, you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you are a fan of TBS games, Dominions 4 has tremendous depth, content and attention to detail.  From the ability to customize your god to each race with unique abilities, there are many variables to make each game unique.  Gameplay can be a bit daunting initially, but rewards players who carefully plan and execute those strategies.My only negative at this time regarding Dominions 4 is it appears to be a bit too similar to Dominions 3 which I played heavily in the pre-Steam days.  I’ll update this review after additional playtime with other factions and MP to highlight some of the changes from Dominions 3. "

												Extraordinary amount of content (75 factions, 2.5k units, hundreds of spells and items), in-depth mechanics with many unique ideas (like the combat system in which you can deploy your troops and give them scripted orders instead of having direct control over them, placing emphasis on careful planning and predicting enemy tactics), factions primarily based on historical nations and real-world mythology from all around the world (and lore being superbly represented by the mechanics: I'd go as far as saying Dominions has the best worldbuilding in video games), great multiplayer experience (simultaneous turns, works really well in play-by-e-mail format, typically played with machiavellian diplomacy), good modding-support...I've personally been a fan since Dominions 2 (although I didn't pick up multiplayer until recently) and despite ridiculous pricing of the time (I think I paid $80 for both Dom2 and Dom3 when you include postage fees), it was worth every cent and then some. After all, in what other game can you have a deathmatch between Gods that lead nations such as Spanish Inquisition, Atlantian Eskimos, Man-eating Giant Jews, The Mongols, Undead Romans and the like? What other game allows you to have reality-altering magic or armed-to-the-teeth titans capable of wiping out armies single-handedly while remaining ""balanced""?Now, it should go without saying that Dominions 4 has low production value and it's not a stellar single player game. Some veteran players have also raised concerns about a couple of changes (like removal of reverse communions) that might end up hurting it in the long run (I don't dare to make a claim for either direction myself). However, as far as I can tell, Dominions 4 is still an upgrade over its predecessor, and even if some of the issues come to haunt it in the long run, there's only one game that even compares, and that's Dominions 3, a proven masterpiece. Dominions 4 is probably even better, and with the bulk of MP-games being made to it right now and improvements to single player being noticeable (even if not huge), it's the obvious choice if you want some Dominions action.

												I've played several thousand hours of this game, and dominions 3.  The only other game i've played anywhere near as much is tabletop rpgs.  But i'm biased, old hand, fan, etc.  This guy isn't.  Here's what he had to say on the Steam forum.Originally posted by Stephen:Earlier tonight, one of the most epic occurences I have ever seen in a video game occured. Seeing that as a sign of a good game and also worth telling about, I decided to post here for your reading pleasure. Since it is only due to a confusing chain of events that this occured, I'm going to tell the full story from start to finish. Enjoy.Recently I started a MA game with my friend. It was Agartha and Pangea (me and my friend) up against 6 other pairs ( Ermor and Arcosephale, Ashdod and Nazca, Tien Chi and Caelum, Eriu and Ulm, Asphodel and Vanarus, Sceleria and Man ). Settings were for a long enjoyable coop game against the AI, with story events, conquest all, clustered spawns, and common random events. To start, we are luckily positioned with the one sea as our northern border ( the map had full wraparound), and mountains close by. We expand quickly and have a nice lump of land before we begin having conflicts with our neighbors, Ermor to the west and Ashdod/Nazca to the south. Im forced to support my Pangean friend with large blocks of Agarthan infantry supported with living statues so we can push back the enemies to the south. During the delay, Ermor casts a global enchantment, Burden of Time. Realizing the issues with all of our units dying of old age, we immediatly leave a small border garrison and charge our resources at Ermor. The endless legion combined with the death 3 provinces causes massive attrition, wearing our armies down to nothing and resulting in the deaths of my top commanders, excpet for one, Ernst, the Cave Captain. He has already aged to 45 / 50 from the Global Enchantment, so I prepare a suicide battalion of my remaining elderly units to rush Ermor and slay their god to end the enchantment. In a long battle across Ermor, I manage to corner and kill him in their capital. In the mean time, I've also rushed my way into Blood Magic to unlock Boots of Youth, which Ernst gets at the ripe age of 49, 1 year before old age. The Encantment is dispelled, but most players without undead focus have been crippled from its effects. My researchers are all diseased and my armies crippled. Ernst and only a few other commanders were given boots in time, the rest being too wounded to salvage. I recruit new generals, one of which being Aripert. The game is peacful for a time, but soon Ashopdel begins attacking. Im ready. Aripert and Ernst lead a combined force of over 400 Agarthan infantry, supported by foul spawn and living statues. Ashopdel is crushed, but their ally Vanarus pushes me back, killing most of my army. My commanders retreat, and I get a story event at my capital. A band of adventurers has joined the cause. I put them to good use as supporting commanders and mages for Aripert and Ernst. I launch a new attack at Ashopdel and Vanarus, killing the former and sieging the latter. My ally in the meantime has been fighting the war from the opposite side, and we meet together at Vanarus's capital. I storm first, Ernst, Aripert, and adveturers as commanders, a a vangaurd of Agarthan Living Statues in the front, foul spawn on the flanks, and Agarthan infantry in the core. The battle is brutal, with the archer towers killing 2 of my 6 adventurers, and my force being hit with many spells. Inside the fort is Vanarus' God, the Son of Fenrir. My own commanders have reached hall of fame status with 4 EXP and a heroic ability each. The battle rages, and I notice the adventures have been casting Nature 2 spells Enlarge and Enrage on my commanders. Suddenly, my small Cave Captains Ernst and Aripert have turned into size 4 killing machines, but are unable to get into combat. Eventually, morale breaks in both sides, and the mages run off the fields. My statues and the enemy elementals collapse into dust, leaving our core infantry to fight. The Son of Fenrir enters combat with his wolves, decimating my men while their men are whittled away by my more tanky infantry. The core infantry of their side routes, but mine route aswell after slaying the wolve body guards of their pretender god. All thats left are Ernst and Aripert, leading the charge alone. Against a god. With 200 hp. and Regen. I prepare for the worst, and to my astonishment Ernst strikes their god down with his enchanted Sword of Swiftness, with Aripert supporting. Vanarus was knocked out of the game, and a basic Cave Captain recruiting for a suicide mission many years ago had slain a god. "

												Young Prince Gawain was marching to a war. He had assembled an army of 80 men clad in the finest black steel, his own black armor was forged by the master smiths of Ulm, the two handed black halberd heavy enough to chop through even a knight and his horse. He strode forward with the weapon in hand, alone except for his thoughts when movement through his narrow eyeholes in his helmet drew his attention. A man clothed all in black stared at him, nodded and ran forward a longsword appearing in his hands.Gawain parried the first blow with a sweep of his halberd and launched a furious blow diagonally downward catching the man across the legs as he attempted to dodge the blow. The man stumbled but still stood, blood poured from the massive gashes across his legs, crippled and limping the man could barely move and Gawain laughed as he stepped in close to deliver the final blow. The man, just barely staying on his feet slashed desperately at the young prince....and blade met flesh and tore through into open air only to bite into flesh and rip through again. Gawain stared at the spurting bloody stumps where his hands and part of his forearms had been. The huge black halberd lay on the ground next to him his hands still clutched tightly around the handle. The young prince screamed as the pain assailed him and he tried to stumble backwards, away from the man with the blade but his eyes locked onto the blade the man was swinging and he could not bring himself to turn his back and die without seeing. No, the young prince would not die at all. Still screaming in pain but feeling anger flair in his chest Gawain hurled himself at the man with the sword and without a fist to swing found himself kicking with all his strength into the mans chin. With a loud crack the man fell backwards and lay still. Gawain stared at the motionless body for a few seconds and stumbled away. His blood dripped onto the ground and he found himself feeling rather tired. In the distance he could hear the shouts of his men. Dully he thought they might've been drawn by the sounds of battle or his screams. Either way, they would find him soon. Sighing he sat down against a tree, and waited nothing in the world but exhaustion and pain.TLDR: New commander had an assassination attempt on him, gave the attacker cripple and limp afflictions with first blow, and then got both his arms cut off, then he kicked the assassin to death. Still leads troops armless.			"

 If you know Dominions3: Dominions 4 is an attempt to turn Dominions 3 wall-like learning ""curve"" into a slightly less steep one. Let’s say a ""Pisa tower wall"" curve!A bit more seriously this game is just the a simple update of Dominions 3. However this one is the must have. Some new races, much more community support (no1 is playing Dom3), here you will be able to find people to play with. If you loved Dom3 do yourself a favour... If you don't: This is a map-top-view war strategy game with races deeply founded on global mythological history.It is like playing a mythological version of Risk (the table top game) in which each and every unit of yours has individual characteristics (stats, afflictions, abilities etc.) which are persistent through the entire match.This will be delightful for people that love finding the most ""efficient"" routes to play, because you have so many variables to consider you will probably never be able to do so, but you will still love the challenge.It will also be delightful for people that read lore. Each and everything you control (or don't) in this game has their characteristics explained in one or two paragraphs entwined with lore which in the end is mythology.TL;DR: If you really usually jump for TLDRs don't bother getting the game.... there will be long necessary reading in the game and honestly you will need lots of patience to learn it! Otherwise... if you read the thing with a smile, buy it already.			"

												Graphics and sound would have been good 20 years ago. Strategic gameplay is maybe the deepest of any non-abstract computer game ever made, but/and also entirely unbalanced, unforgiving and uncompromisingly hard. This is to say, you need to know exactly what you're doing at every point in the game or you'll just suddenly die (no matter how well you seem to be doing) and have to start over (or find another game if doing multiplayer). There is no save (Although you can backup the game-files manually to effectively make one). While this caters to the target audience perfectly (this game is 10/10 if spending about a year full-time, studying its every little nuance, appeals to you), but makes it a less than good game objectively.The fantasy themes are very well presented, and the best part of the game is how it lets you create The Lion or The Witch of Narnia, or Gandalf or Sauron, or a DnD Lich-King, or a Titan of the Greek Mythologies or just about any classic powerful being as a pretender to godhood. No other game on any media have been able to mix a fraction of the themes or come close to portraying them as well as Illwinter. They also deserve kudos for being Indie before the concept was concieved.Dominions 4 is a clear improvement to Dom 3, affording better graphics and implementing some important re-balancing.			"

												If you've ever thought about smashing Dwarf Fortress, Final Fantasy, Age of Mythology, and D&D together, then this game is what you've been waiting for, if you can be patient. Given the time, Dominions can be a charming, humbling, and very fun game, that you can always, always learn more about. Only the patrician need apply here, this game has a very steep learning curve, and shatters your confidence in your meagre skills the first time you want to play competitively. The game is rather pricey, so if you aren't sure you want to buy it, wait for a sale.			"

												While certainly lacking in the presentation department with it's very dated graphics, Dom4 more than makes up for it in it's charm. The game lets you take mythological lore from around the world and pit it in wars for ultimate domination. You will see Titans warring against undead legionares, yomi fighting against valkeries, and lich kings unleashing death on the men of Avalon.To me, Dom4 feels like a Ck2/Total War-esque type of strategy game, where you fight to expand your territory, spread your dominion (religion), and develop your nation. Where it really shines is its deep magical paths and unit diversity. I play the game with my second monitor open to the Dom4 mod inspector (http://larzm42.github.io/dom4inspector/) where I can compare and contrast every item, spell, unit, and magic site in the game. With 25 nations in each time period, combined with the numerous magic paths one can decide to branch into, their are many many combinations of strategies and development. In other words, no two players may play the same nation the same way, they may play off different strengths depending on how they designed their pretender (leading god of their nation).This game to me is an easy to play, tough to master - which opens up for hours and hours of gameplay. You can play against the AI who offer a fair challenge (albeit becoming predicatble as you play more - such is expected with strategy AI), and when you seek a higher challenge it offers both real time and play by email multiplayer. I didn't think I would enjoy the play by email system but it's really relaxing to have a few games going at once and getting to do a turn or two per day before and after work/school. I always look forward to downloading my turns and seeing how my wars turned out, what kind of events popped out, and coming up with a plan for the next turn. All the while trying to formulate long term magic goals that will keep me relevant into the late game.In short, if you enjoy strategy, fantasy, mythology, or games such as Total war, Paradox strategy titles, or even the Civ series, do yourself a favour and give Dominions 4 a try.

												I bought the predecessor game when it was on sale and played it so many hours that I decided the full price for this game was a good investment. As I write this review, it is on sale (BUY IT NOW!) but I'm not very upset for not waiting. The graphics are way better (still crap though), particularly with the default map textures. Several new items were added, and some were rebalanced while others were rewritten to reflect actual affects. A couple new races... units... spells... blah blah Everything got an upgrade just like a sequel is supposed to do. (Finally a developer _actually_ does that!)Turn based means you can play at whatever leisure works best for you. You can play on the same computer (hotseat), by e-mail (PBM), or drop your turns in whatever convenient server will host files for public access (ie Dropbox). Very similar lengths like Risk and Axis&Allies, you could play for an afternoon with friends or play for months with rivals. You could play four games simultaneously as long as you're not running four instances of the program (there is a rule of thumb about more than four games, you need two brains or something like that). You could even play a marathon until interrupted and come back the next day exactly where you left off.I was looking for a game that had serious themes and dark humor. I was looking for a game that focused on stratetic management rather than tactical maneuvers. I was looking for a game that I could not learn to exploit every weakness in an hour. I was looking for a game that had replay value through meaningful starting choices. I was looking for a game based on gameplay rather than being entirely based on its graphics. I found it and then bought its sequel. You should save some money and buy this one straight away.			"

												Possibly the best game you've never heard of.Steam kept recommending this game to me based on other games I played, and for a long time I ignored it because I expected better graphics from a game this expensive.  Then it went on sale one day and I took the plunge, and I haven't looked back since.Dominions 4 is a turn-based strategy game about warring nations each ruled by a mythological entity (titan, monster, wizard, etc) that is trying to become a god.  In the most commonly played game mode, this is accomplished by capturing a certain number of Thrones which are scattered around the map.  In addition to granting victory points, each throne also gives some kind of bonus to your nation when you claim it.There are dozens of different nations to choose from, and while the diversity keeps things interesting, balance seems to have unfortunately been a secondary consideration, and some nations are really better than others.  Once a nation is chosen, the next step is to create your pretender, the previously mentioned creature that's trying to become a god.  Each nation has a dozen or more pretender options to choose from that fit that nation's theme.  So nations with a Norse theme can choose pretenders like frost giants or giant serpents, while Greco-Roman nations get a variety of different titans and monsters like the Manticore.  Each pretender is also highly customizable, and how you build your pretender can have an enormous impact on how you play the game.Once the game actually starts, turns consist of recruiting units from the territories you control and sending them out to conquer more territory.  Which sounds simple, and even seems simple when you first start playing.  But soon you realize there's a TON of strategic depth to this game.  When you tell your units to attack a province, you don't control the battle directly.  Instead, you issue the orders that you want your units to follow during the battle before the battle starts.  So you might tell your frontline sword-and-shield infantry to take up a line formation at the front of the battlefield, hold position for the first two turns of combat, and then advance on the enemy, while your archers stay behind with orders to fire on any flying enemies that appear, for example.You also recruit mages to perform your research and cast all your spells.  There are literally hundreds of spells to research, which creates untold opportunities for play and counterplay - like I said, strategic depth.  Again, balance doesn't seem to have been a primary focus here, and the fact is that many spells are rarely if ever actually used in competitive games, but it's always interesting to encounter spells you haven't seen before, or familiar spells used in new ways.Bottom line: if you're a fan of complex turn-based strategy games and don't mind a steep learning curve, Dominions is as good as it gets.  I started out playing single player exclusively, which is fine if that's what you're into or just looking to learn the ropes, but multiplayer is where this game really shines in my opinion.  I would be remiss if I didn't point out the game's flaws as well, which include the general lack of balance I've mentioned before, the frankly unimpressive graphics, and a UI that often leaves much to be desired.  That said, the good outweighs the bad here, and while the normal price point might be a little high given the lack of polish, I highly recommend grabbing this game when it's on sale.			"

												Here are two lines from a recent update:*Max number of commanders increased 9990 -> 20000*Max number of units increased 160000 -> 250000 The graphics may be less than appealing, but this game has serious heart and heritage. Quality updates continue to trickle in, and I'm more than glad some of my money went to help the devs, and the future of Dominions.For a ""real"" review, I'll talk about how the game plays. For each turn, you: 1. create new units or commanders and assign troops to those commanders 2. decide if you want to build any structures (temple, science-research, and castle/fortress/fortifications, basically) 3. assign new magic-school research, if needed 4. issue move orders, if any 5. End Turn. I mention this because I know, at first glance, Dominions 4 seems like it might be one of those ""Cool concept, but too complicated to play!"" kind of games, when it is not..The game is nowhere near shallow, despite the above statement. Each faction (spanning through three different eras of time) has many tricks and strategies, some obvious and some downright devious, and ""learning"" a faction is quite challenging.. Adapting to your opponents strategy is also serious business..There is no ""diplomacy"" here.. If Pangaea has a massive army of elite Shark Tribe warriors supported with massive underwater behemoths, well.. There is no ""playing nice"" :) Your goal is to conquer, one way or another..Anyway, I'm sure there are far better reviews than mine, so I'll quit rambling. Just wanted to show my support and toss another vertically-inclined thumb into the mix ;)			"

												When it comes to developing a game franchise, the most common approach is to improve every aspect of the game, with a strong attention given to UI and graphics. For Dominions however, Illwinter Games took a different turn. They piled up content and added extra features over a very old engine. They have done so for many years now.So yes, this game is an ugly mess if you compare it to, say, the latest Civ. The barrier of entry is immense : Even if you've gotten your hands on some of the most complex 4X games of old such as Imperialism 2, or for a more recent exemple, Distant Worlds, you are not ready. I have played many of these games in my time, and boy I was not ready. The amount of micro management and planning required to make you a ""decent"" Dominions 4 player is insane. Recruiting the right troops, managing a good income, and agressive expansion won't get you very far. You will need a sound understanding of the Magic Paths (hundreds of spells), your God design will determine if you're an early game nation with a Dragon rampaging through hordes of unprepared half-naked barbarians, or a late game nation with an old but powerful Crone biding his time in his cell, carefully planning research and assembling around you some of the most powerful magic users in the land.I must warn you : If you come aboard, there's no turning back. Civ now feels shallow, when I boot up Total War I get flashbacks of the toy soldiers of my youth. Even my first 4X crush Master of Orion 2 has left me for good. I used to be a nostalgic of the old 4X games, but that was before Dominions 4. I regret nothing.			"

												I've been hesitant to write a review for Dom4 because after nearly 35 hours, I still don't understand most of it. But I feel like I should write something for it to let others know about this game.This game is big, complex, and it all makes sense. There are massive amounts of strategies and a lot of depth, with a detailed world that all factors into how factions play. There are a large amount of factions, all of which have their own units and their own backstories, and a large amount of mythological beings, potential gods, and random events that can potentially completely change your experience.The game is a tale about pretender gods, all together trying to eliminate the others so that they become the one real god. As the player, you control one such pretender god - Fully customised to your own likings and their nation/faction. Expand, research, play to your nation's strength, build up a massive army, and try to conquer the world. The keyword here being TRY, because every other faction has a pretender god trying to do the exact same thing, and things will often not go as planned.You do not personally control the tactical combat, you only control the large picture. The army movement, the research, and important people(Such as scouts, mages, and commanders).It may be overwhelming, and with a 300 page manual it's certainly not an easy game, but you don't need to know the top tier strategies to understand what's going on. Even without understanding most of the game you can enjoy it, with the large amount of mythology, customisation, and detail involved, you can easily weave your own tales of what happens in the world. As a side note, the interface needs a little bit of learning too, but things become clear if you take a step back and calmly read the buttons and try them outAfter all this time, I still have moments where I meet entirely new things I haven't seen yet, so I can not tell you much about the great strategies that will let you win. But I can tell you that if you try hard enough, you can at least not get overrun by the AI most of the time, giving you all the time you need to learn more about the game, regroup, and fight back.It's difficult to truly explain its appeal, but Dominions 4 has a massive amount of content out there, with a lot of lore and depth to it. If you can get into it you will be able to spend hours on it, and if you want to really get involved with it there is a decently sized community out there to play with and learn from, showing you even more of an already huge game			"

Now that I'm in my 40's, our group prefers a-sync games and Dominions is the best of them all. Each nation is vastly different... and there are almost 30 nations now? Deep mechanics. Strategy, Tactics, cunning, bluffing, maneuvering, equipping, researching, casting rituals... it's all handled amazingly well to provide an AAA multiplayer experience.			"

												Summary: Two words: BO-RING!Pros: Tons of content; thoughtful and imaginitive faction designCons: Flat, lifeless delivery; wealth of detail does not translate to depth of playFirst off, I have to add a significant caveat: a couple of comments on this review have noted that Dominions 4 is primarily intended as a multiplayer game, and so my review is inherently flawed since I'm looking at it as a single player game.  That may be so, though I don't see how we're supposed to know that in advance -- they certainly don't advertise it that way.  But I'll concede that point and note that this review is targeted mainly at folks interested in the single player experience.Anyway... I *really* wanted to like this game.  I've been a strategy game addict going back to the days of board games with thousands of little cardboard counters.  So I was as excited as a puppy when I read that Dominions 4 has a 400 page manual.  It had to have incredible depth, right?  Wrong.  It has a lot of *content*, but that's not the same thing.Dominions 4 has hundreds of different spells and units -- but who cares when you can't actually use them?  The game ultimately revolves *entirely* around combat, but combat is always resolved automatically.  At best you're a spectator, but after watching a dozen or so battles with a new faction to get a feel for what combination of units works well, you probably won't even bother with that.And without the ability to participate in combat, there just isn't that much to do.  Despite the creative and well-researched styles particular to each of the many playable factions, no matter which faction you choose, gameplay quickly degenerates into a tedious slog of building units, moving them to the front, and throwing them into combat.  Build, move, repeat.The game has features like combat scripting and magic items, but unfortunately they don't affect the *experience* provided by the game.  For example, you can craft a magic sword and equip your army commander with it, but the only difference that makes is that when you read the next battle report, your army's losses might be 10% less.  If that's your idea of fun, good for you, but as far as I'm concerned it's about as exciting as playing a spreadsheet.The game can be broken into two main parts: the strategic level, where you build and move armies around the map; and the tactical level, where combat is resolved on a smaller-scale map containing all the units in the two conflicting armies.  I'll contrast each of those parts to a game that I think does that part really well.If grand strategy is your thing, I would say the state of the art is currently exemplified by the Europa Universalis franchise.  In EU4 different nations really *do* play very differently, and you actually *do* have the option of pursuing many different strategies that make real differences both in how the game plays and in the outcomes you get.  Maybe I'm missing something, but Dominions 4 hardly seems to have a strategic element to it at all.  For all their different ""background flavor"", the different factions ultimately play virtually the same way.  It really makes no difference whether your armies are composed of human swordsmen or giant hydras, whether your spellcasters specialize in blood magic or fire magic, whether your faction likes heat or cold or even lives underwater -- the only ""strategy"" you can pursue in this game is universal conquest, and the only strategic-level decisions to make are the order in which you attack enemy provinces.There's some slight interest in choosing the best unit combinations for your army, but it's not that hard -- in fact it's mostly a rather tedious chore of comparing unit statistics -- and once you do that you don't ever have to bother looking at them again.  Once you've chosen units A, B and C for your army, regardless of your faction it then boils down to ""build 5 of A, 3 of B, and 6 of C"" every turn, stacking them up, throwing them at the enemy, and then *reading* the combat results.  Put all that together, and Dominions barely even qualifies as a strategy game.  It certainly doesn't excel at it.At the tactical level, Dominions is two or three *decades* behind the times.  Consider the King's Bounty franchise: like Dominions, those games also feature lots of different units, spells and magic items; but unlike Dominions, you can actually *use* them in combat, where they have obvioiusly differing, tangible effects.  What's more, you can *see* these effects via their superb unit and spell animations and sound effects.  In fact, I'd argue that ""despite"" its vastly superior graphics and sound, King's Bounty is also a vastly superior combat simulation.  Even if you're OK with Dominions simulating combat for you (and I don't see why you should be), there's just no way its AI is going to do a tenth as good a job as you could, regardless of any ""scripting"" you might do.  Building and customizing your army requires every bit as much planning in King's Bounty as the nearest equivalent in Dominions 4 -- and it's about 1000 times more satisfying in its execution.  In fact, combat resolution in Dominions is the most boring I've seen in a game since Risk.  And that's a problem, because this game is entirely focused on combat.The final page of the tutorial highlights just what I dislike about this game.  It gives the example of how, if you want to invade a sea territory, you need to ""plan ahead"": you must first research construction magic until you know how to forge a ring of water breathing; and you also need a mage with sufficient skill to forge it; and you need enough magic gems to perform the construction; and then when it's all ready you give the ring to your army commander.  This all sounded very exciting when I read it, but then when I did it, it was just colossally dull.  There's no substance to any of these steps, and no payoff when it's been achieved.  They amount to nothing more than selecting items from text menus, and when you do, the game looks and plays looks exactly like it did before, except now you can move that leader into water provinces.  Whoopee.Plus, the game doesn't have any personality -- there are no quests, no dialogue, no diplomacy.  Again, this might be expected of a game whose focus is multiplayer, but that doesn't do any favors for the single player experience -- which, unfortunately, is as bland and lifeless as any game I've ever played.  Above any other considerations, a game should be fun, and Dominions 4 just isn't.			"

												I thought this game was about spamming units, but I learned more.Then, I thought this game was about powering up characters, but I learned more.Then, I thought this game was about counter-attacks, but then I learned more.Then, I thought this game was about resource management and building, but then I learned more.Dominions is a deceptively straight-forward strategy game which is a unique pleasure.  It involves trying to conquer the world as a Pretender God by harnessing armies, unleashing terrible magics upon unbelievers, and drawing money, resources and gems from the Earth.  Tactically it involves positioning your armies and giving each unit orders, which is surprisingly satisfying.   It is quite easy to grasp, but has a depth of alternatives and so the complexity of the game arises in how you want to play it.  I'm a strategy nut and I've not played a game like this, it's a bit like Pokemon crossed with Chess crossed with Lord of the Rings, crossed with Religious Genocide.In big games it gets ridiculously epic as you cast spells which upset the very basis of nature, bring plague and horrors from beyond the void into your enemies' homelands.  While dated, the graphics are actually really cool, and the sound track is fitting.It's also the only game in which you can have this conversation seriously-""How did you win that?""""Magic"".Anyhoo, I'm off to make a tornado of corpses which eats the souls of all those it passes.

												Dominions 4 is an extremely deep 4x, with more ""under the hood"" than its competitors. The combat, unit choice, list of factions, spells to research and ways to command your units is all far and above what other games offer.But it doesn't have much interest in teaching you how to play it, and the interface is functional at best. Someone sitting down with Civ 5 or Endless Legend could quickly enjoy intuitive and simple mechanics, while Dominions 4 is a struggle from the start. The setting is very rich, with mythological and history-based factions ruled over by a God of your design competing to bcome the omnipotent divinity. Dominions 4 requires a lot of investment to understand what's going on, why it's happening, and what to do, but it's very rewarding once you do so. 70 hours in I am still learning new things- Axe-equipped infantry are more likely to lop off an enemy's arm in combat, giving him hideous penalties and generally ruining his day. How awesome is that? But the game is in no hurry to tell you about its many wonderful features and possibilities. Finally, the multiplayer is much smoother than other 4xes i've played, moving along comparatively fast. It's possible to play out thirty turns in one sitting with multiple friends, and a great way to spend an evening.  Especially recommended to those who love history and mythology.  "

												Wow, I have not written a review for this yet? Hmm.Dominions 4 is a True Fantasy game. The worlds are remind me of the world of Conan. You build armies, attach them to Leaders, and set forth to conquer provinces. Each province will add to your money per turn. Yes, it is Turn Based! YAY! Each faction is Very Different. Each deity can be configured in many different ways. There are spells, but mainly this games is about armies!Spreading the Word of your chosen pretender deity is important. This can be done with temples you build in a province or by priests. Look out for Assassins! There is a nice small selection of buildings you may build in your provinces.The AI can be quite a challenge. MASSIVE armies will clash in heated combat! Although you do not control your armies in combat, your pre battle setup is important.The Thrones of Ascension allow you to capture cool resource areas. You can even win by owning a good number of them.High Fantasy is awesome in this game. It is a little basic as games go, but this is one of my favorite games.			"

												Hi everyone, I do not normally take the time to actually write up a game review. After playing this game for a while, I must say not telling you all how great the game is would be ridiculous. Intro:Dominions 4 is a turn based strategy game created by a 2 man company Illwinter Game Design. The game places you in charge of one of MANY different nations in a struggle for global domination. The nation is lead by a powerful ""pretender god"" that you create prior to launching the game, who seeks to spread his/her dominion over the land. The developers based these factions around lore and culture of various peoples. A great example would be Mitlcan a tribal based kingdom that takes its roots from Aztec or another ancient Central or South American society. The nation has basic weapons but powerful magic that involves sacrificing blood slaves to use powerful blood magic against its enemies. There are also nations based around popular fiction such as the underwater nation Atlantis or Bandor Log who make you feel like the apes from ""Planet of the Apes"" etc. The developers release free updates to the game that include additional content! The manual is available to view online for free on their website just google it. For those who are interested you can even make your own maps to play on or write your own mods to use for the game. Free manual is available for modding & map design via developer website as well. The game does have an extremely steep learning curve as I have 253+ hours logged on steam playing mainly AI opponents, started playing with other players recently and I am being slaughtered. So I can honestly say its a deep and rewarding game you should try out. Beware it is one of those ""I will just take one more turn...."" kind of games and then next thing you know its 2am.Pros:*very deep game with unique nation selection across 3 eras*unique units based on nations and independent provinces conquered*very deep magic system that revolves around different types of mages who perform research to gain powerful spells*8 paths of magic with over 800 spells! sorcery contains astral, blood, nature, and death magic. While elemental magic is fire,water,air and earth. Each magic path has a gem that fuels its artifacts and powerful spells except blood which uses blood slaves.*Solid single player mode that lets you play a challenging AI but the game really shines in multiplayer that is usually played in a “play by email” format.*Active community that create new maps and mods, active developers who patch bugs and release additional content for free*the game is very replayable because of all the variety and the multiplayer aspect I could go on for days with the pros but I will call it hereCons, for me these aren’t really a big deal so they don’t take away from my experience but if I had to pick things out that gamers may not enjoy it would be:*graphics are a basic don’t expect any crazy animations or any cut scenes. One of the two devs does all the artwork a unit will have a regular animation and then an action animation that occurs when the unit attacks or casts a spell thats it.*the map actually makes you feel like you are looking at a real life map for the most part*combat is not real time you assign commands to your commanders and squads who will then perform those actions during combat, you will see the result of that after the fight has already been decided in a battle replayAs I stated I don’t actually mind any of the cons for me the game is great as designed. I hope you are scrolling up to the purchase button. I am interested in sharing more about this game because apparently I wrote up a short story as I ran out of room and had to really butcher the review. I will edit the review if I can host elsewhere. In the mean time check out this to learn more about the game

												TL;DR: Become a god. Crush other would-be gods with your armies, one turn at a time. Ignore the graphics.Long version:Dominions 4 has come a loooooong way.The Dominions series has evolved, and its forth iteration boils down to the exact same core mechanics as each of its predecessors. This is not a bad thing.Let me elaborate:As for the Background and story: The former ÜBER-God, called the ""Pantocrator"", is dead. And now the position is up for grabs by the rising gods, like You! But, lots of ""Pretender Gods"" claim godhod for themselfes and like you, they have marshalled a whole Nation to do their bidding.Traditionally, you recruit armies, and supplement that with powerful combat magics to decimate enemey armies and conquer their provinces. Add to that that your mages may also perform powerful rituals out of combat to do anything from summoning strong monsters to make everyone in the world age at the rate of a year a month. Watch them wither and die.Dominions 4 has other Victory options to supplement the traditional ""Conquer all"" approach. Several strategies are possible for most Victory conditions.Breaking down the Game in Pro's and Con'sPRO: DepthThe amount of material to go through is amazing. There are, literally, hundreds of different spells and rituals that can be researched and wielded by your mages. The amount of different troops availible to you ranges typically a dozen and more, not including summonend monsters. And the number of Factions you can choose is currently about 60, I think.PRO: ReplayabilityNot only are there a ton of factions you can play, and they all play differently, but also many factions allow for different strategies. ""Hmm, Marignon focused on troops was good, but what if I use fire magic instead...""Also, Depending on the size of the map used, the game plays totally different. PRO: MultiplayerMultiple variants are supported. From traditional ""Play by mail"" and hotseat to direct connection to a server.Single player can be considered ""training wheels"" for multiplayer, since this is where you will find the challenging plays.CON: GraphicsThey are bad. Old-timey at best. They also have evolved a lot and look way better than Dominions 3, but are not on par with current releases of major triple A titles.PRO: Mods.So many. So many. Toooooo many. Simple mods can tweak a Faction or a few troops. But total conversion mods exist too. And they add variety to NO END.CON: User InterfaceThe user interface is subject to current optimization. Playing the game without keyboard shortcuts is feasible, but it gets tedious. You will be thinking ""Why can't I order my mage to forge the same magic item every turn?"", you can, but only if you know or look up the keyboard shortcut.My conclusion is: As a hardcore strategy game fan, you should give it a try. If you consider yourself a ""casual"" gamer, this game probably will not be for you.			"

												I'm sorry people... It's not for me...I LOVE EVERYTHING out of this game. Really everything. I love its depth. I love its clear gameplay. I love that you have to take care of thousands of things. I love the fact you play a Pretender god with its mighty armies, crushing the infidels. What can be more epic than this? Nothing. I love it's music. I love its lore. I love the races... I really love everything. Even the graphics are cool. Sounds aren't (it's a pain playing with War Elephants...)This game has the potential to be the greatest and most famous Strategy Game in all times. But it won't be...It won't be for a very simple reason the UI is absolutely terrible. Within all the 4X / Grand strategy games I've never seen something like this...Imagine you're playing Hearts of Iron 2 or 3 for instance. I know they are RTS but still. Imagine now that you cannot pause more than once every In-game Day.- make sure no one invaded any region- make sure you are not attacked anywhere- make sure no troop is missing supply- make sure you're not running out of ressource- make sure your planes are not nearly destroyed- make sure no convoy is being attacked.- make sure you're fully making your researches etc.- make sure any other thing you make in HOI (thousands)Can you imagine the nightmare it would be?Why this comparison? In Hearts of Iron, you have thousands of things to think about. In order to make your life easier you are spammed by messages that you can carefully select on: to they pause game or not, is it shown in a separate square or just in the corner as a report. It's EXACTLY the same thing in Dominion except that you are given very few information on what is happening. And every turn LOADS of things happen and you can't make a single mistake or you will be punished like hell. And this is something I like. I like not having the right of missing something if I want to win.I'll give you an example of my first game:My empire is strong, well defended. No roaming armies. Strongholds near the bridges and mountain passes. Very cool.I'm at war with my neightbore. I gather 3 strong armies and start a grand campaign in order to invade it's major cities.And at one point. BHAM! A general has been killed by a spy. Army scatters. Enemy armies hunt them down and consolidate to counterattack my two other armies. And I lose...OK COOOOOOL. Next time I'll provide spies to my armies.2 hours of gameplay later. I gather 3 strong armies. Fully equiped heroes and my pretender God commanding another; Each army is followed by several spies. Not only their are followed by spies but equally spies are ahead in order to scout the territory.On ONE SIGNLE F****G turn I forgot to move the spy along with the general and on that very specific turn, the general is killed by an enemy spy. Distructing my entire campaign...This is starting to be annoying. Because, as I mentionned in the comment and uphere the tools you have in hand are extremely limited in comparison to what is asked to you.It's really like playing Civilization (way less deep than Dominions) but with almost no help at all concerning the actions you are doing:- auto movement for example is missing- you can see a list of heroes but you can't quickly see their gear or assess the situation in which they are. There is visually and information-wise nothing at all that allows you to do this (and I don't want to hear ""use F1"")By making those very simple things, the experience would clearly be enriched. And some other things too that do not require any further development:- use colors instead of flags to delimit each and every one empire. Sometimes flags are too similar. It's already an overwhelming game, why not making things more userfriendly?I mean.. Is it on purpose or what? I have the impression developers in this game said during their brainstorming meetings ""So you know what? No colors!! Let's put an additional flag on a already over-filled of pixels and information region (with fate, with armies, with temples, with threes etc) so that the player needs extra focus!!!!! It will a pain for him to conceptualize the size and borders of it's empire!!! Hahahahah""- use something nicer to provide the player with a quick look on the map of where are the heroes. Make them pop-up more clearly for god sake!!! F1 screen is useless... You anyway need to go over every single of your Hero to see: where he is on the Campaign map, what is the situation around him, what he is doing and if he is doing the good thing etc.Wouldn't it be better for example to use Sliders for heroes and leave the arrows on the screen so that you can assess all your orders and you can quickly see the stuff? ""No no no no it would be too nice to provide this to the player.""These are very small examples on how exhausting this game can be on larger scales. So imagine you need every single turn to:- go over about 20 to 40 events (battles, regional occupation, spells casted etc)- go over every of your hero to see: is the gear ok? Are the troops situation ok? Where he is? Where are it's spy colleagues? Are the spies doing to good thing? - go over every of your city to see: are the heroes summoning the good creatures? Are they researching? are they iddle? etc- go over your entire map to see: any roaming army? am I losing fate? - I created a new army: provide orders to the general, provide formation for every troop, provide a stance to every troop.And about 20 other things.And do this every turn.And a single game is counted in several hundreds of turns.Make a single mistale, forget to do one thing once and you're nearly screwed. Another example: for the 100'th time you gave all your armies the correct plannings for the battle, but once, you forgot to say to the general to stay behind the troops. Ooooops!! Too bad for you!!! The general went in suicide mission alone because you forgot to activate the correct stance.And this kind of mistake will happen because, I don't know about you, but I'm NOT a VBA Macro. I'm a human being that will forget something...There are too many things to do manually all the time. And all the time the same things you'll do a countless number of times just to conceptualize the empire situation. THAT IS NOT OK!!! Empire situation, as in any other game, should be clear at the FIRST sight... And only once the situation is assessed then the player can dig into the various possibilities at hand... It's NOT OK having to do the same things over and over just to understand what the situation is... Assessing the general situation should be effortless... But it's clearly not. So if such a basic thing is already requiring an effort since you don't see s**t on the map imagine the titanesque effort needed to assess the details...To the developpers, make something to make life easier. Still as punishing, still the same number of things you need to think about, but make it less overwhelming. Provide standard Army templates a player can save and then use after creating an army / before a battle or like a reminder: ""are you ok with your battle stance?""Another hint: it's turn based but why not, like any other 4X, during enemy turn: show the armies moving? Show a spy has been spotted? This way the player would conceptualize more quickly the situation. No no no. You don't see s**t about anything and you just have to read a bible size report of everything that happened instead...Again: no no no!!! such things would be too helpful or what????Things like this and this game would redefine, without improving the graphics, the 4X genre... And to potential buyers: this was my warning. If what I wrote doesn't really bother you and you're up to this incredible challenge, then you HAVE to buy this game and you'll end up with a real gemA REAL GEM, belive me despite my thumb down			"

												Picture vast armies of all kinds of little dudes fighting, killing and dying for you; possibly while you sacrifice their virgin daughters back home in unholy demonic rituals or just to make a nice pair of boots out of her skin; seriously.  Every single one of those little dudes has his own health sheet listing his age, experience and every lasting wound he has accumulated in your service.  See armies break from morale and be cut down from behind while the victors give chase.  Dare to open the battle data displays and watch the thousands of individual calculations and dice rolls that play out EVERY TURN for every single arrow and swing of a blade.Imagine the eye crossing micromanagement of all these armies, their commanders, their equipement, the commander's orders, orders for each unit/block of dudes...  The economy is at least simplified.  This is really about throwing piles of dudes at eachother, 1000 man armies get pretty crowded, beyond that is just messy and absurd.  And boots.  You may find yourself micromanaging entire sweatshops of individual production orders to gear up your commanders.  This is a game about too much complexity and micromangement unless that really floats your boat, like me.Rule your people.  Send them to die for your glory.  Eat them.  Sacrifice them in your temples.  Turn their women and children into horrid tentacle abomination cannon fodder for your armies.  Send commanders to kidnap their virgin daughters so you can turn them into boots.  Soft, youth sustaining, extra spring in your step boots.  Give them to her father on the front line, he'll never know.  The old veteran is dying of old age and you still have a use for him.			"

												One of the best turn based strategy game i've ever played for the last 25 years. I'm a long time strategy game fan and for me this was a hidden gem. I don't care about the graphics, this game is all about gameplay!The amount of depth and game mechanics is just amazing. The playable nations feel different and unique with their own characters. The item crafting is great to add extra power and customization to different leaders. And so many spells to cast! High learning curve, but i like that!Love the modding community and mapmakers, it gives the game that little bit extra flavour.And thank you Illwater for making this game, it shows you really understand what players like and how to make a great fantasy TBS.I truly recommend this game and i'm looking forward to another Dominions game.

												I'm not sure if they've actually fixed the AI to the point where it makes for a better tutor, but so long as you've got some people to PBEM with, this is a really, really, really good game.  Feels like a huge board game / tabletop RPG hybrid with terrific depth and no chance of knocking over all the tiny pieces. A game can sometimes last for for a very long time (depending on how it's set up and played) though players will be eliminated as it goes.Just pretend the graphics are crappy miniatures or cardboard counters or something, at least they're animated... if you can imagine a world where Caligula actually DID declare war on Poseidon and invaded the ocean, strategically speaking that's what we're dealing with here. It's fun to just sit and read the manual for half an hour and *scheme*.			"

												This game is AWESOME! Perhaps the most overlooked fantasy 4x game of all time. Don't let the mediocre sprite graphics fool you into thinking it's a bad game - it is perhaps the deepest, most detailed, and most complex fantasy 4x I have ever played. From designing your Pretender God to laying out your troop formations, your decisions have a very real impact in the style of game you will play and the options that are open to you.If you prefer style over substance, this game doesn't have the visual flash you're looking for. If you want a deep, rich, immersive game with many options to choose from, hundreds of spells, hundreds of unit types, incredible game design, imaginative civilizations drawn from mythology, this is your game.

												Dominions 4 is a Dungeon and Dragons guy's dream strategy game. You play as a Demigod, which can be a Manticore, an Antlion, a Cyclops, a Mummy, a Gorgon, a Dragon, a wide variety of Lich types or even as Dagon, Scorpion King or the Sphinx (or about a hundred other options)Your worshippers can be Lizardmen, Centaurs, Deep Ones, Ghosts, Troglodytes, Demons, Oni, Spider-Riders, Harpies, Hydras, Illithids (Mind Flayers), Minotaurs, Naga, Satyr, many many more. There are 82 playable races. Yes, eighty-two. The magic system is rich and highly customizable, with zillions of interesting spells. You can play each race many different ways depending on your magic decisions (did I mention there's 82 races?). Also, you can cast spells that create Gelatinous Cubes. If you ever enjoyed reading the Monster Manual, you will love this game, "

												This is hands down the best strategy game I have ever played. I got started with gaming on Age of Empires 1 and Starcraft. RTS and turn based strategy games have been some of my favorite genre's for about 15 years.Despite the fact that I've played one or two dozen such games extensively, nothing comes close to dominions 4.Although this game isn't for everyone, as it focuses very clearly on only one aspect of what would make a standard 4X strategy game, it does that one part of gameplay better than anything else by miles.What aspect is that? Combat. Everything revolves around crushing your oppenent in glorious combat, or erroding the his ability to fight with powerful magic. Dominions 4 has 78 unique nations. Although some nations keep their themes and gods through multiple ages slightly reducing diversity from what you might see with 78 totally different nations (the game has 3 ""ages"" it is played through, and many nations exist in multiple ages, but generally they transition to a different playstyle from age to age, with different mages and troops).The sheer number of nations alone makes for an incredible degree of variety and depth, but you can also customize a 'pretender' , the demi-god ruler of your nation. This can make for vast differences in gameplay giving each nations 1-3+ viable strategies, not counting meta-strategies you might employ versus a group of players you know well.We haven't even gotten to the good part yet though. The meat of the game is a powerful combat simulation engine that allows detailed troop formations, powerful magical spells, special monster units, and magical artifacts to be employed in battle. This provides enormous opportunities for you to turn the tide of battle with clever strategy and planning.On top of that, supplies and research do play a role. You can base strategies around researching powerful magics quickly, securing vast amounts of gold to build a powerful mundane army around, or raiding your opponent until they can no longer support their forces.Take a look at the hours I've put into this game. I'd say I'm intermediate skill level. I could play most any nation competently, although I haven't nearly played them all. You will always have more to try and learn in this game, and it's more than worth any price it's ever been on steam.			"

												Two gods had fallen today. Pretenders, not gods. Ctenophoros, the prophet of the Archmage, corrected himself. There had been no true gods since The Pantokrator had left this world. In his absence his former servants, wives, and adversaries shook off their shackles and began to reach for his thrones. How strange it had seemed back then, amongst the mystical giants and beasts and frightening monoliths, that the alien races of R'lyeh had chosen to worship a mere mortal. Stranger still that the stars had revealed to Ctenophoros that he was destined for victory.	In the early days, Ctenophoros had seriously considered if he had misjudged destiny. True, their early campaigns to subjugate the merfolk provinces had been a dramatic success, but no other pretenders cared for the deep ocean. Instead they fought bitter wars for control of the rich provinces and magical sites that lay further inland. The Archmage had thought it wiser to bide his time, research forgotten lore and fortify his treasury, while his rivals clawed at each other's throats.Then the undead of Ermor struck. R'lyeh had considered itself safe below the waves, but the skeletons and ghouls of Ermor had no need for air. Worse still, R'lyeh's Illithids found themselves unable to strike at these mindless creatures, and were cut down in droves. Only a desperate counter-attack of shark riders from the merfolk provinces was able to turn back the undead forces, but for five years, the Sea of Woe would be contested.The bitter stalemate extended to the nearby coast, where R'lyeh had founded mighty a castle. There, they began a recruiting campaign. Compared to Ilithids, human priests were frail, but their banishment spells would stop the undead just the same. The strategy worked, after a fashion. Ermor's undead knights had a nasty habit of cutting priests down like wheat, but soon the Archmage ordered whole contingents of hybrid soldiers (born of the surface mortals and Deep Ones) to accompany them.The tide had begun to turn, but when R'lyeh's forces marched into the newly-conquered land of Zenthra, they found a terrible surprise. The land was desolate, ruined, dead. Ctenophoros had remembered staring in awe at shear number of ghouls and skeletons who had attacked the Sea of Woe. How could Ermor have acquired so main bodies? As he looked at this newly-conquered wasteland, utterly devoid of life, he knew the terrible answer.They had retreated, of course. R'lyeh's armies would find only starvation there and Ermor still threaten the eastern sea. Ctenophoros thought the situation hopeless, but the Archmage had a plan. In his endless nights of study in his library on the ocean floor, he had learned the secrets of the Naiads. Now he called upon them. Together, they forged enchanted bags of near limitless supplies. And thus magically equipped, their armies began the offensive anew. The Naiads had also lent their expertise in the magical school of evocation, teaching R'lyeh's armies to wield torrents of cleansing waters to purge the undead from the land. They pressed onwards, towards the undead capital.To their surprise, Ermor was already under siege. The traitor princes (so called because they had abandoned Atlantis to serve R'lyeh) had summoned a massive army of fishmen and enslaved Atlanteans and had struck from the sea as Ctenophoros and his god had marched up the coast. But the undead don't starve, and R'lyeh could have no peace while Isis, the Neteret of many Names, still walked the earth.Ctenophoros' god, The Archmage had insisted on taking part in the assault. His body has frail, but every spellcaster was needed. He would remain safe at the rear of the army and rain elemental fury down on the fortress's defenders. It should have worked, and maybe nine times out of ten, it would have. But this time he caught an arrow in the chest and was dead before the troops reached the walls. His death sent the army into disarray—the Atlanteans routed. But The Archmage had been right about the need for mages. Cleansing water decimated the undead ranks until only Isis remained. She stood 20 feet high and possessed armaments and magic the likes of which had never been seen in R'lyeh. But in the end, she was just a pretender. And eventually, the hybrid soldier's spears struck true and Emor was conquered.Two pretenders had fallen, but they would not stay dead. So long as their faith held sway in this world they would return, soon or later. Ctenophoros hoped it would be later in Isis's case. Still, Ermor was not his largest concern. While R'lyeh was engaged in this bitter struggle for wastelands in the North, the Golem Cult of Agartha had come back from the brink of extinction to dominate the lands to the south. Troglodytes and terracotta warriors circled their southern borders greedily and spies had already been spotted in their lands. The Archmage had foreseen this war. The night before the assault on Ermor, he had given Ctenophoros an ancient scroll. Now, the prophet poured over this gift from his departed god—it was a summoning spell more complicated and terrible than anything had ever known. The Eater of the Dead, an amorphous mass of semi-liquified dead flesh. It was banished to the void by The Pantokrator before he left this world. And now, Ctenophoros had to the power to summon him back.			"

Posted: May 16, 2016
												I feel like I'm playing a very slightly retuned Dominions 3, but that's not a bad thing. Also, there are still no elves, and that's awesome.Dominions 4 is a turn-based fantasy strategy game that is about 99.985% substance and .015% style. The graphics endearingly suck, and that will turn more than a few people away, but a thorough check under the hood will reveal one of the most complicated and rewarding strategy experiences out there. Though it doesn't share all the features you may expect in your typical modern turn-based strategy game, the ones that it does have are taken to levels so unbelievably high that other games lose sight of it from their big-budget pedestals.If the music upon boot-up sounds familiar, you probably played Dominions 3. I think I've heard a few new tunes, but it seems that all the originals are back. Once again, retuned Dom3.Diplomacy is nonexistant, so don't expect any non-aggression pacts or trade and research agreements with the AI or with your friends. Although a form of coop has been added, it has a certain wonkiness to it that makes it a little less enjoyable than simply making secret alliances with other human players. Backstab, backstab, bacsktab!There are a ton of factions to choose from inside of 3 different ages of existence, all with many, many unit types serving many different purposes. I'm not going to try counting the number of unique units in this game, but it's definitely somewhere between holy crap and even more holy crap.Did I mention that in spite off all this variety there are no elves? That's a breath of fresh freaking air.The magic system is just as varied as the soldiers in your armies, and there are tons of spells ranging from useless to game-ending. Experimenting with magic and finding what works what needs a little adjustment, and what just accidentally killed your entire army is half the fun. Compile that with a single save file and you may develop a light case of paranoia. I did.If magic is the potatoes of this game, then combat is the steak, and it probably runs a bit different than what you may be used to. It involves a lot of indirect control and tactical trial and error. I'll admit it took some getting used to, and you will often find yourself wondering how your 400-something close-combat soldiers were scared off by a dozen elephants, but unexpected catastrophic defeats are all part of the fun. Just like when your fate conspires against you and a stray arrow takes your necromancer out of a fight, leaving your horde of undead to mindlessly scratch their butts while they're picked to pieces. There's so much to go into and so many hilarious stories, but you'll have plenty of opportunities to make your own. My biggest warning: If you played the ealier Dominions and could not get into the swing of it, don't expect this to change that wind's direction. It's more of the same, but the keyword here is 'more'. If it was more you wanted, it's what you got. And It was definitely what I wanted. Kudos!Lastly, Illwinter does sell a printed manual from their website. It's not necessary for the game, but it's certainly helpful. Mine is buried with notes already. http://www.illwinter.com/dom4/ "

												For what it may be lacking in graphics or sound effects and overall ""pizazz,"" Dominions makes up for in sheer depth. That is, I believe, a warning as well as a recommendation. If you're willing to delve into a manual that reads like the core rules for an old and convuluted tabletop wargame, Dominions is probably your bag. Otherwise...it probably isn't.The game has three ages, each with its own set of nations to play as, making the total something like 60. Some rise, some fall, and some change over the course of the timeline, so each Age has its own feel and mechanics. Each also has its own set of units. Some are generic, but there are literally thousands of unique units and monsters in the game.Also spells; I've seen RPG's with less involved magic systems. There are a hair over 800 castable spells and a fair number (200 or so at a guess) magical items to craft.The tactical combat is also quite deep. The player doesn't control it, but the player does organize their armies into formations and give them general orders. Which feels a bit more reasonable given the sheer scope the game can reach on larger maps.Also worth noting is that instead of a generic fantasy setting, the factions and races here are based mostly on different historical mythologies, so there's that to keep it interesting as well.TL;DR:Are you going to cry about having to read, a slightly unintuitive GUI, poor graphics, or lack of tactical control? Maybe give the first Sword of the Stars a go.Do you enjoy reading, find fairly complex games are your thing, and are perhaps used to pixel or even ASCII graphics or, better yet, just playing with paper and dice? Then I think Dominions may just be the Grand Strategy game you've been missing your whole life.			"

												You don't mind the presentation, the UI and that this game is as starter-friendly as advanced astrophysics? Good. Because I played round 300 hours of this game and I still don't grasp everything that happens. And I think I did not understand about anything til I put like 50 hours into it.If you are ready to do this - reading the extremely long manual over and over again, contemplate different aspects, ignoring the crappy graphics - then you are rewarded with one of the best Turn-based Strategy Games ever.This game has an insane amount of depth, so many spells, nations and units that it makes your head spin. Once you master the mechanics and this game unfolds you don't want to play any other game, because they are to simple.			"

												Without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played. A deep, complex and rewarding experience. Not since Dwarf Fortress had a game has totally captured my imagination and drawn me into fantastic worlds that exist only between my computer and my mind. This game has been crafted with a staggering attention to detail, the amount of hard work and love that has been put into this game shines clear on every playthrough. There is so much to be experienced and learned here, everything makes sense and feels realistic within the framework of this fantastical world, you never feel cheated when you lose or make mistakes, everything is your fault for not properly thinking about what you are doing. The multitude of fundamentally different playstyles, the ridiculous number of possibilities in empire building all serve to make this a game that I promise will suck you in and not let you go. This is a proper computer game, hand crafted with hard work and love, backed by an outstanding and friendly community. This game is definetly worth your time and dedication, if you are a fan of TBS, please give this beautifully crafted game a shot, more need to be made like it.			"

												The first thing you should know about this game is its not going to be easy. You're either going to love it or hate it. Approach this game the exact same way you would approach Dwarf Fortress because it is the magic turn-based strategy version of Dwarf Fortress.If you can get past the difficult to use UI, the mediocre graphics (better than DF though) and cliff-like learning curve, a gem of a game lies under.The premise is quite simple, you are a Demigod striving for full godhood and are competing with demigods. You get to craft your avatar to exactly your liking with a massive multitude of options available. The magic system and craft system in this game is quite complex which means you'll either love the depth of options or just flat out hate the confusion.This is a great game, but admittedly, is not for everyone (or even most people).

This game is like a hidden treasure. It's not easy to get to rewarding part but it is one of the best game when you start to get the hang of it. If you like 4X or Strategy games with a lot of depth this is a game to try.It may be unappealing at first due to the graphics and the UI that might not look very user friendly but the amount of keyboard shortcut makes it very easy to navigate through menus and such. There are numerous Let's Play and tutorials on Youtube to get a good idea of how to approach the game.Reading the Manual would always be useful but I would only recommand to read the nations part so you can find a nation you would like to play:You want to Play the Roman Empire ? -> Play Ermor in Early Age,Want to be a Viking God ? -> Play VanheimHow about having a Horde of Demons at your service ? -> Play one of the many blood nation as Berytos, Mictlan, Lanka, etc. and summon your demonic legions to start your unholy march onto the world. Unleash the divine justice with Shiny Knights lead by Paladins fighting the hordes of Undead and heretics ! -> Choose Marignon in Middle Age.Or maybe you prefer being the Undead yourself and swarm the world with the soul of long forgotten soldiers ? -> Ermor in Middle Age is here for you.Find The nation that represent best want you want to play. Then you can quickly search for a guide (or a let's play video) to have a rough idea of how the game works and then let's dive into this world and let the lore transport your imagination as your army conquers the world. Let your mage research more and more powerful spells or let them walk in your domain to find magic sites. Claim Thrones of ascension to gain more power and increase your Influence through the world.This game has an insane amount or replayability, it get more and more fun the more to know how it works.You can play Solo, multiplayer, Coop or PvP online or hotseat.You can find a good community of players on different forums to find scheduled MP games, there are tons of mods (but the game without any mod is enough, it's not mandatory) adding new content, new nations or modifying the game to your liking.To summarize:+ Great Strategic Game with a lot of Depth.+ Insane amount of Nations to play (Roughly 20+ nations per age, with 3 different ages).+ Deep lore taking root in historical nations or existing myth and legends from different cultures.+ High fantasy world, Elves, dwarves, undead, demons, humans, etc. pretty much everything you want is here.+ You'll never get enough of the game and you'll always try new crazy fun strategies.+ Random generated maps for more replayability.- Graphics and animations reduced to the lowest minimum. That's not really a Problem I think but needs to be mentioned.- Many keyboard shortcuts need to be learnt to really improve the quality of life. The game is So much easier to navigate and manipulate when you know them but it may take a bit of time.- A lot of information to learn the game. But once done, only the best part remains. The sweetest bits awaits you.			"

Posted: August 23, 2014
												Over the first few games I played I had a very difficult time winning even on the normal AI settings, partly because I was playing as Early Age Yomi faction which is highly regarded as one of the weakest nations in the whole game. After playing for about the 6th or 7th time with other factions I came to the realization that while the game is quite fun learning how it works and discovering all the options that are avalailable to you there are 2 key things that make this game falling a few steps short of greatness which I will point out later in this review. Now please note that this is my first Dominions title I've played and I have no prior knowledge or experience playing of any of the titles before it.First off let me say what I like about this game, and there's quite a lot to enjoy in such a involving strategy game such as this, but a few I like to mention are the amount of content and spells that is within the package and how each nation plus god that you play as feel worlds different from each other, with different nations having access to a variety of different units and even their own spells, for instance the Bakemono nation in the middle age has their own racial summons to summon Oni onto the world map. Even after all that variety with approximately a dozen of different nations for each age and leaders you can choose from the game is won only by acquiring a number (chosen at the start of the game) of different thrones of ascension that are scattered throughout the map which can have quite a significant impact on all nations nearby once they are claimed by a player. I won't go into the specifics on how they do so now as it would take a whole summary of the game to explain details in the game that are prominent and quite arduous to understand (such as how dominion works and how your empires influence spreads). Let's just say that when you acquire these thrones, apart from giving you additional resources in the form of mana crystals, they can make the lands that are surrounding them more arid, temperate, hot, cold, or even unlucky just by having someone in control of them which can cause a huge impact on your playstyle or how you strategize about future moves. Another thing I like is that when I lost battles I felt that it was my own fault for not paying attention and not giving orders to a commander or a unit, or to forget putting my units in better defensive positions to deal with the enemies units, and while the combat is automated I still felt I had control on the outcome of each battle, which is not an easy thing to do for a strategy game that encapsulates so many different tactics and decisions to be made. The last thing I would like to mention about the pros of this game is that while this game may ultimately seem complex to many new players, in actuality it is a really simple strategy game to learn as your primary concerns are conquering lands and claiming the thrones of ascension, but the amount of choices that you have to achieve that goal are massive.Now on to my opinions on the flaws of the game. The 2 greatest flaws this game has is the diplomacy aspect of the game and the balance of each nation. Now normally the balance of each nation wouldn't be an issue for me in a strategy game like this but considering the degree of difficulty that can scale based on the nations you play can be quite offputting ESPECIALLY for new players trying to grasp the concepts of the game. It took myself 3 failed games and numerous attempts at reading strategy guides to try and figure out what I was doing wrong to win as the yomi in the early age and after failing miserably I finally pursued playing another nation that apparently was much more powerful and won with relative ease without that much of any challenge minus a few times where I had left my lands undefended, or stupidly throwing all of my units in a nation's home base. But balance issues aside, the one thing that I absolutely wish that this game did a better job of is diplomacy, and while I haven't played a game with the Disciple mode (where one nation is a pretender god and other nations are that god's disciples) the game is primarily focused on combat and map positioning as opposed to diplomatic relations and tech trading. And while you can research a massive amount of spells it would seem that having the better units in the army trumps out any spell that you can research midway throughout the game . Now I may be wrong on this for later spells that are high-end, but for every instance that I've played the spells that are cast in combat usually are a minor thing to worry about as opposed to whoever has the better quality and quantity of troops in battle. There are no peace treaties that you can formulate with other nations and one is forced to solve every situation in the game militaristically by conquering their neighbors and fighting for the thrones of ascension , which can be fun for while, but it leaves something to be desired. For instance, after around the 100th turn of a game or so I will still have some of the same enemies that I have dealt with handily since the start of the game that are still pestering me, and it gets kinda worn and laborious to cycle between creating troops, sending troops, and defending. Although I have only played on a Normal difficulty setting, the A.I. doesn't actively try to win the game by going straight for thrones of ascension but rather conquer lesser defended provinces of the player which is a decent enough strategy, but I feel is not realistic enough because any human  player would immediately try to go for the victory points with as many units they have from the get go. All in all Dominions 4 was worth my hard earned cash, as I have no gripes about the graphics (as I really don't care about how a game looks) or my experiences with the game and I do expect to play more of it in the future but probably on higher difficulty settings. But as I said at the beginning of this review, what stops this game from achieving greatness in my eyes is the fact that there are no diplomatic relations that you can have with the other nations and there are nations that are drastically better suited for winning the game than others.

												In Dominions 4, you play a pretender god, seeking ascension to fullblown deityhood.  It is a strategy game, with armies, regions, castles, and research, although I don't think many players would go so far to call it a full-blown 4X.  Maps are designed, rather than generated procedurally; diplomacy is remarkably limited; economic growth is streamlined to and past the point of CA games.The short version of the review is that D4 is clearly a labor of love from an amateur developer with serious problems in presentation and interface.  Even if D4 is your cup of tea-- which it won't be for most-- this is not a game worth the asking price.So before we get to what's bad, let's talk about what's good.  If you want variety, D4 has it.  There are a vast number of pretender gods to choose from, and each customizable from there, 3 eras each with 15 or so different factions, and each faction has a good supply of units to build, including heroes.  But the real variety comes from the spell book.  The number of spells may very well approach 1000.  Just a handful of those spells in the construction school allow you to build innumerable magic items.But this vast variety is one of the failings of D4.  How many different spells protecting against fire need to exist?  How many different missile spells?  With D4, things are either unbearably streamlined (travel, growth) or else abstraction of mechanics is ignored completely (spells, magic items).  Consider D4's units.  When you open up your recruitment window, you're going to be greeted by as many unit descriptions as you'd ever enjoy reading-- and with each region conquered, you'll discover more.  Yet the actual differences between these units are slight and difficult to puzzle out.  Oftentimes, not even the unit's name is changed between two incarnations.  Some stats are byzantine and presented in great detail while I was never able to find other, more important statistics like size.So how do you play D4 well?  Part of it is via an encyclopediac knowledge of the game system.  And a large part of that is through watching presentations of battles.  With each battle, you're supposed to see how the system works.  These battles are repetitive, barely more dynamic than damage numbers floating from people's heads, and painfully slow to watch.  Yet you're not going to get good at D4 without watching a great number of these.  D4's tactical system combines the interactivity of autoresolve with the mind-numbing tedium of watching grass grow.The problems in D4's design are compounded by graphics that would be appropriate to the 486 era and interface issues.  There isn't much to say about the graphics beyond the fact that they're bad, but I can talk about the interface issues.The first thing you'll notice is that D4 decided to go its own way with regards to standards set by other strategy games in regards to rmb/lmb role, and for no apparent reason.  This is frustrating, particularly since the interface will easily cancel your orders anytime you get it wrong, without any warning.  Still, one can adapt.  Heroes frequently decide to stop doing what you told them to, so you're going to have to babysit them, but the only way I found to check on my heroes wasn't with a hotkey nor a button, nor a menu, but a submenu.  If you can't do something right now, the game isn't going to tell you that it can be done, and definitely not why you can't do it right now, although there's little consistency to this-- there are exceptions.  Winning battles is all about understanding unit capabilities (remember how many there are), yet the vision/intelligence system gives you no way to check these units' statistics until you actually fight.  Can your forty troglodytes take on the three winged bathyor?  There is no way to find out beyond trying.  Overall, you have a game that absorbs a lot of attention in small, unimportant details while the really important things are never presented with the weight they deserve.I haven't fully explored the depths of Dominions 4.  There may very well be parts of an interesting game buried underneath there.  What is clear is that it would take me several hundred hours to be able to find out whether D4 is even worth playing, and that even then, problems with interface, presentation, and balance would remain.  I can't recommend this game, not when so many superior choices, in the same genre, at the same price, exist.			"

												This game had simply overshadowed eveything I played in the TBS genre. Everything from Civ I to Alpha Centauri, and all the modern releases. It may not be much of a looker, but this has the depth and breadth that takes the breath away. Magnificent. Truly.More people need to know about this game, becuase they just might find that which they always wanted. By not putting emphasis on the visal fidelity, the game is able to such variety to the mechanics and unit types that will keep you busy for years to come. I have not been excited about a game in my life, and I have been playing for something like 20 years.			"

												Dominions is a difficult game to rate, in part because it is borderline impossible to fully experiance. With nearly 100 factions divided over 3 eras a player would have to play hundreds of games to get the complete experiance of the game. Additionally multiplayer matches are  long experiances. A turn a day turns into a turn a week. Eventually you can get a feel for the magic spells, the units, the complex interactions of the many special abilities. But even then there are countless magic sites, random events that can change strategies and open new oportunities, Dozen's of alternate starting configurations that can completely change the dynamic of the game and finally randomly generated maps just in case the 20 or so hand crafted ones are becoming repetitive. What this creates is an enigmatic, and content rich game that gives the impression of being mechanically complex. Is it balanced? pff, I only have around 500 hours on it. I barely can make it to endgame. balance and metagaming is something that should be reserved once you master the basics. I don't even know if I am there yet. Maybe I am just bad at strategy, and maybe I overestimate the complexity. But hopefully my ramblings have helped you understand the game.			"

												I generally wouldn't recommend to anyone, unless they say ""bah, TBS games are so easy"", or ""bah, strategy games are so 1990's"" (while graphically I'd have to agree). Dominions 4 is so complex, noone has even attempted to make a wiki. There's a manual, written by the developpers, which in printed form is a 400 page book. This is a combination of Magic the Gathering (ie, the card game, with all it's complexities), and Civilization. I'm on my 10th game, I'm cheating, and I'm still getting my♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked. Also, the graphics and UI just suck. The game is very very stable though. :)-Vespy "

												Improvement over previous installment. Disciples and ascension of thrones brings new flavor to the game. One of the best indie games I've ever played and used countless of hours before this was released in Steam. However this game isn't for everyone, so I recommend watching few let's plays or gameplay footage before buying. This isn't the cheapest indie game out there, but personally I would say it worth it when comparing to many other indie games in Steam at same price range.Also if you own Dominions 3 already, I would hold on for a sale unless if you are into Multiplayer scene. This isn't vast improvement over Dom 3 even if it adds nice new features.			"

												This is one of the most involving strategy games i've ever played. The graphics might seem bad, and at the start of the game, you wont understand anything at all, but no worries! Look up the tutorial, check some playthroughs, and test stuff out. This game isnt for those who want instant action though, its for people who like boardgames like chess or risk, or enjoy games like civilization and those where you may have to use hours just thinking out ONE round. ""Did i remember this, did i remember that?"" Be ready for a LOT of micromanagement!After one hour in the game, i thought ""How can THIS be worth more than 10$??"" After ten hours in the game, i wondered how they could sell a game like this, as cheap as this.If you want a game to put a lot of time into, then this is for you. Though, if you're more interested in games like battlefield, COD, etc. for instant action. Then stay away, as you will get bored after ten minutes.Overall, i'd give this game 8/10 due to gameplay. Not higher because it might get a bit boring and repeative at times. The graphics isnt really helping it much either, the battles could have looked a bit prettier, everything else looks and feels great.			"

												This game is the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ seriously. So when you start the game, you get to pick what era you want to play in. Early, middle and late. Some factions only exist in one era, and some change from era to era, Ermor is basically the roman empire in early era and an undead ashen empire in middle era.Anyway, so you got all these cool factions to choose from with awesome lore and backstory, there's like at least +30 factions and they all have unique units and spells. You get to create a pretender god that's basically your king, you pick his physical form, his proficiency in the different schools of magic (Death, Fire, Earth, Air etc) and the effects your god has on your dominion.You got soldiers and you got commanders, commanders lead armies, perform rituals, build buildings, move around on the map, and they can also forge and equip items and search for magic sites in your realm. In this way Dominions 4 has an awesome RPG system, your commanders got stats and traits that affect a lot of things, not only their attributes. For example, there's an item for Ermor that allows my commander to summon 3 lictors for the price of one if I have it equipped. Some items let your armies and commander travel under water or fly. All sorts of cool♥♥♥♥♥♥The empire management is awesome, you allocate commanders to research, forge items, lead armies, you search for magic sites that give you gems and other positive effects (or negative). You don't control the battles directly, but you do get to line up your armies, pick formation, give them orders (Attack rear, attack closest, stay behind troops etc etc) so you do have influence over the lineup and such.I need to play this more but I find it the most fun to play with a human player, it adds challenge and is just fun overal.10/10 would reccomend.

												In Dominions 4, you play a pretender god who has risen up to claim the spot of Pantokrator, after the last one dissapeared for reasons unknown. There are others however who wish to take that spot, and only whoever proves themselves the most worthy will take the place as the god above all gods!Dominions 4 is a grand strategy game with a few interesting twists. First of all, you are a god, and as gods are, you need worship to survive and become the one true god! Second of all, unlike other grand strategy games, you don't give orders to troops directly during combat. You give them a set of orders and tactics to use when combat begins, as if you were commanding an actual army of troops. Finally, magic is a ever-present necessity in any age, and a great deal of magic requires the use of magic gems. Magic gems are an incredibly compressed form of magic, and even a single one can unleash a great deal of power to an experienced mage.Pros:+ Customizability allows for a variety of different playstyles for each nation.+ 75 nations to play, if you count all three ages.+ Has a modding community supported by the devs.+ Has a great depth of strategy, coupled with a large library of spells to bolster any tactics you choose.+ Great deal of replayability, since only a few nations are identical to each other, and the ones that are is intentional.Cons:- The learning curve is quite steep, but there's a manual to help on their website. It's about 100 pages long, but the vast majority is just listing artifacts and spells.- Can get very tedious with alotting magic gems and artifacts to units each turn.- Games tend to be very long, and on very large maps, a turn can take upwards of 15 minutes.Verdict: The price is a bit high, but if you're a fan of the grand strategy genre, and want some fantasy to spice up your library, this is a great game!

												Just a crazy great game if you like complicated strategy. Zillions of units and spells and factions. Much of the fun is learning what works and what doesn't, what's useful, what isn't. A valid criticism is that 80% of the units and items could be dropped and you wouldn't care because they're not terrible useful, but even using the 20% that are useful leaves a ton of stuff to explore.The battle scripting is fiddly. The AI can't handle late game strategies. There are some clearly broken or over powered options in single player. Yea...so what :), it's still lots of fun. You'll need to set challenges for yourself, like purposefully using underpowered races or less than optimal pretenders. Many folks will say it's really only a multi player game due to those limitations, but I put 600+ hours into it only in single player so there's plenty of bang for the buck without multiplayer.			"

The depth is incredible, but the basics are so easy to learn that you can explore the expansive depths of strategic options at your own pace and without feeling like you're missing out by not already knowing it all.Limitless undead hordes, ice giants decked out in magical gear, bird people, and a dozen or more other nations... add countless options for magic, your god's dominion, and plenty of rules options, and you've got a game that you can play for years without getting bored.

												Whelp. First time I opened it it looked neat, seemed to have some depth, old graphics but whatever, and then closed it to play old favourites.Second time I opened it I stayed for 40 hours. The combinations, the spells, the equipment, the everything in this game is phenomenal. Sometimes great depth like this comes with complexity, too much. Not this time. Everything is easy to multi select, easy to manipulate, easy to configure, easy to trade, easy to do everything. So refined. Need info on something, just click it. I can't recommend this game enough if you like strategy games at all. The battles are an utter delight. Where and how you place your units can mean little in some engagements, and everything in others. They are extremly unpredictable and in the best of ways. There will be plenty of other pro and con lists to browse, so I won't do that, or give this game numbers. If you can get past the initial graphics question it's a solid keeper with tons of fun still left in it. I can see playing rounds of this in 10 years from now, something that isn't true of plenty of other games.Get it wont regret it.			"

												Geez....what can I say about Dominions 4? Let's start with the ingredient list:1. A bunch of hand drawn cartoonish maps 2. Tons of tiny, simple pixel sprites3. A battle animation sequence that looks like it comes from an overheated Nintendo in 19894. The best sountrack you'll ever hear in a PC game 5. CrackMix all these together and, oddly enough, you end up with one of the most satisfying strategy games I've ever experienced. Maybe it's the stunning amount of content, literally hundreds of spells, weapons, and items. There are tons of unique races, each with their own developed lore and play style. You create your own customized pretender god and lead your pixel hordes to world conquest, spreading your religion and snuffing out belief in any god other than you. The game's learning curve seems intimidating. The tutorial requires you to read the manual while you play, which is weird and off-putting; but if you do it, you'll be proficiently navigating the interface in no time.It's a storyteller's game that will spark your imagination, and occupy your thoughts long after you shut your computer off.

												Do not take my ""Hours Played"" seriously!  I originally purchased on Desura to get this earlier and have invested at least 100 hours on that version!  I like this game so much, I actually bought it again when it came out on Steam (before Desura offered Steam keys!!).If you've played Dom3, you already intend to buy it and I can recommend it whole-heartedly; if you're on the fence, let's hit the wavetops, shall we?+A superior rendition of the Heroes of Might and Magic idea of world-conquest in a fantasy realm for the following reasons:1)Larger worlds with actual terrain bonuses/negatives based on your race.2)CUSTOM RACES!  Build your own empire bonuses and leader/god (lower case) to meet your style of play.3)Huge variety of units, spells, and gear to give your generals!  You can hire, research, or smith to your heart's content, getting immersed in the RPG-style character management, the tactical setup, or the strategic conquest!4)4X style game that allows for massive multiplayer engagements without feeling cumbersome.  Team up with your friends to take on as many CPU enemies as you like, or crush them as well.  Setup is very customizeable and there are different game modes and victory conditions to meet.5)What other game lets you equip a water-breathing amulet and ambush your foes with a hand-picked team of crack troops lead by a Titan from the sea they thought you couldn't cross?This game has serious depth, but can be adequately played and enjoyed whilst learning it.  AI difficulty can be tweaked, numbers can be adjusted, and the sheer number of races split over 3 different ages (each has an iteration in one of 3 time periods, evolving to meet the slow loss of magical presence in the world), make for a game that has endless replayability and is quite accessible.Do not let the graphics fool you, the gameplay is top-notch 4X gold that has been refined over 3 sequels.  A welcome addition to any gamer's collection.  Recommended if you like 4X games, turn-based strategy, HoMM, King's Bounty, or like games that have depth worthy of investigating, should you pursue them.			"

												This is hands down the best strategy game I ever played, and I have played quite a lot of them. Virtually unlimited variety and strategic depth keeps me coming back for more for a few years now. In a Dominions multiplayer game everything can happen, and your opponents are always coming up with clever ways to defeat your strategy that you thought was unbeatable. Another big argument in favor of this game is the rich lore that was put into the 50+ different nations you can play. It is not based only on commonplace pop culture influences like so many other fantasy games around, but in real world history and mythologies.On the other hand, if you are not interested in multiplayer, the game is not nearly as exciting, since even the most advanced AI engineering in the world wouldn't be able to handle the game's intricacies. After a while, at least for me, single player became mostly a testing ground for new strategies. So yes, that's a downside of the game, but which complex strategy game has decent enough AI to keep you on your toes for years? None.Other downsides I can think of are the outdated graphics (about which I personally couldn't care less) and the sometimes awkward UI. But the game is still occasionally updated, not only with new content, but also with AI and UI improvements, which is always very welcome.So yeah, if you're into a strategically complex set in a rich fantasy setting and don't care about AAA graphics slowing down loading times, there's no better game in my opinion. Go for it.			"

Also the community is really quite good.- In-depth tactical battle system.- An interesting magic system that encourages experimentation with combining spell effects.Cons - Lo fi graphics. For me they became endearing but not to everyone’s liking.- A sometimes obtuse user interface.- High learning curve.- Poor AI for single player. The single player game experience is a pale shadow of the multiplayer game. Over all score - As multiplayer - 9/10As single player - 7/10 "

												What this game may lack in graphics and animations, it makes up for it in depth.  Even on similar maps, with familiar nations, the game always feels like a new story.  I have also spent plenty of time (outside of the game) researching and learning about the various nations and enjoyed every minute of it.  If you enjoy exploring the mechanics that drive a game, how those mechanics are interwoven with a story (one that you largely create), and can look past the simple presentation, Dominions 4 is a fantastic game.Illwinter is also a very commited developer and actively supports their games years after release.

												I played a lot in beta and was just reminiscing. I played three (3) games online in ~12 player games with complete strangers and it dominated about 2 months of my life. Maybe 200 hours in-game but it consumed me. I devoured the manual, lurked on forums and chat rooms, practiced against the AI, stabbed someone in the back. I had trouble sleeping. It was the whole 2 months. Like real world events, the scene unfolded slowly day by day and I was completely absorbed.In some ways it's an unspeakably good game and, as many have written, outshines its obvious flaws through depth. However, I would caution that the multiplayer element is integral and that it takes a kind of obsession or whirlwind to appreciate. I don't know what the communities are like now and haven't really played since release, but it was an extremely impactful and fulfilling experience due in large part to the structure and luxurious detail of the game.

												This game is almost everything I've ever wanted in an RTS. I don't need crazy graphics to lull me into a false sense of having fun. I'd rather have cool mechanics and good game play. It does have a bit of a learning curve and finding information online is hard, but just like any board game you've ever loved, once you figure it out it's a blast. The only thing that's missing is being able to design your own nation. But, I suspect there's either  a mod or an option out there I haven't seen yet as I'm still digging through all this game has to offer. I will be pretty much wasting a massive amount of my life on this game and I'm totally ok with that! :D This is hands down my favorite RTS so far.			"

												This game is absolutely great. It allows for incredibly in-depth strategy with a large variety of interesting factions and mechanics. Only in Dominons 4 can you sacrifice a bunch of blood slaves in an attempt to crossbreed the ultimate warrior. 10/10.Update: I recently had an epic experience that I posted on the discussion board, and people said I should at it as a review. So here it is.How Heroes are MadeEarlier tonight, one of the most epic occurences I have ever seen in a video game occured. Seeing that as a sign of a good game and also worth telling about, I decided to post here for your reading pleasure. Since it is only due to a confusing chain of events that this occured, I'm going to tell the full story from start to finish. Enjoy.Recently I started a MA game with my friend. It was Agartha and Pangea (me and my friend) up against 6 other pairs ( Ermor and Arcosephale, Ashdod and Nazca, Tien Chi and Caelum, Eriu and Ulm, Asphodel and Vanarus, Sceleria and Man ). Settings were for a long enjoyable coop game against the AI, with story events, conquest all, clustered spawns, and common random events. To start, we are luckily positioned with the one sea as our northern border ( the map had full wraparound), and mountains close by. We expand quickly and have a nice lump of land before we begin having conflicts with our neighbors, Ermor to the west and Ashdod/Nazca to the south. Im forced to support my Pangean friend with large blocks of Agarthan infantry supported with living statues so we can push back the enemies to the south. During the delay, Ermor casts a global enchantment, Burden of Time. Realizing the issues with all of our units dying of old age, we immediatly leave a small border garrison and charge our resources at Ermor. The endless legion combined with the death 3 provinces causes massive attrition, wearing our armies down to nothing and resulting in the deaths of my top commanders, excpet for one, Ernst, the Cave Captain. He has already aged to 45 / 50 from the Global Enchantment, so I prepare a suicide battalion of my remaining elderly units to rush Ermor and slay their god to end the enchantment. In a long battle across Ermor, I manage to corner and kill him in their capital. In the mean time, I've also rushed my way into Blood Magic to unlock Boots of Youth, which Ernst gets at the ripe age of 49, 1 year before old age. The Encantment is dispelled, but most players without undead focus have been crippled from its effects. My researchers are all diseased and my armies crippled. Ernst and only a few other commanders were given boots in time, the rest being too wounded to salvage. I recruit new generals, one of which being Aripert. The game is peacful for a time, but soon Ashopdel begins attacking. Im ready. Aripert and Ernst lead a combined force of over 400 Agarthan infantry, supported by foul spawn and living statues. Ashopdel is crushed, but their ally Vanarus pushes me back, killing most of my army. My commanders retreat, and I get a story event at my capital. A band of adventurers has joined the cause. I put them to good use as supporting commanders and mages for Aripert and Ernst. I launch a new attack at Ashopdel and Vanarus, killing the former and sieging the latter. My ally in the meantime has been fighting the war from the opposite side, and we meet together at Vanarus's capital. I storm first, Ernst, Aripert, and adveturers as commanders, a a vangaurd of Agarthan Living Statues in the front, foul spawn on the flanks, and Agarthan infantry in the core. The battle is brutal, with the archer towers killing 2 of my 6 adventurers, and my force being hit with many spells. Inside the fort is Vanarus' God, the Son of Fenrir. My own commanders have reached hall of fame status with 4 EXP and a heroic ability each. The battle rages, and I notice the adventures have been casting Nature 2 spells Enlarge and Enrage on my commanders. Suddenly, my small Cave Captains Ernst and Aripert have turned into size 4 killing machines, but are unable to get into combat. Eventually, morale breaks in both sides, and the mages run off the fields. My statues and the enemy elementals collapse into dust, leaving our core infantry to fight. The Son of Fenrir enters combat with his wolves, decimating my men while their men are whittled away by my more tanky infantry. The core infantry of their side routes, but mine route aswell after slaying the wolve body guards of their pretender god. All thats left are Ernst and Aripert, leading the charge alone. Against a god. With 200 hp. and Regen. I prepare for the worst, and to my astonishment Ernst strikes their god down with his enchanted Sword of Swiftness, with Aripert supporting. Vanarus was knocked out of the game, and a basic Cave Captain recruiting for a suicide mission many years ago had slain a god.			"

												Dominions 4 is a strategy game with no single-player campaign. It's all based around huge-scale single wars with the goal of becoming chief God, in single or multiplayer, that just escalate in scale as they go on. What starts with armies of dozens stabbing with swords and flinging basic magic spells like flickers of fire soon escalates into hundreds and thousands of troops clashing, with mythical beasts of various origins roaring and rampaging as ancient wizards call down great storms that rock nations.The gameplay involves managing your nation. After designing your pretender God you choose what to recruit with recruitables divided between normal troops and commanders who can control different amounts of troops. It's a little more complicated with that but the game is easy to pick up. You then direct your commanders across a world map, taking over, reinforcing and just conquering the whole damn world.There is a lot of variety in what you can play and how you can play. You choose from playing in the early ages, middle ages or late ages. The later the setting, the less magic there is in the world but the more advanced technology is. Playable nations come from a huge variety of influences. Some are historical, some mythological, some fictional and others more original. Only in this game can you play Three Kingdoms-era China battling a Lovecraftian army of horrors.Overall, it's a very deep game but easy to pick up, with tons of content that any strategy fan should pick up!

												This game is not for everyone. If you like fast paced games, don't buy. If you dont like steep, steep learning curves... don't buy. If you like beautiful graphics don't buy. If you dont like turn by turn... you get the idea.If you love diversity, replayability, and hours and hours of gameplay for a single game, with hundreds of races, hundeds of spells and thousands of troops, learning curve so high that even years after playing and searching the forum you learn new techniques that make you want to restart, if you are a strategy geek and you want the best there is in terms of gameplay with a twist of fantasy and magic, heroes and countries to conquer.. if you want to be a god... this title is definatly for you!!!Mltiplayer takes you to an entirely new level. Now this is my only downside to the game... multiplayer is by far the best experience ever, but the time/difficulty to join or create  a game is frustrating... and I end up playing single player becaue I just cant be bothered to spend so much time finding a multiplayer game.Dont be offset by the graphics, its really not what this game is about, think of it in terms of a board game, a really, really complex yet enjoable board game where you strategy to beat your opponents are so diverse, thet the entire game is about finding counters and opening using different tequniques, units and spells. Earthquakes of firestorms, awe or poison, flaming arrows or undead elephants, summon demon riders or archangels, go economy or blood sacrifices, dominion kill or assassination, compete in death matches or forge powerful magic items to choose rom 8 different elemental forces, each with specific reqirments and unique powers, use flying units or underwater units, choose a powerful fighting god or a researcher, awake or asleep for more points to your empire, and it goes on and on.... I just scratched the surface of endless possibilities... "

												A very enjoyable game to learn how to play. However there are times where as a player it can be frustrating trying to understand what certain things do. Indeed there are scenarios that crop up that confuse veterans of the game now and again.A quick pros, mos and consPros:Massive customisation available in god creation stageStrategies can be altered mid-gameCute graphics for different units, and there are many of themNations feel very unique, they all have their own niches, and there are many of them.Game devs still adapt the game even after all this time.Randomisation in map creation leads to unique game scenariosMos: (neither a pro or a con but something I think a new player must know, must know = mo)_Battles are scripted beforehand, you cannot interact with them while they are in progress. But you can watch the replay and learn from your mistakes or successes._God creation is important, if you pick a bad set of scales before the game properly starts you could find yourself in a difficult situation with no way to escape the situation. Don't be afraid to start a few test games to make sure exactly what plan you have in mind for the units you will be working with._Not all spells are equal. Especially when considering the variety of unit types. Some spells don't work underwater, some don't affect mindless, undead and some simply cannot be cast without communions or blood slaves. Cons:Graphics are super dated, although they're very cute for what they are. Sound effects can be a little loud at times. Snakes and archers have the sound dialled up to 11.Information overload is a big problem. Guides are a must. I would recommend watching a playthrough. Information availability can be a problem too. Sometimes there are questions I have that simply bring up no search results.The sheer variety of nations and spells and units can be a challenge to keep in mind.Due to the massive variance in the nations and starting conditions game balance may not always be ideal.Underwater combat can feel a bit limited in variety and some underwater nations do require a bit of game experience before attempting to play. Random babble:Things like figuring out encumberance (spell/melee encumberence is a big deal), what curses do and how important reinvigoration is can trip you up. For instance units with ""cold blooded"" fighting in cold climates suffer an encumberance penalty when fighting in cold terrain, to the point where in very cold climates these units are a liability.Or if you click on the ""Morale"" in the unit card this brings up the unit upkeep, which is how much the unit costs per year. Kind of a big deal when figuring out why a unit costs a certain amount. This vital info is just tucked away under a little word.Or that Undead seem great right? high morale (basically unbreakable), no upkeep and can go underwater...riiight up until you hit an enemy who uses priests, then all those undead summons get banished into nothing. One size does not fit all. (However with the right build you can totally make undead nations work. Watch out for multiplayer with them though, due to their dominion killing population other players generally want to kill them quick)This is a game of layers. Once you figure out one layer a dozen more lie beneath. However once you figure out ideal paths for your god, scripts for unit combat, what gear you need and research goals the game is fairly straightforward. The rest comes down to good old fashioned strategy, (depending on if you play multiplayer or singleplayer this will differ significantly).Due to how much you have to micomanage everything your strategy can change quite drastically and thanks to the  massive number of spells available you will be able to adapt how you play. The rest comes down to how much time you have to spare.The game really shines in how you use your mages and thugs. Also not all Gods (or Pretender gods) are equal, some are designed to be combat monsters from turn 1, others are designed to support your nation from behind the curtain while other still lie imprisoned waiting for the time to come into the world. There are valid reasons to use each of them. It's a God game of god games, you control everything and yet when the battles come all you can do is watch. It can be very rewarding watching all that time you spend preparing scripts for your units come together at just the right moment.For all that it's not a difficult game, it really isn't. It's just a matter of having the time spare to learn what you need to know. If you have that time this game will take you on an adventure that novel writers and film makers could only dream of.			"

												If you are looking for a very elaborated fantacy strategy game, I would recommend this. In short, gameplay is excellent while the graphic/music is really bad in the year 2014. The current US$35 price is a bit too much so I would highly recommend it during a sales. Gameplay: First of all, there are so many nations to be chosen from. For example, in ""Early Age"" setting, there are currently (""currently"" because the Dev just added one new nation in a Nov 2014 patch) 29 nations each with different troops (some nations share the same troops because of the fantacy setting) and starting magic strength. As for magic, there are 8 types in total (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Nature, Death, Astral, and Blood) while the research for spells are divided by schools instead of type (except for ""Blood"", which is both a school and type of magic) so that you can't really too concentrate your research on one school while ignoring the others. As for buildings, there are only a few; I guess the Dev want you to spend gold on troops than fancy buildings. Last but not least, there are hereos for each nation and generic heroes to be summoned by spells. When there are heroes available, you certainly want to equip them with fancy equipments... and yes... there are so many you can build as long as you have researched the magic school level and the magic resources. Although they are called ""Heroes"", they aren't invincible even if they have reached a high experience level or even if you teach them very high magic level. It is because experience only adds small increment to their combat skills while high magic level requires substantial investment and casting stronger magic creates alot more fatique (high fatique can kill them) to the hero. Further, you can't exactly revive heroes in Dominions 4, you can only bring them back as ""mummy"" which is a undead hero. If you want to check how many nations, spells, or equipments, you can read the manual from its official website. Graphic/music:The graphic is really 2008 and there are only like 4 or 5 music in the game. Therefore, please do no expect too much.			"

												Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension brings me back to my younger days of playing strategic board games with the added bonus of godhood and divinity. In the game you control a pretender god and its respective nation of worshipers. Various thrones of ascension exist (based on how you configure the scenario) in different locations around the world map. By claiming enough thrones before the other pretender gods you can attain victory. Each nation has its own units, pretender gods, priest units, magical units and traits. Want to be a Cthulu-esque monstrosity which ushers its amphibious armies from the depths? Do it! Want to be a peace loving and fair deity skilled in the magics of nature? You got it! Forge magical items for your generals and prophets? Spread your dominion to all corners of the globe? Do you want to conduct sacrifices for different benefits? All of these things and more are possible. The game is not perfect, however, as the graphics are dated. And that is being very generous with my wording. I, however, with a deep love of grand strategy and fantasy have found the hours I've explored this game to be quite rewarding. If you enjoy grand strategy and are willing to invest time in swinging through a slightly steep learning curve then don't pass up this hidden gem. And, as always, support games that are more than just products. They are art! Cheers and good luck on your path to godhood!EDIT: I also wanted to highly recommend the map entitled ""Valanis."" It is a user created map that is simply beautiful and intriguing. Happy gaming!			"

Posted: July 20, 2016
												600 hours in almost 3 years :-)    Before I have tried multiplayer I have never even read the tutorial or visited the forums. Basically that meant that I have played it using only the most obvious magic ( e.g. fireballs, summon elementals and such ) and concentrated on learning troop strengths + weaknesses and developing battlefield tactics. I've propably spend 200 hours playing one nation in one age: Machaka in middle age. Why? It was one of the first I have tried and it had Zulu like warriors riding giant, no sorry GIANT Tarantulas. I've read many reviews and nobody writes about the terrifing noice those tarrantuals make, when they chomp their victims...Or how almost every spell has its own sound so the battle is like a strange symphony :-)    Other things people don't mention:1.The developers are commited to make the game even more deep and complex, BUT they are also commited to cut on micromanagement where only possible, for example: to reaserch magic, to buy a new mage (this with a castle 90% of the time), to perform a magic ritual ( e.g. send winged monkeys to enemy province and capture a comander; summon bunch of ogres or dragons ), to send a magic item from one end of a map to another, to access the gem treasury (gems are needed for summoning monsters, crafting magical gear and using more powerfull battlespells), to send blood virgins to the central dungeon (you'll find out yourself what THEY are for, you rascals, you), to make the magic gear and maybe for few other things as well, you need ONLY ONE BUILDING in that province! In other games you would need to buy 7 different buildings because thats the way other games try to achive complexity.    Another example: those troops that have lost their armor during a battle (there are spells with that effect like Rust or Acid Rain) get it back automatically afterwords providing there is enough resources in the province - its so automated that most players have no idea it even takes place!    Another example: in Dominions 3 there was an craftable artifact called Burning pearl(?). It had the efect that the commander wearing it would lose one point of life a turn but you would gain one fire gem. You could give those Burning pearls to all your commanders( after 20 turns maybe 40 of them? ) and then try to keep an eye on them so that you take the magic amulet from them after 9 turns, so they do not die because of it. Imagine the level of micro if you had 150 commanders :-)  In Dominions 4 this amulet got scraped, we got Fire in a Jar amulet, that provides the mage with one fire gem during a battle. Nice, elegant solution.2.The diversity of the game is greatly increased by the aviable mods, especially NationGen. I am currently passionately playing a Hoburg ( essencially warrior hobbits) nation. The blessed, sacred unit is a boar cavalery.They have swords and throw Tomahowks; I gave them fire bless so the Tomahawks are on fire when they whirl towards the enemy! I am sure the Boar's gore attack has a fire element to it as well, but the grafic does not show it :-(      This nation has also a deer cavalery unit, Heavy Infantry with clockwork armour ( there is game mechanic connected with the properties of the armor), a scout that is an assasin as well, flying cavalery with giant hawks and bunch of mages, commanders and infantry which seem vanilla in comparison but would be crazy interesting in other games.     NationGen mod can give you unlimited amount of new, unique nations, including the one where Velicoraptors ride to battle on crocodiles!3.There is a certain beauty in the way a battle progresses in the game, especially in multiplayer. Before battle you decide how big the units should be (one soldier minimum, I don't know if there is maximum - the biggest I remmeber was 250 soldiers), how many of them and what their behaviour during the battle should be e.g. attack closest enemy or wait 2 turns and attack the archers and so on >> about 20 possible combinations. Making those decisions, you will face tradeoffs like: do I make one extra small unit and order it to guard my precious commander but this will result in small morale penalty for all the soldiers this general has under him.     When battle replay starts (you have no control over the battle during the battle) you see how different units move on the battlefield, how when they touch some of them melt under the assault like snow on lava, others stand the groung like a stonewall. Units get mixed with each other; some catch fire others get paralyzed; buffing spells change their color or opaqueness; they get covered and traped by nets, vines or the earth itself. You see how a line of tough, armored, veteran infantry sloughters the cheap militia before them but there is 4 militiamen for every veteran. In the center there is 1v1 fighting but militia gradualy envelops the flank of veterans. The last warrior in line faces suddenly 5,6 militiamen- he fights and dies, then another, and another. You see how the flank of the falange is crumbling, you see how the militia is about to anihilate the veterans (while losing 50 % of their number) when suddenly 5 tarrantula riders charge the militia. Their god pretender blessed them with weapons that are on fire and they make use of it. The giant tarantulas cover the enemy in spider webs, inject them with poison and terrify you with otherwordly screeching. The militia breaks, runs away only to get massacred by the pursuing spider cavalery. The veterans break and flee to - from a 30 man unit there is only 6 left and every one has a battle affliction: missing eye, crippled leg or unhealable chest wound. One of them has 7 afflictions and his stats are worse than a blind militiaman's. If only there was a way to kill him it would be a mercy. But there isn't so in next battle he is going to be part of the Archer Bait Unit...			"

												This is one of the best strategic games you can find in Steam, and my all-time favorite. There is only a couple of insignificant flaws, and I will be short about them. First flaw is graphics, obviously, if you want to see beautiful picture, Dominions is not an eye-candy game. Second flaw is micromanagement, it may be quite tedious to play on huge map with a lot of provinces and opponents. Well, it is always hard to control a vast empire, is not it?And what is good in this game? Well... everything else. Dominions offers a huge amount of content and deep, well-designed and balanced mechanics. By other side, it is not hard to learn basics, Dominions is one of these games that ""easy to learn but hard to master"". You may gather an army and send it to conquer neighbours in just a couple of clicks... and then realise, that you need to think about strategy.I absolutely loved all playable nations, they are not typical boring ""elves, dwarves and orcs"", but thoroughly developed groups, based on myths and cultures from all around the world - from celtic myths to slavic folklore, from african stories to chinese legends. Game offers wonderful lore, and it was really interesting for me to explore it.Customization offers a lot of choices, it has a huge impact and also provides wide capabilities to roleplay, if you want to. Do you want to rule a scorched land of sloth and misfortune? Maybe you prefer frozen realm full of magic and mineral resources? Or lush green paradise with rich fields and bountiful harvests? And how about your avatar, will it be a huge dormant dragon, or ancient powerful lich, or even a marble statue smeared with blood of sacrificed virgins? And all this customization is not just cosmetic changes, it has a huge impact on gameplay and, in fact, determines your possible ways to victory.Economic system is simple and effective. You need to manage three types of resources: gold, production and gems, used for most powerful spells, troops and creation of artifacts. There is no penalties for territorial expansion, so Dominions is true heaven for conquerors. The more provinces you control - the more resources you will have, so expansion is absolutely necessary for victory.Battles are interesting and quite unusual. You can not control your troops directly, but you may plan, how your squads must act and what you expect from them to do. Planning the battle, placing troops and choosing what spells your wizards may cast, is vital part of game, and you really need to think and develop your tactic and strategy. And when it comes to magic... game really shines there, lots of schools and tons of spells, and again you really need to think, what and when you need to use. Easy to learn, hard to master, as I mentioned before.AI is decent. For me it was interesting enough to play on medium difficulty, of course AI can not be compared with human, but he actively resists, collects armies and punishes player for mistakes. And if you want challenge, you can always try hard difficulty or, maybe, join multiplayer... if you can find another players.Main thing that Dominions can offer is huge replayability. So many combinations, I am sure that you will not get bored soon. So. You love turn-based strategic games and still did not tried Dominions? I sincerely recommend this game for you then. Excellent stuff, high quality. I mean it, man!			"

												What a fantastic game! Wow!I can't say enough good things about this game. It is like all of the best old school fantasy 4x rolled into one. Master of Magic, Lords of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, with just the right touch of the Total War series.If you like strategy, watching huge battles play out, or like fantasy RPGs than this game is for you. This game never caught into the mainstream because of the graphics but people are truly missing out on some of the best 4x gameplay in the genre. There are tons of different races, empires, nations, etc with thousands of possibilities for each different nation to be played. No two nations play alike and even within the nations there are many ways to play.My favorite nation is known as Ermor, it's a romanesque nation which as it progresses through the ages it becomes undead. In the early ages you have great armies marching under royal banners, formation fighting with towershields, being supported in the back by toga-wearing wizards. In the middle ages the empire falls and rises again as undead. The rotting legions rise from the grave and march out of the capitol to ravage the countryside. In Ermor's undead regions, everything slowly dies due to the power of the Ermor god, so most Ermorian regions end up with 0 population. So amazingly fun, deep, and detailed.Cheers.			"

												Great Game.Pros- Tonnes of great lore- 78 different nations spread across 3 eras- Each nation is based on some kind of folklore. You can be jewish maneating giants, swarms of underground bat-people, a german inquisition ruled by vampires, king arthur and his hordes of unicorn-knights and longbowmen.... or the exception to the mythology rule, a cthuloid nation of squid-faced illithids. The list goes on. - 1000s of spells and units- The developers are constantly updating it with new nations, bug fixes, etc. etc.- Magic items- Random events range from getting a donation of goats to a local noble burning down a forest of fairies- Hand-drawn maps- Randomly generated maps- Great non-toxic community- Decent multiplayer- Thousands of strategies, troop + spell combinations etc. etc.- Be a god- Speaking of gods, you can be an easter island head, a cyclops, a dragon that eats the world tree, a lich, a one-eyed guy riding an 8-legged horse, a two-headed aztec woman wearing a necklace of hearts... you name it, you can be it.- Centaur chariots- No stupid fantasy stereotypes - so no elf knights riding dragons in massive floating mountains.- Create a second sun that burns up the world, make everybody age ridiculously quickly, plunge the world into darkness, make everybody rich and great, kill your enemies in strange and exciting ways, etc. etc.- AddictiveCons- Learning curve is very steep[But is overcomable if you watch some youtube videos]- Can be overwhelming for new players because of the multitude of choices- The graphics are terrible [I actually really like the graphics - and in defence of the developers... they both work part-time and the two of them won't hire extra developers.]- Multiplayer games can sometimes end with people leaving half-way through			"

												Dominions is not the most graphically complex game, nor does it have the most advanced physics, battle mechanics or all of that whatnot.But if you want to pit an army of trolls against a titan, with scores of einherjar and roman legionaries fighting each other there is few who does it better.Featuring loads of cool factions, many cool gods, multitudes of awesome spells and some hidden easter eggs. This game is gold.Not to mention it is super easy and fun to mod.So what are you waiting for? Go get it, and find out if you like its charming looks and funky events.May the best pretender win!			"

												Best turn based strategy to date. A hardcore game in every sense of the word, this is the perfect game for a micromanaging junkie. Watching the action of battles is suspenseful and fun, even relaxing considering you have no input while they take place. Every game is a new experience as there are near infinite strategies to pursue. While as of writing this review Dominions 4 lacks the mod library of Dominions 3, I'm sure in time content will be converted and new mods will be created. The only downside I can imagine to a fan of the genre would be the complete lack of diplomacy. Dominions 4 has added team games which help reduce the feeling of complete isolation. While the learning curve is steep, with the manual and some messing around I think most people will be successful in enjoying this game. 10/10			"

												About 100 hours before I could say ""Ok, I understand everything I'm doing in this game"" and 50 more hours before being able to say ""Ok, I've beaten this game"" (single player). I had never experienced this in a 4X game before and I LOVED the challenge !And this is just the game mechanics experience. Despite the (very) low quality graphics, the huge diversity of nations, units, and the various associated gameplays was a lot of fun. I kept on playing just to see what kind of units I had not seen, just to FEEL the spirit behind each specific nation.I also loved creating various gods, with different approaches (fighters, spell-casters, buffers, ...), as well as exploiting the game mechanics to create almost unbeatable gods in battle. And I really liked the fact that it is always a ""almost"", because there's always a way to kill a unit even if buffed up like hell.I can imagine that multiplayer must be incredible, but 150 hours in single player is rare enough for me to be praised.

												Dom4 is the best and deepest turn based fantasy game ever made.  Why? There's 75+ different NATIONS to play with over 3 different eras.  Each nation has their own interesting history based on the dominions world and aren't just a fantasy ripoff of orcs, elves, etc.  There's an incredibly deep magic system with over 800 spells, 300 forgeable magic items and over 2000 units!  You can play single player, hotseat, play by email or multiplayer with up to 28 players including team games.  The game is also easily moddable and there's a big mod community.    With this many nations, spells, and units, this game is very complex and impossible to fully master.  It's an old school style game where you should actually read the manual (infact dominions 3 came with a 400 page manual).  This game is an acquired taste for the patient who enjoy gameplay over good graphics.  If you're a tabletop wargamer or enjoy the civ series you might like this. The graphics are sprite based but functional and the music is good. If you're on the fence about this game, Dominions 3 (which is similiar) has a free demo available for download. If you're a serious strategy gamer who cares about deep tactics and likes lots of possiblities instead of just rock, paper, scissors style of today's RTS games, you'll love Dominions.  It's one of my top 10 games of all time on any platform and the only game that I would say even comes close to comparing to it is Civ 5 with all DLC and expansions.  Even then, it's a tough call to say which I like more.  Dominions is responsible for more ""oops it's 7 am, time for bed"" than I care to admit. Give it a try (and read the manual and tutorial!)			"

												Dominions 4 is the kind of grand strategy game for the kind of people that look at a game like the total war series, and go "" I don't like RTS game, I just want to give a basic strategy for my own troops and spend all my time moving armies around ""That sounds really boring right? Welll it ♥♥♥♥ing is, that's why Dominons 4 has magic. But Crix, what fantasy strategy game doesnt have magic, well most fantasy games don't have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle system this complex even though all the battles are played out for you or a troop roster this massive or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spell for everything. AND being able to outfit your commanders with a bunch of different magic items.Before you go and say ""wow this sounds great"" I'm gonna say this:  This game is for autistic people, you know the kind that unironically play untranslated MMOs or games like EVE. For ♥♥♥♥s sake to do the tutorial you have to download the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ manual jesus christ Its like I'm in the 80s/90s again.The graphics and UI are absolute trash, I understand there are only 2 crazy probably eastern european devs working on this game but this is the fourth one in the series, hire a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphic designer.So, why do I reccomend this game? It's kinda cool. There's a bunch of different nations spanning three different eras so you're bound to find one that appeals to your favorite mythologies, and then you get to create a pretender god to stomp all over the enemy nations. You can  be a dragon, titan, gorgon, or maybe you're a bit more laid back and want to be a giant stone statue, you can do that too, oh laugh while you still can, because when you're able to bless your army with flaming arrows and regeneration watcha gonna do then.The game gets a little crazy, like there's a global enchantment that starts making everyone age at a crazy rate. Well some shmuck just cast that spell and he's sitting behind 5500 power liches so what are you gonna do? You're gonna get a ninja and build your most crazy magic items and twink this 50 gold character like a god, and then you're gonna have him sneak into the undead providence and hope that he finds the right mage to murder♥♥♥♥. Let's say you've got lucky and found the mage, well turns out he was a crafty ♥♥♥♥er and had a teleport spell set to autocast, so now he's 10 providences away in another TOWN, but that's keikaku doori because now he's in range for your astral mages in your town to literally mind ♥♥♥♥ this guy TO DEATH.Also you can play as r'yleh and take over the world with an army of insane gibbering madmen led by mind flayers.

												Man, a review huh. I wasn't expecting much from this game as I've bounced from 4x to wargames, and back again over time never really being that impressed. So let me write a quick love letter to this one, that I've been hopelessly addicted to over the past several days despite its flaws. This game does not compromise on what it's supposed to be. It's a lovesong to the heydey of the past, and it's built without regard to any mosquito-like whining of the modern age. It never adapted except maybe to make controls easier, and it's so easy to love for it's somewhat rustic charm. If you played this sort of game in 1998, you will be well at home here. It treats graphics as though they were petty things for lesser purveyors of the arts. Instead, each and every facet of the game is just rich with an 11 herbs-and-spices of flavor. Every ""pretender"" God is interesting to read about, as is each civilization. As far as I can tell, they're all derived from one collection of lore or another, but they're adapted in such a way as to be interesting. Do you want biblical fanfiction? Norse mythology? The Deku tree? There's something for everyone here, and none of it is compromised to plebs that tend to fill modern video game audiences. Let me also mention the depth here. This game is so incredibly deep that many complain about it. As a caveat, the depth may not be entirely perfectly crafted. I feel there are some imbalances between the value of units, and the sheer amounts of spells makes it unreasonable to have a good grasp on what any given casters capabilities are. However, I kind of enjoy the ""fog of war"" this creates, and as my group of bros got this on sale, we're all kind of on the same curve.DO BE AWARE. There are a LOT of things in this game that are never explicitly explained, and I absolutely recommend looking up a guide. I watched the first 5 videos in this guy's guide: 


YouTube™ Video: Dominions 4 Gameplay Tutorial Pt 01 (Intro and Setup) 

			Views: 1,598		

			A full game of Dominions 4 from setup to victory, with live tutorial commentary and on-screen notes. Full playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKl4H7cUmS8iTj7-MYBdMGm_LO8NWoj9o No...		

Things like garrisons, prophets, many facets of casting, even just creating your nation are not obvious or intuitive. You can totally crap your way through it, but it'd be easy to go a few hours and still be missing things.(on a side note, there are no dedicated servers, you have to use a VLAN with port access, however it has been the most seamless experience I think I've ever had with this system, even flawlessly connecting overseas) Multiplayer aside, this game is really great on single player as well. I pretty much immediately put in several hours. There's just so much meat here, and the meat is delicious. I havn't had such a boner for a game in quite some time. So please accept my full-bellied sloppy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥soaked recommendation. Time to play for a few more hours.			"

												It's graphically primitive -- downright ugly, even.The number of units, attributes, spells, and even the number of nations might be intimidating.The AI isn't exactly good at managing all that complexity, so if you're playing well and don't handicap yourself it won't be a great challenge.The developers are great at adding character and factions -- they love mythologies and it shows -- but sometimes not quite as good at maintaining balance.However, there's a multiplayer scene and if you're not into MP (I'm not), you can treat it as a lovely magic-heavy sandbox with a ridiculous number of toys to play with.  There aren't too many games in which you can raise a Hydra, magically give it the ability to lead troops, and then make him the prophet of your faith; or to take a Hoburg (think Hobbit...), give him a magical item that makes him larger, and then give him boots to (literally) walk all over his enemies.    Or, say, for irony's sake summon an a powerful angel and equip him with weapons and armor gained only with the extensive sacrifice of virgins... if you want to play a drunk, demented (or both) god, this might amuse you.  I find outlandish prophets and strangely geared units funny, and I'd rather drink instead of methodically optimize my research and armies, so this is what I tend to do.If you'd rather play it straight and less goofy, and you want competent opponents, then there's the multiplayer mode -- either via PBEM, or with one player hosting a server.While the game doesn't support Workshop mode, it's quite moddable (sprites and text files) when it comes to adding new units or factions or modifying existing ones.  If you and your friends think that some spells are completely unacceptable, you could mod the game to make them inaccessible.   Too cheap units could be made more expensive.  And so forth.  Heck, if you wanted everybody to start with a single-use unit named ""Nuclear Missile"" that could teleport 10 provinces away and cast a kill-everything-on-battlefield spell but would vaporize after its first battle, you could -- you'd need to define the slay-all spell (presumably called ""Explode"" or ""DEFCON 1""), create a unit with desired stats and a trait that makes it die after a battle, and rig it to autocast the spell when battle starts; and then you'd mod the starting forces for each faction to include the missile unit.  It'd be a rather strange game, but you could.And so forth.			"

												Dominions is one of the hidden gems of the Fantasy 4x genre. Dominions 4 is an evolution of the series, not a revolution, which is no bad thing. There has been a rebalancing of the items and spells which, after several games, I approve of. A new strategic option has been added with the Thrones of Ascension which allows one to tweak the play style of the game in a large way during set-up. The civilizations available have been expanded, and an option for team play has been introduced with the Disciple mechanic. A word to the wise, this is a deep game with a steep learning curve and a lot of subtle mechanics which strongly effect gameplay. If you buy it on steam go to the Illwinter site and get the manual which is available for free download. The manual is not optional for your first few games, without it you will lose and you won't even know why.			"

												Utterly complex in the best way possible. Endless strategies and counter strategies to pursue. A game that rewards critical thinking, analysis, and meticulous planning. A truely unique multiplayer metagame that is reminiscent of diplomacy where anything goes. Very easy to learn, but impossible to truely master.  Engaging and deep lore based on world mythologies and a rich history should you choose to explore it. Meticulously detailed combat\spellcasting mechanics and a laundry list of stats for every single of the thousands of units will satisfy the groggiest of the grognards. Massive variety in nation thematic styles, everything from your typical legions of undead, to giants who feed upon the population, demon apes, and insane naked women. The strategy game to end all strategy games. 10/10			"

I follow the serie from Dominions 2 and each sequel is better and bigger than the previous one. And developers patch continuously the game, not only to correct bugs but to add new core contents (factions, mechanics, units and so on) for free,  Buy the game and support Illwinter!			"

												Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension is indeed a game not easy to approach. It definitely has one of the most steep learning-curves I've seen in the various games I played, and even when the mechanics have been mastered, the possible strategies that can be adopted in the game are almost endless.The lore of this game is set in a fantasy world taking inspiration from mithology and legends across the whole world. Concerning the game, Dominions is a turn based wargame with deep mechanics, allowing the players to play the different factions (there are many and all different) in various ways, even the same faction can be played using different strategies, and often there is no clear superior strategy, so it is up to the player to decide which one to adopt and how to adapt it to the evolving game. Dominions 4 is not only about grand strategy but also about tactical decisions, since the player will have to decide its armies formations and somehow how they are going to approach the eventual upcoming battle(s) the coming turn, along with decinding which spells the mages in the armies are going to cast, allowing in this way to create powerful combos.To conclude this short review I would like to point out that Dominions 4 is not ""The perfect game"". But to do so I need to elaborate a little bit: I personally think that Dominions 4 is ""the perfect game"" for what it is supposed to be, a very deep slow paced niche strategy game requiring lot of thinking every turn and even before the game to select the strategy to adopt (I'm saying slow paced since during endgames, turns can take two or more hours, especially on big maps). However the game is not for everyone. Given it's depth, the only proper way to play it is multiplayer, even if the game allows the player to play against AIs, as to be expected due to the game complexity, they do not represent a challeng to a player who learnt the mechanics and has some experience with the game.Finally, if you are interested in a challenging turn based game and you don't mind spending time in learning it and play it against other players (the community has been usually quite friendly and willing to help newcomers), then pick it up and give it a try, I am pretty sure you will be happily surprised by this odd-looking game ;)			"

												looking for a great strategy game? tired of the boring mechanics of the ""one more turn"" games where you mostly just wait for the next thing to happen?  where most factions end up feeling the same in the end?  thats how i felt when i picked up dominions and found, to my delight, an endless playground of fantastic mytho-historical epic religious wars.  none of that ""just one more turn"" crap.  dominions doesn't suck you in by making addictive gameplay, it compels you to discover what can happen in the myriad worlds that are created when new games begin.here's some examples: Being able to recruit Elephant units, I decide I might as well rely on them to stomp through a bunch of independent provinces, letting my horde of archers fire safely from behind my Elephant squad that just tramples everything.  Until I brashly attack a swamp province where a few wights weilding Bane Blades confront my Elephants without fear, hacking into them and causing Decay status to quickly start killing my elephants... which saps their morale, which causes Elephant Squad to rout, trampling over my archers and making the whole army retreat in shame... Playing as the Arthurian inspired nation of Man, my god the Tiwaz of War leads a huge army of archers shooting flame arrows, blessed swordsman, summoned creatures, and knights into the capitol of the bird nation Caelum.  I've already destroyed most of their standing army and expect to take their capitol easily.  Too bad I didn't count on their god being a fountain of blood that none of my units could seem to damage... the fountain rained lightning bolts and other magicks down upon my army and routed it, leaving me drained and confused about how to regroup.I'm an underwater Arch Mage with godlike powers riding on a giant lobster.  I hear the distant call of the ancient ones from the nation Rlyeh, the madness that is Lovecraft and Cthulu.  My dominion spreads insanity and death wherever it goes, and hordes of insane cult members flock to join my army.  Tentacled Illithids and Star Spawn are the commanders of this rabble, using their mind power to dominate those with weak will.  Strange alien beasts appear through the star portal to serve, to bring about the dominion of the Dreamlands, madness for all...I'm a fountain.  Not a fountain of blood, but an Oracle, the god of the fairy folk who were driven into hiding when men came to Ireland.  My army is small, but powerful, the Sidhe and Tuatha have the power of Glamour, and appear to be in many places at once.  With my powerful bless, a small group of Sidhe warriors can stand up to a whole army and turn it to rout.Now imagine a game where all of this is true at the same time, ideally with humans driving these nations.  An epic Play by Email experience awaits!			"

												Absolutely Amazing. I'll keep it short here, because there's simply so much this game has to offer.Pros:-Highly replayable, no two games will ever be alike.-Near unlimited creative control, play as a race of giants, underground trolls, vikings, boring normal humans, centaurs, have your God be a giant rock, a huge naked man, a ghost, a living tree, you name it.-Strategy and micromanaging beyond control, if you're a fan of strategy games, this is the mother of all of them.-Just plain fun to play, need I say more? Fans of this genre will be enjoying this game for years.Cons:-VERY high learning curve getting into the game. After a few games, it gets much easier though.-Limited diplomacy in singleplayer, every single nation is out to kill eachother, no restrictions.			"

												I love this game.  It's a labor of love that shines brightly for its depth, complexity, flavor, charm and moddability.I originally found Dom3 (its predecessor) when I was looking for a suitable spiritual successor to Master of Magic, and while it's not quite 4x, it does scratch a lot of that itch, while bringing you into a whole new world of gameplay that is now its own itch.Don't be put off by the dated graphics; there is still no game like this one, and it is definitely worth your time and money.  The devs continue to keep up with it, adding new content and expanding its modability, and it's worth every bit of the price.(Time played note: I don't think I need to say this, but you can probably guess that it is not the Steam version I have played.  I have played and modded hundreds of hours between Dom3 and Dom4.)			"

												I've always liked strategy games, but not been a hard core player. I've played lots of board games though and in my opinion Dominions is like playing a very good board game. In a true 4X style you Expand, Explore, Exploit and then Exterminate. Playing Dominions solely against the AI is ok for learning the game, but the real fun begins when you start to play against other players IMO.Pros:- Tons of varied nations to play with very different game styles- Cast spells, build armies, forge items, build castles,  plan and execute large scale wars, Dom 4 has it all!- You'll get literally hundred, if not thousands, of hours of varied gameplay- It's turn based, no stress and lots of time to carefully consider your strategyCons:- It is kind of ugly (but it grows on you, after a while you actually start to like the blurry pixels, less is perhaps more?)- The UI is clunky and sometimes unintuitive- It takes a long time to learn and to become good at it you have invest several hours- A lot of micro management and scripting in the late game sessions- You typically want to check stats and strategices online, not necessarily a bad thing, but some info is just esothericly presented in the game when you actually would prefer to get hard stats (Like, if you spend a lot of valuable magic gems on summoning a demon lord, you would want to know if it is worth it or not, but the game doesn't really tell you until you actually have performed the summoning ritual)All in all, when my friend first recommended it, I just glanced at the graphics and sniffed at it. But, over 300 play hours later, it is one of my favourite games ever. And yes, the graphic does grow on you.			"

												It's a great game although the asking price of 32€ is too expensive. I waited for a special to buy it and at 60% off it's definitely worth the money.I wouldn't compare it to Civ. It feels more like Rome Total War during the grand campaign mode but it gives me some Warlords 2 nostalgia feel too. There's a lot of depth to it and the different factions do handle very differently, which is great. The differences go beyond just combat and units and there's a LOT of factions so we're spoilt for choice in this game.All conflicts are automatically resolved for you, but you get to organise your troops into batallions and tell each batallion how it's meant to behave. For example, you can organise a line of infantry which is meant to advance towards the enemy, a line of archers that follows behind and shoots, and cavalry on the sides which flank. Morale is a big deal and if your troops rout then the battle is certainly lost.So unlike in Total War where you have to micromanage everything, there's no micromanagement in this. You have to plan in advance and hope for the best.I think if you enjoy Total War's grand campaigns then you're probably going to enjoy this.Edit: After more time with this game, I would buy it at full price. The trouble is that to give this game an honest go, it's going to take you several hours to figure it out and by then your refund opportunity is definitely gone. I can't see many people wanting to refund this though, especially not after experiencing multiplayer.			"

												A strategy game with some of the deepest and most interesting lore that I have ever experienced in gaming, Dominions 4 is a game that is both complicated and simple at the same time.  The individual details on the lore of each faction and its units is incredible, while the gameplay itself is significantly less deep.  However, you are a Pretender God, a being of great power with ambitions to ascend to ultimate, monotheistic godhood over his or her rivals.  So there's that for you powermongers out there. When starting your game there are three separate eras that you can play your campaign in.  Each of these eras is packed full of at least a dozen factions that are unique from one another.  Often this means that each era introduces entirely new factions as well as a good number of them that are evolved from the previous ones.  For example, my personal favorite, Ulm, is a faction composed large, human barbarians that worship steel in the Early Ages.  In the Middle Ages, they have evolved into a civilization that has mastered the art of crafting with the legendary resource known as blacksteel.  They now have armies full of black knights clad in this fantastic metal and are the most powerful rank-and-file infantry in the era.  In the Late Ages, however, civil war has destroyed what they once were and the secrets of blacksteel have been lost.  Though their troops are know wearing more standard armor, their aristocracy has become corrupted by vampirism.  This is but one of the many examples of a faction's evolution and some of them even have branching factions such as an empire that becomes three unique kingdoms.The strategy mechanics of Dominions 4 are not particularly remarkable, however, supplemented with the vast lore, they do make for a very enjoyable game.  Each faction has a fairly large number of units to build their armies with that have varying strength, weaknesses, special abilities, and a handful of stats.  As you conquer territories, you will also be able to recruit units not originally from your faction's unit pool.  This can result in some wonderfully unique armies that you conquer the world with.Though the lore in the game is fantastic, I do believe players should be aware before playing the game that after starting your campaign there is nothing much that is added to it.  There are exciting random events and, obviously, your conquest of the world will vary every time, but the story from the time you hit the 'play' button is all headcanon.  Granted, that is often the best canon, especially when shared with others.I recommend this game to strategy gamers, especially, as long as they don't mind the ancient graphics.  If you enjoy well written and unique lore and aren't expecting flashy, cinematic battles to play out before your eyes, Dominions 4 will be an experience that you'll come back to and share with others for a long, long time.

												Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension doesn't have a campaign, because every match you play is a desperate scramble for godhood. Whether you're a fountain of blood leading bloodcult Kievan Rus, inanimate stone head at the head of bat winged cavemen or a dragon leading an army of elves, you're gonna have a great time. By which I mean you might win.Eventually.When you learn to set orders for battles, do the communion slave tango, build super combatants out of things best left forgotten and summon harpy women to seduce enemy commanders. Welcome to the jungle. I'd say we have fun and games, but it's more likely to be 20 Jaguar Tribe warriors, 10 slingers and mage.			"

												Quite possibly the best strategy game i've ever played, so much depth in this game, yet, it's not useless depth as it all contributes to the game. All of the spells and what not actually do what they say, pay close attention, sometimes there might be a vague wording on a spell/item, but then there are artifacts/books which correspond to certain things and help there... A good example of this is the spell ""Wish"" which lets you... wish for something, well, it gives you a text box, and you actually wish for anything possible in the game (as long as it's not say, instant victory or something along those lines) you could wish for any unit, any item, money, even armageddon, slaying other gods, whatever your wish it will be granted.This is one of those games where you have to forgive the graphics, because the gameplay is what this is all about, and the gameplay is far better than say civilization 5-be (in my opinion)There's too much in this game for me to explain, though it may be relatively simple on the surface, to win you'll have to understand the deep underlying mechanics of the game and plan every move carefully.

You create a pretender god, select a race (out of more than 75) based on our worlds mythologies and off you go! Ingame the possiblities are almost endless. Do you want to turn a simple goat, who was donated to your temple by a poor farmer, into  a death mage, riding the winds on his magical carpet all the while wielding a battleaxe with a copper arm you mounted on its body and commanding an army of frostgiants? Well, with this game you can! With more than 2000 different units and monsters, over 800 different spells and over 300 different kinds of items you can do about anything!			"

												This is by far the deepest and content packed strategy game I've ever played in my life other than Dwarf Fortress. Single Player leaves much to be desired as the AI isn't that smart. Multiplayer is fantastic and I haven't been able to stop playing the past 2 days. I would assume though for those that are just used to joining a lobby and getting in a quick game, they will have a tougher time with multiplayer, though it really isn't too complicated. The game is also academically interesting as the games choice of lore is both well informed and fascinating. Fans of lovecraft will rejoice at several playable lovecraftian factions. Also the modding community is amazing, with tons of great material coming out for the game every week, also seems like the developers are committed to keeping the game working, fair, and interesting. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the deepest most interesting strategy game available on the market other than the ancient game of Go.			"

												Dominions 4 is the grand champion of 4x strategy games. It might even be the king of fantasy strategy games.Dominions 4 has incredibly deep mechanics that will, truthfuly, be quite frustrating at times but are also incredibly rewarding. This is a game where you invest alot of time into to fully understand. Every time you play you figure out a new strategy or mechanics you didnt know about. At the time of writing this review I have 274 hours into this game and I'm still learning. You can put a hundred hours into one nation and still not unlock its full potential. If you arn't willing to put time into this game you will only leave frustrated. Luckily there is a very active and incredibly helpful community over at Desura.com.Playing this game you will raise vast armies filled with simple human warriors, incredibly strong giants, magic demi gods, demons, angels, half fish men, dragons and many more creatures. You'll have armies of hundreds of units battling eachother as mages set the battlefield afire and call upon divine lightning to destroy their foes while corrupt priests cast unholy rituals by spilling virgin blood. You'll have a unstoppable army conquering and pillaging your enemies lands but then your opponent summons a powerful hero, hundreds of years old, from ancients crypts in his home city. This hero will fight your unstoppable army. One man, versus hundreds. And he'll win. You'll have a crippled commander who can barely move. Old in his age and speaking in croaks and whispers. but all your men respect him because he is a master tacticitan, he has never been defeated in battle. Guarded by your most trusted men he commands huge armies and crushes enemy forces with ease.The modding is where this game truly shines. Their are hundreds of mods available that change every aspect you could possibly imagine. From mods that balance to mods that are simply for fun, there is dozens of mods for every kind of player. If you're feeling brave you can mod yourself, all you need is a text and image editing program, with a official modding manual available at Illwinter's website. You can create any nation or creature you can think of. Want to play as a nation of cannabilistic, necromatic hobbit warrior society, go ahead, easily done. create as many and whatever spells you want. This game is your playground.The setting isnt simply your standard high fantasy theme but taken from legends and myths from around the world and throughout history. You're not playing a premade fantasy world, you're creating the world. You write your heroes stories, your own nations history. You are creating the world as you play. 11/10 "

												Great strategy game. Don't be fooled by the seemingly complex nature of Dominions 4, at its heart it is a turned based strategy game about conquering thy neighbor with a light build aspect to the game. While there are only about five buildings you will choose from to construct, what makes the game so complex and interesting is the myriad of magic research, races, troop types, and crafting items you can make for your heroes. When these are coupled with a wide variety of customizable deities/wannabe gods vying for ascension, different victory conditions (research, a capture the flag like thrones of ascension, domination, etc.) as well as different Ages with different technology and magic, you get a very complex layered game. The ability to set battlefield formations for your troops and command types whereby you can march them into war and watch the battles play out (adjusting accordingly should your plans backfire) makes it even more interesting. It would be nice if the graphics were a bit sharper, but that said, the focus on gameplay is the winning jewel for this game and should be a great examples for devs. out there that are graphics oriented versus gameplay oriented.

												An EXTREMELY over complicated 4X game based around ancient mythology, history, and H.P. Lovecraft. You start out the game by choosing a map, age, empire, and then making a god. The game consists of three playable ages that show the development of the playable empires. The early ages have Magical and Nonhuman factions in abundance, while the human factions of the time are just discovering Copper and Bronze. This age also has the greatest amount of Magic, but also the least organised casters. The second age is marked with Human factions beggining to subjigate the assorted nonhumans with weapons of Iron and Steel augmented by enchantment. This age has a moderate balance of Magic and Organised casters. The Third age is a time were Man has all but destroyed the magical wonders of past ages. Magic is nearly drained from the world, but well organised wizards make do with what is left. After you choose your age, you choose your empire, Then make your God. Your God making sets how you will spend the next several hours of your life in this game. You select an available Deity for your faction, then get to choosing how strong it is in magic and what bonuses you get in lands were you are believed in. Say you're faction has very good yet expensive troops, yet poor magical researchers and practitioners so you can't get any late game spells, you would make your god have a dominion that boosts production and can cast what you need to be cast. FINALLY you are in the game after setting a few end game goals and options, and the real complicated hell begins. I think im going to stop soon so I am going to make this as simple as possible to summarise what you do in the actual game. Your first play through will just be throwing bodies at other bodies till you win or lose. Though what makes the game fun is the magic. One magician with some magical items and gems can single handedly destroy a quarter of an army, but what makes it complicated is knowing the exact stats of those items, spells, and how much your caster can take before fainting. I think this is way to long already and if anybody reads this far then I'm sorry if this was a mess. If you want to take the time to learn about this game and such then by all means get it.(Alright, I've started playing multiplayer) The multiplayer in this game is really fun, but reaaallly slow. It work's on a basis of recieving emails for your turn, and sending in emails when your done. In that time it takes for everything to get done though, you can talk in depth with the people playing the neighboring nations. So pretty much the single player portion lets you learn the game and play it casually, while the multiplayer game gives you an entirely different experience with the same nations you've spent hours learning how to play and counter			"

												This isn't a game for everyone.The strategy game players already have their traits, but this game requires them to utilize their traits to the maximum.Dominions 4 has so many different aspects, it'll probably take you a couple of new games to get adapted to the controls and different things you can do.There is a huge amount of different startup settings you can use, and a huge amount of factions to choose from. Every faction is different - and I mean different not just cosmetically, but to the very essence. To give an example to show the contrast between the factions:Late Age Agartha is a nation of cave-dwellers. Their version of cavalry rides cave drakes, their mages are skilled in earth and death magic. They also recieve a bonus to alchemy. Their best soldiers require a large amount of resources to produce. Since most of their soldiers have darkvision or are already blind, they don't get harmed from spells like Solar Eclipse and Darkness. Late Age Lemuria is a land of the Undead (it's basically a fantasy counterpart of Ancient Rome which gets corrupted). The extent of your pretender god's dominion will always kill off the populace in provinces. You then use these dead bodies to bolster your army with spectral centurions, velites, and consuls  - not through training, but through summoning with spells. Thus, you have little use for gold or resources.---There are also many Pretender Gods to choose from. From a mere sculpture that has gained power through millenia of worship, to a divine burning glyph, from a titan of the sea, to a dragon. You can further customize your pretender by changing the effects of its dominion (the extent of its power), and its capabilities in magic.Units differ wildly. Some are only recruitable in some regions, most are only available to a single nation. They have tons of attributes, a stat sheet, and commander/spellcaster/scout/priest units have an inventory for items.The graphics are a bit of a shame, it's true. Most of the time, you won't even watch the battle replays, the random map generator creates ugly looking maps. However, the userbase (and potentially you will too), have created some lovely looking maps, worthy of Tolkien himself.The gameplay is very complex. I don't like Let's Play videos, so I had to learn by myself. You'll need a bit of patience, some intuition, and curiosity to understand fully how it works.But here's why this game is really worth playing: The storytelling.The richness of the world and its backstory will pull you in. Every single unit type has a story. Every ""hero"" type character has the potential to be your favourite character in the game. You will spend astral magic gems, month after month, empowering Sybil - your Oracle fountain pretender goddess. And you will craft the most powerful of items, to arm Eteonos - a 54 year old Strategos. Eteonos is 54 years old. His best years should be behind him, but he still fights with the vigour and heart of a young hoplite. A shaman you've recruited helped you put a spell over your dominion - where creatures of all kinds age slowly and every wound heals given time, even a lost eye or limb. Eteonos's stiffening joints move with ease, his reflexes and strength are active as ever. You don him with the arms and armor of the Warrior of Dawn, and you send him to the Arena, to fight other champions on your behalf, to bring honour on to your name, and win the prized Champion's Helmet.Will he succeed?

												The first time I played after the tutorial was a singleplayer game, to get a feel for the games' mechanics. I played as R'lyeh (named for the city in which Cthulhu lies in deathless dreams) and zerg rushed everything unfortunate enough to be underwater. Then I turned my attention to the land. This is difficult as R'lyeh, as most units available to it can only survive underwater or with costly magic to allow them to breathe air or transport them in a bubble of water, and my enemies had fortified the coast at this point. So instead of raiding their ports the traditional way I summoned a bunch of sea trolls, which can survive both on land and underwater, and had them repeatedly throw themselves into suicide missions along a coastal region until the area was strewn with corpses. Then I marched the Eater of the Dead, a massive undead horror summoned from a nether realm that feeds on corpses to grow in power until it inevitably becomes too powerful for its summoner to control and breaks free, wreaking havoc indiscriminately, over to the battlefield and had it gorge itself. It broke free quickly and began rampaging, but this was all according to plan- I cast a spell to freeze the oceans over, so it could not get back down to my oceanic empire, yet was free to destroy all unfortunate enough to live above sea level. Sadly, I did not comprehend the importance of proselatyzing, so belief in me gradually ran out throughout the empire, until I had no divine dominion left and lost anyway.Since then I have played as the lavamen of Abysia and created a second sun so there was eternal burning day, crippling the offencive of my cold-loving Niefelheim foes; As the Ashen Empire of Ermor, an undead post-apocalyptic Roman empire that spreads like an infection, turning the world into skeletons, and did the opposite, blotting out the sun and causing the entire world to age at an incredible rate (skeletons have great longevity, humans not so much); As Kailasa, an Indian-themed realm of reincarnating monkey gurus, I used the power of the stars to transform a demigod of mercy into a ruthless and indiscriminate killing machine, flying around the world with a shapeshifting dragon princess she once saved in tow and bringing destruction upon my enemies; As the amphibious subterranean civilisation of Agartha I broke an ancient seal, releasing mad gods upon the world; And so on- These are only the more prominent examples, stories many players are likely to experience because they align with each nation's strengths and lore.Make no mistake, Dominions is only superficially yet another army-management turn-based wargame. In fact it is more of a game about great magical beings at war with each other, and the havoc they wreak in their strife for supremacy. Like certain other absurdly complex modern CRPGs with minimalistic graphics (the most prominent being Dwarf Fortress), Dominions has decent gameplay, but its real strength is in its equally complex and convoluted lore and the intriguing stories that come from it.One of my favourite games, strongly recommend.

I owned this game for over a year before I could muster up the courage to brave it and had to attempt 3 times before i could even figure out how to move and which gods to use. The game itself give you no hints, and everything you must learn from the community, reading guides, or trial and error. Its meta is comparable to League of Legends and Magic the Gathering, And multiplayer is where this game shines.Worth way more than 34.99			"

												If you have ever wanted to play D&D, but with whole armies, this is the game for you, a truly unique universe, no elves, dwarfs and orcs. Nordic Jotuns will be fighting Greek Pegasi and Hindu gods will duel Japanese Oni. The graphics does what is needed and no more, the controls and UI is a thing that needs to be learned rather than something that comes naturally, and a lot of stumbling and failing will come before being even decent at the game. But when all is said and done, the game offers depths of strategy that few others can match with hundreds of different troops, hundreds of spells and hundreds of items that can be combined in more ways than it is possible to say. A unique experience in every way and hundreds of hours of fun, the forums are full of people willing to help you learn, and games with new players are always there to find.			"

												One of the best multiplayer 4X games around. An obscene amount of nations, spells, items, units and gods to choose from and build a strategy around; with endgame strategies ranging from opening the gates of tartarus to bring defeated mad gods into your service, blocking out the sun, or creating an endless wish chain to marching your undead legions across the world to spread your gods population killing dominion, or kitting out your god (and friends) into machines capable of killing entire armies on their own.A large, helpful, and active community can be found at just about any large gaming site.

												Dominions 4 probably presents the broadest array of distinct options I've ever seen in a strategy game, on top of a huge pile of mythologically inspired lore. And not just the western mythology stuff you've seen a million times either. You can summon a winged monkey-demon that wants to ""gobble up the sun and plunge the world into an eternal slumber"". He plunges the entire battlefield into darkness whenever he shows up. You can rain sacred flying jaguar demons on your enemies, free titans trapped in tartarus and nurse them back to health, and literally cause a zombie apocalypse. I've got a weakness for this kind of stuff, but the game is large enough you're bound to find a nation that appeals to you.Not to say the game is without problems. The game's breadth makes it almost inaccessible, and as a game goes on, it increases your workload of fiddly micromanagement. Want to find errands for 30 wizards every turn? Dominions is the game for you. The game's mechanics are unnecessarily complex, and incompletely described in the long manual. The AI is almost non-existent, mostly useful for testing out tactics on the most basic level. The game is not especially balanced, and there are some awkward results of the game's committment to mythological versimilitude. (Women, across the board, have 1 less point of strength than men of the same group. Mechanically, this is largely insignificant, but it is still stupid.)These problems are significant, and if you aren't entranced by Dominions 4's unique qualities, I don't recommend it. If you are entranced, this is, as far as I know, the only game of its kind.			"

												It should be said early that this game is not for everyone, but if you like this type of genre, then Dominions 4 is definitely worth it in my book.The mechanics are mostly about overall strategic movements around the world map, and army compositions, and axcept for a pre-battle plan, there is no way to control your units in combat.To start, you design your god, who will then command your chosen nation in the fight for the thrones of succesion, and ultimately the title of Pentakrator, the sole remaining and most powerful god in the world.The goal is to expand your ""empire"", which means conquering land and spreading your dominion, and claiming the victory points around the map to crown yourself victor. Dominion is basically your chosen gods influence, and will give provinces modifiers based on how you designed your god.Conquering land is vital for securing enough resources and gold to build an ever bigger army. Enemies will usually not be far away, and on multiple fronts. Smart decision making will often decide the outcome of your games.As you gain land, send skilled mages into them to search for magic sites. Magical sites will provide gems, which are mostly used for spellcasting (combat) and rituals (world map spells). Having a high gem income can a lot of times be the edge needed to subdue enemy nations.Personally, i prefer less micro intensive strategy games, which is why i like this game so much. The god aspect is very well thought through, and there is tons of variety in gods and magic, which is the ultimate charm of the game.			"

												Overall, this game is a lot of fun.  I have only really played it as single player, but I find that it offers a heck of a lot of replay and depth to it.  Don't let the old style of graphics turn you from this game, it is incredible.  While the AI is far from perfect, it is still solid and the depth of strategy is beyond basic explanation.  Take combat, for example.You build up an army, you can tell the men what squad they are in, and where that squad will start.  From there, you can give a SINGLE basic order to the squad and that is it.  The order can be Fire (target type, which does NOT include leaders), Hold and Attack (wait two turns then attack target type), and similar.  But that is it, the rest is out of your hand.  Your leader you have slightly more control over, able to give orders for the first five turns through script like commands set up with the armuy (such as cast a certain spell, hold or cast, etc.).  And since it is required to be done before you go into combat, once combat starts, you can only watch it play out, no Total War controls here.There is NO diplomacy in single player, that is a big downside for me.  The computer though does seem to recognize when you are at war with them, which is nice.  You attack their lands and they will fight and attack you, otherwise they seem to leave you alone (until you are their next target).  Kill their pretender and they won't stop attacking until they are destroyed.  No trading, no NAPs, nothing of that nature, but still, it is a remake of an old game.Replayability is incredibly high.  There are three ages (High Magic, High Human, and inbetween) each with their own races avaliable.  Each race, unlike some games that are simple reskins, are very different in play.  Some are high magic focused, even for the high magic age, while others rely on mythical creatures or humans blessed by their god.  No matter how you look at it though, each race fights their own way, takes their own different tactics, and offers plenty of replayability because of it.  Even the same race over the different ages play differently, and some races simply don't exist in certain ages, just to show the type of race they are.Overall, its an incredibly addicting game, active community, and lots of fun.  Go for it, especially when on sale.			"

												Dom 4 is an extremely deep fantasy 4X that captures the grandeur of magic, godhood, and empire management. What the game is in a nutshell:-You are a god; you must vanquish other gods and conquer their dominion, while maintaining control of your own-The game's lore is mixed with history and fantastical mythos. There are no elves or dwarves. There are byzantines with hydras (hydra cataphracts), undead roman legionaries, demonic samurai, and conventional vikings, greeks, English knights, HRE-style armies, aztecs and more.-There is a massive roster of magical units and monsters you can add to your army. The game is a good depiction of how mortals would fare in battle against giant cyclops, phoenixes, dragons, and more. Every mythical beast under the sun is in one form or another in this game.-Magic is devastating; swaths of fire can swallow entire platoons of mortal soldiers. However, the backbone of your armies will still be conventional forces until the late-game.-You don't control armies in battle; you set pre-battle orders and the battle is automatically resolved (though you can watch it play out to analyze why you won or lost).-AI is actually rather competent and ferocious in war. For some reason, while there is utterly no alliance system, certain AI choose not to attack you while you're fighting in your own war. Perhaps they were busy fighting someone else; but my point is that it feels smarter than the AI in CIV. But forget about trade or diplomacy - there is only war in Dominions 4.-You truly understand what war of attrition means in this game. It is a GRIND to defeat another nation; you will lose many, many soldiers and officers and provinces will change hands often. Strategic placement is vital; you have to leave strong garrisons at certain strongpoints. Sieges are lengthy. By the time your large army smashes through the remaining enemy defenses, you will find that your men are 8 years older, many losing limbs and walking on a limp, and slowly dying from disease.-Every single unit has permanent stats: if they lose an arm in battle, they will fight one-handed for the rest of their life. You can equip officers with magical equipment. Also, if one of your generals gets horror-marked, his fate is sealed. Demons from another dimension (the strangest looking demons I've seen in any fantasy game) would periodically attack, and one of these things are strong enough to destroy entire nations. Very rare, but dom4 has bizarre events like these.The only problems I have with the game are that the logistics are quite clunky. You can't route your army to a far away location; the maximum routing distance is an adjacent province. Battle orders are also very finicky. Graphics of course are not the game's strong suit, but that's a part of the package.Recommended for meticulous and patient 4X gamers who want to feel the immersion of empire building and strategic war of attrition.

												This is my first review so if it seems a bit messy, I apologize.I've played this game for about 100 hours now and I still don't know what I'm doing. I have played almost all the Civ games, Total war games and a scattering of other 4X games. If you like turn based strategy games set in a fantasy setting, that are hard to learn and harder to master then this is a game for you. :) Start out modest with some small armies and a handfull of spells for your mages, and as you progress you get bigger armies, summoning spells, huge battlefield wide spells and rituals that can affect the whole world.It may not look like much, as my friends keep telling me. But the diversity of ways to play, and the mechanics that support it is worth the modest cost of the game in my opinion :)			"

												This game is a lot of fun both singleplayer and multiplayer.Single-player: Challenging and fun cause the AI is better than players at picking its battles and growing and massing hordes of units. Good to learn to play and/or you can just play this way the whole time. The game is pretty moddable but there's already so much content to learn about that personal mods are something that is enticing almost exclusively to singleplayer.Multiplayer: Players adopt and try out crazy strategies usually that are always unique to their nation and there're thousands of overal strategies. Players make more intelligent use of spellcasting, item combinations, and formation tactics. Players also screw up entire game strategies, formation tactics, item combinations, and attacking neutral provinces they can't defeat, making player games radically more random than those against the AI.If you have a friend who you can play with, you should absolutely try multiplayer, all the same while, if you're playing by yourself, you can take all the time in the world to do whatever you want with your micromanagement and role-play to your heart's content.

												I'll start with the cons.- Bad graphisms. Actually, the sprites are really nice, but since there's no animation at all, I have to admit that the game is not a delice to the eyes.- Lots of text, and it's all in english. The first half of this con is actually not really a con since you can play the game perfectly well without reading most of it. Also, it could even be considered as a pro, since this text is often very poetic and inspiring - it's all about myths, cultures, and metaphysics. The second half of this con, obviously, is only a con if you're bad at english, which you're probably not if you're reading this.- Very very complex game. Actually not a con, since it also means that there's a lot to learn and do before feeling like you know this game very well. However, be aware of the fact that you'll be pretty much lost about most of the game for a long time. You'll still be able to have a lot of fun with it.- No music. There's one on the game menu, and it's nice, but since it's the only music in the game, you'll disable it very quickly.And that's all. Yup, that's not much. I guarantee you one thing: if you don't mind too much these points and like turn-based strategy games and mythology, you'll definitely love this.This game is a real treasure. A true independant game, made by two people alone, and yet extremely deep and interesting. I have more than 100 hours in the game at this time, and I still consider myself a beginner. There are something like 50 playable nations. Most of them have real gameplay differences (they're not copies with slight quirks like in Age of Empires for example), some of them even bending the rules of the game. All of them are very inspired and original.You can play a lovecraftian nation, the roman empire, the UNDEAD roman empire, byzantium, the tuatha de danann of celtic mythology, the knights of the round table, giants of jewish and mesopotamian mythology, weird and creepy beings that live under the earth with psionic olms, a greek philosopher's kingdom, a greek philosopher's kingdom-that's-undead-and-doesn't-know-it, vampires, inquisitors, egyptian lizardmen, mermaids, at least three different kinds of vikings and their giants, zoroastrian angels, japanese demons, wise sentient monkeys, etc, etc, etc. And in each case, you customize your god (you) with an incredible number of possibilities.The amount of content in this game is tremendous. Also, it is being updated very frequently and sometimes even receives new nations. All of this for free. Yup, no DLC at all. And it's heavily modable. And once you've tried everything in solo, you still have a whole new layer of strategy to discover with multiplayer games.As /vg/ says, ""it's an autist’s wet dream of a war game"". Take it as a huge compliment.			"

												Dominions 4: Thrones of AscensionIt's not you're average stratagy fantasy game, no. Most of the civilizations for example, are based on historical civilizations but are changed to suit a more mythological theme. Meaning, you wont be fighting elves, orcs and dwarfs, but rather giants and lizard men. And the use of priests and religious figures is also an almost prominent factor of the games main objective.Story:The god of all has vanished and in the abscence of this supreme being, many 'pretender gods' have risen to take the throne above all. These pretender gods will raise armies, and fight eachother in brutal combat to ensure claiming the throne for themselves. You play as one of these pretender gods. You must claim the thrones of ascension to accomplish the goal of winning the game, however, you can also just dominate the land with your mighty armies.How it plays:This game plays very much like a board game. You can see the map on a birds eye scale of the world and you can move different units to different settlements in a turn based manner where they can perform different tasks. Such as, spreading your dominion (being your influential power over different areas), killing off rebel forces in nearby areas or build temples, forts and castles for extra deffensive capabilities. This game can be delightfully tactical.Units:There are many different units in the game. Each civilisation often has their own unique ones. But your pretender god is the most powerful a lot of the time. You can take your pretender god into battle, and it can increase the fear of your enemies more than anything which makes them more likely to flee the battle. Which is what happens a lot of the time, usually not all enemies get killed, they eventually run away. But the pretender god can be good for ensuring success in risky battles. There are then more weaker tier units you can simply use as cannon fodder, because of how cheap they are, resource wise. And then there are more powerful infantry and calvalry and as well as more powerful archer units that can be made for more resources. Different settlements may also allow you to recruit different units you can't recruit anywhere else. You can also make scouts and priests. Priests can spread dominion and scouts can swiftly move through enemy territory with ease.Customization:As far as customization goes, you get to choose what kind of pretender god you would like. Different civilizations have different kinds of pretender gods available, and a lot look different in their own unique ways. Also all will have different stats and abilities, but those can not be customized. You simply choose a god, give your god a name and then you get to choose the game options which there are many, as well as many different maps to play on, making the game very replayable for most I imagine. Also game options include victory conditions, difficulty and number of AI, etc...Graphics:This is not a game made for good or even half decent graphic design. The graphics are not that great, but that shouldn't be a problem for any gamer with a reasonably decent imagination. You play the game and as you play you can see everything that's going on inside your head and that's pretty easy to get into, and fun. If you do not have a good enough imagination the game will probably feel empty or hollow.Learning curve:There is a big enough learning curve at first, but things start to click into place eventually and when they do, you'll be flying through this game. There is a tutorial in this game, but for me it was quite a poor one. On a sad note:Diplomacy system is almost non-existent. To declare war means to attack someone. And the AI can declare war on you without even havind to attack you straight away. No sort of trade involved either, (But that seems okay.) or any kind of peace treaty can be made from what I have seen so far. Once war is declared, it goes on till one kingdom falls to the hands of the other. I wish diplomacy played a bigger role in this game it would make things a little more interesting, but then again, there can only be one winner.Verdict:Tons of fun to play, if you have a good imagination and don't mind bad graphics.Steep enough learning curve, with poor tutorial.Can be very tactical, with vast amounts of units and civilizations and different abilities for each one.It immerses you in the story and goal to ascend to the throne above all gods.No good diplomacy system.More could have been added on to the soundtrack I guess, but that's my opinion. Many might disagree there.Loads of stats and information is given throughout the game on all main units and battles are done accuratly.Good AI from what I have seen.All in all, it's a good game. It's worth your time, and can have some very epic and memorable moments.8/10I throughly enjoy this game. But I wish there was more to diplomacy.My imagination has done fair work on this game, but extra graphicdesign in certain parts wouldn't hurt at all.And having a bad tutorial mode can be a real pain. But,a lot of the positives really make up for it.Hope this review helped!			"

												Overall, this game is a lot of fun.  I have only really played it as single player, but I find that it offers a heck of a lot of replay and depth to it.  Don't let the old style of graphics turn you from this game, it is incredible.  While the AI is far from perfect, it is still solid and the depth of strategy is beyond basic explanation.  Take combat, for example.You build up an army, you can tell the men what squad they are in, and where that squad will start.  From there, you can give a SINGLE basic order to the squad and that is it.  The order can be Fire (target type, which does NOT include leaders), Hold and Attack (wait two turns then attack target type), and similar.  But that is it, the rest is out of your hand.  Your leader you have slightly more control over, able to give orders for the first five turns through script like commands set up with the armuy (such as cast a certain spell, hold or cast, etc.).  And since it is required to be done before you go into combat, once combat starts, you can only watch it play out, no Total War controls here.There is NO diplomacy in single player, that is a big downside for me.  The computer though does seem to recognize when you are at war with them, which is nice.  You attack their lands and they will fight and attack you, otherwise they seem to leave you alone (until you are their next target).  Kill their pretender and they won't stop attacking until they are destroyed.  No trading, no NAPs, nothing of that nature, but still, it is a remake of an old game.Replayability is incredibly high.  There are three ages (High Magic, High Human, and inbetween) each with their own races avaliable.  Each race, unlike some games that are simple reskins, are very different in play.  Some are high magic focused, even for the high magic age, while others rely on mythical creatures or humans blessed by their god.  No matter how you look at it though, each race fights their own way, takes their own different tactics, and offers plenty of replayability because of it.  Even the same race over the different ages play differently, and some races simply don't exist in certain ages, just to show the type of race they are.Overall, its an incredibly addicting game, active community, and lots of fun.  Go for it, especially when on sale.			"

												Let's talk about the bad first, to shook off most of the people who would give this game a bad review:This game have crappy graphics, an awkward user interface, and you have a manual with 454 pages. That you will need to read... Or see lots of youtube videos... You won't even be able to start playing without that.*And* you probably will have to play the game with lots of spreadsheets by your side to become good at it... Yes, yes:MATH... TABLES .So, are you still reading this? Ok, then: let me talk about the good:It is clear to me: the devs have disregarded almost everything that makes a modern game to be considered 'good' and instead focused on having a game with *really deep* folkloric roots, picking on lots of myths ever imagined by humanity, and a very complex, deeply thought-about game mechanics. When I play this game, I unexplicably feel like reading a Tolkien book... And feel the urge to enter the wikipedia to know more about the myths the game is based on. There are many layers of game mechanics in this game, so you can always become surprised (and sometimes infuriated, I reckon) with something new. Until you go to back to that *f* manual, and then gets that 'Oh! Of course!' feel, and the urge to slap yourself in the face... And this is one of the strongest points of this game: The game mechanics are all there, in that big manual. There is nothing really hidden, it is only stashed somewhere inside it. (Or, sometimes, in some game hints in game).  Unlike many strategy games that hides the crappy mechanics they have based the game upon behind health bars, or cute graphics... The game options are overwhelming: it mixes religion-based myths with lots of magic, a complex and RPG-like promotion system that I'm only beginning to grasp, and researching spells... The game tactics are deep, very complex: It is surprising me all the time: units *age*, get crippled, blinded;  there is ritual magic, crafting, human sacrifices for blood magic... Commanders become heroes in fame, can receive magical equipment, and some equipments may even be needed to actually win the game... Or not! Because every single faction is completely unique. And can be made even more unique depending on a very deep ""leader"" customization...Unless I discover, as I play the game for more time, that there is *the* shortcut around all these rules and complexities, I can say this game is something of almost infinite replay value... To tell you the truth I can't even play more than a few turns before wanting to start over and try something different with this game... And every time I restart lots of what I've learned is thrown away: the new random faction I've got appears to demand a completely different strategy ... Because there is land factions, sea factions, factions with ranged units, factions *without* ranged units, factions that demands lots of magic, factions that favors absurd strength in numbers... or not. You may discover that that army of 200 little monkeys with bows that you have amassed in a few turns do not make even a dent at that army of 10 heavy cavalry... But, hey... what if I turn those little monkeys into zombies some turns later? Oh, c*p... I've just chosen a leader with no death magic... Ok, ok, let's restart the game *yet again*... And now I've started with with a chinese lore based faction... Or the fabled city of Ur that have only very expensive, strong units in the army... Hm... how many monkeys do I need to kill an Ur Guard?? Let's go back to the *f* manual... And make some spredsheets , and some simulations....  "

												This is my first review so if it seems a bit messy, I apologize.I've played this game for about 100 hours now and I still don't know what I'm doing. I have played almost all the Civ games, Total war games and a scattering of other 4X games. If you like turn based strategy games set in a fantasy setting, that are hard to learn and harder to master then this is a game for you. :) Start out modest with some small armies and a handfull of spells for your mages, and as you progress you get bigger armies, summoning spells, huge battlefield wide spells and rituals that can affect the whole world.It may not look like much, as my friends keep telling me. But the diversity of ways to play, and the mechanics that support it is worth the modest cost of the game in my opinion :)			"

												One very cool thing that the developers of this game do is they bring together various mythologies from around the world and bring it all into 1 game, each faction is highly distinct and has its own setting, along with the patron god you choose to command it with. The best part is the fact that there's tons of them, all with rich lore that you can read up about.Personally, I think CoE is a more challenging game, because your god isn't invincible as they are here.. that's the only flaw I see in this game.. once your dominion gets going and you unlock a lot of the mid-tier trinkets, your god basically is unkillable and could probably take armies on his own, then again I guess that's how it's supposed to be. I don't even think this can be considered a flaw.Obviously this is not the game for you if you don't like 2d sprite graphics, you don't participate in the battles much, it's a really refreshing experience from most RTS games I've played, personally.

												Dominions 4 is last in a quartet of games curiously mixing the board game sensibilities of Risk with the epic high fantasy of spell slinging games like Heroes of Might and Magic. Players are tasked with leading one of the game's many, many factions to victory in a couple of different game modes that all boil down to ""defeat all enemies and paint the map your colour"".In this way the game, like Risk, is very simple. You take over and occupy provinces that you can use to generate soldiers to build into armies. Contrary to Risk however, fights are not won with static dice, but through simulations where fights between armies plays out based on unit composition, mages on the battlefield, or the positioning of the soldiers, all available to the player to organize. After a simulation starts, players lose control of the army, and it follows any instructions its components are given. This takes some getting used to, but emphasises the planning phase of wargames that has taken a backseat to directly controlled combat popularized in the current climate of hard and fast macro oriented games, even among non turn based grand strategy titles like contemporary Total Wars or the crop of RTS available that follows the entertaining-to-watch format of Starcraft 2.Nothing wrong with such energetic gamestyles! Variety is the spice of life, and Dominion's spice is old and venerable, slow paced and strategic to the hard and fast tactics above. Be advised though, if you are looking to command the armies in person, Dominions would fail you.Where it will not fail however is in the lore department. As mentioned previously the game sports what many dare call the most varied set of people and factions available in any strategy game in existance! Dominions 4 sports a cast made up of mostly unaltered figures (gameifies of course, and some original faces are brought to bear) and beings stemming from the imaginative real world mythologies around the globe. This makes factions varied and plentiful, further exasperated by the sheer ammount of optional but plentiful information that has been appropriated from myth to everything from individual characters to unit types, or the factions themselves.These factions are organized into three separated time periods, chosable at the beginning of game-setup that serves the dual purpose of varying each game in terms of playstyles and factions available, and also -cleverly enough- as the game's meta plot. The three eras are separated so as to allow for the passing of time to be implied to take place between them, meaning that descriptions of factions found in the lore, will change between eras.Some factions will change over time, radically in some cases. Others will split or dissapear completely, being present perhaps only at the dawn of the game's timeline or emerging later on only to get snuffed out, during implied conflicts (IE the games you play!) or from internal strife. Others still remain intact from the passing of time, with blurb describing how they made it through each eras rather than how it all crumbled underneath them. It feels truly epic to read about the factions and see how they change or gets destroyed, and overall this ominous method of story telling, while as passive as the game's combat, is really what makes you fall in love with the game. It is truly unique and really does make it feel as if you are part of a vast, age long struggle between ancient civilizations and their even older gods. You are one such god. Did i mention that? You are represented in game by a fully customizeble borderline-divine being looking to step it up a notch and assume the right of rule over all of creation. Power is excerted through the titular ""dominion"" translated to domain power, spread by your followers and priests, but you can also participate (still in a non-controllable fashion) in combat as a force of nature (think movie-Sauron) a tempestuous mage, or a benevolent buffer. As with the factions, godly archetypes are taken from authentic myths both in terms of gameified kit and in game lore, and you can play both as great beasts or ambitious wizards to more conventional divinities, all of which further diversifying the way you play your faction.Games such as this, with cluncky UIs and crappy graphics are perfect for ""making your own fun"" or creating interesting story threads (think Crusader Kings II or Dwarf Fortress!). And given the amount of lore and the underlying ominous note to your excursions into it, Dominions 4 tickles the imagination and succeeds in providing the fantasy of world shaking struggle between pretender gods!

												Dominions 4: Thrones of AscensionIt's not you're average stratagy fantasy game, no. Most of the civilizations for example, are based on historical civilizations but are changed to suit a more mythological theme. Meaning, you wont be fighting elves, orcs and dwarfs, but rather giants and lizard men. And the use of priests and religious figures is also an almost prominent factor of the games main objective.Story:The god of all has vanished and in the abscence of this supreme being, many 'pretender gods' have risen to take the throne above all. These pretender gods will raise armies, and fight eachother in brutal combat to ensure claiming the throne for themselves. You play as one of these pretender gods. You must claim the thrones of ascension to accomplish the goal of winning the game, however, you can also just dominate the land with your mighty armies.How it plays:This game plays very much like a board game. You can see the map on a birds eye scale of the world and you can move different units to different settlements in a turn based manner where they can perform different tasks. Such as, spreading your dominion (being your influential power over different areas), killing off rebel forces in nearby areas or build temples, forts and castles for extra deffensive capabilities. This game can be delightfully tactical.Units:There are many different units in the game. Each civilisation often has their own unique ones. But your pretender god is the most powerful a lot of the time. You can take your pretender god into battle, and it can increase the fear of your enemies more than anything which makes them more likely to flee the battle. Which is what happens a lot of the time, usually not all enemies get killed, they eventually run away. But the pretender god can be good for ensuring success in risky battles. There are then more weaker tier units you can simply use as cannon fodder, because of how cheap they are, resource wise. And then there are more powerful infantry and calvalry and as well as more powerful archer units that can be made for more resources. Different settlements may also allow you to recruit different units you can't recruit anywhere else. You can also make scouts and priests. Priests can spread dominion and scouts can swiftly move through enemy territory with ease.Customization:As far as customization goes, you get to choose what kind of pretender god you would like. Different civilizations have different kinds of pretender gods available, and a lot look different in their own unique ways. Also all will have different stats and abilities, but those can not be customized. You simply choose a god, give your god a name and then you get to choose the game options which there are many, as well as many different maps to play on, making the game very replayable for most I imagine. Also game options include victory conditions, difficulty and number of AI, etc...Graphics:This is not a game made for good or even half decent graphic design. The graphics are not that great, but that shouldn't be a problem for any gamer with a reasonably decent imagination. You play the game and as you play you can see everything that's going on inside your head and that's pretty easy to get into, and fun.

												First multiplayer game I ever played: Lost because I got ganged upon by my two neighbours and I had no idea what I was doing with my stupid hippie nation.Second multiplayer game I ever played: A crushing victory that mostly succeeded because my enemies failed to notice I was about to TAKE OVER THE WORLD. Crazed necromancer amazons thank all the people who failed to notice that they were sending hundreds of people to claim the Thrones of Ascension.Dominions 4 is a fun, unforgiving strategy game about becoming a god, which you mostly do by crushing all the other factions who have some dude, dudette or monstrous creature trying to become a god. There are dozens of nations, dozens of different Pretenders (the dude/dudette/monster trying to become a god), and who knows how many different units, spells and magic items. Through diplomacy, war, spellcraft and plain old trickery, you must guide your nation to victory. Also, the game is balls hard, clunky, filled with archaic knowledge about how units, spells and such work that you just have to know if you want to have any hope of winning, and sometimes you just get randomly screwed by the AI deciding to do something stupid in a battle, your wizards deciding that the best way to react to a random bugger attacking them is by summoning angels of death that immediately kill the wizard, or you open a random coffin and there's a horrible murder mummy in there... but it's fun.

												Never before have I played a game that I can describe as beautiful in such an eclectic sense. The town looks absolutely stunning on the PC. The story is rich and provoking, keeping you guessing and revising your theories as you play. The final scenes will haunt you, driving you (or at least many) to the forums to absorb and discuss thoughts on the plot possibilities. The music is captivating and enthralling, with all of its drama. With extra orchestral stabs to accent details such as how you finish an enemy, the experience really feels complete and integrated. The gameplay is familiar for fans of the previous Illwinter games, with new innovations to spice things up. Zipping around the town and dealing out devastating blows is both effective and immensely satisfying. No game is perfect, as no form of entertainment/art is immune to subjectivity but this game comes so close that it deserves a 10/10 for being worth every single coin spent on it.			"

												This is hands down the best computer game of all time and I've been playing since Might and Magic I on a 286.  It's a bit of a steep curve to get up at first.  I started with the Dominions II demo and couldn't quite take the plunge until Dominions 3 came out, so started playing in 2007.  The game captures the feel of the Malazan book of the fallen - multiltudes of mighty and ancient powers jockeying to ascend to power.  The complexity and variety of spells, units, treasures, magical sites, tactics, are staggering.  A game where scouts matter, assassins matter, powerful wizards matter....It's most fun played multiplayer where you can match wits with wily players from all over the world and brings in real diplomacy on top of all the wonderful tactical and strategic mechanics.  If you are just learning, I envy you.  It's a fun journey.  Last thing I'll say - is the game has soul which not many games seem to have these days.			"

												One of the best strategy games I've played so far. Sure, the game interface is kinda old-school and could be a bit more intuitive. The graphics may also seem a bit odd ad first. But this has the upside that this game can even be played on very old computers, so I wouldn't even consider this a bad thing (also I just like the graphics style tbh). The content of the game is just huge, there are hundreds of units, spells and ways to play the game and win. The learning curve is therefore a bit slow and you will need a good while until you can play really effectively, but even while you have to learn, the game is much fun. There's also tons of lore behind all the different nations you can play, which people with imagination might enjoy as well. And the best thing is that this game is still regularly being updated, with new units, nations and gods to play as. Absolute recommendation for all who like to invest tons of hours into their favorite strategy game.(Also it has Linux support, which is great.)			"

												In essence Dominions 4 is a very enjoyable strategy game that offers a very unique concept and experience. I thoroughly recommend this game for those who enjoy turn based strategy games, and D&D players.The game features well researched historical nations fighting alongisde their own mythologies, such as Japanese Ashigaru being supported by Tengu, or Viking raiders paired with dragons. These nations are led by your own custom god who radically changes the territory that he/she/it controls, wether by making it into a fertile and well ordered land or turning it into a disease ridden, unproductive region of unrest. Or your god can simply be a towering behemoth that smashes its opponents to pieces in battle. Both methods are completly viable. The final component is the deep magic system, with apocalyptically powerful spells and summonable creatures divided into different schools. Some nations have excellent soldiers but terrible mages, and vice versa. It is very rewarding to create your own deadly combinations of different nations, gods and magics; the amount of combinations is staggering. The game is still updated fairly often bringing more nations to the increasingly large roster. Furthermore, there are many mods to keep adding content to the game.However, the game can be rather intimidating with a frankly inadequate tutorial, making a read of the manual essential. I had to lose several games before even starting to understand what was going on, and I'm still pretty bad at it. The graphics are certainly functional but they are not exactly good either. In singleplayer there really is no diplomacy to speak of, you are constantly at war with the other players - I think that the lack of diplomacy is the biggest issue the game has.Ultimately, Dominions 4 is a great game that I greatly enjoy playing.

												Dominions is a massive, complex, turn-based game light on the graphics, and heavy on the rules (300 page manual - and yes, it is necessary to read). For strategy fans, it is a delight.  This being the fourth iteration, and having been in development for so long, things are quite smooth - having fallen into a pattern. The developer does support the game with bug fixes, and minor additions.			"

												Do not let the graphics fool you, this game far surpases the addictive nature of CIV with a deceptivly simple structure that has immese depth. The AI is an actual challange when compared to pretty much any other game, and beating a tenacious upstart pretender god has never felt so good. And the multiplayer.. epic is the only word I really have.			"

												Dominions 4 is one of the best 4X turn based fantasy strategy games I have ever played. I only wish I had discovered it earlier than I did. I am not going to describe the game here but would rather explain why I consider this one of my favorite games of all time. Here are the three greatest strengths that I am compelled to highlight: high replayability, choice driven game play with consequential outcomes, and an excellent system for managing a complex combat system. The game is not perfect but the drawbacks are easily overlooked if this is the style of game you enjoy: relatively simple graphics, a clunky interface system, absence of good networking support, and it can be daunting to jump into the game due to the high number of moving parts.For those who want more detail here I will go over the strengths of the game:1) High replayability: The game has dozens of different nations each with a distinct set of leaders, troops, as well as available magic paths. Some nations are mythical in nature (giants), some can fly, some are aquatic - each of these dramatically varies how you can approach the game. On top of that you choose a pretender who can be customized to shore up your weaknesses or build on your strengths. Not all the nations are equal leading to some interesting asymmetric game play. That means if you like this game you have hundreds if not thousands of hours of enjoyable game play ahead of you.2) Choice driven game play with consequential outcomes: There are many highly impactful events in the game including choosing a nation, a pretender, the magic paths you will research, what units to recruit, and how to arrange them on the strategic map and tactical maps. If you are playing a multiplayer game then things become even more complex as diplomacy and reading your opponents intentions become huge factors. What is nice is that once you are experienced at the game you can see how your choices lead to success of failure.3) Excellent system for managing a complex combat system: This is a turn based game so movement/combat occurs simultaneously between turns and is completely handled by the computer. At the start of your turn you can observe the battles and see how your troops performed and watch in incredible detail how the battle unfolded. But combat is not entirely out of your hands. During your turn you can organize your armies and describe how they should approach the battle with a relatively simple scripting system. For ordinary troops you can position them and give them a fairly basic orders for how to engage the enemy. Leaders are particularly potent because they may be able to cast spells and they can be scripted more complexly. Learning how to position and script your troops is a HUGE part of learning Dominons. This system means that you can organize your army once and fight many times, that your choices are impactful, and most importantly that you don't have to micromanage every battle. Instead you get to watch sometimes nail biter battles to see whether your plans succeeded or resulted in catastrophe. If you are someone who gets fed up with the tedium of 4X games that feature long drawn out turn based tactical based that have to be played out because the AI isn't smart should love this system.So the weak points:1) Simple graphics: This game doesn't look great - its not bad but the sprite based graphics have their limits. Maps can be beautiful or not depending on how much effort their creator put into them.2) A clunky interface system: The interface is servicable but its sometimes hard to figure out how to do things and there are a ton of keyboard shortcuts to learn. In particular being able to set orders for lots of troops particularly the spell casters can get tedious.3) Absence of good networking support: This game can be played multiplayer over the internet but setting things up can be challenging. A nice play by mail system (llamaserver) has been set up by fans of the game and greatly facilitates game play but it could be a lot better.4) Daunting to jump into the game due to the high number of moving parts: This game has a ton of depth and there is nothing to be done but get started. The manual is HUGE but understanding the manual and learning how things work in practice takes time. It is both the curse and the joy of the game. Experienced players will tend to dominate the game.This begins to touch on the strengths of this game. I wish more developers would learn from Illwinter/Dominions and build more engaging 4X play.

												If it wasn't clear by my number of hours played, I love this game and I highly recommend it. If you can get past a confusing UI and sprite graphics, you'll find a wonderfully complicated and strategic game that is also filled to the brim with competing mythologies in pursuit to rule over a world.A world that will likely be destroyed by the time you get there because you won by sacrificing thousands of virgins to summon horrors from beyond the veil to consume friend and foe alike!And that's just one of many viable strategies to win! You can also create massive communions of mages that use its weaker members' energy as fuel to power the rest into throwing out massive firestorms upon the enemy's heads. Or you can air-drop hundreds of magical elves riding ponies into every enemy province at the same time. Or even have your pretender god wish himself physical and magical mastery until no being in existance can stand up to the sheer power.This is, through and through, a multiplayer game. Although there is single player which can be useful for trying out certain things, the focus is on playing the game with others. Communities for Dominions 4 multiplayer can be found on Desura's Dominions 4 forum, on dom4mods, and on Something Awful. I'm sure there are other communities as well. The only thing better than plunging the world into eternal darkness so your legions of undead can rule over the living, is having ten other human players scream in horror as their people are converted into the undead masses!

												I've been playing the series since 2, and 4 has simply streamlined the process. The Automatic research, more diverse sites and the Throne system, and a lot of very unique and thematically fascinating modding commands, this builds on the strengths of the previous games. Graphically, the game leaves much to be desired, but in mechanics and diversity of gameplay there is almost no match. Ther is almost nothing in Steam that offers as much modding support, including a full guide on modding and more options for mods than most players would ever use. Even the base game offers up a very wide array of nations, drawing from almost all mythology. It's one of the rare games where fantasy China, fantasy Scandinavia, fantasy Egypt, fantasy Maya, and fantasy Celts can all fight and all feel like their own unique nation, with assorted strengths, weaknesses, and an incredibly detailed lore.Stepwise from 3, the game is not a huge change, but there's a lot more than modding can do and a great deal of changes that offer new avenues for balance. If you liked 3, you'd like 4 but might want to wait for a sale to make the jump.			"

												This reminds me a lot if Master of Magic was a really complicated board game. This will run on almost any machine and the play by email multiplayer works really well for people with spotty internet connections.You start every game by picking a nation that decides the type of mages and troops you can recruit, and then you choose and customize a god to lead your nation. I beleve there are over a hundred gods to choose from, including (but not limited to) Greek, Norse, Celtic, German, Sumerian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and even Cthulhu-esque. There's everything from an erstaz Athena to a disembodied head with crab claws coming out of its forhead.While the myriad of rules can seem intimidating, most people should be able to jump in and play against the computer without too much difficulty. Once you get a feel for the rules there are a few communities that regularly run blitz matches so you aren't stuck committing months of your time to a long PBEM.			"

												I am a god.  A vacancy has arisen for the post of Supreme Ruler of the Universe.  My job application will consist of wowing a sufficient number of the inhabitants of the world with my awesomeness until they worship only me, primarily by killing the majority of those who don't happen to see things the same way.  Oh, and I'm also a sentient boulder worshipped by blood drinking demons and their monkey-folk underlings.  I'm currently fighting a never ending war of attrition with the druids to my north and am having a spot of trouble with the bat people to the south, and the build up of one-eyed giants on my eastern border is a little troubling.  On the other hand though, my colonisation of the ocean floor is coming along nicely and if all else fails I'm saving up blood sacrifices for a spell to plunge the whole world into darkness, so that's something to look forward to.Yes, play this game.

There's nothing more satisfying than watching massive armies of your mindless slave-I mean, devout and courageous followers, meeting apostates on the field of battle to fight in your name. There's a lot to learn as well, both in game mechanics and strategies to the lore of the countless numbers of nations you can play as. It's not pretty, but you learn to love the little sprites after a while. After you get bored of fighting against AI, you can always play a few games with people online, LAN, or even set up a hotseat game at home. I say just go for it! Jump into the rich and fantastic mythological world that is Dominions, and make some new and interesting friends along the way. We don't bite. :D			"

You can be horrifying fountain of blood that summons ancient fallen angels and murderous giants. You can go full Sauron and build terrifying armies of strong half-men supplemented by dark magic and immortal Japanese demons. You can be a mysterious titaness who has the knowledge of the arcane to gain edge in spell research and then send your battle mages that can form communions in order to gain access to powerful spells that enable you to annihilate or permanently enslave entire armies. You can control an underwater nation controlled by Lovecraftian beings that slowly turn the whole world insane as your god's influence spreads.			"

												Do you like turn based strategy?  Do you like a game whose depth remains after playing for years?Do you like sipping a drink and plotting the horrific slaughter of your enemies?This game is probably for you if you said yes.  Let me get this out of the way-you aren't going to sit down and be good at this game in two hours.  You just aren't  But the process of getting better at dominons is fantastic.  Illwinter has been working and reworking this game for probably 10 years, and it shows.  Gameplay mechanics that are first mystifying are, once you really examine them, absolutely brilliant.I can't tell you why this game is so awesome in a review, because the depth is almost mind boggling.  All i can say is, if you like in depth TBS and you haven't played this, i wholeheartedly endorse it.  I simply can no longer play other TBS games, because i'd rather be using my limited gaming time on Dominions.One caveat:  while SP is very good, this game truly shines in MP.  That's not to say you can't enjoy SP games, lots of folks do.  But i encourage you, once you get your feet wet, to play MP.  There is simply nothing like it.  There are times when there is so much riding on it, you'll be afraid to open your turn file.  And that, my friends, is the greatest experience in MP gaming!  I hope to see you in game(don't worry, i'm still a pretty lousy player, you'll probably splatter me all over the map-but i'll still be enjoying the game!)			"

Fiddly controls that dont match modern sensablilities (can play the whole game with just keyboard shortcuts).  Graphics that look like the sega genesis.  Hardly any tooltips and must refer to the manual/github for myriad of details.  As the game progresses micromanagement increases.  Multiplayer is mainly played by PBEM or direct tcp/ip.  Ai has improved but still not that great.You partake in a bloody contest between gods to be the only left standing.  Thousands of very distinct untis, hundreds of spells, and (i believe) more than 30 factions to play.  Deep gameworld based on varied myths (what if the blood sacrificing mayans faced off the sarmatian amazonian warriors).  Varied armies of hundreds of units clashing while summoning demons, skeletons, lightning bolts, and spooky ghosts.  Wereturkey wizards trying to fry each others minds.  Gelatinous cubes trying to eat stone contructs.  This game and its wonky possibilities always retruns to my mind.  If the preiviously described weirdness sounds intresting, you may like this game.

												So, I decided to play as my current favourite, EA (Early Age) Ermor again. Large random map with 9 AI's at Easy (I'm a real noob).It goes pretty well, so I decide to jerk around and upgrade a few of my mages to insane levels.First one gets Horror Marked (think hunted by monsters from HP Lovecrafts works) and gets murdered by a Lesser Horror. My wizard had 7 in Fire, Astral, Nature, Earth and Water.And that wasn't even that powerful of one.During this time, I started getting harassed by enemy spellcasters, so I put up a Dome of Flaming Death. Yes, that's the exact name of the spell.So, when I decided to go and get my powered-up Augur Elder there, I cast Gateway.What I didn't know was that when a Dome spell says enemy spellcasters, it means all spellcasters that either target this province or cast out of this province. Including my own.So, now my other powerful spellcaster is toast (pun intended), this time however, I was hoist by my own petard.10/10 would get hoist by own petard again.			"

												Dominions 4 is a deep and complex strategy game with more variety in its nations and playstyles than in any other game I have experienced to date. While the single-player is enjoyable, and a wonderful way to get used to the game, it has its flaws. The AI is servicable, but adapting to the challenges it faces using the wide array of options available is beyond its capabilities. Multiplayer is where Dominions truly shines. In multiplayer, diplomacy matters as much as your armies, and magical research is of critical importance to your ever morphing strategies.While I believe that the game is entirely worth its full price, I would recommend buying it during a sale.

												Disclaimer: This is my personal feeling  (and pardon any rambling I may do here) about the game and various features in it, and is not meant as any kind of insult to those who are hard core fans of the game. Nor is it meant to particularly entice new comers to the game. While I clicked the yes button I really wish there was a ""maybe"" option as it is not for everyone.Intro:If you have played Dom 3 you may think you have played Dom 4 after starting it up. The interface is pretty much identical and much of the game is the same (with old school sensibilities about interface, so not much flash). However, many things that were fun for me, and perhaps too awesome (I don't think so but meh) were nerfed/toned down. Items are no longer all that awesome if you focus and invest all your effort in forging. In fact they are barely worth the effort imho but you can still get some fun things out of them. Just don't expect them to be very effective. In particular the items that produced gems, no longer do so for all uses. They may give you something called ""Temporary"" spell gems which can be used in battle but not with rituals. And much of the skill enhancing items are either gone, nerfed or very much more expensive to make. Id say you are better off not making items at all (as tempting as it may be when you realize that some items still seem fairly powerful.) If you do be prepared to be underwhelmed by the end result. Spells & researching them were left largely untouched except for minor nerfs here and there to make them more balanced. On Balance:I will say I am not a proponent of fine tuning/balancing games. Particularly ones that are as successful already as the Dominions series is. However if you are going to do it, don't take away fun things unless you are adding in something to replace them. It is too easy to make a game all hard edges (and difficult even on easy mode, and forget the various coolnesses that may have attracted some people in the first place.) My $0.025 anyway.Does Illwinter do this with this game? Yes and no. Some of the new strategic possibilities with disciples look fun. However,  the practice is tricky and is probably best suited for multiplayer. (Full disclosure: Which is something I have never done with any of the dominions games. I like playing 4x-likes solo/single player mode for the most part.)I like and dislike the Thrones of Ascension mechanism. I like it because it allows you to play in a different manner than the old victory points system. And each throne adds something to the game though you may not enjoy all of the effects of controlling one. I dislike it because the AI at least on the non-cheating (impossible etc) modes does not seem to know how to properly exploit the thrones, only capturing one if it happens to be within easy grasp. But since the whole goal of the game changes from ""conquer your enemies  and make them cry (or turtle up if thats your strategy)"" to: ""conquer this tough independently held province and do it quickly to win before your opponents can mount their own campaigns against"", it does not make sense for the AI to still go into conquer every territory mode (standard behavior). Also once youve captured a throne you have to use it (with a prophet or your pretender) and make sure to hold it. Independants can and will recapture neglected provinces as inexplicable events. (You don't get to see troop movement or anything, as a warning first.) Which makes the game more and less interesting. More because you have to pay attention to defenses perhaps well inside your territory that you might otherwise neglect, and less because the same. Micromanagement is ever the bane of the 4x player. Yes it is important but it make the game drag to the point of wanting to go play tiddly winks or something else equally inane. God Making:Perhaps still the best part of the game is being able to set up the game in any way you like. Hard? Easy? Large? Small? Make your own maps. Make your own deity. Choose a form that is all combat or go with many schools of magic and master the arcane. Lots of choices is a good thing and you get a lot of that here. Modding:You can still mod it, though it seems that some of the modding rules have changed. And I would not begin that task unless you really want to see it through and have some actual ideas. Do it because you have a story you want added, not just to up the power level of some item, nation or diety. Or whatever but be warned that once you look under the hood you may feel less enthusiasm for the magic of the game ever after. Graphics:The graphics are unsurprisingly primative but adequate. Sprite based battles still look haphazard and may require some getting used to, to interpret properly. (Why DID that priest suddenly lose morale and run?? You may never really know...)Overall:The most disappointing thing for me is that as a solo game Dominions 4 has no real innovation, only small refinements on prior editions, which don't really rise to the expectations I had when I saw it was out. As they say: ""Caveat Emptor"" but I really expected more for some reason. Yes I bought it earlyish and didn't do my due dillegence (feh at brand loyalty) on checking other reviews but the product is what it is. Illwinter does not make bad games. So no matter how you feel about it, it will be a game to play not just one to sit on the shelf of buyer's remorse (Because steam never refunds you anything, ever.) You should still get fun out of it.Buy it if you want a fantasy RPG-4x to play. It is challenging and the UI can be a little inscrutible at first but read the manual and you'll be fine. There is a community and sites to help you learn the strategy of the game. You may even be sucked into the multiplayer version or the modding community.			"

												Perhaps the number of hours I’ve been playing deceives you? Hmm? Well, let me put it bluntly. This game is pretty awesome. It is a strategy game at its core. And in the purest sense, a classical war game involving fantastical creatures and beasts. I refer to it as a war game due to the nature of game play. It is hard-core and classical in that, there is no diplomacy. Pure tactics and strategy is needed to succeed. You make your own diplomacy and essentially create your own story. A word of warning, this game is far better when played online or with other people. Don't get me wrong. There is a single player aspect but in my personal opinion. The single player aspect against the AI is probably best used as a way of testing your builds, possible tactics and army composition. Yes, there is a very in depth combat system in the game, very much akin to Total war. For better or for worse, you have no control over these clashes (represented by crude graphics combating it out, looks pretty appealing in my opinion), and instead you can script what your troops would do. This makes for a more intense session and allows you to experiment possible tactics. By making battles less hands on (like total war), it enables you to feel more like a proper general :) Each unit has a hand drawn sprite and there are over a dozen nations to pick from (from a selection of three ages). Then there is the pretender creation. That is the best part of the game. To create a pretender ‘god’ that represents you. The number of possibilities that come to creating a god is endless.  You can make a combat oriented super god, or perhaps a more spell oriented support god. Maybe even an immobile stone god that confers perks to your troops. The choice is yours! I admire the game. Not just because it is a pure grounded classical war game involving fantasy creatures, gods and what not, but more-so due to the amount of detail put into the game. That is a feat that no game can accomplish (well at least with higher graphics anyway). Perks-Really in depth combat system with a multitude of troop types and nations to pick from.-Formation system-Pretender Creation-Randomised map generation-Excellent multiplayer game-Mod capabilitiesCons-Graphics can be a major turn off for a lot of players (especially those who look to graphics as the main factor for enjoying a game)-Though battles are very detailed (modelling each individual soldiers move and attack), they are very heavily scripted and despite it following orders. There can be tendencies where some of your units won’t follow orders properly (I understand orders cannot be followed to a point but in some cases, it can be pretty extreme). So to conclude, my highlight of the game would have to be the combat mechanics and the pretender system. Some people may dislike not having direct control over battles, but I personally think it makes for a far more strategic game. Not to mention, back in the day, generals would not be able to control their infantry or cavalry directly anyway. Even now, there is a margin of error when it comes to following orders from a higher up. I think that is very well simulated in this game. By letting players script orders, you are almost planning your move from a war room. Not knowing exactly what is going to happen. That is how it should be done :D			"

												Dominions is my favorite series of strategy games. I admit, it's a difficult game to get into. I still haven't really played this one much - I've spent much more time in Dominions 2 and 3 before there were any Dominions games on Steam.In Dominions, I really feel like a leader, not just grinding through turns but planning things out. It's a simultaneous turn-based game, you everyone essentially draws up where their armies will go and gives each army tactics for how to fight.Dominions 4 appears to be an improvement over Dominions 3 - the thrones feel like a good addition and there's a little less micro-management with the tax changes.Overall, I've been stuck playing more casual games recently, but if you have the time to take on a serious strategy game, this is the game to play. I've seen enough to be sure of that.			"

												A wonderful game. Epic (Battles with a thousand units vs a God. One Survivor), deep, intelligent and growing (new races are still being released in every age). If you're browsing then know it is well worth the price even full price. I've played it twice as long as Skyrim... longer than most of my games library added together. And each game I've played has been different:I lead a race of aquatic mind-lords, deep in the ocean. My pretender to the throne of godhood a great Polypal Queen, giving birth to a host of magical beings that swarm the enemy with their writhing tentacles. My massive ancient mind-lords enslave the enemy with a look, curse entire armies and form communions to enhance their power to incredible levels - enslaving entire battlefields and shredding the souls of the enemy.I've led a race of winged humanoids that live high in the mountains crafting weapons and armour from magical ice. Summoning back splendid beings from the astral spheres, 'adorable ones' beautiful to behold, too awesome for living men to dare strike.I've seen the temptation of power topple empires. Mages suffering the ravages of old age turn to healers and eventually to death magic to be reborn as wight mages, drawing on the power of conquered lizard shaman to blot out the sun and cover the battlefield with a never ending horde of undead warriors. Then in a latter age casting spells that change the entire globe, covering the lands in darkness and advancing the slow decay of time till all is withered and dead.I've felt the fear of a horror-mark. A towering giant of a God, multi-armed and terrifying touched by the unspeakable powers. The last act of a doomed race to mark it, a slow, pyrrhic victory. My God, with power beyond reckoning destined to be stalked forever by the creatures that lurk beyond the veil. Each touch from the terrifying apparitions further marking the Great God for the attention of the astral beings until at last... a doom horror, Each name more frightening than the last. The Eater of Gods arrives to feast. My God is no more...A brilliant game. I could say more, it's worthy of praise. More than a little tough to get into (you'll make lots of mistakes and you need to practice in SP before trying your hand at MP), dated graphically (2D spites, only one artist working on the game) and a little micromanagement heavy (Ok very micromanagement heavy. You can script every mage, every squad, equip every commander and forge every magical item... lots to consider, lots to weigh up and lots of stats if you're into that). But, if none of that puts you off and the thought of summoning hordes of undead, demons, shrimp or cross-bred monstrosities appeals: Buy it. Or stick it on your wish-list and get it when you can afford it. Play a few games.Get your friends to all play on a big map with diplomacy, backstabbing and roleplaying. Keep an eye on the little guy, he's probably planning a surgical strike with teleporting golems, gathering blood-slaves to taint the magic of the world to cause all magic but blood to bring the attention of the horrors. Or he may just have had lots of misfortune and be fighting against barbarians, vampires, roaming bands of heroes, blights and plagues and extreme weather. (Could be luck... or it could be that somone doesn't like him very much).I hope you get it, I'm glad I did.			"

												I would recommend this game to every one loving deep strategy game. But keep in mind on the first attemps the game is hard even against the ""easy"" AI. If you don't mind to do your ""homework"" you are rewarded with endless nations, units and tactical possibilities. Every nation has its own units with custom strengh and weaknesses. The game is basicly a board game like Risiko Deluxe in a fantasy setting (magic, devils, vampires... you name it). But the game mechanics are more complex. It also assemble some similarites to games like Heroes of Might and Magic (weapons, heros, castle, battle spells and 'normal' soldiers). You play as a god and have to get rid of your enemy deities.I wouldn't the game to somebody who want fast gameplay, a decent graphic or a deep story. This is a hardcore strategic game, the graphic could be described as functional. All units are 2D spirits and only seen in a 3d envoirment on the battlefield. All other screens are drawn 2D only (hence board game fealing). I put alot of hours into the game (and the older Dom 2) and still not mastering it. (and even not seen every unit available!). If you still interested the game is perfect for you!			"

												If you're looking for a turn-based multiplayer game which you can play regardless of timezones, in which you actually do significant stuff every turn, which has lots of depth, and loads instantly (but in which you may spend an hour or more deciding what to do in particularly competitive games), Dominions 4 may be worth a look.It supports play-by-email, and games are usually run through www.llamaserver.net, which handles setting up games, accepting pretender submissions, hosting the turns and sending out the new turn files, receiving your .2h orders files and having a page which shows who has submitted their turn and who hasn't... It supports turn submission time limits (e.g. it runs the turn after everyone submits or after x hours since the turn files were sent out), postponements (whoever makes a game, or any admins they designate, can postpone the new turn or change the turn time length, rollbacks, changing a player to AI or replacing them with someone else (so that games don't have to end if someone drops off the face of the Internet), etc.			"

												Dominions is an excellent game - but not for the faint of heart!  The level of complexity and depth is beyond any other strategy game I've played.  Can easily spend like 1-2hrs just thinking about the moves of a single turn.  Don't waste your time with single player (aside from training) as the AI is not up to the challenge.  Go straight to the forums and join a multiplayer game.One word of caution: brace yourself for the tides of victory and defeat in the MP games.  As the games sometimes run over a course of 4-6 weeks, wins are an incredible rush, but losses can be equally crushing >:)			"

												Been a fan of Dominions since 2 and while 3 was excellent, 4 is even better. More victory conditions, more nations, while some are renamed, none have been removed, more spells, coop play with disciples, it all adds up to a great turn-based strategy game. Not what one thinks of when you hear:""Fantasy strategy"", it uses a plethora of races and creatures, even my personal favorite, the nation of R'lyeh based on H.P. Lovecraft's works!Highly recommended.			"

												Great game - not much has been changed since Dominions 3 (I would say 4 is more or less an 'expansion"") which is good and bad in a way. It is good because it is the game we like, it is bad if you expected major changes. I recondmend the game to anyone that likes complex turn based strategy games. Great game!			"

												Great game once you get the basics of it. It's a bit like Dota or LoL where you have to know pretty much everything about the game to actually win. Although the game might seem difficult at first, all you really need to do is research spells that your nation excells at and then make sure each army has a few mages to turn the tide of every battle. What caught my attention most about this game is how certain civilizations are based on real life civilizations. For example, Machaka represents Great Zimbabwe, Ermor is Rome, Berytos is ancient Carthage, Tien 'Chi is ancient China, and C'tis is based on ancient Egypt, etc. On another note, you get to rule as a god, how awesome is that!? The game gets really addicting after a while and it's a bit hard to put down, although the game is supposed to be multiplayer based, the AI is solid and creates an interesting singleplayer game especially with the new Ascensions game mode. Though the AI is not a good practice tool for Multiplayer, it's mostly a tool for testing pretender chasis and certain spells that catch your eye. If you have a gift card then I definately recommend getting this, otherwise, wait until the price goes down (as $35 is a hefty price tag for this game) and hopefully when that happens, the game will be better balanced and patched up.

												Dominions is simple yet complicated. This board game-esque turn-based strategy game features a massive amount of different units, varying factions that all specialize in various areas, randomly generated maps,  and even the ability to create your own factions and gods. The premise is relatively simple, you are a God who is battling other gods to ascend as the supreme God Ruler of all existence and the AI will not go easy on you. Trust me, I've played both the 3rd and the 4th games and the AI has beaten me senseless almost every time I've played. I highly suggest the game as the gameplay is relatively fast paced for a TBS and as such is incredibly addicting. You'll be hard-pressed to close the game when it'll only take 4 more turns to conquer the Undead guys. Definitely recommended.			"

												Dominions 4 will dominate your waking life, and soon enough your dream time as well. It is simply the most intricate, intriguing, and deep fantasy strategy game around. You could play this game a lifetime long and probably still not exhaust the combinations of viable and fun strategies for conquering the world.So with that totally unqualified and exuberant approval out of the way, it must also be said that this is one of the most maddening games around, in terms of interface, AI and certain functions. Despite substantial interface improvements in Dominions 4 over the previous version, there remains far too much micromanagement. A few additional tools would greatly assist - like automatic pooling of blood slaves (as happens with gems), automated forwarding of recruits from rear areas, multiple turn path-setting for armies, automated setting of research priorities (ie, research Conjuration 3, than Evocation 4, then Thaumaturgy 1 - without me having to manually adjust each turn). And one thing about movement routines frustrates me constantly - once an enemy army is ""behind your lines"", so to speak, actually pinning it down to a battle is nearly impossible. You move into the province the enemy army is in, but simultaneously the enemy army moves to a different province, and you're caught in a never-ending game of musical chairs. Even if your army is ""faster"", or should be faster. I'd love it if there were some more sophisticated move mechanics or orders, like ""move to block any enemy army that moves to any adjacent province"". And I'd also love more stats. And a less silly AI. And... Seriously, just get the game. And clear out the next year or so of your life.			"

												I read good reviews on this game, some saying that it was the best 4x game in existence. So I picked it up and convinced some friends to get it; then I bought it for another friend. Get it.Super complex, but simple. You set up formations for troops before battle, but other than that it's like Total War overmap or a simplistic Civ with preset diplomacy (either you're on someone's team or you're not).You mix and share dominion, which is the power your god eminates. Together, you can be strong. Or, you can rip each other apart with violating differences.			"

It takes a good bit of time to really start learning what you're doing, and even more time to start learning the basics of what you can do with your strategy, and almost twenty hours in and I'm still figuring out how things work.And that is the absolute beauty of it. It's a game where you can experiment and learn, figure out new strategies, new ways to do things, new tactics to try, new setups to run with... I don't know of very many other games at all that can really let you do that as deeply as Dominions 4 will. "

Also, in this scenario, Napoleon Bonaparte is one of 7 people you need to kill to become God, and if left alive he will inevitably turn on you.			"

												I've got 108 listed hours on this game but that's only because I've got a folder for batch SP/MP starts for practice.  I play the hell out of this game and it's still unbelievably challenging (especially in multiplayer) and interesting.  There are still nations that I haven't even played, much less effectively.What I will say is that it's not as fresh as it was.  I've begun to find it tedious practicing expansion, and I only do it when I feel inspired.  It's definitely worth it but it doesn't look like it to a lot of people, and it's not a perfect game - it's just deep and complex and grand.  I have friends who don't like the lack of control in battle, particularly since the AI can sometimes leave a lot to be desired.But even as a relatively casual player these days I can still recommend this game one hundred percent.The various multiplayer and modding communities (Desura, dom3mods, etc.) make this game for me.  New content and support and guides help get both new players and veterans out of the gate to start experiencing the game - which is where you really start to develop an understanding of the nuance.My suggestion to you is to buy it when it's on sale, and play it with your friends (who did the same).  Great way to play with and against humans before stumbling into a major community where you will lose often - in a game that usually has 8-20 players, a 15-20% win rate is pretty high.Go have Dagon lead lovecraftian shamblers out of the ocean to crush the egyptian lizardmen who are flanked by Jotun frost giants and dinosaur-riding amazons.

												Dominions 4 is an awesome turn-based strategy game, somewhat combining province-based strategy games with Master of Magic and Warhammer Fantasy Battles. While it does have a somewhat clunky shell (e.g., UI controls via the keyboard that you actually need to read the manual for and/or watch other play), it is actually not too hard to learn, but has a lot of depth and provides the cliche ""hard to master,"" especially when playing with/against others.

I've played each incarnation of Dominions, though Dominions II most definitely stole my soul.  Luckily, I have a decent familial support group who pray on a daily basis for my errant ways to end.  After several seasons I have been called back into the material plane and, though my dominion fades, my black labrador prophet has has built temples of chew toys in my honor.

Great way to play with and against humans before stumbling into a major community where you will lose often - in a game that usually has 8-20 players, a 15-20% win rate is pretty high.Go have Dagon lead lovecraftian shamblers out of the ocean to crush the egyptian lizardmen who are flanked by Jotun frost giants and dinosaur-riding amazons.  It's pretty cool.			"

												I highly recommend this to anyone who likes RTS, or Turn based games, mythology, or has an imagination. Its super easy to mod, ( you only need to make 2d pictures, and write on a notepad) and easy to play, you can jump right in and start making units and conquering territory, though you may or may not win on your first try. The scope of the game is limited by nothing but your imagination and your ability to write in features. Don't think your troops are strong enought, look at a mod someone made, copy it to fit your needs, and before you know it your meek empire of tree loving hippies is spitting fire and stronger then giants.

												Not only one of the deepest and most expansive games in the strategy genre but also one absolutely brimming with rich and unique lore that ties the whole experience together. Even if the game wasn't practically limitless as far as strategy goes, the extensive mythological and theological research that composes the game's universe, reflected in the lore, is probably worth the price of admission alone.Sure, you will see bad reviews but the fact is that the vast majority of them are made by people that simply didn't bother or couldn't manage to understand the game. You'll see comments about the lack of a tutorial (which is stupid, as a single cursory glance at the manual or ingame menus would reveal,) or things like the ""lack of control"" during battles (which again is stupid since the very core of combat is understanding unit strengths, positioning and scripting.) You'll see people whine that units are samey even if a couple games with different nations would prove otherwise. Likewise they have complained that the unit roster of each nation is limited, blissfully unaware that most every one has access to tons of summons, including nation unique ones. The list goes on and on and every single review in that vein is both as much a testament to laziness as it is pathetic.The game has some problems, for sure, but they are seldom tied to content aside from a fairly rudimentary AI that doesn't have access to the breadth of tactics that a real opponent would. The interface can be clunky and micromanagent tough IF you don't bother to read the hotkeys reference. Setting up a live multiplayer game can be confusing the first time you do it (although not if you are used to running a server in any other game,) back to the AI issue it has no built-in way to do diplomacy or trading so during single player games you won't have that option. Units are plentiful but without careful reading it can be easy to miss why they should or should not be used at a given moment and chances are that at the beginning and at least at some point you will have to look up information on how to play a particular nation.In multiplayer the game's AI problems are alleviated and the game shines to its full potential. There is simply no other game that offers as much variety in troops and strategies thanks to the combination of  pretender god options, the inherent strenghts and weakness of each nation and the plethora of spells plus equipment that you can research on top of whatever the map and the game's random events might bestow upon you. For example; even if you follow the absolute same strategy in two different games, in one game you might find territory that comes with independent mages or summons that can give you access to entirely different magic schools and in the process completely change how you go on about the game. In the same vein; the game has over two thousand random events that can range from national heroes appearing at your door to hellish portals opening somewhere in the world and letting demons pour out unchecked.Something else that I haven't seen a single negative review touch upon is the fact that the game has a pretty extensive modding community. Mods can do everything from adding completely new nations to tweaking the so often called too easy AI. There's lots of balance tweaks, tools, nations based on other popular franchises, sprite changes, magic changes, even a mod that grabs bits and pieces of sprites to easily create entirely new nations with randomized units. Of course, there's also hundreds upon hundreds of user created maps both made by hand and created with the game's random map maker so the game is not bereft of content at any point.On the matter of patches the game is still supported often and has undeniable gotten better with time. Since release there's been three new nations released for free, with at least one more coming soon. Other nations have been reworked to be made more competitive and flavorful as well; each and every one of these updates coming with a brand new batch of sprites, events and spells. Tons of bugs have been fixed, quality of life UI improvements have been added and even the AI is slowly being reworked to be more competitive as well. Since the development team is quite small, it is hard to tell for how long or not they might support the game but at this point in time we've come close to two years and with not a drop of paid DLC rearing its head. The price tag might seem a bit hefty mostly because of the graphics, but considering this game and its content can stand toe to toe with any AAA strategy game, it is more than reasonable.In conclusion I think there's really no reason to skip this game. As long as you are not  in a rush to immediately go into a game and fail to give the manual and ingame menus even the slightlest little check, you will avoid 90% of the problems that the game is supposed to have.

												This is a deep fantasy TBS game with a relatively steep learning curve.  It is well worth the effort to learn.  If you enjoy this sort of game and have not played previous Dominions games, I *strongly* recommend it.  This is true even considering the high price tag for what is essentially a niche indie game.  You will enjoy a unique and well-crafted strategy game.  It is well worth it!  However, I am personally disappointed that it is only a small upgrade from Dominions 3.  The interface is much better and everything is cleaner.  But gameplay-wise, it is virtually identical with only a few new features.  This is a shame because - while the game is indeed quite well designed - it does have areas that could have been improved or redesigned.  For instance, the spell research system could be done better, the spell circles could feel less generic, and there is certainly room for more spells and more interesting spells.  Likewise, although Prentender customization (A Prentender is your nation's god who is vying to become the one true god) is one of the most fun parts of the game, an even deeper system would be appreciated.  Yet it is essentially unchanged from Dominions 3.  Furthermore, I would have loved to see even basic diplomacy and trading introduced to the series.  As it stands, there is only war between you and the other nations unless they are on your team from the start.  Additionally, while graphics are not important in this sort of game, it is still disappointing that they are mostly unchanged from Dominions 3.  There are some higher-res sprites and the 3D ground combat textures are slightly higher resolution, but it really looks pretty much the same.  Sadly, there are still no overworld spell visual effects; Dominions should take a page from Master of Magic.  Even basic overworld spell effects would make spellcasting much more satisfying!  Overall, I felt as though there were many missed opportunities for improvement.  I felt like I was playing Dominions 3.5, not Dominions 4.     So if you own Dominions 3, is it worth the price tag?  Well, if you play a lot and want a better interface with a few new features, then yes.  Just don't expect much of a change in actual gameplay.  I just hope these talented developers can provide a more substantial update in the next iteration of this wonderful series.			"

												Turn Based Strategy / Fantasy*Bug FreeOverall 4 out of 5Complexity 4Graphics 2Immersive 5Inovative 4Game Pace 1This was probably the best game I got to know by Steam recommendation.It took me a while to figure out how it works, as it's not an easy to play game as we got use to in the last decade, but if you take the time to start over a few times and learn, it's absolutly worth the money.This is a turn base strategy game with a slow pace, every turn counts and it starts getting more complicated with time. The most fun comes to me from the mages and priest, it's very hard to decide if you'll put them to research new magics, cast rituals to summon undear or animal armies, search for hidden magical places, craft magical items to your commanders or even empower their own skills to to all the above more awsomely.Another thing that I really like is that you can build new fortress, casltes, temples and labs wherever you want. So you are not stuck with what you find, you can actually use the geography in combination to fortresses and create an effective defense to your lands. Every territory is an oportunity for recruting and resources.If you like turn based, complex and flexible strategy games, go for it.It's not for the people who wants to manually drive the troops in combat or that are looking the cool graphics.

												I caught wind of this game really by accident while searching for something new to play. I have to say it must have been serendipity because this game is fantastic! It plays like a very complicated board game, which is why the graphics are not necessarily state of the art - but they don't need to be. What this game lacks in graphical horsepower it makes up for with brilliant game mechanics. The level of detail the designers put into each of the game mechanics and how they made a tremendous effort to ensure they each fit with the lore and setting of the game is amazing. For instance, a unit equipped with a spear can deflect incoming melee attacks from enemies equipped with a shorter melee weapon, such as a sword. Archers' arrows don't just hit or miss an enemy unit - they actually take into account the spread of the arrows over a target area.The lore setting is also extremely unique. You are a pretender god vying to be the ONLY god. You can choose from a large number of deities each with their own special characteristics. Add on top of that about two dozen different civilizations you can match you deity up with...and on top of that there are three separate ages you can start from each with different environmental settings - you get the picture for the level of depth in this game. Others have mentioned the user manual being a critical part of this game. It is. And yes it's long at about 400 pages, but about 300 pages of that are just reference tables for all the different units, spells, items, etc. I have to give the designers credit again here, because not only is this the most comprehensive user manual I have ever seen in a video game, but it's actually easy and fun to read! I've played other board games where the rulebook was a tenth the size but incredibly hard to read (I'm looking at you Republic of Rome!).I definitely recommend this game for anyone that enjoys master strategy games like Europa Universalis and perhaps the Total War series. Probably the best way to describe this game is a healthy mixture of Civilization, Europa Universalis, Heroes of Might and Magic and Total War. The first hour or so I was a bit lost, but read the manual and you'll quickly pick up on the game mechanics and an appreciation for the level of depth and endless replayability of this game.			"

												First and foremost, while I heartily recommend this game, I must underline that this game is NOT for everyone.First impressions for most people are horrible: the graphics are dated, the audio gets irritating after a short while and the user interface is one of the worst I've ever had to deal with - although there are few very welcome improvements over Dominions 3. Single player doesn't really offer much of a challenge either, once you understand the basics of the game. As a single player game, I would rate Dominions series as one of the worst I've ever played.Where Dominions 4 shines though, is multiplayer. Despite the simplistic basics, it's easily one of the most complex MP games out there. The variety of nations is quite large, each era plays differently due to different units and varying access to magic paths and while there are obviously ""generally accepted strategies"" for each nation, each of them can be played in very varied ways depending on scales and pretender choice.The game has very steep learning curve, but there is a wealth of information to be found quite easily - google is your friend here. I would personally recommend checking out some let's plays, playing single-player game until you grasp the basics and then try and find a newbie game to join on one of the forums (Desura's Dom4 forums worked fine for me).

												Dominions is a very meaty game.  It is, hands down, the most comprehensive fantasy war game that is available.  That being said, it is not an easy game to play.  It is a game that you must learn to play.  It is definitely a ""no skill cap"" game.  If you want to win, it should be easy enough to find a guide that will explicitly give you a strategy that will steamroll any AI out there, but to me the true fun of Dominions is the freedom you have to play the kind of nation you want.Do you want to play as a nation of reptilian necromancers who worship a massive crocodillian devourer of souls?  How about a nation of reptilian necromancers who worship a stone monolith that blesses its followers with unearthly quickness and undying vitality?  How about a nation of mermen who worship a massive electrical octopus . . . IA IA SHOKTOPUS !Let me say a few words about the graphics.  At first glance, to the modern eye, the graphics might suck.  However, once you realize that the creators have lovingly crafted graphics for 1,500+ characters, you will have some appreciation for their lo-fi style.  A steep learning curve, endless replayability, and a cult following: is Dominions 4 the game for you?			"

I haven't tried multiplayer that, from what I read and imagine, is the best part of the game.This game is highly enjoyable and highly addicting, the just one more turn curse has ruined all my nights since I bought it.The graphics are bad, but for grand strategy is doesn't matter. In combat you give orders to your armies and then you can see the batle but not give new comands. The complexity of diferent units and nations and pretender is amazing.If you like CK, if you remenber and enjoyed that old strategy game Centurio, if you like long and complex games, if you like theorycrafting I think you wille enjoy this game.

												This is one of the best games i have ever played and i know i will continue to enjoy playing this. It has tons of replay ablity as every game is different and there are almost 100 nations spread across 3 ages. Each age is different as well. The early age being the more magical age and the late age being less magic and more tech advanced (when i say tech i mean better armour weapons etc.) magic is still around in the late age however. Magic in this game is very powerful but you can win without it. So if you want a Magic nation only you can do that and wipe all other god's nations off the map with massive lighting bolts OR if you dont want to use any magic you can, you can send 1000 of troops head on into battles (which can get massive). Dominions 4 can be quite difficult as well. I have yet to do online so i cant rate that but the single-player against Ai can be very diffcult as it is not dumb and provides a good challenge. At first Dominions 4 is overwhelming but its a grand stratagy game and so if you take it slow you will do fine and have a great time as I have. There are random generated maps as well as drawn maps and you can create your own which is always fun. The Graphics may not be the best but the content BY FAR makes up for that. Since you control the nation there are very few limitations, if you want to be an evil blood god/nation go ahead, or if you want to be a good orderly god/nation you can. The depth in this game... just wow i have almost 300 hours and i still have not played every nation or seen nearly everything, i think its safe to say ive only scratched the tip of the iceberg. When i discovered Dominions 4 it was like finding the game of my dreams.			"

The interface improvements do matter, and help to cut down the micromanagement inherent in the game, but there is still a fair amount of turn to turn management that you need to engage in which would be nice to automate. Perhaps the biggest thing to be aware of in this game is that singleplayer is very lacking. The game has a huge amount of depth, thousands of units, hundreds of items and spells; all of which the AI is unable to effectively employ. So if you get this game and intend to play any significant amount, look to get involved with multiplayer. Those are the game's primary flaws, for everything else Dominions delivers nicely. Each of the different nations plays differently from it's peers, and most have sereveral viable paths to pursue as the game developes. The game escalates from small numbers of spearmen fighting eachother to angels and dead gods slugging it out in a world where the sun has been snuffed out by magic. If you can look past the game's quirks, this is a fantastic product with amazing scope and detail. It's well worth your money.			"

												If you want graphics, GTFO. If you want a great game without caring about graphics, welcome. Dominions 4 is one of the best experiences for those who enjoy strategy games. There are a crapton of nations to choose to conquer the world, each with customizeable features such as the growth of your dominion (basically who follows your god) or the heat or cold of your lands. The way you win is up to you, you choose how to win.  In my experience, it is THE most customizeable turn-based strategy I have ever seen. You position your units in your armies, and decide if they will either be in box formation, a long line, and who and how they will attack. You decide how many units go into this army, and who goes into that one. Maybe you want to go in, hacking and slashing with swords and axes. OR, you can defend your mges with your units, and control the battlefield through magic. It's entirely up to you.			"

												Dominions 4 is the latest in the Dominions series. The revisions from Dominions 3 are superficial, but, the core game is still excellent and full of depth. There have been some revisions to gameplay -- new pretenders -- but also some minor revisions to spells and some new maps. I would suggest this game but implore owners of Dominions 3 to buy it on sale owing to the extremely minor alterations from Dominions 3.			"

												Dominions 4 is an in-depth, involved, immersive game that harkens back to the good old days of turn-based fantasy empire gaming. Tasked with taking the place of the now absent creator of the universe, your character (known as a Pretender God) seeks to become the new, true God. You must build armies, research a huge range of spells, and vanquish rival Pretenders to claim the ultimate prize in creation.I really, really like this game. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling of nostalgia with the graphics, sound effects and just how much depth and substance is here. There's no glitz and dazzle with funky graphics to glamour you. Their are hundreds of spells in several different schools (such as Air, Earth, Fire, Water and darker paths like Death and Blood magic) which can be researched and used to advance your claim to Godhood. Your character can be anything from a wizened old crone, to a titan of the underworld, to a dragon, cyclops, divinely-created bull and many, many more things. This game is worth the price-tag, once you have this you don't need any other strategy games anymore, because this one has enough content to keep you going for a long time. It has a steep learning curve, so be prepared for that, but all the best games are the ones that take a while to get the hang of. Highly recommended to anyone who loves in-depth, fantasy turn-based strategy games.I give it 9.6 out of 10.			"

												Used an army of Lizardkin, Deer Warriors, Wolf Scouts, Monkeys, Lionwarriors, and soldiers riding dinosaurs to conquer the last civilization of Mankind. Replay value, 9.5/10. Overall value: 9/10. The spells, the content, and the potential endless campaigns in this game make it a favourite. I used underwater nations at first to get the idea of how it's played by resticting what I could actually do. Once I understood research, building, and patrolling armies around, expanding whenever possible (especially if my dog has influence) the game started to go from interesting, to an all out obsession of gameplay. It's so in depth but lacks that modern visual for good reason. Maybe a mod will change that in the future.			"

												An incredibly deep turn-based strategy game with fascinating and deligtfully detailed game lore. A very steep early learning curve that once surmounted gives way to hundreds of hours of gameplay. Most intriguing and complicated magic system that I've ever seen in a strategy game. As for cons, there are many. Single player AI is remarkably useless creation that in battle contends itself with throwing completely random selections troop at you, with no ability to plan strategies or conduct diplomacy. Make no mistake, Dominons 4 is a multiplayer game to the bone, and much of it's lasting appeal is directly in proportion to how much you enjoy scheming and devicing strategies for beating human players. The multiplayer system itself is frankly archaic, requiring the hosting of an old-fashioned game server for other players to connect to and upload their turns to specific games. Individual matches might run for months at a time. The magic system while complex, is daunting to master and requires memorization of the vast spell lists to properly use. There are numerous exploitable mechanics that are slow to get fixed, as well as a plethora of bugs.Despite all it's flaws, Dominions 4 is still a true gem for turn-based strategy fans. It's quite unpolished and with decidedly indie production values, but with deep and rewarding mechanics.			"

												Very good gameThis game is a bit of a logistical nightmareThere are a ton of things to keep in mind and any unit that is is recruited from the ""commander"" tab can be micromanaged like crazy. From you little scouts to your super commanders and generals this applies to summoned commanders too of course. There are too many things to cover but here are some footnotes.Lots of myth. If you like old slav/viking/greek/roman/lovecraft and a lot more mythology this game will probably cover it.Huge variety in everything which makes for tons of strange combinations. Turns are resolved at once but at least its turn based so you have time to think on what you should do.Stats stats stats stats if you are a min maxer you will have a lot of time to do that.Lots of flavor which is what games that sacrifice graphics need.Warnings.Obviously the graphics.Your troops fight for you, you yourself DONT control them you position them and order them what to do.The tutorial in the manual will get you going but you will inevitably begin researching this game.This game shines in multiplayer. The diplomacy against ai is non existent but pretty funny versus players.Have fun and don't get overwhelmed Its turn based don't forget.			"

The learning curve is somewhat steep, but if you don't mind watching a few basic tutorials and/or gameplay videos, and doing a bit of research, you'll be in for a ride with Dominions 4. I'm actually a bit sad I've rediscovered this game after initially being overwhelmed, as I see it devouring my free time in the near future. Few games can boast having such a wealth of options, tactics, maps, and units, and the AI seems happy to pile armies on you and make things interesting if not difficult. Throw in multiplayer, which I've yet to try, and you have a huge heap of game here. Highly recommended, can't wait to get back to it.			"

												I've got 108 listed hours on this game but that's only because I've got a folder for batch SP/MP starts for practice.  I play the hell out of this game and it's still unbelievably challenging (especially in multiplayer) and interesting.  There are still nations that I haven't even played, much less effectively.What I will say is that it's not as fresh as it was.  I've begun to find it tedious practicing expansion, and I only do it when I feel inspired.  It's definitely worth it but it doesn't look like it to a lot of people, and it's not a perfect game - it's just deep and complex and grand.  I have friends who don't like the lack of control in battle, particularly since the AI can sometimes leave a lot to be desired.But even as a relatively casual player these days I can still recommend this game one hundred percent.The various multiplayer and modding communities (Desura, dom3mods, etc.) make this game for me.  New content and support and guides help get both new players and veterans out of the gate to start experiencing the game - which is where you really start to develop an understanding of the nuance.My suggestion to you is to buy it when it's on sale, and play it with your friends (who did the same).  Great way to play with and against humans before stumbling into a major community where you will lose often - in a game that usually has 8-20 players, a 15-20% win rate is pretty high.Go have Dagon lead lovecraftian shamblers out of the ocean to crush the egyptian lizardmen who are flanked by Jotun frost giants and dinosaur-riding amazons.

												Hasn't your ego always told you, you are special? The one? Forget that, here you can try to become a god. But beware the others try to become the same. ;-)I am playing strategy games for decades now and in my view Dominions 4 is one of the best games of this genre. Why? Because it offers possibilities, strategies and tactics beyond anything you have seen in other games. It is a very complex beast and you have to dive in if you want to understand what is going on there and it has lousy but functional graphics but who cares? If you do dive in, you find an extremely rewarding, challenging and - in the best sense - complex game. If you are interested in the game but the graphics or the complexity are preventing you from buying it, at least give a lets play series a try. There you will get a glimpse what you can do in this game and that is nearly unfathomable. It is just great. Give it a try, mates!This is the game that is giving you strategic possibilities second to none. If there were an award for best strategy game of all times, this one would be one of the candidates for me.			"

The game is pretty complicated but it didn’t take me more than a day to be a pretty decent dominions gamer. I would highly recommend buying this game the price is a little high but the game is really worth all the money. Also I recommend going on YouTube for dominions tutorials this will get you started. I could spend hours telling you all the awesome complexity that comes with this game but I’m just going to say simply find out for yourself and buy this game right now you won’t regret it.			"

												I've been playing Dominions (Started with DOM3 3 years ago) for a while now, and it remains the Best. Game. I've. Ever. Played. Dominions 4 is a big upgrade to 3, with a better interface, many more nations, spells, artifacts and events, and, while its graphics get their share of abuse, the gameplay is deeper than the Marianas Trench. Be advised: While playing against the improved AI is a challenge, playing against people is something else entirely. If you aren't fully familiar with the nation you're playing, it'll feel a little like slo-motion DOTA 2.			"

												i love this game. it's easily one of the most intricate strategy games i've ever played. don't let the graphics fool you, this game easily has just as much content (if not more) as any Civ game or other turn based strategy game. i haven't finished either of the games i've started, but the almost overwhelming number of civilizations/deities to play as as well as how much they affect the gameplay itself makes this game a little hard to grasp at first. there are just so many options. tons of world maps and different civs each with their own playstyle. there are underwater nations (mind-blowing) and magic based nations, and evil nations, warlike nations, monk like nations, all kinds of nations. there are several different schools of magic as well and each nation is better at some types than others but all nations can research any type of spells. you also get to create your own deity to play as and they act like a beefed up version of your nations commanders, but what's really cool is that it doesn't matter what nation you pick, you can have them ruled over by any kind of god. dragons, fish, undead liches, stone monoliths, etc. and whatever form your deity takes affects their abilities as well. and beyond all that, the different nations also have climate preferences. some like it hot, some like it cold, some like it in between and if they're outside their comfort zone, they suffer a slight penalty in combat and defense. you can control your individual armies' tactics and formations and you'll have to because there's a lot more depth to the combat than just unit strength or weapon power. some really powerful armies can get crushed by a smaller, weaker army if they have the right weapons or mages/spells. honestly, i don't know of another turn-based strategy game that has as much variety and depth to it as this game does. it's not just raising armies and researching new spells-you also have to build up and maintain an empire made up of several smaller zones and if you don't build and maintain infrastructure and defenses between them, you're going to mowed down not just by your opponent(s) but by the neutral natives on every map.in short, this game has so much content to it, that it has a bit of a steep learning curve, but once you get past it and figure out what you're supposed to be doing, you'll likely have as much of a blast playing it as i do.

												A very innovative strategy game with a wide variety of interesting factions. It has an detailed and diverse lore based on various real mythologies and cultures. Battles take place in real time, and manage to apply an old school rpg feel (isometric 2d sprites rolling dice at eachother) to a concept of large scale battles. The number of factions, units, magic spells, and the customization of your god means there are almost limitless strategic possibilities.This game probably gets lower numeric review scores because dominions 4 isn't much different from dominions 3, which isn't much different than dominions 2. I agree with this criticism, so if you own Dominions 3 the pricetag is not worth the upgrade. For anyone else interested in mythology and TBS wargames, a very unique and fun experience.			"

Dominions 4 contains alot of strategy elements as well as the ability to change which units are in which squad and how each squad lays out. Although the grapichs may seem hideous and horrbile the main thing about the game is the amazing and awsome strategy that it uses to allow players to use there mind against their foes.			"

												Dominions 4 is just one of those games that sure, it doesn't have the amazing graphics of say Civilization or Europa Universalis but it makes up for that with a lot of depth, a ton of content and great replayability. The plotline for the game is fairly basic; Essentially each player is a godlike being called a Pretender, each controls a loyal nation and is battling to become the Pantokrator, or supreme god. To do this a pretender can either do it one of three ways; The first way is to conquer your enemies with vast armies which can take a long time depending on some of the maps, spreading your religion to the point it extinguishes the power of your rivals religion or the new victory condition for this installment, capturing the required number of Thrones of Ascension. Each throne grants you a special perk so to speak and also adds strategy to what provinces you conquer and when. Each nation exists in either one of three ages, sometimes all three. The sheer amount of units in this game is astounded and every single nation in the game is based on history, mythology or fantasy tropes (Although there are no stereotypical Elves or Dwarves at all really.) One of the best parts of the game is also the manual which not only contains information on how to play the game, but it also contains little bits of lore, developer commentary on the different nations and an entire roster of every unit in the game. It is even updated to consider in updates and patches. There is too much content for me to state in this review but the last thing I will say is this; If you enjoy turn based strategy games that give you that ""One More Turn"" mentality and you can look past the dated graphics then this game is well worth the $35 asking price.

												So i came into this game expecting conquest of elysium but more complex, but that didnt prepare me for the amount of complexity. I'm leaving a good review, but my stance is more neutral. The game doesn't do a whole lot to teach you whats going on, and the overworld map is riddled with confusing icons and text. I'm sure that if I had put in a lot of time I would've ended up loving this game, but I don't feel like a game where I need to study to play is worth it.			"

The variations on troops and pretender gods insure that the game is different each time.I have been playing this game daily since I bought it. With each race and god playng a different way, mastering them all is a challenge. This is more than a simple strategy game, it is conquest by changing the minds of the people (or creatures or whatever is living in each province) to follow you and only you. This is truly an enjoyable game that will keep me coming back every time to play.			"

It's very deep but kept streamlined so it's not too confusing, you play as a god which you can customise and your god can be things such as a rock, a pile of bones and a fountain aswell as many mythological creatures, there is also TONS of factions to play as, Lizardmen, Rome, Witches, Cthuluhu, you name it and it's probably in this game. The objective is to control the world and take over new provencies similar to EU4 or CK2, yet with more of an empire building theme similar to Civ V, would recommend.

												It's like HoMM with more game mechanics. Turn based strategy on large maps that involve dozens to hundreds of units in a single army.Combat is automated, but setting formations and outfiting commanders with gear is a big aspect of gameplay, as is researching magical spells.There is no diplomacy in singleplayer. You cannot form alliances and game modes generally encourage total conquest.The setting is mix of mythology, high fantasy, and historical fiction playable races range from semi-historical cultures such as Authurian Brits, Bureaucratical Chinese, Bloodthirsty Aztecs, and Steel Worshiping Swiss to more fantasy races such as Lava Men, Cave People, Lovecraftian Ocean Dwellers, and Undead Theocracies. Unfortunately micromanagement becomes a nightmare when you have tons of generals since there's no order queuing. The game has a ton of hotkeys and you'll have to read the 275 page manual to find them all.The funnest way to play, in my opinion, is to play on a huge map with a ton of races. Everyone will carve little enclaves and you won't have to worry about overwhelmed mid-game because everyone is fighting 3-5 sided wars.			"

Call back undead and insane gods from the lower planes to destroy your opponents (when they aren't busy staring at the stars?).  Yep.  Your options are bit more limited in multiplayer, as many options are simply too inefficient to lead to victory, but of course the competition and joy of multiplayer games make the greater limitation worth it (and you still have a ton of options to take you to victory, but not as much of a ""sandbox"" feel as single player).If you like turn based strategy, and like fantasy, you really can't go wrong here.

Sorta is like civilization but I like it better than civilization.  The price is high , but worth the buy if you like strategy games.  Unlike some reviews I read ....there is a instuction manual but I havn't even needed to use it. If you played as many strategy games as me ...how hard could it be to build up a kingdom and take over a map.  Lots of different style empires. This games like a nice brain massage! Doesn't seem like it's going to be quick for me to win the whole map either. There's quite a challenge especially if your on a map with lots of computer players.  So I hope this helps and gives credit to the makers thanks for a great game and hope ya grow and create more strategy games.			"

												While this game does have a very steep learning curve, it's definitely worth learning. The gameplay is solid, and I enjoy the graphics and music, but it's really the mechanics that fascinate me most with this game. There's so much depth and customization, and you can even find a modding manual on illwinter's website. That means you can customize the pretender god you play, the nation worshipping said god, the individual units recruited by that nation, and even the weapons and armor available to individual units. It's quite literally staggering. The price looks somewhat steep, but considering it's an indie game with a very small staff, I can sympathize. Try it out, chances are you'll find more than a few things you like.One more thing I can say is that if you're still doubtful because of the price tag, go ahead and try playing the Dominions 3 demo first. You can find it at Illwinter's website, and rest assured that dominions 4 is somehow even better than its predecessor, so if you enjoy dom3, then dom4 will be great.			"

Unlike some reviews I read ....there is a instuction manual but I havn't even needed to use it. If you played as many strategy games as me ...how hard could it be to build up a kingdom and take over a map.  Lots of different style empires. This games like a nice brain massage! Doesn't seem like it's going to be quick for me to win the whole map either. There's quite a challenge especially if your on a map with lots of computer players.  So I hope this helps and gives credit to the makers thanks for a great game and hope ya grow and create more strategy games.			"

												While this game does have a very steep learning curve, it's definitely worth learning. The gameplay is solid, and I enjoy the graphics and music, but it's really the mechanics that fascinate me most with this game. There's so much depth and customization, and you can even find a modding manual on illwinter's website. That means you can customize the pretender god you play, the nation worshipping said god, the individual units recruited by that nation, and even the weapons and armor available to individual units. It's quite literally staggering. The price looks somewhat steep, but considering it's an indie game with a very small staff, I can sympathize. Try it out, chances are you'll find more than a few things you like.One more thing I can say is that if you're still doubtful because of the price tag, go ahead and try playing the Dominions 3 demo first. You can find it at Illwinter's website, and rest assured that dominions 4 is somehow even better than its predecessor, so if you enjoy dom3, then dom4 will be great.			"

												It goes without saying that graphically speaking, this game isn't designed to reach out and grab you.  The base mechanics are solid though.  I enjoy the lore to all the Pretenders, the units and factions, the random heroes that show up.  I like it.  Yus.			"

												This game very nearly got a ""NO"" from me, due solely to its cost. It is good, but it is by no means worth as much as they are charging for it. I decided against that, however, because how much money a player is willing to throw around will vary greatly from one to the next, and I want this review to be based solely on the experience of playing the game, rather than on the experience of buying it.The game is very complex, and you will probably have to play several times before you are even aware of all of the options available to you during play. There are many factions to choose from, and some of them play quite differently from others. I have probably spent as many hours reading the 400+ page manual as I have browsing through the character creation screens, designing ""pretender gods"". If you saw the screenshots, and didnt lose interest immediately, then you very likely are the kind of player who can set aside graphics for depth of content, and this game will reward your attitude.If I were to seek to complain, two things would come to mind. ONE: the user interface could really use some work. There are many icons which can be clicked which give absolutely no indication of it, and many things you would think were interactable which serve no function at all. It is very easy to lose track of an army or leader, and then discover him again 40 turns later, only to realize hes gone to waste all that time. And TWO: much of the depth of this game is merely superficial. Many units are near carbon copies of others, only a single stat apart, and once you throw them both into a battle, you wont see any difference. You can research volumes of spells, and build hundreds of items, but most of these things will ""come out in wash"", as they say, proving to be mere distractions when it comes right down to it... although I certainly enjoyed being distracted, as such.If you get a boner looking through pages and pages of stats and lore, while micromanaging every tiny aspect of a massive and complex empire, than you are going to love the hell out of Dominions 4. If you want to learn to play a game you spent 40 bucks on, in less than 10 hours, then you will hate it. Its worth a second look if its on sale, but I have a hard time recommending this at full price... not when Age of Wonders 3 is only 5 bucks more, and is easily just as deep but with far better graphics and combat mechanics, to boot.

The variety of the over 75 factions ( which are expandable throu user created ones) and the vast amount of units and magic are just astonishing. I just scratched the top of the iceberg whilst my 6 hours playing and I can only imagine how awesome rounds of multiplayer will be. "

												Simple to play but has many subtle complexities that make the game a challenge. The variations on troops and pretender gods insure that the game is different each time.I have been playing this game daily since I bought it. With each race and god playng a different way, mastering them all is a challenge. This is more than a simple strategy game, it is conquest by changing the minds of the people (or creatures or whatever is living in each province) to follow you and only you. This is truly an enjoyable game that will keep me coming back every time to play.			"

												The game looks like it was made in MS:Paint but if you can look past that then this is a fantastic game. It's very deep but kept streamlined so it's not too confusing, you play as a god which you can customise and your god can be things such as a rock, a pile of bones and a fountain aswell as many mythological creatures, there is also TONS of factions to play as, Lizardmen, Rome, Witches, Cthuluhu, you name it and it's probably in this game. The objective is to control the world and take over new provencies similar to EU4 or CK2, yet with more of an empire building theme similar to Civ V, would recommend. Did I mention you can play as a rock?			"

												I'v spent some time playing this game and I enjoyed  it. If you like war and strategy games combined with the myth and lore of hundreds of Soldiers,Creatures and Gods from over 50 differn't civilizations.Theres Medusa's and Dragons, Giant Kraken's and Undead armys. Raising Demons and using hundreds of magic spells to give your army the advantage.You play a demigod, trying to reach godhood by killing other rival demigods or claiming the thrones of accension. these options are left open to the player.There is 3 ages that effect playstyle and the races that existEarly Age---Lots of magic and Fantasy. Very little in strong weapons or siege enginesMiddle Age--- some magic and decent weapons and iron few siege enginesLate Age--- Magic mostly a dead art, Steel weapons and powerful units, Siege Engines widly usedTheres a few maps but more can be found online at places who make mods for this game. Same goes for custom units and races. The only bad thing that can really be said about this game is some balance issues with races and the graphics arn't anything to write home about but it does have a specific art style.In the end a must have for anyone who loves myths and legend and is a strategy fan. Hope you will enjoy this game as much as I did :)			"

												This game is deep and the attention to detail is quite simply one of the best I've seen in any game. You can always tell by the little details if a developer has really worked on this as a labour of love and this one shines through in many different ways, for example I was amazed to see the hybrids I spawned would have slightly randomized sprites, some wielding weapons of different types, some just with tentacles and mutations, these weren't just cosmetic and actually carried over into their individual weapon stats and attack types which is pretty awesome considering you can field hundreds if not thousands of units and the game contains 2000+ types total.The simple interface also hides a deep layer of strategy that is further refined by your choices. What age do you choose, map, nation, pretender, their dominion (the buffs/debuffs their territory gives out) and what spells will you specialise in? This combined with the varied playstyles that the dozens of factions encourage, from teleporting amphibious assaults, sneaking blitzkreig attacks and dark summoning rituals means that you can play this game in so many different ways that it never gets old, and you may find yourself shifting tactics several times to win out on the larger maps. I highly recommend giving it a try!			"

												Dominions 4 is an amazing game with alot of depth, don't let the simple graphics and rather obtuse UI tell you otherwise. There are hundreds of units, hundreds of spells and thousands of strategies to use to become the ultimate god. Every nation is different, from the Dominion of Ermor which kills the populace within it's domain in order to fuel it's undead armies, the fire children Abysians which are wreathed in flame and burn their way through their enemies.Even choosing a pretender is a process that can take 10 minutes, each having different stats and magical potential. Some can be built as towering titan bruisers that crush armies beneath their boots, some are powerful wizards that can plunge the entire world into darkness or make their enemies lungs fill with water.Seriously, put a little bit of time into this game and you will not regret it.

												Great game if you love strategy games. Very deep with lots of replayability!More hours into this game than any other game at least since steam has been tracking it. I also played on desura for at least a hundred hours. I think a good measure of a strategy game is how many hours you see logged for peoples reviews on here. You are a god! You can make you're own god and pick from many different styles of nations, and fight against other gods,It takes a while to figure out how everything works, since the game is so deep. You can keep upping the difficulty in many ways as you learn how to take advantage of everything you can do. With low difficulty you can have fun before you know all the ins and outs, I would recommend looking at some of the user guides. I haven't really checked out the multiplayer as it seems like it takes a long time, and my play time is sporadic and hard for me to plan.Custom map editor and generator. There are a lot of user made maps to download, and you can generate and modify your own. Also a lot of user created empires, but there is so much already in the game I haven't even downloaded any of it!You can outfit special or summoned units, or thugs as they're refered to. Sea Troll King, many types of demons, liches, giants. It adds an RPG element to the game.One of my favorite games ever!			"

												This is one of the best strategy game I have ever played. Dominions 4 is a fantasy 4x game, heavily focused on warfare and magic development... and a very distinctive God-building system (yes, you are the God of your civilization).In order to achieve your goal (rule over the world destroying your enemies, making of your God faith the only one remaining or claiming several magical sites) you will need more than controlling land and building your armies... You will have to take advantage of your nation strenghts and sinergies, take control of territories with strategic resources and special troops available, and craft special equipment for your commanders, as well as develop your magical level. You can also know what is wrong with your armies as you may actually see the battles you are involved in, knowing this way how your troops are performing, among them and against your enemies.This game has an incredible amount of nations, units, spells, enchantments, equipment... available, which is a guarantee of replayability. Content that is constantly increased by free patches.Though graphics and interface look a bit outdated, this is a very immersive game, with lots of possibilities, and an important community modding it and with lots of multiplayer games active. Highly recommendable.			"

												I love this game ...That said There are 2 fundamental design flaws with it:1. the graphics are horrible ... really really bad ... not not that bad worse far worse ... think 1980's low budget game then wind back your expectations. Good games (imo) arnt all about the graphics but they're bad enough to make it hard to play.2. starting a game you are presented with a dizzying array of nations, gods and possible setups, the most complex part of the game is deciding on your setup - but you really have to understand the game quite well in order to do this, these choices are fundamental and important. There is no guidance in game that helps a new player, the 397 page pdf manual is little or no help (once you find it) googling 'dom4 nation setup' gives lots of forum postings by those who use so many acronyms they're illegible.[e.g. EA Neif Monolith E9A1E6 D6 O3P3C3G1M3D0 - really didnt help me - though now I know the game better I can see is a helpful build suggestion]In short you really have to put work in to get to the point where the game is anything more than a turn based terrirtory domino fall game of conquest.Dominions 4 is however far more than that. Yes you can just pump troops out and spread your gods dominion by attacking and taking over all other gods territories but there is so much more here once you look. Research of spells & items to forge add a lot but other than being a wider available choice you get similar tech tree approaches in many other games. Adding the divine to the game is a somewhat new, interesting and brilliant twist - the aim is not global military dominion but instead for your god to spread his dominion to the world, to spread belief in your god to the exclusion of all other gods. Belief can cross borders stepping right over a turtled mass of troops in a pinch point.As a suggestion:1. find the online pdf manual (linked in guides) play the 9 turn by rote guide to controls (found somewhere about 90 pages in interspersed with irrelevant and unhelpful history of how the game was made and waffle about the designers inspiration for the game.2. Play a Late Age (LA) Nation called Man, dont worry about nation / god setup on a small map against any random land based nation, dont research anything / forge any items just work with longbowmen to get the feel of the game.3. Play an Early Age (EA) Nation called Metlican. Google some setups but the one that works for me is :Demilich (Imprisoned): Water 4 Death 9 Nature 9, Dominion 8 Order 3 Sloth 3 Heat 2 Growth 2 Misfortune 2 Drain 2Set a commander to the spells Blessing / Divine Blessing and work with Jaguar Warriors.Use these to learn the game to the point where you feel comfortable experimenting & understand the forum post acronyms you'll find from google.I hope you enjoy the game as much as I have!

												Do you want to play as a giant, two-headed, amphibious serpent and lead an army of coastal fish-men down to the dark depths of the briny ocean to battle fin-legged mermen led by a giant, half-monster, half-topless woman who summons creatures made out of water to kill your troops? Because this is literally the only video game where that can happen.			"

												It has flaws (such as very slow battle resolution while watched, especially when a lot of hero units are spellcasting, even at turbo speed and a tutorial that is woefully insufficient), however, the meat and potatoes of the game is top notch and sooooo flavorful.  For people who remember Masters of Magic fondly, this will be a real treat.			"

												This game is deep.  There are a huge amount of mechanics and lore embedded into every aspect of the game.  However, it looks and plays like a game from 1994.  While that isn’t a big negative, it certainly doesn’t make this a game to sit and play for hours on end.  Disregard my time spent playing, I think I left this game running for a long time without playing a few times.  My real time spent is probably around 15-20.  It’s a good game to play with the T.V. on in the background, or splitting time between work or school.  All in all, this is a good game but it is not worth thirty-five bucks, no way no how.  Twenty-five, maybe, fifteen is more reasonable.  Pick it up on sale for sure.  Be sure to play it with the sound muted, the music is horrid.			"

												I like pretty graphics. I really do. But despite the somewhat unpretty graphics of the Illwinter games, I think I've sunk more hours into Dominions II than the entire Total War series combined, and Dominions III and IV have only increased my adoration. The Dominions series (and it's sister series Conquest of Elysium) is not for everyone of course. No game is for everyone. But there are free playable demo versions of the titles available, if Steam doesn't provide them just Google it, and if the idea of a TBS game with low-tech but high-depth and high-customization is appealing, then at the very least give these games a shot. If you're anything like me, this title will consume every second of your leisure time for weeks on end, and you'll be glad of it. Also, you can run it on a laptop from the mid-90''s if you have to, and that's more than you can say for a lot of other modern TBS titles. Being a god is fun, give it a try.			"

												What other game can I have a Wolf God go beserk while ripping apart undead roman legionaries.Here's a quick run down of my current game. I'm Vanheim, a Norse-based faction that uses beserkers, shapeshifter, and valkyria. I started in the corner of the map and had an expansive first 10 turns until I till I ran into an water nation. Can't really take their land because of them being underwater so I had a few skirmishes and created a front to hold them off. After another 5-10 turns, the lovely Ermor (faction of undead monstrosities) appeared and decided to throw it's hat in the ring. So now I'm fighting a Two factions at once. Then something important happened that had unwanted effects.

This was a Good victory at the time, but sadly this was a victory for tunnel vision as it left a portion of my front open and let the undead nightmare sweep into my lands with an army just as large. 10/10 wish I wouldn't have jumped the gun on that.			"

												Tired of strategy games that boil down to Gun vs Bigger Gun?Tired of strategies that boil down to 'I'm gonna get SUCH a big number'?\Tired of games where there are hundreds of units, but only three of them are meaningful?Try this game.  Near-fractal in is complexity there are three different 'ages' depending on whether you want your game to revolve around raw magical power or military might backed up by complex strategems.Prep your ground troops to assault a castle while your combat wizards open the ground beneath the enemy army's feet, meanwhile bloody sacrifice summons a demon lord to assist your cause!It has a rather immense learning curve, so I encourage you to hit the wikis and forums for help, but that's the price you pay for such a deep game.

												With nearly infinite variations, a plethora of factions with access to dozens of gods (ranging from dragons to stone pillars, all equally viable) Dominions 4 is an intimidating game to play. My first few hours were spent largely in confusion as I grappled with the sheer number of choices I could make and trying to understand the stats and rules of the units (almost all of which come with a decent back story, making the game exceptionally immersive). I've spent an unhealthy number of hours playing Sid Meiers Civilization series and while it offers superior graphics and accessibility than Dominions, Thrones of Ascension far surpasses Civilization in terms of player immersion and creativity. The vast array of chracters and nations to play is a canvas for the imaginiation, and whether I'm a stationary God-tree or Archmage, leading legions of skeletal soldiers or reptilian wizards, its always a fun time. At least once you leard just what the hell is going on.			"

												I discovered Dominions when it was Dom2.  That game was very hard to understand and play.  Dom3 was much, much better and Dom4 (in my opinion) is a modest improvement.  There is a lot to like about this game: building your god (I really like that part), discovering and using magic, and researching some of the over 800 spells.  Not to mention several dozen different nations to play with and each of those in THREE ages (i.e. different ages of the world).  I don't think it's possible to play the same game twice the same way; there's just too much diversity.It's easy to take this game as a series of battles: win every battle, beat the other god(s) and you win the game.  Wrong!  It is about magic and if you don't utilize magic, you will lose.  That alone makes it a challenging game to understand and play, and win.  I really like that part of the game.But here's the problem for me:  It is a massively detailed micro-manager game.  You have to check every thing in every  province, every turn, and usually every army (or part of an army) every turn, and anything and everything else in every part of the game and almost every part of the map -- every turn!  If you really, really like that in a game, this is one you must buy.  It is fun, and interesting, and deep and complex...but after a while I find it overwhelmingly tedious.			"

												This is my review as a noob to the dominions series, rather than a seasoned expertI'll put my TL:DR at the start for those who want me to get to the point - if you like strategic games, and total war with magic + better AI but less control of combat appeals to you then get this.its a deep game. really deep. intimidating to learn but seeing the battles happen is really satisfying. It's by no means triple A graphics but it doesn't need to be. I think the battle graphics are endearing but the strategic map could use a bit more of a clear UI. At least from the perspective of a noob. However everything on buttons is clearly labelled, its mostly the things on the map that need to be labelled so i can figure out what it means.I highly recommend watching a youtuber explain it first. i did and it really helped clear up some of my questions. the people on the forum are great to ask too. Once you get it, its a fun game to play. I by no means have logged many hours, but i think i've logged enough to post this to people who are wondering what going into the series as someone whos never even heard of it before buying it thinks.My interests align with strategic games. i like EU IV, hearts of iron 3 etc, i used to enjoy the total war games (not so much anymore). i liked gratuitous space battles which funnily enough does have some parralels with how the battles in this game plays out. Its deep, rewarding and difficult. Diffuclty appeals to me greatly as i find nothing more dull than just instant winning so thats another plus for me. I still haven't figured out the optimum strategy of anything by any means but its an ongoing learning process.			"

												10/10 - My go to for procrastination.The game is simple enough to play through the first time and crush the AI on easy using some surface elements.  After the first playthrough, you'll start playing with research, exploration, crafting, buildings, and deeper 'god customization.'The races give you plenty of options for playthrough, and the automated battles let you judge your strategy by watching a replay (which you can speed up) after each encounter.  You can make/download custom factions, change victory conditions to quite a few options.  There's a map editor and the randomn map generator is pretty fantastic as well.I like pretty much everything about this game, I wish you could be a little more detailed in the scripts after mastering some basic tactics, and that you didn't have to ration magic gems as much, but other than those small complaints, I'm a happy customer.After seeing the progress from Elysium 3 to Dominions 4, I'm seriously hoping this company comes out with another game like this.

												Great game if you love strategy games. Very deep with lots of replayability!More hours into this game than any other game at least since steam has been tracking it. I also played on desura for at least a hundred hours. I think a good measure of a strategy game is how many hours you see logged for peoples reviews on here. You are a god! You can make you're own god and pick from many different styles of nations, and fight against other gods,It takes a while to figure out how everything works, since the game is so deep. You can keep upping the difficulty in many ways as you learn how to take advantage of everything you can do. With low difficulty you can have fun before you know all the ins and outs, I would recommend looking at some of the user guides. I haven't really checked out the multiplayer as it seems like it takes a long time, and my play time is sporadic and hard for me to plan.Custom map editor and generator. There are a lot of user made maps to download, and you can generate and modify your own. Also a lot of user created empires, but there is so much already in the game I haven't even downloaded any of it!You can outfit special or summoned units, or thugs as they're refered to. Sea Troll King, many types of demons, liches, giants. It adds an RPG element to the game.One of my favorite games ever!			"

												Great strategy game, just lacks a diplomacy system. Seems as though most AI only attack when prevoked though. Lost of epic battles with hundreds sometimes thousands of units. Lots of variety, magic is pretty cool and there is a rediculous amount of spells which is awesome. Some factions like Ermor are a little overpowered as they can cast an OP spell killing all living things on the map over about 5 years [60 turns] which isnt much to be honest turns go really fast. If you use a human faction beware of units that can trample as 10 of them can destroy a large army if you get unlucky. Hmm awesome massive maps, with dozens of factions. A trade system would be nice also, or trade routes to protect within ur faction. Good game, similar to dominions 3 but significantly better as far as I can tell. Hope this helps			"

												No doubt, this game ranks close to Dwarf Fortress in terms of complexity.  That being said, it can be a really wild ride.  The basic premise is that the Pantokrator (the Overgod, think Aao if you know Forgotten Realms), has vanshied.  This leaves the lesser gods, demi-gods, demon lords, elemental kings, and even powerful ""mortal"" beings struggling to become the new Overgod.  The game focuses on recruiting armies and researching powerful magic to push back your opponents and become the only remaining God.  The mechanics can take a bit of getting used to (think along the lines of Risk, but with more depth from the various unit types and magic) but there are plenty of guids and manuals available, as well as an active fan base that is very helpful when it comes to questions.Also, all mechanics aside, you can play as frost giants led by the very physical embodiment of Winter itself against an undead Roman Empire led by a horror from the Void outside of reality.  Why the f**k wouldn't you want to try that?  Buy this game, be a Pretender God, and claim your rightful destiny.			"

												This is one of the best strategy game I have ever played. Dominions 4 is a fantasy 4x game, heavily focused on warfare and magic development... and a very distinctive God-building system (yes, you are the God of your civilization).In order to achieve your goal (rule over the world destroying your enemies, making of your God faith the only one remaining or claiming several magical sites) you will need more than controlling land and building your armies... You will have to take advantage of your nation strenghts and sinergies, take control of territories with strategic resources and special troops available, and craft special equipment for your commanders, as well as develop your magical level. You can also know what is wrong with your armies as you may actually see the battles you are involved in, knowing this way how your troops are performing, among them and against your enemies.This game has an incredible amount of nations, units, spells, enchantments, equipment... available, which is a guarantee of replayability. Content that is constantly increased by free patches.Though graphics and interface look a bit outdated, this is a very immersive game, with lots of possibilities, and an important community modding it and with lots of multiplayer games active. Highly recommendable.			"

												I find Dominions 4 to be fascinatingly intricate and polished, a credible result for 10+ years of dedicated evolution over four sequels, from what I've gathered. I've seen that in series before, yet somehow I'm still impressed here. Right after I got it, I told a friend of mine who spent about a year of his free time playing two humongous maps of Age of Wonders II--something I never expected [was a typo] when I gave it to him as his first brush with the genre--that my initial estimate puts Dominions 4 at about (AoW2)^2 in content. Personally, I relish a steep learning curve: grand strategy titles and deeply dynamic RPG character building systems have been particular pleasures down this line. Nevertheless, starting Dominions 4 I was surprised such as I haven't been in a long time to see I had underestimated how much I wouldn't know.At first I was moderately impressed at the apparent scope of the thing, and I started to get burnt out on my course of study about the time I felt I could look at the nations lists with their dozens of choices and think I could describe the basic flavor for all of them. But then for the first time I looked at my first details about the magical and crafting systems and as ideas and dimensions began to click I was truly impressed like I had finally shifted the top layer of this giant package, and underneath it was still layers more good and integrated stuff!The more I've dug up hour after hour of yet more complimentary game dynamics and worldbuilding flavor, the more I've thought I wish I had bought this game full price instead of on sale: all the more power to the developers if they're this kind of craftsmen.

												This is my review as a noob to the dominions series, rather than a seasoned expertI'll put my TL:DR at the start for those who want me to get to the point - if you like strategic games, and total war with magic + better AI but less control of combat appeals to you then get this.its a deep game. really deep. intimidating to learn but seeing the battles happen is really satisfying. It's by no means triple A graphics but it doesn't need to be. I think the battle graphics are endearing but the strategic map could use a bit more of a clear UI. At least from the perspective of a noob. However everything on buttons is clearly labelled, its mostly the things on the map that need to be labelled so i can figure out what it means.I highly recommend watching a youtuber explain it first. i did and it really helped clear up some of my questions. the people on the forum are great to ask too. Once you get it, its a fun game to play. I by no means have logged many hours, but i think i've logged enough to post this to people who are wondering what going into the series as someone whos never even heard of it before buying it thinks.My interests align with strategic games. i like EU IV, hearts of iron 3 etc, i used to enjoy the total war games (not so much anymore). i liked gratuitous space battles which funnily enough does have some parralels with how the battles in this game plays out. Its deep, rewarding and difficult. Diffuclty appeals to me greatly as i find nothing more dull than just instant winning so thats another plus for me. I still haven't figured out the optimum strategy of anything by any means but its an ongoing learning process.			"

												10/10 - My go to for procrastination.The game is simple enough to play through the first time and crush the AI on easy using some surface elements.  After the first playthrough, you'll start playing with research, exploration, crafting, buildings, and deeper 'god customization.'The races give you plenty of options for playthrough, and the automated battles let you judge your strategy by watching a replay (which you can speed up) after each encounter.  You can make/download custom factions, change victory conditions to quite a few options.  There's a map editor and the randomn map generator is pretty fantastic as well.I like pretty much everything about this game, I wish you could be a little more detailed in the scripts after mastering some basic tactics, and that you didn't have to ration magic gems as much, but other than those small complaints, I'm a happy customer.After seeing the progress from Elysium 3 to Dominions 4, I'm seriously hoping this company comes out with another game like this.

												Really a cool game. I am a civ 5 obsessor, but wanted something similar which was new - this fit the bill perfectly!Its a neat game I'm sure I will be playing more of in the future, because there is a lot of depth I have barely scratched the surface of.One thing: find a guide for your first playthough. I thought the guide by Klomster in teh steam community was a good way to get me started - at which point I understood just enough to restart on a smaller map and play though a game (with the manual open next to me as well).Sorry, but the manual kinda is necesary to have available to look stuff up in...Outside of that, great game if you want a slower paced turn based strategy game.

												No doubt, this game ranks close to Dwarf Fortress in terms of complexity.  That being said, it can be a really wild ride.  The basic premise is that the Pantokrator (the Overgod, think Aao if you know Forgotten Realms), has vanshied.  This leaves the lesser gods, demi-gods, demon lords, elemental kings, and even powerful ""mortal"" beings struggling to become the new Overgod.  The game focuses on recruiting armies and researching powerful magic to push back your opponents and become the only remaining God.  The mechanics can take a bit of getting used to (think along the lines of Risk, but with more depth from the various unit types and magic) but there are plenty of guids and manuals available, as well as an active fan base that is very helpful when it comes to questions.Also, all mechanics aside, you can play as frost giants led by the very physical embodiment of Winter itself against an undead Roman Empire led by a horror from the Void outside of reality.  Why the f**k wouldn't you want to try that?  Buy this game, be a Pretender God, and claim your rightful destiny.			"

tl;dr If you really enjoy turn-based strategy games and if you don't mind a brobdingnagian learning curve, it's one of the best. If you don't like to spend hours over the handbook and browsing through the game before even starting, leave it and play something easily digestible.Short reviewI love it: More than 500 units, a big load of spells, multiple styles of the different races,First the only ""bad"" part of the game: The graphics are old, it looks like around 2000 and it feels like it was never updated. For me that's no problem, I don't mind bad graphics in an awesome game.And the best part: A big, huge handbook like in the old games; about 300 pages long, not really uptodate, but I really enjoy reading it and learning parts of the game I didn't know.Some might say Dom4 is such a mod re-release of Dom3 and it feels in some ways like that, but I gladly pay the few bucks to keep the game updated and mostly bug-free.Dominions 3 was my favourite strategy game. Dominions 4 is much improved, allows kind of alliances, new game goals and (I repeat myself) no more game breaking bugs. 4 friends and I spent multiple weekends playing together and against each other; I enjoyed every moment. My personal favourite game.			"

												Dominions 4 is a turn-based strategy game similar to Risk but way more complicated. This game is not for everyone. It is a very good game but it requires patience, a lot of thought, and a whole lot of reading. The manual for the game is over 300 pages long. The graphics are very simple and not at all amazing, but it gives you the IDEA and you lets your imagination do the rest. If you like games like Risk, you will like this game.			"

												I love this game ...That said There are 2 fundamental design flaws with it:1. the graphics are horrible ... really really bad ... not not that bad worse far worse ... think 1980's low budget game then wind back your expectations. Good games (imo) arnt all about the graphics but they're bad enough to make it hard to play.2. starting a game you are presented with a dizzying array of nations, gods and possible setups, the most complex part of the game is deciding on your setup - but you really have to understand the game quite well in order to do this, these choices are fundamental and important. There is no guidance in game that helps a new player, the 397 page pdf manual is little or no help (once you find it) googling 'dom4 nation setup' gives lots of forum postings by those who use so many acronyms they're illegible.[e.g. EA Neif Monolith E9A1E6 D6 O3P3C3G1M3D0 - really didnt help me - though now I know the game better I can see is a helpful build suggestion]In short you really have to put work in to get to the point where the game is anything more than a turn based terrirtory domino fall game of conquest.Dominions 4 is however far more than that. Yes you can just pump troops out and spread your gods dominion by attacking and taking over all other gods territories but there is so much more here once you look. Research of spells & items to forge add a lot but other than being a wider available choice you get similar tech tree approaches in many other games. Adding the divine to the game is a somewhat new, interesting and brilliant twist - the aim is not global military dominion but instead for your god to spread his dominion to the world, to spread belief in your god to the exclusion of all other gods. Belief can cross borders stepping right over a turtled mass of troops in a pinch point.As a suggestion:1. find the online pdf manual (linked in guides) play the 9 turn by rote guide to controls (found somewhere about 90 pages in interspersed with irrelevant and unhelpful history of how the game was made and waffle about the designers inspiration for the game.2. Play a Late Age (LA) Nation called Man, dont worry about nation / god setup on a small map against any random land based nation, dont research anything / forge any items just work with longbowmen to get the feel of the game.3. Play an Early Age (EA) Nation called Metlican. Google some setups but the one that works for me is :Demilich (Imprisoned): Water 4 Death 9 Nature 9, Dominion 8 Order 3 Sloth 3 Heat 2 Growth 2 Misfortune 2 Drain 2Set a commander to the spells Blessing / Divine Blessing and work with Jaguar Warriors.Use these to learn the game to the point where you feel comfortable experimenting & understand the forum post acronyms you'll find from google.I hope you enjoy the game as much as I have!

												This is a deep turn-based strategy title that's about spreading you your deity’s religious power through conquest and proselytizing. It’s a fantasy title and has something like 10,000+ unique spells between the different factions.Your deity’s avatar (pretender god) will appear at some point, which you preset. You pick the time period you want to start the game in, which will affect technology and available starting factions. You need a pretty hefty system to run it at max fps, there’s a lot of calculations that go on in the background. The graphics aren’t spectacular either way. Combat is hands off. You set the tactics and formations your commanders will use, as well as the dispositions of the units. Spying will help you know how to set your tactics. Proselytizing will give you advantages as the faith of the locals will change advantages. Watching post-combat reports and fact sheets will be hugely beneficial on how you change your tactics for the next conflict with that particular army. As you learn the game it becomes even deeper. The dev’s made it so it’s easy to make your own maps, and the community has uploaded quite a few between Dominions 3-4. The game does allow you to build up territories that you control. You can also search for places of power, which give you advantages. Research will allow you to have access to more powerful spells (and better craftables), which allow you to more fully utilize the power of your casters (individual units have caps on capabilities and with what kinds of spells they can utilize; it’s all part of the strategy).I’ve enjoyed this title, and if you like strategy games this is a title you will like. It’s from a small dev team, which has a long heritage of solid strategy/tactical games. If you buy it from the dev’s website (or their publisher) you will get the DRM-free version as well as a steam key. Desura was also giving you a key if you had a license from the dev (I’m not sure if they still do or if Desura is a healthy company at this point).			"

												"" I had a vampire uprising in one of my desert provinces so my merman had to team up with my local barbarian cavalry cause all the oni were busy fighting down south"" - My explination of what was going on in one of my games.A fantastic 4x game that is rather simple to play once you get past the overwhelming text and barely present GUI, however should you choose to jump down the rabbit hole there is a lot of depth for you to find in all of the different civilizations as well as the numerous gods you can combine with them. Magic only adds to the complexity as you research a variety of spells in different ""Schools"" of magic but even then its unlikely you're faction will even favor all of the spells you research in a single campaign causing numerous spells to go essentially unused unless you can get some foreign troops skilled in that element to aid you. All in all if you can get past the graphics and the fact that you will have to teach yourself everything about this game as it gives you almost nothing to start with, you're gonna have one heck of a ride.Pros:+Numerous Factions+Deep Magic System+God customization ensures that even playing the same faction will be different+Easily Moddable+Sieges, Assassinations, and screaming wild women clawing out the eyes of your enemies+ Map size and game settings allow you to set up games that'll last anywhere from 2-20 hoursCons:- No tutorial on top of the game being wordy and poorly organized- GUI is functional (once you are used to it its not so bad) but is not intuitive and it can be difficult to find info at times- A whole lot to manage at once (turn-based and meant to be played slow and methodically, the multiplayer can even utilize Play-By-Email, so not a con for everyone but not everyone's cup of tea) "

												Fantastic game full of very complex strategy.  It is rough arround the edges, but if you like complexity in a 4x title, then the Dominions series is pretty great.			"

												The other reviews give plenty of details on the great depth, replayability, challenge, and sustained interest this game provides, so here is my summary:Very deep, very cool strategy game crafted with love. It reminds me of Master of Magic, not necessarily by gameplay, but in the feeling it gives me - Awesome!			"

												This game has a lot of history and charm to it, and has a ridiculous amount of depth. Like, a 400 page manual's worth of depth. The UI may be daunting and unhelpful, and the graphics might look like someone pooped on it, but once you have it explained to you via an online tutorial or some such service, it's manageable, and once you get deep into the game, you don't even notice or care anymore.In my first game I played as the Sun God Nokal, who manifested himself in the shape of a great eagle. He was slain trying to take the Throne of Stars by a skeletal army commanded by 3 necromancers, but was resurected by his priests and enacted vengeance on the necromancers. His people, the Nazca, conquered the Atlanteans and Ichthyids, and with them wrested control of the last two Thrones of Ascension from the Tritons. His high priest Quizquiz claimed the Throne of Stability in his name, and the Sun God himself walked beneath the water and sat on the Throne of Ice, cementing his rule as the One True God against the frost giants and their pretender of the Hungry Forest.If that was at all entertaining to read, you'll like this game. I promise.			"

												If you're willing to invest 100+ hours to learn this game, you'll find one of the deepest and most engrossing strategy games out there. It's definitely a learning process; and it doesn't look pretty, but it's charming in its own way. Not only that, but it scratches that itch that civilization just doesn't come close to.			"

												I have played Dominions since the original, and have always enjoyed it.  It is one of my favorites, and I come back to it every few months.  Each version has brought improvements, and 4 is the best so far.  I don't mind spending the money for the new versions, because supporting a durable indy developer is priceless.There are numerous races to be played, and they are all very different.  There is a ton of replay value, just trying out new factions and learning their strengths and weaknesses.  It also makes you a better player, since those factions appear in other playthroughs as your rivals, and there is nothing like knowing your enemies intimately.This very diversity of strategies leads to the game's major limitation: the AI opponent presents a very weak challenge.  It simply isn't built to compete at your level, so you will get to the point where playing against the computer is like playing against a young child: the only way to create a challenge is to let it cheat gratuitously.  Higher difficulty levels simply give the AI more and more bonuses, rather than kicking in more cleverness or sophistication.  I recognize that game AI is still a fantasy, but this is a fantasy game after all. ;)I am confident that human players would provide that competition; however, I have never had the flexibility to commit to that kind of long social engagement.  I will continue to dream of a day when the computer opponent is as satisfying as a person.			"

												Dominions 4 is an amazing game with alot of depth, don't let the simple graphics and rather obtuse UI tell you otherwise. There are hundreds of units, hundreds of spells and thousands of strategies to use to become the ultimate god. Every nation is different, from the Dominion of Ermor which kills the populace within it's domain in order to fuel it's undead armies, the fire children Abysians which are wreathed in flame and burn their way through their enemies.Even choosing a pretender is a process that can take 10 minutes, each having different stats and magical potential. Some can be built as towering titan bruisers that crush armies beneath their boots, some are powerful wizards that can plunge the entire world into darkness or make their enemies lungs fill with water.Seriously, put a little bit of time into this game and you will not regret it.

												Great game if you love strategy games. Very deep with lots of replayability!More hours into this game than any other game at least since steam has been tracking it. I also played on desura for at least a hundred hours. I think a good measure of a strategy game is how many hours you see logged for peoples reviews on here. You are a god! You can make you're own god and pick from many different styles of nations, and fight against other gods,It takes a while to figure out how everything works, since the game is so deep. You can keep upping the difficulty in many ways as you learn how to take advantage of everything you can do. With low difficulty you can have fun before you know all the ins and outs, I would recommend looking at some of the user guides. I haven't really checked out the multiplayer as it seems like it takes a long time, and my play time is sporadic and hard for me to plan.Custom map editor and generator. There are a lot of user made maps to download, and you can generate and modify your own. Also a lot of user created empires, but there is so much already in the game I haven't even downloaded any of it!You can outfit special or summoned units, or thugs as they're refered to. Sea Troll King, many types of demons, liches, giants. It adds an RPG element to the game.One of my favorite games ever!			"

												I love this game. So much so that i bought it a second time here on steam for convenience. There are many maps in the vanialla edition, and more can be downloaded from the community (those people are the best). The game itself has high re-playability, extreme depth, loads of factions, spells and Items in three distinct eras. Characters can be modified with names, equipment and spells. If your hero becomes experienced he will get a hall of fame bonus which are awesome. To equip a hero can be easy, or you can make it into a science of stacking abilities. Some heroes die if they meet a single foe, others can invade continents alone. You and your game knowledge decide which is which. I have spent hundreds of hours on the third edition, (and the fourth) and the forth has added alot of new content. I reccomend this game if you like to tinker, roleplay, care more about depth than graphics and be aware that sound in vanilla is a bit bothersome with some units (but there are mods that fix that).

In addition, the modding community has some great mods out there for anyone who wants to expand the game.			"

												I am certain most of my points would have been covered already by other reviewers, but I wanted to say good things about this game anywayPros:Complex strategy, involving macro management of your provinces/troops, magical utilities eg summoning/crafting, spreading dominion via priests and temples, as well as setting up troop formations and battle ordersVery unique God/Dominion system. Your god can be a statue, giant people (including a naked woman), Odin, Santa, a dragon, or a pile of bones (muffled doot), and many others (even just regular mage-dudes). Your god can specialise in magical paths, or spend points in making your religion/dominion a certain way, or a combination of bothMagic is quite varied in its use (if your god is a statue, he can't move, but you can teleport him somewhere else, or you can summon things, or just throw regular ol' favourites like fireballs and lightning bolts)Cool ancient human mythos setting with many different races, with each being either slightly or very different from each other (races that use unique mechanics exist such as aquatic, underground, or undead races)Very responsive 'controls' (not a lot of waiting. when you click, something happens immediately)Skellington race produces skellingtons by using in-game necromancy instead of just training them (10/10 very immersive)Pretty cool, proportionate artstyle if you look past the pixelsAlthough complex, LOTS of information can be found in the UI and its many menusCons:Often feels like going the cheaper units over the expensive ones is a bad ideaMorale seems arbitrary sometimes, and since all fights are auto-calculated it can be frustrating to loseSome information seems hidden or unintuitive Way too easy to click the exit button during multiplayer (literally 5 of us in a group have all done it multiple times)Sound effects are pretty lulzyWhat the ♥♥♥♥ is this UI tho srslyFriends complain about the complexity sometimesNot enough skellingtonsOverall, for this type of game, I'm very impressed with it and give it 8/10The terrible UI and graphics can be forgiven in favour of how much I enjoy the detail and complexity of the strategy, of which there is much of, but at the same time more work could have been done on them.

												Pros: A turn base fantasy strategy game with very indepth mechanics. Its got a complex, multi-branching, magic system. Its got a ludicrous amount of nations that all play very differently. Its got a customisable god that will either get you access to buffs for some troops, higher tier magic, and/or better nation scales for a better economy.Flaws: Game really only shines in multiplayer as the ai can't use magic effectively. You will have to do research outside the game since this game likes to hide a lot of information. "

												If Dungeons and Dragons was turned into an epic turn-based strategy game that was just ""plain awesome,"" it would be Dominions 4.  Create your own God and play one of over a dozen unique civilizations as they progress from the time of legends in the early era all the way to the days of conventional medieval warfare in the late era.  Races are heavily influenced by popular culture and real world history/civilizations.  You'll find obscure references to Conan the Barbarian, H.P. Lovecraft, Hercules,etc... all the way to Vlad the Impaler and so on.Personally, I like to raise forth a sea of mindless thralls to serve as the limitless buffer for my vampire aristocracy.  Large urban population centers are soon converted into blood farms where my illuminati spies and sorcerors sacrifice virgins by the hundreds for their dark lord and master.   As my power becomes complete, the Sun is removed from the sky with the global spell ""UTTERDARK"" as the world plunges into perpetual night.  Crops wither and die as world economies follow suit.  Fear of starvation is replaced by genuine terror of what now roams in great numbers through the unlit countryside.  The currency of gold is replaced by human blood that grows scarcer by the day untl only the monsters remain.Needless to say, yeah, this game is pretty cool.			"

												This is  fun game.  I got it for 20 bucks on sale.  I loved all the ideas but was turned off by the super outdated graphics.  Even with crap graphics the game is super fun and addictive.  If you have played eu4. ck2 or games like it you will feel at home playing on a map.  Where this game differs from the other is how much you can customize characters and make armies.  In one turn i sent an astral arrow into the heart of an enemy commander, summoned 2 different animal group to fight and 250 men to storm a castle of an enemies capitol province.    The ""bad Graphics"" thing really comes from the battle recap.  Before the turn ends you can set different orders for your armies.  At the end of the turn everything gets added up.  You can then watch a replay of the battle to get an idea of how your strategies worked out.  Yes its ugly but its helpful and eventually helps immerse you into your own little story.   If you enjoy grand strats, rpg and games where you get to have a GOD avatar this is a game to get.			"

Posted: May 1, 2015
												NOTE: There will be no TL;DR version of this review. To quote Maxi’s review “If you really usually jump for TLDRs don't bother getting the game.”I want to be clear about this, I love this game. I think it's great fun. I've sunk around 100 hours into Dominions 3, with another 70 into Dom 4. I think Dom 4 is a flat out improvement from its predecessor, and given the choice I would chose to play Dom 4 every time. That said this is not really a game that I could recommend to my friends, let alone to some stranger on the Internet. To start off the graphics are old fashioned and I know a LOT of people who will turn up their nose at a game just because it doesn't look pretty. If the idea of some simple sprites moving across a painted background isn't your idea of an acceptable battle animation then turn around and walk the other way. The combat may also be something that turns people off. The combat works through a scripting element, something that was designed in part so that players could engage in multiplayer through a play by email style (if that doesn't show you that the game might have some antiquated design ideas hanging around, I don't know what will). This means that you as a player cannot engage in combat in real time, it happens between game turns and you receive a summary and video of what happened in the combat while you were away. You set up your units, tell them where to go and what to do (within certain limitations of course. You cannot, for instance, order your archers to stop firing if friendlies come into danger of being shot, nor can you order your troops to wait more or less than two turns before charging headlong into the enemy), and then they handle everything by themselves without any more input by you. This can sometimes make you feel as though you are being cheated, like if you didn't get a very good scout report and the enemy wound up having cavalry you weren’t prepared for that decimate your troops with their lances. Maybe if you could alter orders on the fly, you would have ordered your mages to cast a spell to stop or slow the cavalry instead of trying to buff your own troops. I find this to just be part of the game, and I enjoy the strategic fetters it places upon my gameplay. Some people, though, may not. This, I think, is the main point of contention one will have with the game. If you can find yourself enjoying the combat, then you'll probably be fine. That said, there are a smattering of more tedious issues that can still turn you away.One such issue is micromanagement. On a small map with one to four other nations, you can manage your little empire without too much of a struggle. If you try to play on a large map with 12+ nations, you'll be working through a micromanagement slog the likes of which you may have not even comprehended before. If you are playing as a nation with heavy troops capable of only moving one province per turn, may the Pantokrator help you. Add in the fact that the UI is not great, and you might not even know how to do the thing that you want to do. I love micro (I play vanilla Dwarf Fortress as well), and I don't mind referring to the manual when I forget how to do a little thing like copy orders or make a mage cast the same spell every month, but if you aren't willing to find those little time saving things the micro can weigh you down even more quickly.The last detractor is the AI, and this is the only real reason I'll ever take a break from the game. Dominions is the kind of game that was always developed with multiplayer in mind, and I think that the game gives players a lot of tools to build, execute, and adapt to different strategies. While I haven't played any multiplayer in my time with the game, I have seen several games and read a lot of the theorycrafting involved. While that isn't the same as playing a MP game, I think it gives me a measure of insight into how the game can function differently in MP as opposed to SP. Sadly, the AI isn't very good at using a lot of those strategic tools designed for human players. For example, let's say you have two kinds of units that can ""hold the line"" and buy time for either your ranged units or mages to kill the enemy. The first are heavily armored pikemen capable of repelling, and thus negating, enemy melee attacks. The second are heavy infantry with a shield, these ones better prepared to tank volleys of arrows. While I can build both and adapt which one I need depending on my opponent, I see the AI often just building one or the other and fielding that against all opponents regardless of attrition rate, or building both in equal numbers (which admittedly isn’t a very bad idea if you haven’t seen what your opponent's army looks like, but if I march in with a cadre of longbowmen maybe some more shield guys would be prudent). I have seen the AI do some cool things, I was foiled often in my early days by some spell I didn't even know about, but after a while I find myself wishing that the AI could bring something new and exciting to the table (Master enslave. Just once, I want to have to worry about Master Enslave in single player). Of course, this doesn't keep me away for long. The AI is fun enough to face at high difficulties that I enjoy myself, and after a while I just think of a new exciting thing that I want to try, so I don't care if the AI isn't amazing. All in all, none of these things stop me from loving this game. I walk away from time to time, but I always find myself coming back, or even just thinking about the game when I'm taking a break from it. If none of the things I mentioned sound like they would bother you, then I would encourage you to go read some multiplayer threads, watch lets play videos, or in the best case scenario ask a friend of yours who has the game to let you try it. While I jumped into the Dominions series blindly and wound up loving it, I know that I'm exceptional in that regard. I don't think this game appeals to the average gamer, or even to the average strategy gamer. I think this is a game for the kind of person who was never bothered by the Dwarf Fortress UI or “fun,” who always thought the diplomatic options in Civilization were just there for babies that didn't have the guts to earn their victory on the point of their spear, who likes the idea of a world in which no one is ever the ""good guy,"" and who doesn't mind playing a game that might not be balanced if that imbalance allows one to tell a better story. Most importantly though, it is a game for someone who doesn't mind gambling 35$ on a game they may very well not like. If that doesn't sound like you, then that's fine. But if you're the special kind of crazy for whom it does, I'll be waiting here for you. Just you try to take my throne away from me. I dare you.			"

												although the graphics look old, this game is deep enough and entertaining enough that you wont really care or notice that much.its a good game!not stupidly hard that it makes you annoyed and frustrated but not stupidly easy that you dont want to play it. it finds a pleasant ballance between difficultys....but thats me judging by normal mode, you can make it harder (i think, if the difficulty change works which i havent tried yet)its quite fun raising a huge army of undead from the corpses of the dudes fallen in battle then having a huge free army of rotting corpses to troll others with! so this game will make you dreams of leading necromantic armys come true! (although you dont need to be necromantic, the game has lots of mythology and stuff)			"

												An entirely different concept of strategy gaming slowly evolved into a massive compound of possibilities that take some time to get you confortable with, no doubt; but its deep and well written lore will make you sink into countless hours of enjoyment of one of the best gaming experiences for the harcore fans of the genre. It is surely one of those titles that are not made for beginners or the casual player, but if you miss the time when you got scared or cried by reading your favourite game text, this sure is the title you've been looking for!

												I highly recommend this game to any strategy enthusiasts, or fans of mythology, out there. I'll go ahead and get the (tiny) amount of criticism out of the way - the game has an unusual user interface, and targeted selection of units can be especially tedious at times. With that detail out of the way, I only have good things to say about Dominions 3. The writing in the game is top-notch, and very immersive. You often have to play multiple races to get a fuller picture of the history, but it's rich and satisfying once you piece it together. The Tuatha and the Fomorian Giants are a good example. The game plays in a traditional fashion concerning territories and the movement of agents and armies, much like other turn-based games. However, to locate the useful goodies in a territory, you'll have to cultivate a few powerful mages among your commanders, to find hidden sites that can provide mana gems, unique and powerful units for recruitment, or special effects, once unearthed. You'll need them (and magi once again) for the forging of magical items to equip your agents, priests, mages, generals, prophet, and your Pretender God. But the true meat of the game is in spreading your dominion (aka faith) across the map. It is the source of your power, and since it can flow into enemy territoy, it can also hamper their efforts to withstand your (inevitable) attack. Be sure to build lots of temples in your own honor! Put those puny mortal mages to work researching powerful magic that can affect the whole world. Turn day to perpetual night, bring on and endless winter, summon hurricanes, kill someone from anywhere in the world, dispach the flying monkeys to pluck away some unfortunate soul! Last Pretender God standing wins the prize - true Godhood. Sounds simple, right? Think again. It's a deep and complex game, and can be quite the challenge at times. So join in the fun, weave your own epic tale! Smash vampires with giants, ♥♥♥♥♥ queens (yes, its a real Pretender) with a midget masher, or run from Cthulu! It's all in there, and waiting for you! Order now!			"

												Do you want to play a game ? How about global thermanl nuclear war?  No , well if not I got this one about fake gods trying to control the world and eliminate that competition. I think you can play one of about 30 very diferent empires . There are hundreds of units and spells and  each player gets to create their own unique pretender god.   It's the fourth one in the series. If you've played the previous games the major new feature you will notice is the new thrones of ascension. These work like vicotry points that give you empire wide bonuses. They come in 3 sizes and you can configure how many are on the map and how many it takes to win the game. If you were looking for something like master of magic I think this is about the closest you'll get at this time.  Enjoy . "

This is game is the great for strategy gamers or people who like slow moving large army building kind of strategy games. It will be semi-complicated at the very start so dont think your gonna Atilla and conquer everything. Secondly the reserch is not tech but spells (witch i thought was pretty interesting). Lastly the faction count for this game is insane, there are 3 eras to choose from at the very start, Early, Medieval, and Late each having a some-what diffrent playstyle, oh and this is pretty lore heavy if you care to every read any of it and yeah I know im missing alot, but you just need to try it on your own			"

												This game is so deep that it will never leave you bored.The graphics are insanely simple, but all of the units are drawn. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish the units that look similar. Only the small differences make it clear which unit is which. But the random map generator draws so beautifully that it lets you forget every problem you might have with the simplicities.The music is terrific! You play them over and over hundreds of times and it still never gets old.The magic system is very deep. There are paths and schools with over 800 spells! Much of them are summoning, but there are rituals and combat spells alike, including global spells.The units are abundant, I have never seen a game before that has so many units in it, with detailed descriptions for each. By the way, the whole game is based on mythology.I can only recommend this game to others. Discover everything that was not written here, the journey will be exhilarating!			"

												While I've only sunk in about 4 hours of playtime when I wrote this, I sank in about 2 - 3 hours studying the massive 295 page manual (half of it's just spell / unit statistics, so only 120 pages or so of reading). While the process of reading this manual was a bit oppressive and a rather large time investment just to start playing, from what I can see is there is a game with an incredible amount of depth and replayability. Just from the start you get random worlds and the ability to craft your own ""pretender"" (basically a demigod) and then explore with the aim of conquering. There is espionage, assassinations, and management of your territories. Perhaps the only thing that's missing in my mind is diplomacy (it's a war game) but I for one never have really explored those aspects in games like this so nothing was really missing.The difficulty of this title is steep, at least to someone like myself. What's good is that if you read the manual, you should be able to get several hours of playtime and experimentation before you start to get undermined by other nations. This gives you a good shot at your first playthrough to get a grasp on the basics before starting a hopefully more successful campaign.The graphics are abhorrent, I won't lie, so if you need at least poor graphics to be satisfied I'd stay away. Graphics however are sacrificed for depth which to me, is far more important. There is so much complexity (but in a good way) to each aspect of the game: your towns (buildings, defense levels, dominion, etc.), the terrain, your soldiers (commanders, unit  types, formations, leadership, items), and a robust magic system as well. I could go on, but I already fear that this review is a bit incoherent as there really is a lot to say about the game. [B}TLDR[/B]Pros+Great Depth of Gameplay, incredible opportunities for strategy.+Great Customization: Province Management, Commanders, Unit Types / Organization, Orders, etc.+Very Replayable due to custom game modes.+Tons of multiplayer options including classic favorites like Play By E-Mail and Hotseat+Rich in Lore and Mythology based upon real life mythology.+Tons of Unit Types, Spells, and ItemsCons-Clunky UI, not reading / following the tutorial will make it very diffiuclt to get used to the controls.-Incredibly huge manual (295 pages, of which 120 pages are essential reading) that you really must read if you don't want to spend many frustrating hours of trial and error.-Absolutely hideous graphics, they really aren't good at all. The game is purportedly very moddable and that's something I will explore as I get bored of the stock game as well!			"

The graphics are cheesy at first but they really grow on you and actually add flavor to the game. The fact is that this game is for true strategy game lovers and not so much for those who play games just for the whiz bang flashy graphics and ooooh shiny effects. If you love true depth in a strategy game which also has a thriving multiplayer community to boot, this game is it for its genre. The only other games which come close to matching the depth and breadth of this game is EU4 and CK2, which are different genres.			"

												Not for the faint of heart, this strategy game will require multiple play throughs and attempts to grasp all of the mechanics. It is feature rich with so many different units, spells, items... the learning curve makes it brutal but rewarding when you start understanding how to affect the world. I think my favorite aspect is creating leaders with unique equipment and casting abilities. These leaders will be generals for your basic unit and can enchance their combat abilties. As a game progresses, you will move up the different magic aspects which unlock more combat casting and summoning unit. You will also be able to pick up rare units to supplement your faction. The game is just huge. If you want a game that will challenge you and offer high replayability check it out. I would suggest reading through the massive user manual otherwise you will be over your head immediately.			"

												My actual play time is over a thousand hours as I have only recently registed it on Steam. There are three key problems with this game. The first is that the game gets boring after a while. Yes, I'm talking about multiplayer. Initially, it is exciting learning how to outwit other human players -- raid and counter raid, various strategies, spells and their counters. After a while, though, there is a serious lack of variety. There are many spells, units and items in the game, but the reality is that over 90% of them are plain bad and you'll always be restricted by a very limited selection to what is feasible/competitive.The second problem is a rather toxic community. For some reason, many people who play the game think that they are geniuses and have sky high egos. It can be really frustrating communicating with them especially if they know that they are wrong but just plain refuse to admit it. I guess that people who play this game are naturally more logical and hence think that they are smart. The third is that many multiplayer games end up dead. It is difficult to find a game where everyone is playing competitively until the end. Most of the time, someone will give up and disappear halfway through the game, resulting in his neighbour becoming stronger. Some times, people refuse to attack the leader and let him run away with the game. Some times your starting location is bad, you have no chance. In any case, it gets really frustrating when people treat the game flippantly. Winning the game can be due to plain luck since many factors are outside of your control.			"

												This game, made by two people, has more depth than most of the AAA strategy titles I've played.  This is not another Civ or HoMM clone; here we have a spell list that makes the tech tree of any 4x game you've played look like a post-it note.  Every single troop and item has a back story and a sprite, and every spell has a counter strategy to a counter strategy whch acts as a counter-counter-counter strategy.Unfortunately, the learning curve is sharp.  The game comes with a read-along tutorial, but nothing can prepare you for the blistering amount of options you have at your fingertips until you play the game.  A lot of the game is figuring out how your different units can behave, because unlike other games where your troops simply ""move, attack, or build a structure"" commanders in this game can search for blood sacrifices, preach the word of your god, cast a staggering variety of ritual spells, patrol for spies, assassinate commanders with stealthed heroic squads (I made Brock Samson and some OSI agents) and so much more.  Once you amass a healthy army, troop setup and positioning before battle is also vital.The game is also not very pretty.  The only nice thing to say about the UI is that it's functional.  No form here; you're presented with a drop-down list that looks like it came from a primitive spreadsheet document.  The backgrounds are pixelated, and the pictures of the troops look like they came from a 16 bit game, though I actually find that charming.What this game lacks in eye candy, it makes up in strategic depth.  Whether you like min-maxing or discovering new strategies on the fly, the absolutely massive toolkit this game gives players means that there is almost always a new way to screw over your opponents and be screwed yourself.  There are so many ways for players to customize their win conditions and other game settings, though this often feels like an old-school war game where the players have to commit to a solid 3-5 hour chunk of play time (though you don't have to do it all in one go because the game saves everyone's progress).  This game also makes you feel like a real deity with spells that let you do anything from creating a global hurricane, ageing the world's population supernaturally fast, or summoning elder gods to rampage indiscriminately across the continent.  There are just SO MANY ways to build your god, nation, and heroes.Also, I would like to say that this is the first game I've played in a long time where I've felt like a proper necromancer.  You're not raising a handful of skeletal minions here, oh no.  If you so choose, the entire world will wither and legions of the dead will rise from the doomed populace to do your bidding as your carrion dragon leads squads of bane knights you equipped with weeping blades of venom against your enemies.The developers patch new content in on a regular basis, and have claimed they will continue to do so for the next 2 years at the least.  If you are a strategy enthusiast who has the patience to power through a steep learning curve, this game is an absolute must-buy.To get an idea of the sheer amount of things your can summon, forge, and cast check out this site: http://larzm42.github.io/dom4inspector/ "

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096885327/recommended/248510/this is my review form dom3. and dom4 is even better. I had my doubts about buying it, since the changes seemed few and not game-changing. but... once you try it, there is no going back. the best change is the manual (YES, you can improve a 300 page manual. adding another 100 pages with every unit stats), but the others are those little things that seem unimportant, but you cannot live without them once you get used to them (note: although for me, the thrones of ascension aren't THAT great. I mean, I like them for the effects and the strategy twist, but I don't really needed a new victory condition. Conquering everything seems good enough for me. but you can still do that on dom4.... )I love this. It's the largest game I have seen in terms of quality content and replayability. and one of my all-time favorites. I totally see myself playing this a few years from now. And that's much to say. a side note: don't start a map with too many opponents (~10), it will last VERY long (my first map on dom4 lasted for about 75 hours..... )oh. and about the AI. it may not be a challenge for experienced players... but you will easily reach a few hundreds of hours before that. I mean, on normal difficulty, I still have to be very careful or I'll easily lose... just buy it. no need to even wait for a sale, even for full price is completely worth it. PS: I have something like 30hours more than steam says. but steam crashes every now and then. and my hours vanish. sigh. PPS: well, if you are not sure... there's a demo on the illwinter page. Or at least there was for dom3.			"

												First time i've played the game i didn't give it a ***, but in the second time, i saw that this game reminds me the first Age of Wonders with Medieval Total War.CONS:The facctions are exclusive ( not orcs or elves ), a bit wierd but nothing we can't handle.The game economics and diplomacy aren't detailed and could be better, it's a bit focused on battle and expansion only. The multiplayer doesn't support server browsers and only direct connection supported.PROS:One thing that is amazing is the customizable aspects of the game, editors, maps, gods and mods. You have a good range of options to customize your match. Also, the units has very detailed stats, which is really good for good military commander players.The battles scenes are great, they are on 2D sprites and you can only spectate them since you can only plan their behaviour during their organization label (off-battle).8.4/10 for now.Recommended.

												I want to like this game.  It's got a lot that appeals to me.The big thing that makes me not recommend it is that it's a bit of a ""needle in the haystack"" game.  Most of what you do is going to be wading through the many many races, units and abilities to find the combo that works well together.Once you do that there's a pretty decent turn based fantasy 4x in there, however I found the crunchiness to be too much for me.Also the single player is dreadfully dull, my advice is to stick to play by mail games			"

												After 18 Hours of digging into Dominions 4 and playing through 5 different games , I can safely say this game did not come through for my inner strategy gamer.Major Cons-1- Cookie Cutter Strategies Included - There are a lot of spells but nations are so cookie cuttered into a particular set of paths that it is hard to develop more than a few strategies for a race. Unlike in games like Master of Magic where you can easily pick the spells you want to cast with your nation all the time to develop a theme or strategy that enhances the weak points or strengths of your race. Now, you can design your pretender to cast any spells you want. But this is a strategic game and your caster can only be in one place at one time and can usually only cast one of the big spells and then he/she/it is knocked unconscious. Its not very fun and does not make a lot of sense to me.2- Low Strategic Value/Adaptability offered by units - As with spells, each race has a handful of units that are great at certain things but there was not a lot of strategic decision making offered by the units. After you get used to constructing a line of spearmen who can push back units or are fronted by trampling war elephants/cavalry, there is little to be done adapting to an opponent. I wished spells or different units could respond better to the how the game changes on the combat scene, but it does not offer any adaptibility.3- The Strategy Game that makes you work - This is a big one for me. I don't mind researching unit stats and comparing them to each other. I really dont mind reading a 400 page manual to find out how each of the different nations function on a strategic level. But trying to figure out what spells you can and can't cast and trying to plan for it...and then just trying to see if it is even worth it because it feels like half of the spells are worthless in most situations ( aka, only affecting the weak♥♥♥♥♥caster with a melee damage buff...wtf...i guess this would be only for pretenders), is just frustrating.So overall, I gave Dominions 4 a pretty fair shake. It has so much that would have been fun with a bit more tweaking and forethought, but the warfare is too one dimensional and cookie cutter. Not recommended.			"

												Civilization maps & resources + Risk troop stacking + D&D RPG Items and Spells + Rome Total War troop combinations.What do you get? Dominions 4!I played a game for 3 hours and started to feel the burn of losing.Where I started not knowing the map is continuously scrolling until ""mid"" game. Then I realized, I could've won this a long time ago, I stacked my troops of minotars and centaurs, along with my ""pretend god"" and marched them on the enemy castle, little did I know, that pretend god can die, and calling the god back takes AGES! So I thought, big whoop, I got biggest army and there's only 4 squares left to take, I got all their forts.Well guess the ♥♥♥♥ what?They rule by politics, aka dominions, candle figures, and I saw the white candles turn black, and plenty, even though I held physical victories, they spread like communism in 1940s. So I pooled all my gold, hired all the mercenaries, and still got my butt kicked. Lesson learned, don't put your ""pretend god"" on the frontlines, doesn't matter how decked out, how much spells and how much planning you put in him, he still needs an army.Every general can be deployed with a personal strategy, if you don't like to micromanage (clicking repeated things a lot), this game isn't for you. Also you can claim resource points, build a fort, hold it down.If you like civilization, rome total war, CK2 (combat side), dungeons and dragons dice rolls on hit, you got yourself a dominion.I'm still :salt:y			"

												One word: Confusion.If you don't watch youtube videos on this game, there is really a greater chance than not you will be absolutely clueless as to what you're doing or why you're doing it.Such a depthy strategy game with deep dynamics in terms of units, races, and gods... honestly so unique that it makes me cringe to put this game into the depths of games I will never have the time to touch.(this is coming from a guy who has put about 4 years out of 27 into time played in video games.)There is no tutorial, hints, or anything even close to it integrated into the game; the UI is probably the worst i've ever encountered too, add the two features of inevitably doomed to confusion and a UI from the mid-80's interacting with AI from 2010's, it's a mess.  The game is really picky and precise on how you do things too and it's because of the insanely poor UI.  Processes  like ""drag and drop"" are rendered as ""drag, drop, lock, assign, instruct"" and if you don't do exactlly that, the unit you're assigning will just go back to their original spot before you dragged them.  To make matters worse, that very situation is intensified further by an unintuitive UI, in this case, it won't warn you in ANYWAY that your intended action was unsuccessful - instead it will just put the character back after you leave the screen.My problems with this game start at the most basic levels and this has been a factor before which i've overcome and have enjoyed myself a great game because of my abilitiy to understand it - but every little thing in this game is a hastle, and at the end of the day it's just not intrigueing enough.25/10 - lore factor 0/10 - frustrated beyond recognition			"

												Let me throw my hands up and say I've never played any of the previous titles. I openly admit that. What I want to know is how at no point in four renditions of this game have they introduced a way to manage buildings more effectively than one province at a time. It took me nearly 20 minutes to complete a turn, and then I realised this was on a small map. I can't even concieve of how long it would take to complete a single game, and not because of any kind of ""gameplay"", simply hours and hours of clicking the same thing in menus. A building queue. That's all it would take. Let me queue up multiple buildings to be built, like you can with infantry. If I have 20 provinces, I have to go back and build every single building individually 20 times. Every castle, tower, walls, etc. I realized in my short time with this game I had spent about 50~60% of it not actually ""playing"". I was spending it clicking ""build this"". I could go into MSPaint, write the word ""build this"" and click it a few hundred thousand times and get pretty much the same experience. The actual game? The infantry battles, the heroes, the actual ""PLAYING"" part? It's awesome. It was really fun! It's really in depth, a lot of tactics involved, and I loved it! But how does this game not have a better management system!? HOW?! How has not a single fan of this game told the developers ""Hey you know what would be a good idea? The ability to queue up buildings."" How can I possibly reccomend a game where I would completely cut out 50% of the ""gameplay"" if I could? It's horrendous. It's inhuman. I genuinely am concerned for anyone who plays this game regularly. How do you possibly do that for hours and hours on end?			"

Disadvantages I have found so far are: lack of diplomacy against AI but some real ppl still behave less reasonable than bots, ridiculous possibilites of city extension (just couple of buildings to build - mainly forts) and the thing I hate most is being able to train the entire unit roster in a very first turn.In the beginning I was amazed by the game but after while Dominions gets both repetitive and boring.

												The game has a board game style and deep systems.  The various factions are diverse and customizable.  The basic premise is amusing and the overall flow of the game seems well designed.  Where the problem for me lies is the combat.   Battles are automated and the player can view the results as a replay after they occur.  After spending a fair amount of time in several games as differently designed factions setting up squads, I can say that I have no clue what does or doesn't work.  My strong armies were defeated by what seemed to be weaker ones with ease.  Parsing the combat logs didn't help me figure things out.  I read the actual game manual, which is quite interesting in and of itself, but it didn't seem to help with this.  The in game combat probably would have worked better as a turn based, player-controlled system.  I think perhaps the developers avoided that as they wanted a board game style that didn't get bogged down with combat.  The result is that, without extensive forum-diving, the average player will end up simply building large armies and throwing them around with no preconception of what will be effective.On the other hand, the game developer continually updates the game and there are avid players from whom one might receive help.  If the game were about half its current price of 34.99 USD, I would recommend it.			"

The enemy is somehow able to amass massive armies without building a solid infrastructure, and has prodigious resources rates to quickly replenish its armies.  Not to mention the remarking battle mechanics where on paper, your forces are stronger, but somehow you never win even numbered fight.

The presentation and interface are so obtuse, you probably will not figure out how to play it without watching a tutorial video and/or printing out the manual. Even navigating the interface enough to display the pertinent information to begin figuring out what's going on takes some learning.I would not recommend this game for anyone who has spoiled themselves by playing anything more modern than Master of Magic.

												If your looking for a polished turned based strategy game, this isn't it.As $10 game, I might consider this a good deal. But at $30, If you're not a previous fan of the game I wouldn't spend the money on it.Problems:-No tutorial-Wacky modal interface-Graphics look like they are from a 15 year old game-Very tedious end game with little in the way of automation tools-Tons of confusing detail when it comes to stats, but in the end they don't really mean much-Not that much depth when it comes to resource management and empire building -3D battle scenes are misleading. You have no control over anything, they just kind of show you what happened			"

												I feel this game is so pew-2000. EVERYTHING is manual, cant leave a guy alone for more than a few turns or you'll waste resources. war is uther ugly, sooo many layers of stuff that are either un-explained or provide low value. In a game as text base as this i would hope to get a hardcore description so i know what and where im going. a quick video (12min) on youtube and your set, read a tad more and you win your first game against AI without too much of a hassle....i was glad to buy it, poor gameplay.Romance of the 3 kingdom (in 1995) was a lot better;/			"

												When I saw this game I thought I hit the jackpot, really poor graphics with really great reviews.  There seemed to be awesome depth, with tons of units, races, leaders, status modifiers, spells, and victory conditions.  My first game I picked a magic heavy leader with a race balanced between magic and combat.  I left faith at the wayside and pursued magic early on.  Magic is very costly to develop, and gives very little back, not to mention the high cost when you do use it.  I switched to being combat heavy and did well, though I was still trying to grasp all the nuances of battle (it has tons of options, but is ultimately autocalced).  the enemy had a delayed start, and when they did come unto the scene I beat them at every turn, though my casualties got higher with each battle.  As I started to clinch my victory I suddenly lost.  I was out faithed, and my leader suddenly died due to such.  so for my second game I sat down and tried to figure out a better approach.  I realized that just by dumping all my points into faith, and picking a race that had good priests I would win without having to win many battles, or develop any magic.  I picked a combat heavy leader, but maxed out faith, and picked the race with the best priests.  Early on I was too aggressive and suffered a lot of losses.  In the end I was a push over in every area, except faith (which i was being very innefficiant at), and I won easily.The problem is that faith is cheap and easy, and there is no way to remove it as a victory condition.  Have a low faith side, and end up dead quick.  Have a High faith side and almost auto win.  Don't get me wrong, the faith mechanics other than your leader insta dying are great.  In fact most aspects of this game is great, however all of it means nothing due to the current death by faith mechanic.  balancing all enemies to have the same faith is the only way to actually use the majority of the game's mechanics, which is easiest to do via multiplayer with humans.

												I bought this game because it stated it was multiplayer co-op. Technically that may be true, but it is no simple task to play multiplayer. It is misleading to say it is a multiplayer game, as for most people that will be almost impossible to work out the network configuration. For a start you need a separate instance of the game running a server. You can't do that on your own machine or you get a bad packet error (and that's after working out how to run two instances). There's no real help for it, so the game is now essentially useless except single player, which would be fine, but that's not why I bought it.			"

												Ok, I can not understand why anyone should buy this game. To be clear: I love games with so many rules, with a complex manual like that of Dominions 4; I love games like this difficult; I love the fantasy setting; I have no problem if the graphic is not 3d, vectorial and ""trendy"" (a few days ago I was playing ""Ultima 4""), and in Dominions 4 graphic is really “nineties style”! But, I read the manual, I followed the tutorial, then from where it stopped I continued the game, I won easily, and I realized that I haven’t enjoyed it at all.I tried to start a completely new game, setted it carefully. I played it, I won it easily, and again I haven’t enjoyed it at all.Well, I really can’t understand this game rating…			"

												i think this might be a good game at heart but i cannot recommend it as some stuff that should be obvious is not (like how do i reinforce). why might this be a good game? because its gameplay  ideas make a lot of sense and are obviously the result of much tweaking over a long series of games. however the game does not do very much to introduce you , which is not just bad, its a lazy oversight for such complex games. you can probably invest a ridiculous amount of time to get this game but i don't think its worth it. it's a good concept though. and there are many races. you can even play as Ulm, which is nicefor fans of a particularly famous AAR of another game. there are many options. also hotseat. they did not bother with a singleplayer campaign either, which is another lazy oversight.  also the graphics suck and unlike some other people i don't think there is any technical excuse for that. just developer laziness. if you do pixel art, make sure its 'oh my god thats beautyful' pixel art. this game should just run on a 3D engine.only recommended if you have crazy amounts of time to waste.

												This is hands down one of the worst games I've ever played. The trailer makes it sound like it'd be amazing, but the graphics are 2D, like someone just dragged pictures on top of other pictures. it's honestly so sad. I haven't written a review, but I see it's on sale and I wouldn't want people to waste their money. I would be so happy if I could get a refund, because I was expecting so much more. My fault for trusting the video it starts you off with. The most amazing part is the character/god creation which you see in the trailer, then the actual gameplay is crap. I should've left a review long ago, but I felt scammed and annoyed. Feel free to comment if you disagree. I don't recommend this game for sure.			"

Combat is automatic when it should have been the center of the game.. You just hire more units and send them around. That's it. Very poor game and one you should never buy.			"

												I have found this game disappointing. In the single player version, there is no way to deal with the AI players except unending undeclared war. Add in that the limited development of the provinces (you can only build three buildings - temple, lab, and fort) and lack of depth in the economy and you are left with a really detailed set of units and spells, but for battles you cannot ever control. The lack of real player control over battles and the shallow economy makes this game tedious at best.			"

You're thrown into an overly complex, bland, poorly designed/constructed UI with some overly complex stuff in the background, all combined with a learning curve that makes Crusader Kings 2 or Europa Universalis 4 look like learning how lego works. No tutorials or explanations for anything, no tooltips to explain how stuff works bar the bare minimum.I was recommended this game by someone who I won't be listening to in the future. My biggest regret is that I gave this 4 hours in total (online+offline), voiding the 2 hour refund window. Can't believe I paid close enough to £20 for this.			"

												An awesome game for awesome people.If you are a mythology buff like I am who also happens to enjoy games like those in Sid Meier's Civilization series (or Conversely Europa Universalis/Crusader Kings), as well as nigh on Dwarf fortress level learning curves, then this is the game for you.- Preposterously deep (multiple ways to play an asthma attack inducing number of different races)- Mouth wateringly creative (A million spells of varying effects and quality)- The game really caters to the modding community. Lots of great stuff out there.- Faithfully (pun intended) retains the mythological feel of the various ancient faiths the game portrays.Let me emphasize. There is no mythological figure too obscure. There is no faith's boogeymen left unjustly translated without all their crazy weird abilities. From sorcerous glamours, to shape shifting wolves/snakes/dragons, to religion not spreading unless you sacrifice some father's daughter at the altar of good intentions.However it's not without flaws.- Civ 2 era graphics.- It's not so much a learning curve as it is a learning cliff. With poisonous thorns growing up it and a pit of sharp legos below just waiting for your to fall.- Some nations can be more than a little imbalanced (Poor EA R'lyeh comes to mind).- Pretty pricey at 'half a Triple A game sans DLC'.Bottom Line: If you've ever wanted to feel like a callous vindictive divine entity with absolutely no regard for the well being of your people beyond their immediate use for dying in your glorious name, then look no further than Doms4.It's the authentic god experience.

												Graphics and animations flat out suck.  That out of the way, your mileage with the art style may vary.  If you don't like looking at the battles, you can simply look at the summaries to see how your army fared.Apart from that, you have the deepest turn-based strategy game available, fourth generation and better than ever for what it offers.  Easily modifiable.  There are plenty of mods available if you know where to look (start at the Desura forums for this game).  If you don't have an imagination, this game probably isn't going to come through for your inner strategy geek.  Many of the pre-made maps are beautifully realized in a variety of art styles.The game is easy to learn, but complex.  Certain civilizations will outperform and outclass others.  The worst civilizations are there to handicap better players so that they may play with their lesser skilled friends, or simply for the challenge.There's multiplayer mode, which is the preferred way to play the game for many.  The AI isn't perfect for those who prefer single-player, but there are ways of meta-gaming if you want to challenge yourself solo.I'd recommend this game for anyone who can see past the game's flaws.  Perhaps wait for a sale and put this on your wishlist, but know that this game doesn't go on sale often.  If you do go full price, know that you're supporting a good indie developer that provides support for their games years after they're released.			"

The Pantokrator, your Zeus, has for whatever reason gone AWOL, so like any good subservient god, you and your entire pantheon try to usurp his throne in his absense in a divine battle royale to claim the world, inevitably tearing it apart in the process.Underneath the simple, almost retro 2.5d graphics, the clunky user interface, and all of the strange idiosyncracies in this game lies an extremely deep and varied turn based strategy game.  You begin as a patron god of one about 50 nations, each with a rich history, backstory, and set of quirks, and through your loyal believers, you take out the other gods by converting his believers, running them down with their military might, or by claiming enough thrones of ascension on the map.  Along the way, you use diplomacy and magic to gain every advantage you can, right up to and including casting spells that bend reality in your favor.This is the only game I have ever played where I've had armies of naked women fight on my behalf, made trees sing praises in my name, turned the earth into a desolate wasteland in like ten different ways, stole the sun out of the sky, been a sun with arms, befriended water, and made a knight that lives in a coat pocket that lives on a diet of lint.

												The German kingdom of Ulm knew what had to be done. After several stinging defeats to the Giants, their once proud realm stood on the edge of defeat. To the southwest, Hochmeister Sangerhausen, the leader of the Black Templars had slowly but surely secured Roskva from the slavic heathens of Bogarus to the south. Soon, these fools would see the light of Ulm. They would see the light of their true God. He knows if you are sleeping; he knows if you're awake; he knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake.For when you are bad, as these slavs had been in the eyes of our Lord, he will come for you. He is KRAMPUS, THE GREAT HORNED ONE, TRUE SUCCESSOR TO THE PANTAKRATOR'S THRONE.Unfortunately, His Great finds himself in dire straights against his Giant foes. The Kingdom, however, was far too few of infantry, after having lost so many grave Ulmers by the giant scum.He knew what had to be done. ""Commander,"" Krampus said, his voice deep and raspy, ""gather every criminal you see. Then lead them in the front lines.""			"

												The Dominions series is complex, and not wholly intuitive. With that out of the way however, it allows for a great deal of diversity for playstyles. Everything is usable for some player, there is little in plannable metagaming. Unlike a lot of strategy games, it is unlikely that someone can hard counter you from the outset. There is a huge variety of mythologies that are drawn upon and a ludicrous number of units and playable factions. I recommend this game for casual strategy fans. I would expect a degree of dislike from folks who like hard and fast predictable strategies.			"

												The amount of fun this game brings is huge. How long games are, how many nations you can use at one time if your modding. And the mod nations that you can find is great as well. Warning you need to know how to mod them in manually but the end recult is awesome. On a 1500 provinces map with over 50 nations in play bring so much fun its worth going through the entire game from start to finish. The mod is easily customizable on what kind of game you want to play. From how many nations you want to play with, the size of the maps, from what happens in game. Theres so much you can do, its great!I would give this game a 8 out of 10. One point loss for how hard it is to get modded in nations into the game and testing them all together takes a long time. And as well making maps and getting the out of memory crash cause its just to big to handle. And also the crashes in general because maybe your nations are outdated and you have to uncheck them from the mods selection page, and wait till that mod is updated. But you can no longer play your saved games. Another point loss because of how long it takes for mega playthroughs to be extremely long load times in between turns because the games calculating all the other nations moves, actions, new troops, and so on.Overall the game is fun and at least worth playing once in your life time to see just how big a game can be and how unique one can be as well.

Keep in mind this game is meant to be played against other humans, but of course you have single player scenarios, just think of them as tutorials to prepare you for real war among gods.So go on, make your pretender God, and fight others to win the Thrones of Ascension.

												this is a great game, the only thing I do not like about it though is it has long turn times, and there is no diplomacy. I really hate the turn times in it, over all I give this game a 9/10. Lots of units, fractions, and I love these kind of games that you take over like a map. So addictive to me, this game would be perfect even with the slow turn times if it had some diplomacy in it and allies and stuff. The only way to have a ally in it, is set up the game that way with teams in the start. The game is more for online, but I never play online and I love it without it.  One of the best games I have ever played.			"

												This might be The best strategy game I have ever played. Can recommend to anyone looking for good strategy game with fantasy twist.Amount of lore is epic - I have spent hours just reading manual and planning how to play with different nations, gods and dominions settings. Game is complex but still easy to start; even if you can't remember all spell effects and such - usually everything makes sense. Casting storm makes it hard to fly in combat, or shoot arrows. Rain will cause more fatigue to casters using fire magic.Moving in world map is turn based and battles are resolved automatically, you just set unit formations and script spells for mages (not necessery, AI does mostly good job). Watching these battles after each turn is probably best way to learn game mechanics.You can see stats for all units and there are many. Units gets older and old age makes you more vulnerable to diseases and injuries. Off course this in not issue if your units are demons or undead. or lifeless.I have played this since Dom III and AI is constantly getting better. It gives very good challenge, even though there are tactics it cannot counter well. There are many very different nations and tons of units, but game is still well balanced. Micromanagement with end game and large maps can be issue, especially with blood nations. Much of this depends how you play. If you have lots of commanders with equipped items, supply chain managament can take time.			"

												The game is a seemingly straightforward fantasy war-game.  Recruit troops, set formations and unit orders, move army into neighbouring provinces.  You do not control the battles themselves, you can only watch the battles to see if your orders worked or not and adjust your orders for next time.  Rinse and repeat.  Your build options are castles (allow recruitment of national troops in province – otherwise limited to the usually poor natives), temples (spread your faith – prereq to recruit holy units) and labs (prereq to mage recruitment, allow research, magic item forging and rituals in the province).   This game does not have a learning curve.  It's a learning minefield.  This charming game looks deceptively simple but it's subtleties and complexities hide underfoot ready to trip you up, especially as magic research progresses and options open up and the game shows it's true colours and depth.  There's an asymmetry to the game as the nations can play very differently, with 20+ nations in each era  (3 era's) giving lots of options of play styles.  For a new player it can be a bit daunting and it will take a while to find which nations you find fun but there should be a few in each era to suit.    A good game for single player, a great game for PBEM multi-player.  The biggest flaw in this game is the AI cannot handle all the complexities of the magic system, either to use it against you or to counter your own gambits.  Trade is non-existent and diplomacy is limited to either the AI is attacking you or not.  Still, you'll still get enough mileage out of single player to make this a worthwhile purchase but be warned, once you've played multi-player it's hard to go back.  So much of the joy of this is the inter-player diplomacy, ganging up on other players (and preventing them from doing the same), misinformation and saying nice doggy until you can summon a big enough stick.  Ideally by sacrificing virgins.			"

												Dominions 4 is a strategy game where you take the role of a pretender god trying to ascend to the position of Pantokrator, the true god. You do this by leading a nation of worshipers, taking your armies into battle against other pretenders, researching magic, managing resources and casting spells. The game is very complex and not the easiest game to play. It has a very thriving mod community.			"

												I spend now 20 hours into this game and have to agree with everzone that the game is great strategy. There wasn't a true tutorial by todays standards, but that's no problem for someone, who doesn't like to explore. Now let's get to the crucial point. ...20 hours into the game and I spend most of it yet to create my own map (mostly INGAME, only 3 hours outgame). So what happened? After watching the map  editor tutorial on youtube I figured out: I could do that too and with my own favourite fantasy maps as well. So what I did OUTGAME is: 1. find a picture of the Map of your desire (without provinces)2. Use GIMP to open the map3. FInd all white Color Pixels that are 255/255/255 and change them into 253/253/253 (How you do that? Google if necessary)4. Use the path tool and do Shift+Left Click at all your desired points on the map. (these will be the centers of your provinces (be aware that 1500 is the max for the game)5. Use the Voronoi Path plugin (need to install it) and make a right click on the path window to choose the option Voronoi path6. Choose the option ""Preserve the original path""7. Now you have to paths: the original path dots you made and the path net you created with Voronoi path.8. Choose the Path tool and choose the option ""Stroke path"" to draw the Voronoi path net onto the picture (tada you have your provinces borders ready)9. Choose the pencil tool and chance its brush to ""1Pixel"". Choose the foreground color 255/255/255 white. 10. Select your original single dots path and select the path tool and the option ""Stroke path"" and the option ""stroke with paint tool"" and use the pencil. When it's done then there should be a single white pixes in each province.11. Now the map is ready to use in the map editor. (Takes may be 30 mins to do all that, but you can use any map you like)So year I am now about to finish my big map 1500 Provinces and I do a lot of test in betweens and it is a lot of fun.			"

												Best game of its kind i have played.  Dont let the looks fool you.  Although i agree with others that it could use a bit of polish in the graphics department, i would never never trade game play for eye candy.  Tired of buying all the new AAA titles looking for a challenge and burning up your graphics card in the process?  Get This Game! It will burn up your brain instead as you struggle to choose between so many options... What race to lead, what leader should you play, which units should you build, where, what about magic research, narrow or broad, intense or as needed.  Do I empower my leader or my other minions or hold on to all those crystals for actual combat?  And thats just a tiny bit of what you think your in control of.  Then there's all those other guys scheming against you and totally random events that can help or hinder you in small ways or out right be game changers.  53 hours on record as Im writting this review, and I've won exactly one game, on a small map vs one ai player on easy setting, totally by accident I admit (I had no idea the last move i was making was the winning move.)  I see hundreds more hours of fun and frustration waitting for me.  Trust me on this one, you wont be dissapointed.			"

												don't be discouraged by the graphics, it's worth the 31 dollars. If you're a fan of classic gaming and enjoy this sort of aesthetic, the graphics are actually quite beautiful. The game is complex, yet easy to use, and so, so mechanically deep. Instead of annoying, dull Tolkein-derived crap, the game actually bases its kingdoms off of real, diverse mythology.It's so good.

Despite its dated UI and obscure controls, this is one of the few 4X games that allows you to go wild with whatever strategy you can think of. Want to field a horde of bloodthirsty eagle men that explodes violently on death? Check. Want to field an army of steel-wielding centaurs that adopted the ways of men? There's one for you. Want to cover the field in fire and lava and all the other nasties you can think of? You can do that easily. The list goes on.			"

												>ATTENTION! GAME PLAYED VIA FAMILY SHARING<Back in the day i thought the Dominions game was just spam spam spam and lose lose lose, young me never learned about the true meat of the game, and thanks to family sharing i was able to do it.One could consider this a God-Game but at the same time not really, in the Dominions series your a Pretender, a person of such power that you are going for the final title of power that matters: Godhood. Unfortunately other people (and... sentient beings to put it nicely) want the same thing, so you gotta earn it through genocide and warfare!Thats pretty much the jist of the game, you pick or create a pretender of various types as well as the age of which the final war takes place (after the stone age to the end of magical fantasty) as well as the faction of man or monster you will rule in the attempt of becoming a God, then you soak the land in the blood of your enemies and armies, for they are little more then tools needed to achieve godhood.Fun game series, dunno where the sequels will go though.

												Fantastic game. The magic system is wonderfully horrible, and there are so many stats I could bathe in them! Plus, the lore paragraphs for every unit, commander, and faction are great fun to read. I've pulled far too many all-nighters playing this game, before I had it on steam.As for first appearances, the graphics may suck, but in turn the amount of content is incredible. Which I suppose means you could say the quality is not in the graphics, but in the stats and descriptions for each unit.			"

												This Game is literally Game of Thrones Simulator 2013:If your Commander didn't die in his first battle he is going to die in the next tournament.If he didn't die in the tournament he is going to die of an affliction.If he didn't die of an affliction he is going to die of a disease, which strucks him randomly because why not?If he didnt die of a disease he is definately going to die of old age (except he is bathing in virgin blood, which has the possible negative side effect of transforming him into a bloodthirsty canibal).Eventually if your commander did not die from something of the above, you should have a pretty awesome battleproven alpha male with nice magic items and a lot of XP. You got pretty fond of this hero and perhaps you are going to give him a name, perhaps your own name to identify with him? Well, f*** you, this is GoT Simulator 2013. The stronger your awesome hero gets the more likely it becomes that he is going to attract a transdimensional lovecraftian horror, which is definately going to kill your hero as they are the strongest motherf***ers in the game. AND I AM NOT KIDDING YOU RIGHT NOW. THIS IS A STRATEGY GAME WHERE OCCASIONALLY TRANSDIMENSIONAL LOVECRAFTIAN HORRORS ENTER YOUR DIMENION AND F*** EVERYTHING UP. GoT SIMULATOR 2013 WAS ACTUALLY A CLICK BAIT, THIS IS THE TRANSDIMENSIONAL LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR SIMULATOR 2013!!!I ADDED THE TAGS: rogue like, horror, psychological♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Srsly if you have time, an above average IQ and like the idea of cosmicism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmicism) play this.
